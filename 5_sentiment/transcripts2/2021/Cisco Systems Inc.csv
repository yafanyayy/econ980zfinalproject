This year is full of promise as vaccines give us a path to healing and recovery. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to what lies ahead. 
This past quarter, our team delivered strong performance with revenues coming in at the top of our guidance range and non-GAAP EPS landing above the high end of our expectations, all supported by margin expansion and a further strengthening of our balance sheet. More importantly, we are seeing encouraging signs of strength across our business as the recovery takes shape with all customer segments showing improvement in year-over-year growth rates. 
Our employees and partners have done a remarkable job executing and innovating throughout the pandemic to help our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. We are partnering with them on core issues that are essential to their success, business resiliency, modernizing their IT environments and embracing secure hybrid work. 
Over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate their digital and cloud capabilities while protecting them from an expanding threat environment. In my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our technology will be a powerful engine for their recovery and growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace. 
Building on the strength of our broad portfolio, we are focused on 6 strategic pillars that will deliver highly secure next-generation architectures with unprecedented insights, automation and visibility. First, we're building networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that can be consumed as a service. 
Second, we are optimizing our customers' application experiences, enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications and DevOps that deliver the best end-user experience. Third, with the future of work being hybrid, we are delivering highly secure access, a safer workplace and the best collaboration experiences no matter whether workers are at home or in an office. 
Fourth, with our customers and partners, we are building the Internet for the future by transforming connectivity and efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low latency and higher speeds. Fifth, with security and privacy a top priority, we are building integrated high efficacy end-to-end security solutions that are delivered on-prem or in the cloud. Lastly, as apps and workloads move closer to users and devices, we are developing new edge capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience and extending enterprise and carrier networks. I am confident that this is the right strategy to deliver the innovation and integrated network solutions that our customers need no matter what the future holds. 
Now moving to our performance this quarter. We continue to see signs of gradual improvement, led by order growth in our commercial, public sector and service provider businesses, which together account for nearly 3/4 of product orders. The enterprise market remains soft, driven by some elongated sales cycles and a continued pause in spending among some customers brought on by the pandemic. 
From a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our Catalyst 9K, data center switching, security, wireless and Webex portfolios. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show great progress as we achieved $3.6 billion in software revenue with 76% of our software revenues sold as a subscription. 
We also saw our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation, delivering unique solutions and digital capabilities as we invest in flexible consumption models. I am confident in our ability to capture the long-term opportunities ahead in areas such as cloud, 400 gig, 5G, security, hybrid work and next-generation applications. 
Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic as recent surveys of IT spending indicate year-over-year IT budget growth for calendar 2021. And Cisco remains well positioned among CIO's top forward-looking spending priorities, including network infrastructure, cybersecurity software as well as cloud migration and cloud infrastructure. We are also mindful and vigilant about the uncertainty of the pandemic and its influence in the market, which is not fully behind us yet. 
Now let me touch on infrastructure platforms. To manage the highly distributed and complex nature of modern IT environments, our customers must fundamentally change how their networks are architected. To help them achieve this, we are building a unified cloud-native platform suite to deliver secure agile networking. A good example of this is our subscription-based intent-based networking portfolio and is reflected in the momentum of our Catalyst 9000 family, which saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We are also delivering full stack observability from the application to the infrastructure to give our customers greater insights for faster, better decision making. We are doing this through key elements of our portfolio like Intersight, ThousandEyes and AppDynamics as well as our leading security innovations. 
As a global leader in transport network infrastructure, we are playing an important role in helping customers build their networks for the future. We continue to invest heavily to capture 5G 400-gig and WiFi 6 transitions to enable open RAN and Edge services. This is reflected in our SD-WAN portfolio, routing, 5G mobile core platforms, optics and automation capabilities. 
In our web scale business, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of very rapid order growth increasing to triple digits. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our orders grew over 60% as we focus on delivering routing, data center switching and optical platforms built on Cisco Silicon One, which has a better efficiency over other silicon on the market. 
While we could see our performance vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of large deals, we are incredibly confident in our ability to further strengthen our position. By building a network on Silicon One, our customers can also save up to 30% of network switching power, resulting in a meaningful reduction in their environmental footprint as well as significant energy cost savings. 
Our agreement to acquire Acacia will enable us to deliver leading edge optical technology to meet both the bandwidth requirements and the economics of next-generation networks, which is critical to providing high speed connectivity. This is just another reason why I'm so confident we will continue to win in the web scale space. 
As I've mentioned, we plan to transition the majority of our portfolio to be cloud-driven, cloud-managed and delivered as a service. If we can deliver from the cloud, we will. For example, we are looking at offering SD-WAN plus cloud security as a service, along with creating other new solutions. We will also provide simplified end-to-end networking with security, reliability, control and automation plus seamless on-ramp capabilities to the cloud that no one else can deliver. 
Moving to Security. We delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth driven by increasing adoption of our next-generation cloud-based architectures, which can enable fast, secure access to applications and data from anywhere. With the rapid growth in modern applications and more distributed work environments, our customers are adopting new security architectures as identity and data privacy are increasingly critical. 
The recent solar winds breach only highlights the urgent need for advanced threat defense. Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while minimizing the attack surface and automating security policies across an organization's hybrid cloud footprint. This extends to our secure access service Edge framework and Zero Trust architecture where we have developed a best-in-class cloud-delivered stack across umbrella, secure Internet Gateway, Meraki SD-WAN and Viptela. 
We are also delivering leading unified detection and response capabilities built on Cisco SecureX, our cloud native platform. Over 5,400 customers are already seeing the benefits of this platform since it became generally available last June. We remain committed to delivering simple, integrated and highly effective end-to-end security solutions delivered on-prem and in the cloud. 
Turning to applications, which includes our collaboration portfolio. We are focused on building solutions that will enable an engaged, productive workforce and an intelligent workplace built with secure collaboration, automation and insights. Our aim is to deliver the best collaboration experience for our customers no matter where they are. Our strong momentum with WebEx continued, resulting in double-digit revenue growth. I am so proud of the work the WebEx team has done to ensure our nearly 600 million quarterly average users are able to stay connected and productive. 
In addition, we are connecting over 6 billion calls every month for our customers around the world. We are bringing incredible innovation to the collaboration market at an unprecedented pace. Our goal is to deliver a 10x better experience than just in-person interactions. 
At our recent WebEx One event, we introduced more than 50 new product and feature innovations, integrating security and privacy to deliver inclusive experiences. Some of the new powerful capabilities we announced include noise cancellation, real-time language translation and our WebEx Desk Pro series platforms. 
Our recently announced intent to acquire cloud-based IMI mobile and Slido furthers our vision of building a WebEx suite of applications as we combine these technologies with our WebEx contact center to improve customer interactions. 
In summary, our strategy is clear, and our business remains strong. We are executing and innovating with speed and delivered solid results with our Q2 revenue coming in at the high end and earnings coming in above our stated guidance. 
As we move into the gradual recovery phase, we believe our customers will continue to turn to Cisco as their partner of choice. I am so proud of what our teams have achieved. The incredible innovation and trusted partnerships we are building will serve us well in the years ahead. While the past year has highlighted far too many inequities in our society, we believe in the power of technology to drive more inclusivity and opportunity to underserve populations and communities around the world, which is why we are committed to powering an inclusive future for all. 
With our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation, we expect to be in an even stronger position post pandemic as our customers look to deploy their next-generation networks at the heart of their organizations. I firmly believe Cisco is well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities ahead and win for years to come. 
I'll now turn it over to Scott, our new CFO, to walk through our financial results. As you know, Scott has strong experience in software and a proven track record of leading successful business model transitions from perpetual licenses to SaaS and recurring subscriptions. Scott is proving to be a powerful addition to our team, and I look forward to partnering with him as we plan the next phase of Cisco's continued transformation. Scott, over to you."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to join the Cisco team at such a pivotal time in the company's transformation. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I thought I'd share my initial observations and key priorities. I'm impressed by the team here at Cisco and the progress the company has made on his transformation, achieving the goals laid out 3 years ago of driving 50% of our revenue from software and services. It's also clear that the leadership team is unified and focused and that the strategies Chuck has laid out earlier in the call, will drive our growth over the next several years. It's an exciting time to be joining the company in this role. 
In terms of my key priorities, they include the following: driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. I'm also committed to providing you the insight and metrics needed to understand and properly value our business longer term. 
Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results reflect very good execution with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share in a continuing challenging environment. Total revenue of $12 billion came in at the top of our guidance range, flat year-over-year as we see gradual recovery in several key product areas and sequential growth rate improvement in 2 out of 3 of our geographies. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.4%, up 70 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, up 2% and and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.79, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 3% year-over-year. 
Now let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1%. Infrastructure platforms was down 3%. As a reminder, this is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. Switching revenue was flat overall. We saw solid growth in data center switching with strong growth of the Nexus 9K. We also saw continued strong momentum of the Cat 9K products within campus switching. 
Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless had solid growth, driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and strength in Meraki. Data center revenue declined, driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications was flat overall. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in WebEx, driven by our continuing product innovations and the criticality of remote working. This was offset by declines in unified communications and TP endpoints. 
Security was up 10% with growth across the portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2%, driven by growth in our maintenance business as well as solution support. And we continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. 
Software subscriptions were 76% of total software revenue, up 4 points year-over-year, as  Chuck mentioned earlier. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q2 were $28.2 billion, up 13%. RPO for product was up 17% and for service was up 10%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services and is another indicator of the broad recovery we see happening. 
In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were up 1%, a significant improvement from Q1. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 1%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 14%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 11%. 
In our customer segments, public sector was up 10%, service provider was up 5% and commercial was up 1%, enterprise down 9%. Non-GAAP total gross margin was 66.9%, up 50 basis points. Product gross margins were 66.6%, up 70 basis points, and service gross margin was 67.9%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The growth in product gross margin was driven by positive product mix, including some software benefit and productivity improvements, partially offset by pricing. 
In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.5 billion, and earnings per share was $0.60. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30.6 billion, up $600 million sequentially. Operating cash flow was $3 billion, down 22% as expected, driven by a lower beginning receivables balance for the quarter, timing of payments and the restructuring payments. 
We expect operating cash flow growth to normalize over the course of the fiscal year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend and $800 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, which represents 69% of our free cash flow. 
And today, we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This dividend increase reflects the tenth consecutive year of increasing our dividend and reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. 
We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q2, we announced an amendment to the definitive merger agreement under which we previously agreed to acquire Acacia Communications. We expect to complete the Acacia acquisition in our fiscal Q3, subject to closing conditions, including Acacia's stockholder approval. 
In addition, we announced our intent to acquire IMI mobile, the cloud communications, software and services company; and Slido, a provider of SaaS-based solutions to enhance our WebEx platform and our new cloud-native contact center offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our focused growth areas. 
To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share growth. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. 
Now let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years. We've factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. Although it's difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly 2% to 3% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $185 million of incremental cost of sales and operating expenses. 
The guidance for Q3 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% growth year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

I think that the -- what we have been operating under is a premise that customers will probably begin to come back to the offices and we have been thinking sort of mid- to late summer. I think if you're watching the news this morning, you heard some of the New York companies say that they may be September. But I would suspect that as companies look to prepare their offices for the return, in our case, we've seen significant uptake in WiFi 6, as an example, as they've begun to get ready for that return. We believe that, that will require switching infrastructure as people come back to the office and begin to put load on those wireless networks. We also believe that every meeting in the future is going to be a hybrid meeting, even when people are back in the office. You'll have people in the office and you have people remote. And in order to accommodate that, we suspect most of our customers will be putting video units in every conference room they have, which, again, will also accommodate the hybrid work model, but will also drive bandwidth requirements, which could lead to switching infrastructure. So that's the way we see it playing out over the next few months. And we would expect that with some of the solutions we have around worker safety, in the collaboration portfolio and the WiFi 6 build-outs that we'll continue to see some progress from our customers as they prepare to return."

Our expectation is about $185 million of additional spend. Coming through -- when you compare year-on-year coming through from last year, we also have comp plans reset. So as you'd expect, commissions and bonuses are on a different track this year than they were last year. And FX, is the weakness of the dollar is having an effect on us as well. And so when you add those up, that's what drops through to the COGS and the OpEx line. We are on track just to get ahead of maybe what your next question would have been, we're on track with the $1 billion of savings that we talked about through the restructuring. That continues to go well. Almost all of that is behind us at this point. But there's some year-on-year things that are factoring into our spend rate for this year -- for this coming quarter."

And look, first of all, I think that if you look at the customer segments, we saw improvement across service provider, commercial and public sector. And we saw improvement in enterprise, although it's still negative year-over-year. But what I would tell you is from a vertical industry perspective, we did see positive movement from industries that are not directly impacted by the pandemic. Think financial services, think manufacturing, think technical services and then those that are still in the midst of the pandemic continue to struggle, hospitality, retail, transportation, energy. And so I think from that perspective, it gives us confidence that as we come out of this thing that those industries that are being depressed by the pandemic will obviously look to the future and will recover as well. So the other thing that we've reflected on is that when we came out of the 2008 crisis, we saw commercial lead and then enterprise followed. And it's just been a really good sign. The U.S. commercial business this past quarter grew 6% from an orders perspective, which I think is a nice balance. And obviously, it was 1% globally. But seeing that go positive gives us also confidence in the future of the enterprise following. As it relates to the bigger picture, I think we've talked a lot about giving our customers' consumption flexibility. Earlier in my comments, I actually outlined 6 of the strategic pillars that we're all focused on. I'd say that we are super optimistic about the progress we've made in the web scale space. We continue to deliver on our software revenues, which were $3.6 billion this quarter, and again, 76% of it coming from software, and I think that will only increase. So I think that those 6 pillars, combined with more flexibility and consumption options for our customers and continued transition to software and a continued focus on web scale and other growth opportunities is what we're trying to do over the next 2 to 3 years."

The pricing mix was really in line with what we've seen over the last several quarters, and you'll see this next week, obviously, in the Q, but I'll go ahead and give you the data point. It was 1.6% for the second quarter. Slightly better actually than what we had seen in Q1 and actually modestly better than what we've seen over the trailing 4 quarters. So pricing mix was as expected during the second quarter. I think as you look longer term, gross margin is going to bounce around a little as it always does. I think part of what is factoring into our view of gross margin ahead is the benefit of a greater mix of software and services in there. Being somewhat offset by some of the supply chain concerns that we have right now that I think you've seen, not just from us but from everyone who's building products that contain as significant amount of semiconductors. So we're doing what you'd expect us to do on the supply chain front. We are contacting all of our key suppliers on that front. We're leveraging kind of the volume purchase that we have, extending that supply chain further out, all with a goal of ensuring we can protect customer shipments. So there's a little bit of a headwind coming in those lines from the -- just the supply -- the current supply chain."

The durability of the public sector, I think 2 comments on this one. Clearly, there's stimulus that's flowing both in the U.S. and around the world, and I think that will continue for some period of time, obviously. And that's certainly helping. But the other thing that I think has occurred over the last year is that countries have realized that they have to invest in infrastructure and digital infrastructure and technology to be prepared for these sorts of crises in the future. So I think that notwithstanding stimulus, I think the spending we see post pandemic will be greater than what we saw pre pandemic. And in fact, some of these countries have come to the conclusion that they they need to take more dependency on themselves and less on some of their allies given sort of what we've seen over the last few years. And so they're beefing up their technology investments from that perspective. So I think net, once the stimulus goes out, I still think you see a positive segment for a few years to come. On the web scale front, I'll just take a minute to explain. We actually gave more information today than we've given. And over the last few years, many of you have heard me say that this was a marathon, and we had a lot of work to do. And what has become clear to me over the last 5 quarters is that the work that our teams have put in over the last 5 years has begun to pay off. And so this quarter, we saw triple-digit growth year-over-year in our web scale portfolio, as I said in earlier comments. The prior 4 quarters, I will tell you that the growth rates range from 17% to 74%. So it's been up for the last 5 quarters, as we've talked about. From a portfolio perspective, you asked, we're selling the 8000 series, which we announced in December of 2019. We're winning 400-gig franchises. We are selling some silicon. We're selling our Catalyst 9000 candidly. We're selling the rest of the portfolio as well. And so it's been pretty broad-based relative to what we are selling them. But we feel good about the investments we've made, the hard work we've put in. And the last thing I'll tell you is that the other question you're probably going to ask is how material it is from a size perspective. And I'll tell you that last quarter that we just finished, it was 25% of our service provider segment. And over the last 4 quarters, it's averaged 21% of that SP segment. So it's gotten to a point where it's meaningful. So that's why we decided to give additional information today. Again, this business, much like the service provider business that we've talked about over the years, we'll have -- we'll be big deal driven, big customer-driven. So we'll have a tendency to be lumpy. But I think if you look at it over the course of 4 quarters, 6 quarters, 8 quarters, it's going to be -- it should continue to be positive."

So yes, if you look at what we saw in the quarter from an order perspective, we saw positive growth in cable, which represents about 15% of the segment. We saw triple-digit growth in web scale, which has represented 25% of the segment. And then our telco business was down, and that's roughly 60% of the business. And primarily, that is because of where we are in the stages with 5G, we have we have roughly 35 customers around the world that we're working on 5G solutions with with mobile backhaul, with orchestration, with Packet core. And so we're just early in that transition. And I think that particular sub-segment of SP will begin to show progress for us as we see the core backbone build-out, as we've been saying over the last few years. And the good news is we're seeing the we're seeing the backhaul stuff being built. We're seeing the packet core decisions get made, which means that the core network backbone decisions will be made and the fact that we are being having some positive success in the web scale space would give me a high degree of confidence that those same products will bode well in the service provider space. So I think this has been a tough segment for us for many, many years. And we're hopeful right now with the web scale success and then with the 5G build-outs underway that this could be a tailwind over the next few years for us."

We didn't have China approval. We thought we did. We didn't have it in time. So we renegotiated the price because our contract with them had expired. And candidly, the performance they put up in the 18 months between our original deal and this deal was pretty astounding so that the price was not out of the question. And then we subsequently got Chinese approval, and I think, Scott, keep me honest, but I think they have to get shareholder approval and the proxies out. So we expect that, that should happen. It will happen during Q3, Tal. So China; approval is done. There's no more approvals to get. It's just up to the shareholder vote at this point. So we think that is in pretty good shape. On the second front, let me just run through the portfolio, and I'll tell you sort of how I feel about everything right now. So I think the -- if you look at the MAS kill infrastructure, the service provider portfolio, whatever you want to call it, where the 8,000 is and some of the other stuff that's being built for 5G and for 400-gig in the mass scale data centers, I think that portfolio is in really good shape, and I would expect it to be a very positive contributor, not only over the next year, but over the next 2 to 3 years. I think that there's -- if I look at the campus switching infrastructure, I think with customers begin to come back, they are going to look at upgrading. We've seen -- we saw significant growth last quarter in demand for WiFi 6. Just to give you a data point that we don't disclose anywhere, but we had -- I think our orders for WiFi grew 20% last quarter. And what typically happens is that when you when you effectively put a lot of load on Wifi, like Wi-Fi 6 is going to accommodate, it's going to require an underlying infrastructure upgrade to accommodate it. And when you add to that, the video load that will likely go on to these customers as they come back to the office and put video in every conference room and continue to use video the way they've used it during the pandemic, we think that will also be a driver. So I think we have the Catalyst 9K portfolio, the WiFi 6 portfolio, we feel good about as well. The SD-WAN technology continues to move forward. We're seeing good growth there. And I think as we deliver that technology as a service integrated with our cloud security, I think that's going to be a differentiator for us. Within the Security portfolio, the teams are working on a couple of very differentiated tracks on strategy. I'd say that we need -- I'd say we need another 6 months or so to see how that evolves. But I feel good about what they plan to do. Our current portfolio is performing well, and they just need to execute. So we have to see that. I think the teams have done an amazing job on what they've brought forward with the WebEx platform. Again, you have to remember in the applications space when there's probably a view on that, that when it's when it's not performing the way you would think. You got to remember, all the phones are included in that space, too. So while WebEx was up double digits, as Scott said, you've also got the drag of the handset business that's in there as well. But I think the WebEx work and the pace of innovation, the feature velocity, the suite aspect that they're looking at. I think the teams are doing a really good job. And I think over the next year, you'll see us actually that portfolio will continue to improve, and I think we have a chance to take share back. What did I miss? And then we're working on things like full stack observability, which are somewhat nascent. We're working on our edge service strategy, which is somewhat nascent. But I feel like the team -- I think the portfolio is in probably as good a shape as it's been in a while, and we just have to execute."

So I think we're sort of in the that right now with a lot of our customers doing those kinds of assessments. But it's been from the early parts of the pandemic, when we saw VPN technology being absorbed as much as we could possibly build. And then the network firewall and then combine that with the cloud security, it just -- it feels like customers are consuming whatever security they can consume right now to try to avoid those sorts of situations.

And does that mean you need more split print? What's the future of shared space? Are employees comfortable coming in and sitting in a shared space that someone else occupied the day before or do they want their own space when they come in so that they feel safe in it. And I think those are the kinds of things that we don't understand. But if I net it out I don't think, personally, this is my own opinion, based on customer discussions and everything else. I don't think that some of the earlier beliefs in the pandemic where the early days is like no one's going to go back to the office because we're actually productive at home. I think we sort of moved into that phase where people actually struggle mentally. People are -- it's -- they're not enjoying it. One of our employees said to me the other day, I don't mind the option of working from home, I don't like being forced to work from home. And so I really believe it's going to be hybrid where people are going to work from home and everybody is sort of landing here where they don't work from home 3 days a week and I work from the Office 2 days a week or vice versa. The question is, what accommodations does that lead to for customers? Based on employees' concern over space issues, concern over future pandemics or other concern. That's what we just don't know yet. But I do believe, based on what we've seen with WiFi 6, that tells me customers are getting ready. And they're upgrading the wireless infrastructure now. And in the commercial space, we've seen a fair amount of the follow-on with the switching, and hopefully, we'll see that in the enterprise space beyond this quarter."

And I think I've said on a couple of calls before, it's really good, the size of it this year because it gives us a chance to test our processes and our renewal value proposition, all that stuff because it's meaningful in fiscal '22. So teams are working hard right now to try to get ahead of that and be ready for it. On the cloud front, what I would say is that we are -- when we announced in December of 2019, we had a launch -- the future of the Internet launch, we talked about that we would be -- we would sell our customer systems, integrated systems, we would sell them silicon or we would sell them white boxes. I mean, I'm sorry, our software. And we have all 3 of those scenarios actually playing out right now. So we have customers who have standardized on our systems for 400 gig. We have customers who are testing our silicon and actually putting it in white boxes, which is what we would expect them to do. We have some customers running our software stack on their hardware. And so and the people we're competing with, they would be quite evident to you, short of me calling them out. I think these are the traditional players that have been successful in that space. And we talked a lot back years ago about the fact that we missed the first wave, and we were going to work hard to be in a position when the 400-gig transition occurred and try to work our way back in and earn that business back, and I think the teams have begun to do that. So I'm really proud of what they've done."

This year is full of promise as vaccines give us a path to healing and recovery. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to what lies ahead.  
This past quarter, our team delivered strong performance with revenues coming in at the top of our guidance range and non-GAAP EPS landing above the high end of our expectations, all supported by margin expansion and a further strengthening of our balance sheet. More importantly, we are seeing encouraging signs of strength across our business as the recovery takes shape with all customer segments showing improvement in year-over-year growth rates.  
Our employees and partners have done a remarkable job executing and innovating throughout the pandemic to help our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. We are partnering with them on core issues that are essential to their success: business resiliency, modernizing their IT environments and embracing secure hybrid work.  
Over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate their digital and cloud capabilities while protecting them from an expanding threat environment. 
In my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our technology will be a powerful engine for their recovery and growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace.  
Building on the strength of our broad portfolio, we are focused on 6 strategic pillars that will deliver highly secure next-generation architectures with unprecedented insights, automation and visibility. First, we're building networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that can be consumed as a service. Second, we are optimizing our customers' application experiences, enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications and DevOps that deliver the best end-user experience. Third, with the future of work being hybrid, we're delivering highly secure access, a safer workplace and the best collaboration experiences no matter whether workers are at home or in an office.  
Fourth, with our customers and partners, we are building the Internet for the future by transforming connectivity and efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low latency and higher speeds. Fifth, with security and privacy a top priority, we are building integrated high efficacy end-to-end security solutions that are delivered on-prem or in the cloud. Lastly, as apps and workloads move closer to users and devices, we are developing new edge capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience and extending enterprise and carrier networks.  I am confident that this is the right strategy to deliver the innovation and integrated network solutions that our customers need no matter what the future holds.  
Now moving to our performance this quarter. We continue to see signs of gradual improvement, led by order growth in our commercial, public sector and service provider businesses, which together account for nearly 3/4 of product orders. The enterprise market remains soft, driven by some elongated sales cycles and a continued pause in spending among some customers brought on by the pandemic.  
From a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our Catalyst 9K, data center switching, security, wireless and WebEx portfolios. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show great progress as we achieved $3.6 billion in software revenue with 76% of our software revenues sold as a subscription.  
We also saw our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation, delivering unique solutions and digital capabilities as we invest in flexible consumption models. I am confident in our ability to capture the long-term opportunities ahead in areas such as cloud, 400 gig, 5G, security, hybrid work and next-generation applications.  
Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic as recent surveys of IT spending indicate year-over-year IT budget growth for calendar 2021. And Cisco remains well positioned among CIO's top forward-looking spending priorities, including network infrastructure, cybersecurity software as well as cloud migration and cloud infrastructure.  We are also mindful and vigilant about the uncertainty of the pandemic and its influence in the market, which is not fully behind us yet.  
Now let me touch on infrastructure platforms. To manage the highly distributed and complex nature of modern IT environments, our customers must fundamentally change how their networks are architected. To help them achieve this, we are building a unified cloud-native platform suite to deliver secure agile networking. A good example of this is our subscription-based, intent-based networking portfolio and is reflected in the momentum of our Catalyst 9K family, which saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. 
We are also delivering full stack observability from the application to the infrastructure to give our customers greater insights for faster, better decision making. We are doing this through key elements of our portfolio like Intersight, ThousandEyes and AppDynamics as well as our leading security innovations.  
As a global leader in transport network infrastructure, we are playing an important role in helping customers build their networks for the future. We continue to invest heavily to capture 5G, 400-gig and WiFi 6 transitions to enable open RAN and Edge services. This is reflected in our SD-WAN portfolio, routing, 5G mobile core platforms, optics and automation capabilities.  
In our web scale business, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of very rapid order growth, increasing to triple digits. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our orders grew over 60% as we focus on delivering routing, data center switching and optical platforms built on Cisco Silicon One, which has a better efficiency over other silicon on the market.  
While we could see our performance vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of large deals, we are incredibly confident in our ability to further strengthen our position. By building a network on Silicon One, our customers can also save up to 30% of network switching power, resulting in a meaningful reduction in their environmental footprint as well as significant energy cost savings.  
Our agreement to acquire Acacia will enable us to deliver leading-edge optical technology to meet both the bandwidth requirements and the economics of next-generation networks, which is critical to providing high-speed connectivity. This is just another reason why I'm so confident we will continue to win in the web scale space.  
As I've mentioned, we plan to transition the majority of our portfolio to be cloud-driven, cloud-managed and delivered as a service. If we can deliver from the cloud, we will. For example, we are looking at offering SD-WAN plus cloud security as a service, along with creating other new solutions. We will also provide simplified end-to-end networking with security, reliability, control and automation plus seamless on-ramp capabilities to the cloud that no one else can deliver.  
Moving to security. We delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth driven by increasing adoption of our next-generation cloud-based architectures, which can enable fast, secure access to applications and data from anywhere. With the rapid growth in modern applications and more distributed work environments, our customers are adopting new security architectures as identity and data privacy are increasingly critical. The recent SolarWinds breach only highlights the urgent need for advanced threat defense. 
Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while minimizing the attack surface and automating security policies across an organization's hybrid cloud footprint. This extends to our secure access service edge framework and Zero Trust architecture where we have developed a best-in-class, cloud-delivered stack across Umbrella, secure Internet gateway, Meraki SD-WAN and Viptela.  
We're also delivering leading unified detection and response capabilities built on Cisco SecureX, our cloud native platform. Over 5,400 customers are already seeing the benefits of this platform since it became generally available last June. We remain committed to delivering simple, integrated and highly effective end-to-end security solutions delivered on-prem and in the cloud.  
Turning to applications, which includes our collaboration portfolio. We are focused on building solutions that will enable an engaged, productive workforce and an intelligent workplace built with secure collaboration, automation and insights. Our aim is to deliver the best collaboration experience for our customers no matter where they are. 
Our strong momentum with WebEx continued, resulting in double-digit revenue growth. I'm so proud of the work the WebEx team has done to ensure our nearly 600 million quarterly average users are able to stay connected and productive.  In addition, we are connecting over 6 billion calls every month for our customers around the world. 
We are bringing incredible innovation to the collaboration market at an unprecedented pace. Our goal is to deliver a 10x better experience than just in-person interactions. At our recent WebEx One event, we introduced more than 50 new product and feature innovations, integrating security and privacy to deliver inclusive experiences. Some of the new powerful capabilities we announced include noise cancellation, real-time language translation and our WebEx Desk Pro series platforms.  
Our recently announced intent to acquire cloud-based IMImobile and Slido furthers our vision of building a WebEx suite of applications as we combine these technologies with our WebEx contact center to improve customer interactions.  
In summary, our strategy is clear and our business remains strong. We are executing and innovating with speed and delivered solid results with our Q2 revenue coming in at the high end and earnings coming in above our stated guidance.  
As we move into the gradual recovery phase, we believe our customers will continue to turn to Cisco as their partner of choice. I am so proud of what our teams have achieved. The incredible innovation and trusted partnerships we are building will serve us well in the years ahead. 
While the past year has highlighted far too many inequities in our society, we believe in the power of technology to drive more inclusivity and opportunity to underserve populations and communities around the world, which is why we are committed to powering an inclusive future for all.  
With our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation, we expect to be in an even stronger position post-pandemic as our customers look to deploy their next-generation networks at the heart of their organizations. I firmly believe Cisco is well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities ahead and win for years to come.  
I'll now turn it over to Scott, our new CFO, to walk through our financial results. As you know, Scott has strong experience in software and a proven track record of leading successful business model transitions from perpetual licenses to SaaS and recurring subscriptions. Scott is proving to be a powerful addition to our team, and I look forward to partnering with him as we plan the next phase of Cisco's continued transformation. Scott, over to you."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to join the Cisco team at such a pivotal time in the company's transformation. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I thought I'd share my initial observations and key priorities. I'm impressed by the team here at Cisco and the progress the company has made on its transformation, achieving the goals laid out 3 years ago of driving 50% of our revenue from software and services. It's also clear that the leadership team is unified and focused and that the strategies Chuck laid out earlier in the call will drive our growth over the next several years. It's an exciting time to be joining the company in this role.  
In terms of my key priorities, they include the following: driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. I'm also committed to providing you the insight and metrics needed to understand and properly value our business longer term.  
Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results reflect very good execution with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share in a continuing challenging environment. Total revenue of $12.0 billion came in at the top of our guidance range, flat year-over-year as we see gradual recovery in several key product areas and sequential growth rate improvement in 2 out of 3 of our geographies.  Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.4%, up 70 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, up 2% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.79, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 3% year-over-year.  
Now let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1%. Infrastructure platforms was down 3%. As a reminder, this is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. Switching revenue was flat overall. We saw solid growth in data center switching with strong growth of the Nexus 9K. We also saw continued strong momentum of the Cat 9K products within campus switching.  
Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless had solid growth driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and strength in Meraki. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications was flat overall. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in WebEx driven by our continuing product innovations and the criticality of remote working. This was offset by declines in unified communications and TP endpoints.  
Security was up 10% with growth across the portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2%, driven by growth in our maintenance business as well as solution support. And we continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions.  
Software subscriptions were 76% of total software revenue, up 4 points year-over-year, as Chuck mentioned earlier. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q2 were $28.2 billion, up 13%. RPO for product was up 17% and for service was up 10%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services and is another indicator of the broad recovery we see happening.  
In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were up 1%, a significant improvement from Q1.  Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 1%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 14%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 11%.  
In our customer segments, public sector was up 10%, service provider was up 5% and commercial was up 1%, enterprise down 9%. 
Non-GAAP total gross margin was 66.9%, up 50 basis points; product gross margins were 66.6%, up 70 basis points; and service gross margin was 67.9%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The growth in product gross margin was driven by positive product mix, including some software benefit and productivity improvements, partially offset by pricing.  
In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.60. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30.6 billion, up $600 million sequentially. Operating cash flow was $3 billion, down 22%, as expected, driven by a lower beginning receivables balance for the quarter, timing of payments and the restructuring payments.  We expect operating cash flow growth to normalize over the course of the fiscal year. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend and $800 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, which represents 69% of our free cash flow.  
And today, we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This dividend increase reflects the tenth consecutive year of increasing our dividend and reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.  
We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q2, we announced an amendment to the definitive merger agreement under which we previously agreed to acquire Acacia Communications. We expect to complete the Acacia acquisition in our fiscal Q3, subject to closing conditions, including Acacia's stockholder approval.  
In addition, we announced our intent to acquire IMImobile, the cloud communications, software and services company; and Slido, a provider of SaaS-based solutions to enhance our WebEx platform and our new cloud-native contact center offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our focused growth areas.  
To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share growth. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.  
Now let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years. We've factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. Although it's difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly 2% to 3% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $185 million of incremental cost of sales and operating expenses.  
The guidance for Q3 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% growth year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. 
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

I think that the -- what we have been operating under is a premise that customers will probably begin to come back to the offices and we have been thinking sort of mid to late summer. I think if you're watching the news this morning, you heard some of the New York companies say that they may be September. 
But I would suspect that as companies look to prepare their offices for the return, in our case, we've seen significant uptake in WiFi 6, as an example, as they've begun to get ready for that return. We believe that, that will require switching infrastructure as people come back to the office and begin to put load on those wireless networks. 
We also believe that every meeting in the future is going to be a hybrid meeting, even when people are back in the office. You'll have people in the office and you'll have people remote. And in order to accommodate that, we suspect most of our customers will be putting video units in every conference room they have, which, again, will also accommodate the hybrid work model but will also drive bandwidth requirements, which could lead to switching infrastructure. 
So that's the way we see it playing out over the next few months. And we would expect that with some of the solutions we have around worker safety in the collaboration portfolio and the WiFi 6 build-outs that we'll continue to see some progress from our customers as they prepare to return."

Not only does the extra week in Q3 bring along with it additional revenue, it brings along additional spend as well. And we touched on this in the opening commentary, it's about $185 million -- our expectation is about $185 million of additional spend. 
Coming through -- when you compare year-on-year coming through from last year, we also have comp plans reset. So as you'd expect, commissions and bonuses are on a different track this year than they were last year. And FX, the weakness of the dollar is having an effect on us as well.  And so when you add those up, that's what drops through to the COGS and the OpEx line. 
We are on track just to get ahead of maybe what your next question would have been. We're on track with the $1 billion of savings that we talked about through the restructuring. That continues to go well. Almost all of that is behind us at this point. But there's some year-on-year things that are factoring into our spend rate for this year -- for this coming quarter."

Maybe you can give us a little bit more -- the bigger picture perspective that you have here about the company. In what ways Cisco here and now different in the way it operates and thinks and moves going forward versus the Cisco of a year ago just before heading into the pandemic?

And look, first of all, I think that if you look at the customer segments, we saw improvement across service provider, commercial and public sector. And we saw improvement in enterprise, although it's still negative year-over-year. 
But what I would tell you is from a vertical industry perspective, we did see positive movement from industries that are not directly impacted by the pandemic. Think financial services, think manufacturing, think technical services. And then those that are still in the midst of the pandemic continue to struggle, hospitality, retail, transportation, energy. And so I think from that perspective, it gives us confidence that as we come out of this thing that those industries that are being depressed by the pandemic will obviously look to the future and will recover as well. 
So the other thing that we've reflected on is that when we came out of the 2008 crisis, we saw commercial lead and then enterprise followed. And it's just been a really good sign. The U.S. commercial business this past quarter grew 6% from an orders perspective, which I think is a nice bounce. And obviously, it was 1% globally. But seeing that go positive gives us also confidence in the future of the enterprise following. 
As it relates to the bigger picture, I think we've talked a lot about giving our customers consumption flexibility. Earlier in my comments, I actually outlined 6 of the strategic pillars that we're all focused on. I'd say that we are super optimistic about the progress we've made in the web scale space. We continue to deliver on our software revenues, which were $3.6 billion this quarter, and again, 76% of it coming from software. And I think that will only increase. 
So I think that those 6 pillars, combined with more flexibility and consumption options for our customers and continued transition to software and a continued focus on web scale and other growth opportunities is what we're trying to do over the next 2 to 3 years."

It was 1.6% for the second quarter, slightly better actually than what we had seen in Q1 and actually modestly better than what we've seen over the trailing 4 quarters. So pricing mix was as expected during the second quarter. 
I think as you look longer term, gross margin is going to bounce around a little as it always does. I think part of what is factoring into our view of gross margin ahead is the benefit of a greater mix of software and services in there being somewhat offset by some of the supply chain concerns that we have right now that I think you've seen not just from us, but from everyone who's building products that contain a significant amount of semiconductor. 
So we're doing what you'd expect us to do on the supply chain front. We are contacting all of our key suppliers on that front. We're leveraging kind of the volume purchase that we have, extending that supply chain further out, all with a goal of ensuring we can protect customer shipments. So there's a little bit of a headwind coming in those lines from the -- just the supply -- the current supply chain."

Clearly, there's stimulus that's flowing both in the U.S. and around the world, and I think that will continue for some period of",529,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So let me start with the second one. The durability of the public sector, I think 2 comments on this one. Clearly, there's stimulus that's flowing both in the U.S. and around the world, and I think that will continue for some period of time, obviously. And that's certainly helping. 
But the other thing that I think has occurred over the last year is that countries have realized that they have to invest in infrastructure and digital infrastructure and technology to be prepared for these sorts of crises in the future. So I think that notwithstanding stimulus, I think the spending we see post-pandemic will be greater than what we saw pre-pandemic. And in fact, some of these countries have come to the conclusion that they need to take more dependency on themselves and less on some of their allies given sort of what we've seen over the last few years. And so they're beefing up their technology investments from that perspective. So I think net, once the stimulus goes out, I still think you see a positive segment for a few years to come. 
On the web scale front, I'll just take a minute to explain. We actually gave more information today than we've given. And over the last few years, many of you have heard me say that this was a marathon, and we had a lot of work to do. And what has become clear to me over the last 5 quarters is that the work that our teams have put in over the last 5 years has begun to pay off. And so this quarter, we saw triple-digit growth year-over-year in our web scale portfolio, as I said in the earlier comments. The prior 4 quarters, I will tell you that the growth rates range from 17% to 74%. So it's been up for the last 5 quarters, as we've talked about. 
From a portfolio perspective, you asked, we're selling the 8000 series, which we announced in December of 2019. We're winning 400-gig franchises. We are selling some silicon. We're selling our Catalyst 9K candidly. We're selling the rest of the portfolio as well. And so it's been pretty broad-based relative to what we are selling them. But we feel good about the investments we've made, the hard work we've put in. 
And the last thing I'll tell you is that -- the other question you're probably going to ask is how material it is from a size perspective. And I'll tell you that last quarter that we just finished, it was 25% of our service provider segment. And over the last 4 quarters, it's averaged 21% of that SP segment. So it's gotten to a point where it's meaningful. So that's why we decided to give additional information today. 
Again, this business, much like the service provider business that we've talked about over the years will have -- will be big deal-driven, big customer-driven, so will have a tendency to be lumpy. But I think if you look at it over the course of 4 quarters, 6 quarters, 8 quarters, it's going to be -- it should continue to be positive."

Can you help us understand how the dollar move has affected, for instance, revenue growth year-over-year and maybe margins as well? Just anything you can help us with on quantification there."

We saw triple-digit growth in web scale, which has represented 25% of the segment. 
And then our telco business was down, and that's roughly 60% of the business. And primarily, that is because of where we are in the stages with 5G. We have roughly 35 customers around the world that we're working on 5G solutions with mobile backhaul, with orchestration, with packet core. And so we're just early in that transition. And I think that particular sub-segment of SP will begin to show progress for us as we see the core backbone build-out, as we've been saying over the last few years. And the good news is we're seeing the backhaul stuff being built. We're seeing the packet core decisions get made, which means that the core network backbone decisions will be made and the fact that we are being -- having some positive success in the web scale space would give me a high degree of confidence that those same products will bode well in the service provider space. 
So I think this has been a tough segment for us for many, many years. And we're hopeful right now with the web scale success and then with the 5G build-outs underway that this could be a tailwind over the next few years for us."

We didn't have China approval. We thought we did. We didn't have it in time. So we renegotiated the price because our contract with them had expired. And candidly, the performance they put up in the 18 months between our original deal and this deal was pretty astounding, so the price was not out of the question. 
And then we subsequently got Chinese approval, and I think, Scott, keep me honest, but I think they have to get shareholder approval and the proxies out. So we expect that, that should happen. It will happen during Q3, Tal. So China approval is done. There's no more approvals to get. It's just up to the shareholder vote at this point. So we think that is in pretty good shape. 
On the second front, let me just run through the portfolio, and I'll tell you sort of how I feel about everything right now. So I think the -- if you look at the mass scale infrastructure, the service provider portfolio, whatever you want to call it, where the 8000 is and some of the other stuff that's being built for 5G and for 400-gig in the mass scale data centers, I think that portfolio is in really good shape. And I would expect it to be a very positive contributor, not only over the next year, but over the next 2 to 3 years. 
I think that there's -- if I look at the campus switching infrastructure, I think with customers beginning to come back, they are going to look at upgrading. We've seen -- we saw significant growth last quarter in demand for WiFi 6. Just to give you a data point that we don't disclose anywhere, but we had -- I think our orders for WiFi grew 20% last quarter. 
And what typically happens is that when you  effectively put a lot of load on WiFi, like WiFi 6 is going to accommodate, it's going to require an underlying infrastructure upgrade to accommodate it. And when you add to that, the video load that will likely go on to these customers as they come back to the office and put video in every conference room and continue to use video the way they've used it during the pandemic, we think that will also be a driver. So I think we have the Catalyst 9K portfolio, the WiFi 6 portfolio, we feel good about as well. 
The SD-WAN technology continues to move forward. We're seeing good growth there. And I think as we deliver that technology as a service integrated with our cloud security, I think that's going to be a differentiator for us. 
Within the security portfolio, the teams are working on a couple of very differentiated tracks on strategy. I'd say that we need -- I'd say we need another 6 months or so to see how that evolves. But I feel good about what they plan to do. Our current portfolio is performing well, and they just need to execute. So we have to see that. I think the teams have done an amazing job on what they've brought forward with the WebEx platform. 
Again, you have to remember in the applications space when -- there's probably a view on that, that when it's not performing the way you would think -- you got to remember, all the phones are included in that space, too. So while WebEx was up double digits, as Scott said, you've also got the drag of the handset business that's in there as well. But I think the WebEx work and the pace of innovation, the feature velocity, the suite aspect that they're looking at, I think the teams are doing a really good job. And I think over the next year, you'll see us actually -- that portfolio will continue to improve, and I think we have a chance to take share back. 
What did I miss? And then we're working on things like full stack observability, which are somewhat nascent. We're working on our edge service strategy, which is somewhat nascent. But I feel like the team -- I think the portfolio is in probably as good a shape as it's been in a while, and we just have to execute."

So it was a good quarter across the board, across the portfolio. And I think what you'll see is that we're in the early phases, I think, of any positive impact that you would see from the SolarWinds build-out because most of the customers are going in to assess like where am I, what have I missed, what do I need, what caused me to miss what I missed. And then they're going to move from there. So I think we're sort of in the midst of that right now with a lot of our customers doing those kinds of assessments. 
But it's been -- from the early parts of the pandemic, when we saw VPN technology being absorbed as much as we could possibly build and then the network firewall and then combine that with the cloud security, it just -- it feels like customers are consuming whatever security they can consume right now to try to avoid those sorts of situations. So I would think that, that will continue to be positive for us."

Our -- and I think that there's certainly some unknowns and it's certainly complex, but I think the teams have done a pretty good job navigating it and it is built into the guide. 
On the campus front, I think what I described is actually what I would expect for most customers. I think, Simon, the question you ask is a philosophical discussion that we have a lot in that when customers go back, what is it going to look like? Are more employees going to stay at home? Does that mean they're going to shrink their footprint? Does COVID stay with us? Do people now believe that they want to be -- they want to maintain somewhat of a social distance in the office even post-COVID until we really get well beyond it? And does that mean you need more footprint? What's the future of shared space? Are employees comfortable coming in and sitting in a shared space that someone else occupied the day before or do they want their own space when they come in so that they feel safe in it? 
And I think those are the kinds of things that we don't understand. But if I net it out, I don't think -- personally, this is my own opinion, based on customer discussions and everything else. I don't think that some of the earlier beliefs in the pandemic where the early days is like no one's going to go back to the office because we're actually productive at home. I think we sort of moved into that phase where people actually struggle mentally. People are -- it's -- they're not enjoying it. One of our employees said to me the other day, I don't mind the option of working from home. I don't like being forced to work from home. 
And so I really believe it's going to be hybrid where people are going to work from home. And everybody is sort of landing here where they work from home 3 days a week and then work from the office 2 days a week or vice versa. The question is, what accommodations does that lead to for customers based on employees' concern over space issues, concern over future pandemics or other concern? That's what we just don't know yet. 
But I do believe, based on what we've seen with WiFi 6, that tells me customers are getting ready. And they're upgrading the wireless infrastructure now. And in the commercial space, we've seen a fair amount of the follow-on with the switching. And hopefully, we'll see that in the enterprise space beyond this quarter."

So teams are working hard right now to try to get ahead of that and be ready for it. 
On the cloud front, what I would say is that we are -- when we announced in December of 2019, we had a launch -- the future of the Internet launch. We talked about that we would be -- we would sell our customers systems, integrated systems. We would sell them silicon or we would sell them white boxes, I mean, I'm sorry, our software. And we have all 3 of those scenarios actually playing out right now. So we have customers who have standardized on our systems for 400 gig. We have customers who are testing our silicon and actually putting it in white boxes, which is what we would expect them to do. 
We have some customers running our software stack on their hardware. And so -- and the people we're competing with, they would be quite evident to you, short of me calling them out. I think these are the traditional players that have been successful in that space. And we talked a lot back years ago about the fact that we missed the first wave, and we were going to work hard to be in a position when the 400-gig transition occurred and try to work our way back in and earn that business back, and I think the teams have begun to do that.

I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe as we start to see the benefits of vaccine deployments and the continuing improvement in economic activity. I want to start by acknowledging our employees, customers and partners in India who are experiencing a devastating surge of COVID cases. Cisco is providing critical resources during this challenging time, and our thoughts remain with all of you. While many of us are seeing great progress in our recovery efforts, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as we manage the ongoing pandemic around the world.
Turning to the quarter. We had impressive momentum in Q3, which gives me a great sense of optimism going forward. We returned to growth with revenue up 7%, driven by an improving macro environment, the strongest product portfolio in our history and great execution by our teams. We saw broad-based demand across the business led by our biggest growth opportunities: Hybrid work; digital transformation; cloud; and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings. We're also seeing early momentum in the ramping of key technology cycles that are long-term growth drivers for our business, such as 5G, 400-gig and Edge.
The next phase of the recovery and the future of work will be heavily reliant on our technology. Cisco's end-to-end portfolio will serve as the foundation for next-generation infrastructure solutions as well as cloud-enabled delivery models and innovation, allowing our customers to move with even greater speed and agility. This will require a significant investment cycle and reinforces the strength of our strategy while driving greater opportunity to create a world that is more connected, inclusive and secure. We remain focused on accelerating innovation while simplifying the adoption of our offerings with network-wide automation, analytics and flexible as-a-service consumption models, all aimed at improving our customers' network performance capabilities and security, which we believe will drive tremendous long-term opportunities for us.
Our Q3 performance only reinforces my confidence about the future. These results reflect a return to a strong spending environment and an economic recovery that has gained momentum driven by vaccine rollouts and the easing of restrictions. As the economy has improved, customers have increased their investment across our portfolio to prepare for the upturn and return to office.
In Q3, we saw 10% growth in product orders, the highest growth rate since Q1 of fiscal 2012, reflecting robust improvement across all of our customer segments and geographies. From a product revenue perspective, we saw 6% growth led by strength across our portfolio, including campus switching, routing, wireless, security, collaboration and web scale as well as from our acquisition of Acacia, which closed during Q3.
We continue to aggressively shift our business to more recurring revenue streams, which we expect to grow over time as we expand our offerings. In Q3, we achieved $3.8 billion in software revenue with 81% of our software revenue sold as a subscription, up from 76% last quarter. We also saw another quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations.
Over the past 6 years, we have made significant progress and now have one of the largest software businesses in the industry with an annual run rate well over $14 billion.
Let me now touch on infrastructure platforms. We saw strong demand across the majority of our portfolio, led by our next-generation enterprise networking and service provider solutions as companies accelerate the modernization of their infrastructure. This modern infrastructure delivers higher performance and faster access to data while offering the best user experience in an increasingly distributed environment.
Customers are turning to us to help them create the trusted workplace of the future. With WiFi access points, video endpoints, cameras and IoT sensors, feeding data into DNA center and DNA spaces, we are enabling operations teams to remotely monitor workplace conditions for a safe return to office. We are also working to provide visibility beyond corporate networks, which is increasingly critical as our customers accelerate their adoption of SaaS and cloud solutions for hybrid work. At Cisco Live, we launched the industry's first enterprise-wide full stack observability offering by integrating ThousandEyes cloud intelligence with our catalyst switching portfolio and AppDynamics. This provides IT with visibility and actionable insights across both external and internal networks to provide a seamless digital experience for users.
And with users more distributed than ever, It is vital that they have the most efficient and secure connection to the cloud. Our deep partnerships with Google, Amazon and Microsoft allow native connectivity from our SD-WAN fabric to each of these cloud offerings. With our technology, customers can reduce deployment times and connect branch offices to cloud workloads in minutes.
In our webscale business, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong order growth, which increased over 25% in the quarter and over 50% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our webscale customers are starting their 400-gig upgrade cycles and aggressively pursuing long-haul build-outs while our carrier customers are exploring new architectures to realize the full potential of 5G.
We are building the Internet for the future by creating breakthrough innovation with our routing, optical and automation technologies to deliver significant economic benefits. Recently, we launched a new routed optical networking solution, integrating our scalable, high-performance routers in Acacia's pluggable optics, which offers significant cost savings.
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Sedona Systems to extend our Crosswork automation platform to build on these capabilities. We also expanded our Silicon One platform from a routing focused solution to one which addresses the web scale switching market, offering 10 networking chips ranging from 3.2 to 25.6 terabits per second, making it the highest performance programmable routing and switching silicon on the market. We know our customers increasingly want to consume Cisco's technology in new, more flexible ways. At Cisco Live, we launched our new as-a-service portfolio, Cisco Plus and our first offer, Cisco Plus Hybrid Cloud, combining our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to deliver networking as a service, which will unify networking, security and observability across access, WAN and cloud domains to deliver an unparalleled experience for our customers.
Turning to security. We had a record quarter, surpassing $875 million in revenue, up 13% as we expanded our reach with customers around the world. Our security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and secure experience. We have an unrivaled ability to provide end-to-end security capabilities across users, devices, applications and data on any network or any cloud. This is the key reason why our customers trust us to help them proactively protect against and remediate threats. In fact, leading customers in every industry, including 100% of the Fortune 100 are using Cisco Security Solutions. These customers are increasingly deploying our Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE architectures, along with automation, authentication and analytics capabilities.
With today's distributed workforce, companies must quickly deploy highly secure, trusted access to critical applications everywhere without compromising performance. Customers like Ford are using our cloud-delivered security platform umbrella as they secure over 100,000 of their remote team members.
In this quarter, Lyft turned to Cisco to strengthen their security protection for all of their users accessing their applications. By deploying our Duo portfolio, Lyft was able to provide strong access controls as they protect their user's sensitive personal and financial information while reducing their total cost of ownership by more than 50%.
With nearly $6 billion in annual R&D, the investment that Cisco is making in both security and the network continues to lead the momentum across our portfolio, with 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit umbrella cloud security growth, nearly 7,000 customers using our cloud-native SecureX platform and strong platform growth with security enterprise agreements.
We continue to expand our leadership with new innovations, including passwordless authentication, data loss prevention, observability, cloud-based malware detection and enhancements to SecureX. We are also complementing our organic innovation with assets that enable greater security efficacy. Our intent to acquire Kenna Security will bring together their risk-based vulnerability management platform with SecureX threat management capabilities to prioritize and more effectively manage overall risk.
Lastly, let me touch on applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well. We had a record quarter in WebEx as we execute against our strategy to power the future of hybrid work. Over the last 6 months, we've added more than 400 new features and devices to our WebEx portfolio. We are enabling seamless experiences through our desk camera and desk hub solutions while extending the WebEx suite of devices, including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts and environmental sensors to help enable a safe return to the office.
Wellbeing is top of mind for so many right now as we face a new way of working. This is why we launched People Insights to help people monitor and manage their wellbeing. These new features, devices and capabilities, combined with cloud calling and cloud contact center, provide our customers with the most comprehensive and inclusive hybrid work platform.
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Social labs by integrating Slido and Social labs into our WebEx platform. We will also be able to provide the most comprehensive internal and external event management solution on the market.
In summary, we had a very good quarter. I'm so proud of the continued success of the business transformation our teams are driving. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the strongest demand in nearly a decade. We are also seeing similar component shortage supply issues as our peers. The good news, and this is reflected in our guidance, is that we are confident we will work through this as we have already put in place revised arrangements with several of our key suppliers. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors, and take care of our customers by fulfilling their demand as quickly as possible. Our strategy and commitment to leading with trust, innovation and choice along with our continued focus and discipline are positioning us well for growth and profitability.
As we accelerate the pace of innovation for our customers and partners, it's critical that we continue to support our people, our communities and our planet. I'm very proud that Cisco was recently named the #1 Best Place to Work in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This is a tremendous honor for us as it recognizes the incredible work of our people and the power of the culture we have created.
And lastly, in terms of actions we are taking to protect the planet. Last month, the Cisco Foundation announced $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing and climate solutions. We have already achieved 100% renewable energy in the U.S. and in many countries across Europe, and this is another strong step forward.
Whether it's our deep focus on delivering the best results for our customers, partners and employees or our commitment to making a difference in communities across the world, Cisco remains committed to our purpose to power an inclusive future for all. I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead and confident in our team's ability to deliver.
I'll now turn it over to Scott."

Last quarter, I identified 4 key priorities that we are using to define our financial strategy: Driving profitable growth; a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency; setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation; and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. We made progress on all these fronts in Q3 and are continuing to build our financial approach based on these 4 pillars, providing a strong foundation for enhanced financial performance as well as long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q4. As Chuck said, Q3 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well with strong product orders and solid growth in revenue, net income and earnings per share.
Total revenue increased to $12.8 billion, up 7% year-on-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw broad strength in all product areas and geographies. We also saw continued recovery in our business and building momentum with sequential revenue growth of 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 4%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 5% year-on-year, coming in above the high end of our EPS guidance range.
Now let me provide more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 8%. Infrastructure platforms has rebounded nicely with revenues up 6%. Within that, switching revenue increased overall with growth in campus driven by strong double-digit growth of our Catalyst 9K products. Routing had strong double-digit growth, driven by strength in the service provider market. Wireless had strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and strength in Meraki. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we experience continued market contraction. Applications were up 5%.
We continue to see double-digit growth in WebEx driven by our product innovations and the value we bring to remote working. We saw growth in Unified Communications, IoT software and AppDynamics, offset by a decline in telepresence endpoints. Security was up 13% with growth across the entire portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings.
And we continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was $3.8 billion and subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-on-year.
As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenues. In fact, the majority of our total revenue growth in the quarter came from recurring revenue streams. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q3, RPOs were $28.1 billion, up 10%. The product was up 15% and for service was up 7%.
There was a 90 basis points positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter related to the acquisitions of Acacia and IMI Mobile, which both closed during the quarter. As a reminder, these acquisitions were not factored into our Q3 revenue guide. We had strong order momentum in Q3 with total product orders up 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas were up 6% and EMEA was up 10%, and APJC was up 31%. Total emerging markets were up 13%, with the Bricks plus Mexico, up 31%.
In our customer segments, service provider was up 17%. Commercial was up 16%, Public sector was up 11%. Enterprise was flat, which is a significant improvement from last quarter.
Non-GAAP total gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 66%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.9%, down 90 basis points. And service gross margin was 68.7%, down 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was largely driven by ongoing costs related to the supply chain challenges, offset by positive product mix, which includes some software benefit. Price erosion was relatively moderate and in line with our historical range.
On the supply chain front, we continue to manage through the constraints seen industry-wide and continue to incur additional costs. We are partnering with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extending supply commitments as we address the supply chain challenges, which we expect will continue.
The quarter did include an extra week, as we discussed on our last call. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to total revenue was approximately 3 points of growth. Total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million.
Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 8%, driven by the timing of payments and restructuring costs. We expect operating cash flow to normalize for the full fiscal year. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.6 billion, down $7 billion sequentially, driven by $5.5 billion in payments for acquisitions as well as $3 billion in repayments of our long-term debt.
From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend and $510 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $6.7 billion to shareholders, which represents 64% of our free cash flow, and we have $8.7 billion in capacity remaining under our current share repurchase program authorization.
We continue to invest organically and inorganically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we closed 3 acquisitions, Acacia Communications, IMI Mobile and Dash Space. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also successfully closed on our acquisition of Slido on May 4. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our growth areas.
To summarize, we had a great Q3. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering growth and driving shareholder value.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Our financial guidance for Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% year-on-year, reflecting, again, the strong demand we're seeing; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%, reflecting the ongoing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.81 to $0.83.
Looking ahead, we're excited to announce we will host a virtual Cisco Financial Analyst Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021. We will post event details in the coming weeks and look forward to sharing more with you at that time. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

19691,706408965,2292973,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

Rod, on the -- starting with the gross margin, the impact you're seeing in the Q4 guide on gross margin is really driven by supply chain. It has a couple of elements to it. One is unit costs so that we've got and actually it was announced today from Gartner. We've got the #1 supply chain team in the world 2 years in a row. That team has done a great job getting ahead of the issues that everyone in the industry is seeing. So with that, though, we've locked in both supply and pricing with some of the key component providers that we've got going ahead, that's what you see built into the margin guide. And I think the supply chain issues will stay with us at least through -- from what I can see at least through the end of this calendar year.
On the OpEx side, it's a little bit different. When you look at the -- we're right on track. Let me just start by saying before you ask, we're right on track with the savings associated with the restructuring that we announced earlier this year -- earlier this fiscal year. We said at the time, we would reinvest some of that into the growth of the business overall, and that's what you see happening. So when you look at the year-on-year growth in OpEx, it's driven by the integration of the acquisitions that closed during the quarter. A little bit of a headwind from FX as the dollar has weakened and then the higher commissions given the robust strength of the top line, commissions are up and reset of the variable comp plans. So that's what's driving it. And I think the sustainability to get to your point, is I expect to see some of these supply chain issues linger with us through the end of the calendar year, first half of our fiscal year."

So as we began to realize that we were going to have the incremental cost, we had to make some decisions. And I think, obviously, we do believe these are temporary. We'll have to see how long they last. But based on that and based on the fact that we are seeing such momentum in the business right now, we decided to continue to invest in the business to drive the growth that we are feeling right now. And when you see the balance of the growth across all the businesses, as you see the regional balance, it was balanced across the technology areas, it was balanced across segments.
And then you think about that in the context of some of these real major trends that are occurring that were on the front end of like the 400-gig transition like the success we're having in web scale, the service provider 5G build-out. The hybrid work and return to office. We talked about WiFi 6, leading to campus switching, which we're seeing play out now. And the security business had a record quarter at a time where most every customer is suggesting that they're going to be spending more over the next 12 months in cybersecurity. So we felt like it was prudent to continue to invest to meet the demand and deal with some of the short-term pain and then we think we'll get to the other side of it."

A couple of great questions. Number one, What we do know is that if we come to the conclusion that any of these cost increases or these -- this inflation, as you mentioned it, are going to be more sustained than we will look at strategic price increases where we have to. That work is already underway. There's already some decisions that we've made. So we will do that. It's a pretty dynamic situation, as you know. And then on the pull ahead, this is a question that we've been asked. And while it's impossible to really quantify what that might be. It's going to be pretty obvious that if a customer has extended lead times, they're probably going to place order sooner than when they would. That just makes sense.
But we also have proxies that we would be looking for to really reflect that being a major issue like order cancellations if they're placing these orders in multiple -- against multiple channels and then canceling when they get it out of 1 channel. We don't see that. You would see more of that pull ahead from the enterprise. And obviously, commercial and small business, you probably wouldn't see as much, and those were pretty significant growth engines for us this past quarter. So we don't see any glaring red flags, although we would certainly agree that there's probably some level of early ordering going on."

I think we're seeing the small businesses and the commercial customers moving a little faster. Although we saw enterprise pickup in Asia and in Europe, and we've done a deep analysis with our team. The U.S. improved, and we would expect next quarter and the next fiscal year for U.S. Enterprise to actually improved significantly from where we are today.
And I think on the industry front, we were doing the review in the U.S., and we've actually seen double-digit growth in hospitality, in health care, in retail, and we've even seen the cruise lines making significant purchases as they prepare to go back out. So we think that, that is definitely a sign that we're on the road to recovery. And I would say that the other thing I would highlight is, as our customers think about hybrid work and they think about the return to office, we've talked about the prevalence of WiFi 6. We saw continued strength in WiFi. And we said once that begins to happen, that we believe there would be a campus switching upgrade follow. And the Cat 9K has had 4 quarters of increasing growth in double digits the last few quarters from a demand perspective. So we've seen that happen as well. So I think that overall, I think it's happening as we thought it would and perhaps even at an accelerated pace."

And I know it's hard to say, but it's hard to quantify, but can you at least qualitatively speak about the fact of, when you grow 7% and we deduct the acquisition impact, et cetera. What's the impact of the environment really improving in your comments versus just easy comps because last year was so weak because of COVID?"

I'll comment on both of them, and then Scott can add on to it. So on the pricing front, as I said a few minutes ago, I think we have made some decisions on certain products that we will be making price increases on, and we're looking surgically at the rest of the portfolio based on where we have costs that we believe are going to be sustained. But we're erring hard right now on taking care of our customers and trying to get, optimize our ability to deliver to them right now because we think that improves our relationships and it improves our position over the long term with these customers. So that's what we're doing.
On the year-over-year trends, I think that -- what I would point to is the real thing that I think is substantive is the demand side of what we've seen. And because you're right, you can do some math that gets at the revenue in Q3. But I think that based on what we see and the demand that we see, we do believe this is certainly a -- it's a positively evolving marketplace for us. And I think the work we've done over the last year, we pivoted our strategy a year ago based on what we thought would happen post-pandemic. The teams have been executing really hard, and it's great to see the customers embracing the solutions that we're delivering out there. So we feel like it's sustainable. And Scott?

So we're seeing continued improvement, and that obviously bodes well for looking out at Q4 and into the future.
I think the other thing that we've talked about the robust demand that we've had, and you see the revenue that we printed in Q3, what you didn't see is we also have built up a healthy backlog at this point. And so I think coming into Q4, not only do we have a very high percentage of recurring revenue as -- that we know will come into the revenue stream during Q4. We've got a sizable backlog at this point of orders to fulfill, and we know exactly what's in the pipeline. So really feel good about the sequential trend that we're seeing across the business."

And right now, kind of goes away, maybe you can help us think about that.

So I'll try to do what you -- I'll try to answer what you asked, but I think it's a difficult one to really be definitive about. But I think there's a couple of aspects going on. I certainly believe there are projects that customers put on hold that they're now accelerating now that they have better visibility into what the return looks like. I definitely think that's happening. Also I think your second point is happening. I think that there -- every customer is looking at modernizing their infrastructure because no one wants to be caught flat-footed by the next crisis. And everyone has realized the power of technology during this time frame. And so I think there's an element of increased investments that we'll see across all the technology areas as well as, obviously, cybersecurity, et cetera.
But the other thing I think that's really important is that we've been investing for a long time against a lot of these big market transitions that are starting to come to life. I mean, you remember, Ittai, we didn't play in the web-scale space 5 years ago. We didn't play. And now we're seeing -- that was almost 1/4 of our service provider business again this quarter and is still growing robustly. I mean it grew over 25% this quarter against a quarter a year ago that was in excess of 70% growth. So it's not -- it's still accelerating.
And then you got 5G that's starting to play out the way we -- as we've all been waiting for it to play out. You've got this return to office and hybrid work with WiFi 6 and the campus upgrades that we've talked about, and you've got this cybersecurity concern that is only exacerbated by everything we see in the press by all the continuing attacks and at a time where we had record revenue. So we -- I think all of those things are playing into it, and that's what leads us to feel pretty good about where we are right now."

The first is we see a revenue headwind from the supply chain issue in Q4. As I said earlier, if we didn't have the supply chain challenges, we would have been guiding higher on revenue, which is reflected what Scott mentioned about the backlog coming into the quarter. The second thing is this business transformation that we have been working on for the last 5 or 6 years. If we go back to the first quarter, I was CEO and then we look at the quarter that we're entering into. The recurring revenue that we're pulling off the balance sheet that we have visibility to today that will be part of Q4 revenue is up 64% during that time frame. So we have a lot more visibility, and it just says that the whole rationale for why we've been driving this business model transformation, which is a big complex change to get to. But that has helped us in a big way, in allowing us to actually deliver the revenue we're talking about next quarter. So the benefits that we believe were there for the business model. I think this is probably the quarter where we're feeling the positive impact of that more than any other quarter."

In terms of your question on software growth, the numbers that you're using are a little bit rounded, but you're on the right thread. We're seeing nice growth in software. And in fact, we mentioned that 81% now of that is driven by subscription and recurring revenue. So 7-point improvement in the amount of that software revenue that's recurring. That is great news longer term, as you know, with recurring revenue, particularly when it's ratable, you see less of the impact upfront. So there's a bit of a bow wave.

But we do -- we have sold silicon stand-alone as well. We have our software running on one of their pieces of hardware. And in some case, we have their software running on our switching hardware. And we're working on white box ODM with a couple of them relative to our silicon. So we have all the variations that we announced in December of 2019, we are actively involved in right now. And the good news is there's a lot of systems desire as well. 
Just as an add-on to that. Last time we talked about 400 gig and there's always seems to be a question about 400 gig. And our customer count on 400-gig went up by 50% during the quarter. So we did see a continued uptake on that technology. And that's super early, as you know."

I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe as we start to see the benefits of vaccine deployments and the continuing improvement in economic activity. 
I want to start by acknowledging our employees, customers and partners in India, who are experiencing a devastating surge of COVID cases. Cisco is providing critical resources during this challenging time, and our thoughts remain with all of you. 
While many of us are seeing great progress in our recovery efforts, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as we manage the ongoing pandemic around the world. 
Turning to the quarter. We had impressive momentum in Q3, which gives me a great sense of optimism going forward. We returned to growth with revenue up 7%, driven by an improving macro environment, the strongest product portfolio in our history and great execution by our teams. 
We saw broad-based demand across the business, led by our biggest growth opportunities: hybrid work, digital transformation, cloud and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings. We're also seeing early momentum in the ramping of key technology cycles that are long-term growth drivers for our business, such as 5G, 400-gig and Edge. 
The next phase of the recovery and the future of work will be heavily reliant on our technology. Cisco's end-to-end portfolio will serve as the foundation for next-generation infrastructure solutions as well as cloud-enabled delivery models and innovation, allowing our customers to move with even greater speed and agility. This will require a significant investment cycle and reinforces the strength of our strategy while driving greater opportunity to create a world that is more connected, inclusive and secure. 
We remain focused on accelerating innovation while simplifying the adoption of our offerings with network-wide automation, analytics and flexible as a service consumption models, all aimed at improving our customers' network performance capabilities and security, which we believe will drive tremendous long-term opportunities for us. 
Our Q3 performance only reinforces my confidence about the future. These results reflect a return to a strong spending environment and an economic recovery that has gained momentum driven by vaccine rollouts and the easing of restrictions. As the economy has improved, customers have increased their investment across our portfolio to prepare for the upturn and return to office. In Q3, we saw 10% growth in product orders, the highest growth rate since Q1 of fiscal 2012, reflecting robust improvement across all of our customer segments and geographies. 
From a product revenue perspective, we saw 6% growth, led by strength across our portfolio, including campus switching, routing, wireless, security, collaboration and web scale as well as from our acquisition of Acacia, which closed during Q3. 
We continue to aggressively shift our business to more recurring revenue streams, which we expect to grow over time as we expand our offerings. In Q3, we achieved $3.8 billion in software revenue, with 81% of our software revenue sold as a subscription, up from 76% last quarter. We also saw another quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations. Over the past 6 years, we have made significant progress and now have one of the largest software businesses in the industry with an annual run rate well over $14 billion. 
Let me now touch on infrastructure platforms. We saw strong demand across the majority of our portfolio, led by our next-generation enterprise networking and service provider solutions as companies accelerate the modernization of their infrastructure. This modern infrastructure delivers higher performance and faster access to data while offering the best user experience in an increasingly distributed environment. 
Customers are turning to us to help them create the trusted workplace of the future with WiFi access points, video endpoints, cameras and IoT sensors, feeding data into DNA center and DNA spaces. We are enabling operations teams to remotely monitor workplace conditions for a safe return to office. We are also working to provide visibility beyond corporate networks, which is increasingly critical as our customers accelerate their adoption of SaaS and cloud solutions for hybrid work. 
At Cisco Live, we launched the industry's first enterprise-wide full stack observability offering by integrating ThousandEyes cloud intelligence with our catalyst switching portfolio and AppDynamics. This provides IT with visibility and actionable insights across both external and internal networks to provide a seamless digital experience for users. And with users more distributed than ever, it is vital that they have the most efficient and secure connection to the cloud. 
Our deep partnerships with Google, Amazon and Microsoft allow native connectivity from our SD-WAN fabric to each of these cloud offerings. With our technology, customers can reduce deployment times and connect branch offices to cloud workloads in minutes. 
In our web scale business, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong order growth, which increased over 25% in the quarter and over 50% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our web scale customers are starting their 400-gig upgrade cycles and aggressively pursuing long-haul build-outs while our carrier customers are exploring new architectures to realize the full potential of 5G. 
We are building the Internet for the future by creating breakthrough innovation with our routing, optical and automation technologies to deliver significant economic benefits. Recently, we launched a new routed optical networking solution, integrating our scalable, high-performance routers and Acacia's pluggable optics, which offers significant cost savings. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Sedona Systems to extend our crosswork automation platform to build on these capabilities. We also expanded our Silicon One platform from a routing focused solution to one which addresses the web scale switching market, offering 10 networking chips ranging from 3.2 to 25.6 terabits per second, making it the highest performance, programmable routing and switching silicon on the market. 
We know our customers increasingly want to consume Cisco's technology in new, more flexible ways. At Cisco Live, we launched our new as a service portfolio, Cisco Plus and our first offer, Cisco Plus hybrid cloud, combining our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to deliver networking as a service, which will unify networking, security and observability across access, WAN and cloud domains to deliver an unparalleled experience for our customers. 
Turning to security. We had a record quarter, surpassing $875 million in revenue, up 13% as we expanded our reach with customers around the world. Our security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and secure experience. We have an unrivaled ability to provide end-to-end security capabilities across users, devices, applications and data on any network or any cloud. This is the key reason why our customers trust us to help them proactively protect against and remediate threats. In fact, leading customers in every industry, including 100% of the Fortune 100 are using Cisco security solutions. These customers are increasingly deploying our Zero Trust and secure access service edge or SASE architectures, along with automation, authentication and analytics capabilities. 
With today's distributed workforce, companies must quickly deploy highly secure trusted access to critical applications everywhere without compromising performance. Customers like Ford are using our cloud-delivered security platform umbrella as they secure over 100,000 of their remote team members. And this quarter, Lyft turned to Cisco to strengthen their security protection for all of their users accessing their applications. By deploying our duo portfolio, Lyft was able to provide strong access controls as they protect their users' sensitive personal and financial information while reducing their total cost of ownership by more than 50%. 
With nearly $6 billion in annual R&D, the investment that Cisco is making in both security and the network continues to lead the momentum across our portfolio, with 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit umbrella cloud security growth, nearly 7,000 customers using our cloud-native SecureX platform and strong platform growth with security enterprise agreements. 
We continue to expand our leadership with new innovations, including passwordless authentication, data loss prevention, observability, cloud-based malware detection and enhancements to SecureX. We're also complementing our organic innovation with assets that enable greater security efficacy. Our intent to acquire Kenna Security will bring together their risk-based vulnerability management platform with SecureX's threat management capabilities to prioritize and more effectively manage overall risk. 
Lastly, let me touch on applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well. We had a record quarter in Webex as we execute against our strategy to power the future of hybrid work. Over the last 6 months, we've added more than 400 new features and devices to our Webex portfolio. We are enabling seamless experiences through our desk camera and desk hub solutions while extending the Webex suite of devices, including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts and environmental sensors to help enable a safe return to the office. 
Well-being is top of mind for so many right now as we face a new way of working. This is why we launched People Insights to help people monitor and manage their well-being. These new features, devices and capabilities, combined with cloud calling and cloud contact center, provide our customers with the most comprehensive and inclusive hybrid work platform. 
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Socio Labs. By integrating Slido and Socio Labs into our Webex platform, we will also be able to provide the most comprehensive internal and external event management solution on the market. 
In summary, we had a very good quarter. I'm so proud of the continued success of the business transformation our teams are driving. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the strongest demand in nearly a decade. We are also seeing similar component shortage supply issues as our peers. The good news, and this is reflected in our guidance, is that we are confident we will work through this as we have already put in place revised arrangements with several of our key suppliers. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors and take care of our customers by fulfilling their demand as quickly as possible. 
Our strategy and commitment to leading with trust, innovation and choice, along with our continued focus and discipline are positioning us well for growth and profitability. As we accelerate the pace of innovation for our customers and partners, it's critical that we continue to support our people, our communities and our planet. 
I'm very proud that Cisco was recently named the #1 Best Place to work in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This is a tremendous honor for us as it recognizes the incredible work of our people and the power of the culture we have created. 
And lastly, in terms of actions we are taking to protect the planet. Last month, the Cisco Foundation announced $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. We have already achieved 100% renewable energy in the U.S. and in many countries across Europe, and this is another strong step forward. 
Whether it's our deep focus on delivering the best results for our customers, partners and employees, or our commitment to making a difference in communities across the world, Cisco remains committed to our purpose, to power an inclusive future for all. I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead and confident in our team's ability to deliver. 
I'll now turn it over to Scott."

Last quarter, I identified 4 key priorities that we are using to define our financial strategy: driving profitable growth; a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency; setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation; and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. We made progress on all these fronts in Q3 and are continuing to build our financial approach based on these core pillars, providing a strong foundation for enhanced financial performance as well as long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q4. As Chuck said, Q3 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well with strong product orders and solid growth in revenue, net income and earnings per share. Total revenue increased to $12.8 billion, up 7% year-on-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw broad strength in all product areas and geographies. We also saw continued recovery in our business and building momentum with sequential revenue growth of 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 4%; and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 5% year-on-year, coming in above the high end of our EPS guidance range. 
Now let me provide more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 8%. Infrastructure platforms has rebounded nicely, with revenues up 6%. Within that, switching revenue increased overall with growth in campus, driven by strong double-digit growth of our Catalyst 9000 products. Routing had strong double-digit growth, driven by strength in the service provider market. Wireless had strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and strength in Meraki. 
Data center revenue declined, driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were up 5%. We continue to see double-digit growth in Webex, driven by our product innovations and the value we bring to remote working. We saw growth in unified communications, IoT software and AppDynamics, offset by a decline in telepresence endpoints. Security was up 13% with growth across the entire portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and umbrella offerings. And we continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. 
Software revenue was $3.8 billion and subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-on-year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenues. In fact, the majority of our total revenue growth in the quarter came from recurring revenue streams. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q3, RPOs were $28.1 billion, up 10%. RPO for product was up 15% and for service was up 7%. 
There was a 90 basis point positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter related to the acquisitions of Acacia and IMImobile, which both closed during the quarter. As a reminder, these acquisitions were not factored into our Q3 revenue guide. We had strong order momentum in Q3 with total product orders up 10%. 
Looking at our geographies, the Americas were up 6%, EMEA was up 10% and APJC was up 31%. Total emerging markets were up 13%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 31%. In our customer segments, service provider was up 17%, commercial was up 16%, public sector was up 11%. Enterprise was flat, which is a significant improvement from last quarter. Non-GAAP total gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 66%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.9%, down 90 basis points. And service gross margin was 68.7%, down 20 basis points. 
The decrease in product gross margin was largely driven by ongoing costs related to the supply chain challenges, offset by positive product mix, which includes some software benefit. Price erosion was relatively moderate and in line with our historical range. On the supply chain front, we continue to manage through the constraints seeing industry-wide and continue to incur additional costs. We are partnering with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extending supply commitments as we address the supply chain challenges, which we expect will continue. 
The quarter did include an extra week, as we discussed on our last call. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to total revenue was approximately 3 points of growth. Total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 8%, driven by the timing of payments and restructuring costs. We expect operating cash flow to normalize for the full fiscal year. 
We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.6 billion, down $7 billion sequentially, driven by $5.5 billion in payments for acquisitions as well as $3 billion in repayments of our long-term debt. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend and $510 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $6.7 billion to shareholders, which represents 64% of our free cash flow, and we have $8.7 billion in capacity remaining under our current share repurchase program authorization.
We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we closed 3 acquisitions, Acacia Communications, IMImobile and Dashbase. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also successfully closed on our acquisition of Slido on May 4. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our growth areas.
To summarize, we had a great Q3. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering growth and driving shareholder value.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Our financial guidance for Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% year-on-year, reflecting, again, the strong demand we're seeing; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%, reflecting the ongoing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.81 to $0.83.
Looking ahead, we're excited to announce we will host a virtual Cisco Financial Analyst Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021. We will post event details in the coming weeks and look forward to sharing more with you at that time. 
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

On the -- starting with the gross margin, the impact you're seeing in the Q4 guide on gross margin is really driven by supply chain. It has a couple of elements to it. One is unit costs. So that we've got, and actually it was announced today from Gartner, we've got the #1 supply chain team in the world 2 years in a row. That team has done a great job getting ahead of the issues that everyone in the industry is seeing. So with that, though, we've locked in both supply and pricing with some of the key component providers that we've got going ahead. That's what you see built into the margin guide. And I think the supply chain issues will stay with us at least through -- from what I can see, at least through the end of this calendar year.
On the OpEx side, it's a little bit different. When you look at the -- we're right on track. Let me just start by saying -- before you ask, we're right on track with the savings associated with the restructuring that we announced earlier this year -- earlier this fiscal year. We said at the time, we would reinvest some of that into the growth of the business overall, and that's what you see happening. So when you look at the year-on-year growth in OpEx, it's driven by the integration of the acquisitions that closed during the quarter. A little bit of a headwind from FX as the dollar has weakened and then the higher commissions given the robust strength of the top line, commissions are up and reset of the variable comp plans. But that's what's driving it. And I think the  sustainability to get to your point, as I expect to see some of these supply chain issues linger with us through the end of the calendar year, first half of our fiscal year."

So as we began to realize that we were going to have the incremental cost, we had to make some decisions. And I think, obviously, we do believe these are temporary. We'll have to see how long they last. But based on that and based on the fact that we are seeing such momentum in the business right now, we decided to continue to invest in the business to drive the growth that we are feeling right now. And when you see the balance of the growth across all the businesses, as you see the regional balance, it was balanced across the technology areas, it was balanced across segments.
And then you think about that in the context of some of these real major trends that are occurring that were on the front end of like the 400-gig transition, like the success we're having in web scale, the service provider 5G build-out, the hybrid work and return to office. We talked about WiFi 6, leading to campus switching, which we're seeing play out now. And the security business had a record quarter at a time where most every customer is suggesting that they're going to be spending more over the next 12 months in cybersecurity. So we felt like it was prudent to continue to invest to meet the demand and deal with some of the short-term pain and then we think we'll get to the other side of it."

A couple of great questions. Number one, What we do know is that if we come to the conclusion that any of these cost increases or these -- this inflation, as you mentioned it, are going to be more sustained then we will look at strategic price increases where we have to. And that work is already underway. There's already some decisions that we've made. So we will do that. It's a pretty dynamic situation, as you know. And then on the pull ahead, this is a question that we've been asked. And while it's impossible to really quantify what that might be, it's going to be pretty obvious that if a customer has extended lead times, they're probably going to place order sooner than when they would. That just makes sense.
But we also have proxies that we would be looking for to really reflect that being a major issue like order cancellations if they're placing these orders in multiple -- against multiple channels and then canceling when they get it out of one channel. We don't see that. You would see more of that pull ahead from the enterprise. And obviously, commercial and small business, you probably wouldn't see as much, and those were pretty significant growth engines for us this past quarter. So we don't see any glaring red flags, although we would certainly agree that there's probably some level of early ordering going on."

I think we're seeing the small businesses and the commercial customers moving a little faster. Although we saw enterprise pickup in Asia and in Europe, and we've done a deep analysis with our team. The U.S. improved, and we would expect next quarter and then next fiscal year for U.S. Enterprise to actually improve significantly from where we are today.
And I think on the industry front, we were doing the review in the U.S., and we've actually seen double-digit growth in hospitality, in health care, in retail, and we've even seen the cruise lines making significant purchases as they prepare to go back out. So we think that, that is definitely a sign that we're on the road to recovery. And I would say that the other thing I would highlight is, as our customers think about hybrid work and they think about the return to office, we've talked about the prevalence of WiFi 6. We saw continued strength in WiFi. And we said once that begins to happen, that we believe there would be a campus switching upgrade follow. And the Cat 9000 has had 4 quarters of increasing growth in double digits the last few quarters from a demand perspective. So we've seen that happen as well.

So on the pricing front, as I said a few minutes ago, I think we have made some decisions on certain products that we will be making price increases on, and we're looking surgically at the rest of the portfolio based on where we have costs that we believe are going to be sustained. But we're erring hard right now on taking care of our customers and trying to get -- optimize our ability to deliver to them right now because we think that improves our relationships and it improves our position over the long term with these customers. So that's what we're doing.
On the year-over-year trends, I think that -- what I would point to is the real thing that I think is substantive is the demand side of what we've seen. And -- because you're right, you can do some math that gets at the revenue in Q3. But I think that based on what we see and the demand that we see, we do believe this is certainly a -- it's a positively evolving marketplace for us. And I think the work we've done over the last year, we pivoted our strategy a year ago based on what we thought would happen post-pandemic.

So we're seeing continued improvement, and that obviously bodes well for looking out at Q4 and into the future.
I think the other thing that we've talked about the robust demand that we've had, and you see the revenue that we printed in Q3, what you didn't see is we also have built up a healthy backlog at this point. And so I think that coming into Q4, not only do we have a very high percentage of recurring revenue as -- that we know will come into the revenue stream during Q4. We've got a sizable backlog at this point of orders to fulfill, and we know exactly what's in the pipeline. So really feel good about the sequential trend that we're seeing across the business."

I think that there -- every customer is looking at modernizing their infrastructure because no one wants to be caught flat-footed by the next crisis. And everyone has realized the power of technology during this time frame. And so I think there's an element of increased investments that we'll see across all the technology areas as well as, obviously, cybersecurity, et cetera.
But the other thing I think that's really important is that we've been investing for a long time against a lot of these big market transitions that are starting to come to life. I mean, you remember, Ittai, we didn't play in the web-scale space 5 years ago. We didn't play. And now we're seeing -- that was almost 1/4 of our service provider business again this quarter and is still growing robustly. I mean it grew over 25% this quarter against a quarter a year ago that was in excess of 70% growth. So it's not -- it's still accelerating.
And then you got 5G that's starting to play out the way we -- as we've all been waiting for it to play out. You've got this return to office and hybrid work with WiFi 6 and the campus upgrades that we've talked about, and you've got this cybersecurity concern that is only exacerbated by everything we see in the press by all the continuing attacks and at a time where we had record revenue. So we -- I think all of those things are playing into it, and that's what leads us to feel pretty good about where we are right now."

The first is we see a revenue headwind from the supply chain issue in Q4. As I said earlier, if we didn't have the supply chain challenges, we would have been guiding higher on revenue, which is reflected what Scott mentioned about the backlog coming into the quarter. 
The second thing is this business transformation that we have been working on for the last 5 or 6 years. If we go back to the first quarter, I was CEO and then we look at the quarter that we're entering into. The recurring revenue that we're pulling off the balance sheet that we have visibility to today that will be part of Q4 revenue is up 64% during that time frame. So we have a lot more visibility, and it just says that the whole rationale for why we've been driving this business model transformation, which is a big complex change to get to. But that has helped us in a big way, in allowing us to actually deliver the revenue we're talking about next quarter. So the benefits that we believe were there for the business model, I think this is probably the quarter where we're feeling the positive impact of that more than any other quarter."

They've all got significant transformation underway as well within their shops to support the new hybrid work environment. And so we're working as hard as we can to make sure we can deliver a product to them. So unit costs are slightly higher, and that's semis, that's memory and it's certain other smaller commodities across the board.
The second is freight costs are higher. And as freight costs go up. Obviously, that hits gross margin and finally, expedite fees as we're getting product in the door. So it's all tied to various elements of supply chain."

In terms of your question on software growth, the numbers that you're using are a little bit rounded, but you're on the right thread. We're seeing nice growth in software. And in fact, we mentioned that 81% now of that is driven by subscription and recurring revenue. So 7-point improvement in the amount of that software revenue that's recurring. That is great news longer term, as you know, with recurring revenue, particularly when it's ratable, you see less of the impact upfront. So there's a bit of a bow wave. And you see it in the growth of our RPOs and the growth of our deferred revenue on products. So each of those are growing. That's also a sign of the growth within our software product set.

So we've had 6 consecutive quarters of very strong double-digit growth, ranging from mid-teens to triple digits. And so -- and that's in the webscale vertical. And it's been a combination -- it certainly has been share gains because we didn't have any presence before. So as I've joked on calls before, it's one of the few markets where we actually have the opportunity to go gain share. And so that's been positive. We've worked hard on these relationships. And so that has expanded. We had a 2-day customer briefing with 1 of them 2 weeks ago. And it was -- that particular briefing was all about our enterprise portfolio. So we're seeing both sides, but we are definitely seeing the success that I just mentioned with Tim's question around the cloud vertical in the cloud infrastructure."

That's at a higher margin than our software business, which year-on-year grew at 13% and is now on a run rate of about $14 billion per year software business, that obviously comes at a higher margin, too. So while we do have supply chain headwinds, we've also got some nice tailwinds that are coming in."

19691,716411796,2381712,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all remaining healthy and staying safe. Our team at Cisco ended fiscal 2021 with an incredibly strong finish. We had an outstanding Q4 performance and fiscal year revenue, reflecting strength",1593,"Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all remaining healthy and staying safe. Our team at Cisco ended fiscal 2021 with an incredibly strong finish. We had an outstanding Q4 performance and fiscal year revenue, reflecting strength across our portfolio, customer segments and geographies. Our product order growth was the highest we've seen in over a decade, and we're continuing to see strong customer reception to the accelerated investments in software and subscriptions. This great momentum is reaffirming our position as the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet and the digital enterprise.
As I think about our achievements over the past year, 3 things stand out to me. First, the exceptional execution of our teams. We achieved these results through the extraordinary efforts of our leadership team, our partners, and most importantly, our people around the world who operated with incredible speed and at an unprecedented scale to deliver this growth.
Second, our transformation and strategic investments are paying off. The benefits of our shift to software and subscriptions are clear, and they are helping both Cisco and our customers move with greater speed and agility.
And third, the power of our portfolio. The groundbreaking innovation we are investing in today will serve as the foundation for our customers' futures. These 3 factors position us exceptionally well for growth as we enter our next fiscal year as evidenced by our results this quarter. We are more confident than ever that we are in a strong position to help our customers be successful. As we look forward, we are laser-focused on providing our customers the technologies they will need to successfully navigate highly dynamic environments at an incredibly rapid pace.
With the rise of COVID variants and the inconsistent pace of vaccine deployment around the globe, organizations must be resilient and adaptable as we've seen how quickly the world around us can change. While this may impact certain short-term plans like return to office for many, one thing is clear: there is tremendous demand for Cisco's technology. No matter how or when the global recovery takes shape, we are executing on our vision of rebuilding a better world, one that is digital, sustainable, inclusive and highly secure.
I believe we're at a pivotal moment in our company's history as we have a massive opportunity to transform what has been the traditional office and define the future of hybrid work. As our customers look to create safer hybrid workplaces as well as collaborative and engaging experiences for their customers and employees, we believe they are becoming increasingly reliant on Cisco technologies to help them with their transformation and resiliency.
Enterprises are increasingly seeking digital and cloud-enabled services, which is driving demand for our solutions and leading to new and expansive market opportunities for Cisco. We're in a unique leadership position to build and deliver innovative cloud-to-edge infrastructure platforms that our customers need. With the depth and breadth of our hardware, software, silicon and optics solutions, we are helping companies solve their biggest challenges. Whether it's adopting modern application architectures, shifting to hybrid work and hybrid cloud, securing their enterprise or meeting their ESG goals, Cisco is helping our customers thrive in a hybrid world.
These industry dynamics helped drive our strong fourth quarter performance. The momentum we saw in Q3 accelerated through Q4 as we delivered robust revenue growth, increased earnings, strong margins and record operating cash flow. We also generated strong double-digit growth in product deferred revenue, reflecting the success of our transformation around driving subscriptions and recurring revenues, which increases our visibility into future performance.
We are seeing IT budgets grow as companies begin to implement their critical future plans and business confidence increases. However, we do recognize that uncertainty remains around COVID-19, and we are closely monitoring the Delta variant and its impact on customer spending. Right now, we are not seeing any additional impact to our business aside from the component shortage we've been facing over the past several months.
Moving to the performance of our customer segments. As I mentioned, we delivered the highest product order growth in over a decade with growth of 31% driven by strength across all of our end markets. This outstanding performance is also up over 17% from our pre-COVID Q4 levels in fiscal year 2019. We saw double-digit growth in every one of our customer segments. This strength is being driven by stronger customer investment and substantial network upgrades to help modernize and secure their environments to support the new way of working.
Specifically in our enterprise business, we had the best quarter in terms of product orders in over a decade and saw very strong order growth of 25%. We also had our third consecutive quarter of acceleration in our commercial, service provider and public sector businesses with all of these segments showing growth in excess of 20%.
In our webscale business, we saw increased momentum, delivering record performance with over 160% order growth. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, orders grew over 80% due to customers adopting products across the portfolio and early traction of our 400-gig solutions, a huge testament to the investments we have made in accelerating innovation and the differentiated value we're bringing to these customers.
From a product portfolio perspective, we also had a very balanced performance. As customers prepare for office reopenings and hybrid work, they are increasing their investment across our networking, cloud security and unified communications portfolios. In Q4, we saw double-digit revenue growth in campus switching, Catalyst 9000, high-end routing, wireless and in our Zero Trust solutions, along with strength in our security endpoint portfolio. We also had very strong adoption of our Acacia optical solutions driven by increasing customer demand for leading-edge technology to address their growing bandwidth requirements.
The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show tremendous progress as we achieved over $4 billion in software revenue in Q4, an increase of 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Within that, subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. For perspective, software represented 31% of our business in Q4. And for the full year, when combined with our services business, they represent over 53% of revenue, clearly highlighting the success of our continued business transformation.
In addition to delivering strong financial results, our innovation engine continues to accelerate. Over the last year, we introduced an impressive number of new capabilities across our entire portfolio while also doubling down on more flexible consumption models, including our core networking capabilities as a Service, highlighted by the recent launch of Cisco Plus. Our new Cisco solutions deliver cross-portfolio technologies to help solve our customers' biggest needs with faster time to value. Our initial Network as a Service offerings deliver hybrid cloud technologies and will later expand to a broader catalog of services built and delivered with our partner ecosystem.
Cisco Plus improves speed, agility and scale with on-demand solutions that intelligently adapt to our customers' business needs. While still early days in its launch, Cisco Plus directly aligns with our transformation goals around driving more subscription-based recurring revenue via the cloud.
Our unique strengths improvement strategy give us the confidence to move at a more accelerated pace. You will see us continue to invest in our key growth areas and technology shifts like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, 5G, WiFi 6, Edge, security and cloud-native architectures to extend our technology leadership positions. You will also see us deliver even more strategic offers to enable our customers to thrive in a cloud-first digital world. These include full stack observability to improve their digital experiences by providing visibility and insights across their entire technology stack and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE, designed to enable seamless secure access to applications anywhere their users work.
Given the momentum we're seeing in our business, we have more conviction than ever that we are investing in the right areas, and we'll continue to extend our competitive advantages and drive growth.
Before I turn it over to Scott for more details on the quarter and our expectations for the next fiscal year, let me give you an update on the supply environment. While we are seeing increasing demand for our technology, we are also continuing to manage through the component shortage challenges that nearly every company is experiencing. Our world-class supply chain team, as always, is doing an incredible job navigating this complex situation by working with our global suppliers to meet customer demand as quickly as possible.
Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half.
In summary, demand for our technology is very strong, and our strategy is more relevant than ever. This allows us to deliver greater value to our customers, partners and communities as we all adapt to new ways of living and working. I am very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and with our momentum. I am confident in our strategy and investments. I feel great about the innovation we are driving in our portfolio, and I'm incredibly proud of what our teams and partners have achieved. I look forward to building on these insights with a more comprehensive deep dive on our multiyear vision and strategic growth drivers at our virtual Investor Day on September 15, and I hope you'll join us.
Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for additional detail."

Our fourth quarter reflects a strong close to our fiscal year with significant momentum across our business. We saw robust customer demand, demonstrating the third consecutive increase in product order growth and solid execution by our team",1518,"Thanks, Chuck. Our fourth quarter reflects a strong close to our fiscal year with significant momentum across our business. We saw robust customer demand, demonstrating the third consecutive increase in product order growth and solid execution by our teams. I'll provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance.
Q4 was a very strong quarter in a very dynamic environment. We executed exceptionally well with greater than 30% product order growth year-on-year and more than 17% order growth versus our pre-COVID Q4 fiscal '19 product bookings, driven by strength across our portfolio. In fact, it was the strongest product order growth rate in over a decade. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, earnings per share, and as Chuck said earlier, record operating cash flows.
Total revenue increased to $13.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continued to recover well and build momentum with sequential revenue growth of 3%.
Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 50 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84, both up 5% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Now let me turn to provide more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.7 billion, up 10%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 3%. Infrastructure platforms performed very well with revenues up 13%. All businesses saw double-digit growth with the exception of data center.
Switching had strong growth driven by double-digit increase in campus switching, led by our Catalyst 9K and Meraki switching offerings. We also had solid growth in our data center switching portfolio with the Nexus 9K products. Routing grew driven by both the service provider and enterprise markets as we saw strong adoption across our portfolio, including robust uptake of our Cisco 8000 platform.
Wireless had strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were down 1% driven by a slight decline in our collaboration portfolio. However, recurring subscription revenue within our WebEx suite grew 9% in Q4. We also saw solid growth in IoT software, AppDynamics, cloud contact center and our cloud calling platforms.
Security was up 1%. Our cloud security and Zero Trust portfolios performed well with greater than 20% growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Our Security recurring subscription revenue grew 13% in Q4 and 18% for the full fiscal year. In both applications and Security, we are seeing strong revenue growth in the strategic areas that we and our customers are investing in.
We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was $4 billion, an increase of 6%. Subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 3 points year-over-year. Software subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenue.
Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations, or RPO. At the end of Q4, RPO crossed the $30 billion mark at $30.9 billion, up 9%. RPO for product was up 18% and service was up 3%. Approximately 53% of the total RPO is short term, meaning it will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As I mentioned, we had exceptionally strong order momentum in Q4 as total product orders were up 31% with strength across the business.
Looking at our geographies. The Americas was up 34%, EMEA was up 24% and APJC was up 29%. Total emerging markets were up 25% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 37%. In our customer segments, commercial was up 41%. Service provider was up 40%. Enterprise returned to growth and was up 25%, while public sector was up 22%.
Non-GAAP total gross margins came in at 65.6%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 65%, up 180 basis points. And services gross margin was 67.4%, down 240 basis points, which was in line with our expectations as we do see variability from quarter-to-quarter. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity improvements from lower freight and other costs, partially offset by relatively modest price erosion.
As we discussed last quarter, we continue to manage through the supply chain constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. We've closely partnered with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half. Our #1 ranked global supply chain team continues to perform at a world-class level.
When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a positive 210 basis point impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share. From a cash perspective, operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $4.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong cash collections. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $24.5 billion, up approximately $900 million sequentially.
In terms of capital allocation, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $791 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q4, we closed 5 acquisitions: Kenna Security, Socio Labs, Slido, Sedona Systems and Invalvio. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas.
Turning to the full fiscal year results. Overall, our financial results were solid in a very challenging global pandemic environment with strong operational execution. Revenue was $49.8 billion, up 1%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, up 10 basis points. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points.
From a bottom line perspective, our non-GAAP net income was flat at $13.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.22. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.5 billion, flat compared to fiscal '20. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $9.1 billion in value to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 61% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $2.9 billion of share repurchases.
We also increased our dividend for the tenth consecutive year in fiscal 2021, reinforcing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We remain firmly committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to fuel our organic and inorganic growth initiatives as well as continuing our cap allocation strategy by returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, we had a great Q4 and a solid fiscal year with strong operational execution. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, driving more recurring revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value.
Now let me provide our forward-looking guidance. We are pleased to initiate the additional practice of providing an annual outlook to complement our regular quarterly look ahead for fiscal year 2022. The successful transformation we've been executing around driving a higher proportion of our revenues from subscriptions, recurring and deferred revenue, is affording us additional visibility into our outlook for future growth. Please note, our guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.
Our financial guidance for Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% year-on-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81.
Our financial guidance for the full year fiscal '22 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-on-year. In both our Q1 and full year outlook, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%.
Looking ahead, we're excited to host a Cisco virtual Investor Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021, which we will webcast live, and hope you can join us.
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

So definitely appreciate the full year guide and kind of wanted to understand what's providing that higher visibility. You mentioned the transformation. But also, how is the -- how are the orders feeding into that visibility? And what are you kind of baking in, in terms of supply chain in that full year guide overall? How much of -- kind of what you're baking in, in terms of headwind into that full year guide from a supply chain perspective?"

As we move to more and more of a software and services and recurring revenue base, we have greater visibility. One of the stats that we just talked about is our remaining performance obligations of $30.9 billion, of which 53% of that will turn into revenue in the next 12 months.
We also have a good feel for what other renewals are going to come up and what our renewal rate is as we work our way through this. So we have a pretty good sense of a big chunk of our revenue and how it's going to grow. We also have a good view of pipeline and what that looks like ahead. And one of the things that I would say about that pipeline is it's one of the -- it's -- we've seen year-on-year growth in the pipeline for Q1 better than we've ever seen in the last several years. So we see good growth in the pipeline as well. So it's -- when you add all that up, that's what gives us the confidence to give a full year guide.
What I would say is, the -- to your question about supply chain and what's the assumption on supply chain, the way to think about that is that's the difference between the high end and the low end of the guide. We expect the supply chain to impact us through the first half of the year. And then at the low end of the guide, we think we continue to have supply chain impacts through most of the second half as well with some clear up at the end at the high end of the guide. We think that we begin to clear up the supply chain issues, supply and demand comes back more into balance earlier in the second half.
So that's the -- that's why we gave the full year guide. I think -- certainly, we have the confidence with the visibility we have and what's baked into that based on some of the uncertainties still out there with the supply chain."

What we -- when you look at the Q4 gross margin, obviously, it came in better than what we had expected and what we had guided to. And there was really favorable product mix built into that, some of that being driven by a good quarter for software, as you heard on the call earlier.
Looking ahead, we've taken several steps to ensure that we can continue to have supply and deliver products to our customers. They're in the midst of their own transformations. They're all in the midst of doing the things they have to do to adapt to a world that's not only a hybrid work world, but one with the rise of the Delta variant that it's added complexity. It's not a, hey, the world is going to go back to normal at some point. It's ""I need to continue to have this kind of flexibility ahead."" We're trying to support that, and at the same time, the supply and demand imbalances and some of the key components around semiconductors and memory and some of the same things you hear from others of our peers. That turns into higher component costs as we buy from those suppliers.
We are also to ensure even greater supply going to brokers to get additional supply from -- versus what we can get directly from our suppliers, and in some cases, qualifying second sources where we have to. Each of those obviously drives cost, and it takes a while for those costs. We've been in that process through Q4, and we'll be in it through Q1. It takes a while for those costs to flow through our standard costing system and show up in the cost of goods sold.
There's a little bit of unfavorable product mix headwind as well in Q1 as we have a good sense of the products that don't have those same impacts that we will be able to ship that are sitting in backlog. So that's what's driving that sequential change.
As you know, we did put in place a price increase. Very selective, very targeted, only on the products where we were seeing the higher component costs. That went into effect August 7. But we always honor quotes that are out there for 30 days beyond that pricing because many of those quotes were produced before the price increase was put in.
So scroll 30 days ahead from August 7 before the first orders come in with those higher prices, and then it takes a while for those orders to come in, get built and shipped back out to customers and for us to realize the benefit of that on the top line. So think of those price increases as being something that we'll feel more of the benefit of in Q2 and Q3 versus what we see in Q1."

And we have customers that are large carriers, large telcos, cloud players who have 12-, 18- to 24-month capacity plans. And so they look at our lead times, and they are going to order into that based on what they have. But we would not say there was a significant amount of pull-ahead other than dealing with the lead times.

So on the applications front, we expected that you guys might want to ask about that. And there's a couple of things to to keep in mind. In both applications and Security, the order rates were certainly higher than the revenue rate. So that's the first thing I would tell you. The recurring subscription portions within each of those businesses were also very positive. As Scott said, in Security within -- I mean, in collaboration within applications, WebEx suite, the recurring subscriptions within WebEx suite revenue was up 9% in Q4, 16% for the year. We had solid growth in IoT, FD, cloud contact center and cloud calling.
What's also in there, if you will recall, is there's phones and handsets and there's some on-prem software that's associated with collaboration, and some of those were impacted by supply chain. But the future growth areas actually for us, looked really good.
On the Security front, Cloud Security Zero Trust over 20%. The Security recurring subscription revenue, up 13% in Q4, up 18% for the year. So that was solid as well. And again, our next-generation firewall demand was really good. but some of the legacy products and the supply chain created a little bit of a revenue headwind there. But again, orders were stronger than the revenues. We would expect those to normalize over the next few quarters.
As we get to webscale, look, this is a -- I have to tell you that preparing for this call, I reflected over the last 5, 6 years of having this discussion. And I always said that we would start talking about webscale when it was meaningful, and I guess I can now declare it meaningful. We made multiyear investments building the Cisco 8000 with new silicon, the optics and the software. And we had phenomenal growth. And it was 160% order growth this quarter over almost 30% order growth a year ago in the same quarter.
And the customers are really adopting our entire portfolio, including the enterprise side, but over half of that business landed in their cloud infrastructure. We also see 400 gig taking off in -- and really in a meaningful way. I'll give you a couple of stats on that because someone's probably going to ask it.
In Q4, 400-gig ports, our orders were up 668% and for the year, 400-gig port orders were up 831%. We have over 400 customers that have deployed, and we've taken orders for almost 180,000 ports total. So it's really moving forward. And I think those are the things that -- and we won several franchises in the cloud webscale space. We continue to do proof of concepts. We're in validation and certification stages and others. So we always said that we missed the first transition with these players and that we wanted to be prepared for this next architectural transition, and I think our teams have done a great job putting us in a good position."

You mentioned the ability to accelerate. I certainly wouldn't expect 31% order growth to be the new standard. But I think that there are certainly going to be -- it just feels like our customers are dealing with -- they're coming out. They're making decisions about modernizing their infrastructure and their technology assets to deal with this new hybrid work. And I think now what they're seeing is with the Delta variant, they're understanding that this may not be one move back to the office, right? This is going to -- they have to -- they're going to have to be resilient. They're going to have to build adaptability in for future because we could have the next variant 6 months from now. And I think that's what customers are thinking through right now.
The comment I'd make on pricing, and then I'll let Scott talk about the durability of them is, one thing that -- as we talk about gross margin in the quarter we just finished, the pricing element of gross margin was actually at the very low end of our normal range, which means we're holding pricing with our sales teams, which is a good sign right now. So once these things start flowing through, if that trend continues, then we would certainly see the favorable impact that we expect.

Clearly, as we locked in some of that -- some of the work that we did on supply, and particularly going after components that are particularly at an imbalance between supply and demand, we locked in both, right? We looked at both the costs that would come in for that and what the committed delivery schedule was on those. So we have a good sense of that for a subset of our components.
There's still going to be fluctuation in some areas. Memory is a good example where there's going to continue to be fluctuation in pricing, and we'll continue to monitor that. You saw us -- you've seen us in the past make price adjustments based on memory cost increases, and I would expect that to be kind of an ongoing process there. But for the ones that we locked in, which are the -- I think, the ones that are -- have the greatest imbalance and the highest demand both for us and for our competitors, we locked in both from that standpoint."

I think the other thing -- the other data point we gave is the growth of commercial. So if you look at the orders -- the overall order growth, commercial was up 41%.

So I think the refreshed portfolio and the new innovation that has been brought forward is just timely because we're on the front end of some of these big transitions that we've been talking about for several years. So I think that's really what's driving it.

But it's already -- the transformation has already made a big difference. Scott and I were looking at last quarter when we did guidance for Q4. Having the software revenue that came off the balance sheet significantly altered positively what we were able to guide from a revenue perspective in Q4 versus what we would have done 5 or 6 years ago.

As we look at the renewal rates and the actions we have to take, our renewal base is obviously growing and becoming much more important to us ahead. And obviously, renewals are dependent on adoption.

We achieved these results through the extraordinary efforts of our leadership team, our partners, and most importantly, our people around the world who operated with incredible speed and at an unprecedented scale to deliver this growth.
Second, our transformation and strategic investments are paying off. The benefits of our shift to software and subscriptions are clear, and they are helping both Cisco and our customers move with greater speed and agility. And third, the power of our portfolio. The groundbreaking innovation we are investing in today will serve as the foundation for our customers' futures.
These 3 factors position us exceptionally well for growth as we enter our next fiscal year as evidenced by our results this quarter. We are more confident than ever that we are in a strong position to help our customers be successful. As we look forward, we are laser-focused on providing our customers the technologies they will need to successfully navigate highly dynamic environments at an incredibly rapid pace.
With the rise of COVID variants and the inconsistent pace of vaccine deployment around the globe, organizations must be resilient and adaptable as we've seen how quickly the world around us can change. While this may impact certain short-term plans like return to office for many, one thing is clear: there is tremendous demand for Cisco's technology. No matter how or when the global recovery takes shape, we are executing on our vision of rebuilding a better world, one that is digital, sustainable, inclusive and highly secure.
I believe we're at a pivotal moment in our company's history as we have a massive opportunity to transform what has been the traditional office and define the future of hybrid work. As our customers look to create safer hybrid workplaces as well as collaborative and engaging experiences for their customers and employees, we believe they are becoming increasingly reliant on Cisco technologies to help them with their transformation and resiliency.
Enterprises are increasingly seeking digital and cloud-enabled services, which is driving demand for our solutions and leading to new and expansive market opportunities for Cisco. We're in a unique leadership position to build and deliver innovative cloud-to-edge infrastructure platforms that our customers need. With the depth and breadth of our hardware, software, silicon and optics solutions, we are helping companies solve their biggest challenges. Whether it's adopting modern application architectures, shifting to hybrid work and hybrid cloud, securing their enterprise or meeting their ESG goals, Cisco is helping our customers thrive in a hybrid world.
These industry dynamics helped drive our strong fourth quarter performance. The momentum we saw in Q3 accelerated through Q4 as we delivered robust revenue growth, increased earnings, strong margins and record operating cash flow. We also generated strong double-digit growth in product deferred revenue, reflecting the success of our transformation around driving subscriptions and recurring revenues, which increases our visibility into future performance.
We are seeing IT budgets grow as companies begin to implement their critical future plans and business confidence increases. However, we do recognize that uncertainty remains around COVID-19, and we are closely monitoring the delta variant and its impact on customer spending. Right now, we are not seeing any additional impact to our business aside from the component shortage we've been facing over the past several months.
Moving to the performance of our customer segments. As I mentioned, we delivered the highest product order growth in over a decade with growth of 31% driven by strength across all of our end markets. This outstanding performance is also up over 17% from our pre-COVID Q4 levels in fiscal year 2019. We saw double-digit growth in every one of our customer segments. This strength is being driven by stronger customer investment and substantial network upgrades to help modernize and secure their environments to support the new way of working.
Specifically in our enterprise business, we had the best quarter in terms of product orders in over a decade and saw very strong order growth of 25%. We also had our third consecutive quarter of acceleration in our commercial, service provider and public sector businesses with all of these segments showing growth in excess of 20%.
In our webscale business, we saw increased momentum, delivering record performance with over 160% order growth. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, orders grew over 80% due to customers adopting products across the portfolio and early traction of our 400-gig solutions, a huge testament to the investments we have made in accelerating innovation and the differentiated value we're bringing to these customers.
From a product portfolio perspective, we also had a very balanced performance. As customers prepare for office reopenings and hybrid work, they are increasing their investment across our networking, cloud security and unified communications portfolios. In Q4, we saw double-digit revenue growth in campus switching, Catalyst 9000, high-end routing, wireless and in our Zero Trust solutions, along with strength in our security endpoint portfolio. We also had very strong adoption of our Acacia optical solutions driven by increasing customer demand for leading-edge technology to address their growing bandwidth requirements.
The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show tremendous progress as we achieved over $4 billion in software revenue in Q4, an increase of 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Within that, subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. For perspective, software represented 31% of our business in Q4. And for the full year, when combined with our services business, they represent over 53% of revenue, clearly highlighting the success of our continued business transformation.
In addition to delivering strong financial results, our innovation engine continues to accelerate. Over the last year, we introduced an impressive number of new capabilities across our entire portfolio while also doubling down on more flexible consumption models, including our core networking capabilities as a service, highlighted by the recent launch of Cisco Plus. Our new Cisco Plus solutions deliver cross-portfolio technologies to help solve our customers' biggest needs with faster time to value. Our initial Network as a Service offerings deliver hybrid cloud technologies and will later expand to a broader catalog of services built and delivered with our partner ecosystem.
Cisco Plus improves speed, agility and scale with on-demand solutions that intelligently adapt to our customers' business needs. While still early days in its launch, Cisco Plus directly aligns with our transformation goals around driving more subscription-based recurring revenue via the cloud.
Our unique strengths improvement strategy give us the confidence to move at a more accelerated pace. You will see us continue to invest in our key growth areas and technology shifts like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, 5G, WiFi 6, Edge, security and cloud-native architectures to extend our technology leadership positions. You will also see us deliver even more strategic offers to enable our customers to thrive in a cloud-first digital world. These include full stack observability to improve their digital experiences by providing visibility and insights across their entire technology stack and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE, designed to enable seamless secure access to applications anywhere their users work. Given the momentum we're seeing in our business, we have more conviction than ever that we are investing in the right areas, and we'll continue to extend our competitive advantages and drive growth.
Before I turn it over to Scott for more details on the quarter and our expectations for the next fiscal year, let me give you an update on the supply environment. While we are seeing increasing demand for our technology, we are also continuing to manage through the component shortage challenges that nearly every company is experiencing. Our world-class supply chain team, as always, is doing an incredible job navigating this complex situation by working with our global suppliers to meet customer demand as quickly as possible.
Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half.
In summary, demand for our technology is very strong, and our strategy is more relevant than ever. This allows us to deliver greater value to our customers, partners and communities as we all adapt to new ways of living and working. I am very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and with our momentum. I am confident in our strategy and investments. I feel great about the innovation we are driving in our portfolio, and I'm incredibly proud of what our teams and partners have achieved. I look forward to building on these insights with a more comprehensive deep dive on our multiyear vision and strategic growth drivers at our virtual Investor Day on September 15, and I hope you'll join us.
Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for additional detail."

Our fourth quarter reflects a strong close to our fiscal year with significant momentum across our business. We saw robust customer demand, demonstrating the third consecutive increase in product order growth and solid execution by our teams. I'll provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance.
Q4 was a very strong quarter in a very dynamic environment. We executed exceptionally well with greater than 30% product order growth year-on-year and more than 17% order growth versus our pre-COVID Q4 fiscal '19 product bookings, driven by strength across our portfolio. In fact, it was the strongest product order growth rate in over a decade. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, earnings per share, and as Chuck said earlier, record operating cash flows.
Total revenue increased to $13.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continued to recover well and build momentum with sequential revenue growth of 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 50 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84, both up 5% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Now let me turn to provide more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.7 billion, up 10%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 3%. Infrastructure platforms performed very well with revenues up 13%. All businesses saw double-digit growth with the exception of data center. Switching had strong growth driven by double-digit increase in campus switching, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. We also had solid growth in our data center switching portfolio with the Nexus 9000 products. Routing grew driven by both the service provider and enterprise markets as we saw strong adoption across our portfolio, including robust uptake of our Cisco 8000 platform.
Wireless had strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were down 1% driven by a slight decline in our collaboration portfolio. However, recurring subscription revenue within our WebEx suite grew 9% in Q4. We also saw solid growth in IoT software, AppDynamics, cloud contact center and our cloud calling platforms.
Security was up 1%. Our cloud security and Zero Trust portfolios performed well with greater than 20% growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Our Security recurring subscription revenue grew 13% in Q4 and 18% for the full fiscal year. In both applications and Security, we are seeing strong revenue growth in the strategic areas that we and our customers are investing in.
We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was $4 billion, an increase of 6%. Subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 3 points year-over-year. Software subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenue.
Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations, or RPO. At the end of Q4, RPO crossed the $30 billion mark at $30.9 billion, up 9%. RPO for product was up 18% and service was up 3%. Approximately 53% of the total RPO is short term, meaning it will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As I mentioned, we had exceptionally strong order momentum in Q4 as total product orders were up 31% with strength across the business.
Looking at our geographies. The Americas was up 34%, EMEA was up 24% and APJC was up 29%. Total emerging markets were up 25% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 37%. In our customer segments, commercial was up 41%; service provider was up 40%; enterprise returned to growth and was up 25%, while public sector was up 22%.
Non-GAAP total gross margins came in at 65.6%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 65%, up 180 basis points. And services gross margin was 67.4%, down 240 basis points, which was in line with our expectations as we do see variability from quarter-to-quarter. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity improvements from lower freight and other costs, partially offset by relatively modest price erosion.
As we discussed last quarter, we continue to manage through the supply chain constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. We've closely partnered with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half. Our #1 ranked global supply chain team continues to perform at a world-class level.
When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a positive 210 basis point impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share. From a cash perspective, operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $4.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong cash collections. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $24.5 billion, up approximately $900 million sequentially.
In terms of capital allocation, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $791 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q4, we closed 5 acquisitions: Kenna Security, Socio Labs, Slido, Sedona Systems and Involvio. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas.
Turning to the full fiscal year results. Overall, our financial results were solid in a very challenging global pandemic environment with strong operational execution. Revenue was $49.8 billion, up 1%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, up 10 basis points. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points.
From a bottom line perspective, our non-GAAP net income was flat at $13.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.22. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.5 billion, flat compared to fiscal '20. From a cap allocation perspective, we returned $9.1 billion in value to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 61% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $2.9 billion of share repurchases.
We also increased our dividend for the 10th consecutive year in fiscal 2021, reinforcing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We remain firmly committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to fuel our organic and inorganic growth initiatives as well as continuing our cap allocation strategy by returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, we had a great Q4 and a solid fiscal year with strong operational execution. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, driving more recurring revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value.
Now let me provide our forward-looking guidance. We are pleased to initiate the additional practice of providing an annual outlook to complement our regular quarterly look ahead for fiscal year 2022. The successful transformation we've been executing around driving a higher proportion of our revenues from subscriptions, recurring and deferred revenue, is affording us additional visibility into our outlook for future growth. Please note, our guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.
Our financial guidance for Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% year-on-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81.
Our financial guidance for the full year fiscal '22 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-on-year. In both our Q1 and full year outlook, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%.
Looking ahead, we're excited to host a Cisco virtual Investor Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021, which we will webcast live, and hope you can join us.
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

I would think most other companies would have said this is -- with supply chain uncertainty, this is probably not the right time to get a full year guide out. So definitely appreciate the full year guide and kind of wanted to understand what's providing that higher visibility. You mentioned the transformation. But also, how is the -- how are the orders feeding into that visibility? And what are you kind of baking in, in terms of supply chain in that full year guide overall? How much of -- kind of, what you're baking in, in terms of headwind into that full year guide from a supply chain perspective?"

As we move to more and more of a software and services and recurring revenue base, we have greater visibility. One of the stats that we just talked about is our remaining performance obligations of $30.9 billion, of which 53% of that will turn into revenue in the next 12 months.
We also have a good feel for what other renewals are going to come up and what our renewal rate is as we work our way through this. So we have a pretty good sense of a big chunk of our revenue and how it's going to grow. We also have a good view of pipeline and what that looks like ahead. And one of the things that I would say about that pipeline is it's one of the -- it's -- we've seen year-on-year growth in the pipeline for Q1 better than we've ever seen in the last several years. So we see good growth in the pipeline as well. So it's -- when you add all that up, that's what gives us the confidence to give a full year guide.
What I would say is, the -- to your question about supply chain and what's the assumption on supply chain, the way to think about that is that's the difference between the high end and the low end of the guide. We expect the supply chain to impact us through the first half of the year. And then at the low end of the guide, we think we continue to have supply chain impacts through most of the second half as well with some clear up at the end. At the high end of the guide, we think that we begin to clear up the supply chain issues, supply and demand comes back more into balance earlier in the second half.
So that's the -- that's why we gave the full year guide. I think -- certainly, we have the confidence with the visibility we have and what's baked into that based on some of the uncertainties still out there with the supply chain."

And there was really favorable product mix built into that, some of that being driven by a good quarter for software, as you heard on the call earlier.
Looking ahead, we've taken several steps to ensure that we can continue to have supply and deliver products to our customers. They're in the midst of their own transformations. They're all in the midst of doing the things they have to do to adapt to a world that's not only a hybrid work world, but one with the rise of the delta variant that it's added complexity. It's not a, ""Hey, the world is going to go back to normal at some point. It's -- I need to continue to have this kind of flexibility ahead."" We're trying to support that, and at the same time, the supply and demand imbalances and some of the key components around semiconductors and memory and some of the same things you hear from others of our peers. That turns into higher component costs as we buy from those suppliers.
We are also to ensure even greater supply going to brokers to get additional supply from -- versus what we can get directly from our suppliers, and in some cases, qualifying second sources where we have to. Each of those obviously drives cost, and it takes a while for those costs. We've been in that process through Q4, and we'll be in it through Q1. It takes a while for those costs to flow through our standard costing system and show up in the cost of goods sold.
There's a little bit of unfavorable product mix headwind as well in Q1 as we have a good sense of the products that don't have those same impacts that we will be able to ship that are sitting in backlog. So that's what's driving that sequential change. As you know, we did put in place a price increase. Very selective, very targeted, only on the products where we were seeing the higher component costs. That went into effect August 7. But we always honor quotes that are out there for 30 days beyond that pricing because many of those quotes were produced before the price increase was put in.
So scroll 30 days ahead from August 7 before the first orders come in with those higher prices, and then it takes a while for those orders to come in, get built and shipped back out to customers and for us to realize the benefit of that on the top line. So think of those price increases as being something that we'll feel more of the benefit of in Q2 and Q3 versus what we see in Q1."

I think there's a couple of things that I would say. We obviously can't calculate that directly. We've looked at several indicators, our pipeline analysis, channel orderings, our sales force opportunity movement, order cancellation rates, future pipeline build. And we don't see any signs of ordering well ahead of needs other than lining up with what our lead times are.
And we have customers that are large carriers, large telcos, cloud players, who have 12-, 18- to 24-month capacity plans. And so they look at our lead times, and they are going to order into that based on what they have. But we would not say there was a significant amount of pull-ahead other than dealing with the lead times.
And the other thing that I would just highlight is that, Scott pointed out earlier, after the real strong order growth we saw in Q4, we're sitting with the best start from a forecast pipeline perspective that we've had in several years. So that would lead us to believe that this is a trend that we should see continuing for a little while."

So on the applications front, we expected that you guys might want to ask about that. And there's a couple of things to keep in mind. In both applications and Security, the order rates were certainly higher than the revenue rates. So that's the first thing I would tell you. The recurring subscription portions within each of those businesses were also very positive. As Scott said, in Security, within -- I mean, in collaboration within applications, WebEx suite, the recurring subscriptions within WebEx suite revenue was up 9% in Q4, 16% for the year. We had solid growth in IoT, AppD, cloud contact center and cloud calling.
What's also in there, if you will recall, is there's phones and handsets and there's some on-prem software that's associated with collaboration, and some of those were impacted by supply chain. But the future growth areas actually for us looked really good.
On the Security front, Cloud Security Zero Trust over 20%. The Security recurring subscription revenue, up 13% in Q4, up 18% for the year. So that was solid as well. And again, our next-generation firewall demand was really good. But some of the legacy products and the supply chain created a little bit of a revenue headwind there. But again, orders were stronger than the revenues. We would expect those to normalize over the next few quarters.
As we get to webscale, look, this is a -- I have to tell you that preparing for this call, I reflected over the last 5, 6 years of having this discussion. And I always said that we would start talking about webscale when it was meaningful, and I guess I can now declare it meaningful. We made multiyear investments building the Cisco 8000 with new silicon, the optics and the software. And we had phenomenal growth. And it was 160% order growth this quarter over almost 30% order growth a year ago in the same quarter.
And the customers are really adopting our entire portfolio, including the enterprise side, but over half of that business landed in their cloud infrastructure. We also see 400-gig taking off in -- and really in a meaningful way. I'll give you a couple of stats on that because someone's probably going to ask it.
In Q4, 400-gig ports, our orders were up 668% and for the year, 400-gig port orders were up 831%. We have over 400 customers that have deployed, and we've taken orders for almost 180,000 ports total. So it's really moving forward. And I think those are the things that -- and we won several franchises in the cloud webscale space. We continue to do proof of concepts. We're in validation and certification stages and others. So we always said that we missed the first transition with these players and that we wanted to be prepared for this next architectural transition, and I think our teams have done a great job putting us in a good position."

But it seems like those orders could accelerate from here, and I'm curious whether you think that's a possibility or how probable an acceleration is from that 31% growth rate.
And then I wanted to come back to this pricing commentary. And I'm curious what the durability of these prices is, what your intention would be once these component costs, these underlying costs go down. Will you flex these prices right back down again? Or do you expect this to sustain themselves a little bit longer? Just curious what you -- what your plan on pricing would be as these underlying costs change."

On linearity, just to give you the quarter, it started hot and ended hot, right? It was from day 1 to the end. So this was not like we were 5% growth till the last month and then it accelerated. It was pretty consistent throughout the entire quarter.
You mentioned the ability to accelerate. I certainly wouldn't expect 31% order growth to be the new standard. But I think that there are certainly going to be -- it just feels like our customers are dealing with -- they're coming out. They're making decisions about modernizing their infrastructure and their technology assets to deal with this new hybrid work. And I think now what they're seeing is with the delta variant, they're understanding that this may not be one move back to the office, right? This is going to -- they have to -- they're going to have to be resilient. They're going to have to build adaptability in for future because we could have the next variant 6 months from now. And I think that's what customers are thinking through right now.
The comment I'd make on pricing, and then I'll let Scott talk about the durability of them is, one thing that -- as we talk about gross margin in the quarter we just finished, the pricing element of gross margin was actually at the very low end of our normal range, which means we're holding pricing with our sales teams, which is a good sign right now. So once these things start flowing through, if that trend continues, then we would certainly see the favorable impact that we expect. Scott?"

I think, Rod, the other way that I'd ask you to think about the price increases we just announced on August 7. Those are really -- they're not motivated by driving top line as much as they're motivated by offsetting some of the cost increases we're seeing.
Now there's a lag effect, right? It's going to take time before we see those prices show up actually in our revenue stream, but they're really motivated by that. And so we'll continue to assess as we always do, if we need to make another price adjustment, up or down. We'll continue to make those assessments going forward. So it's -- don't think about them as being motivated, though, by top line drivers. It's really motivated by offsetting some of the higher costs that we're seeing.
But the other thing I would just close on this one is that we have a price increase methodology that we deploy on a regular basis for different portfolios. We just don't talk about on earnings calls every time. But we -- so this is a muscle we have that we actually use on a fairly regular basis when the conditions warrant it."

We looked at both the costs that would come in for that and what the committed delivery schedule was on those. So we have a good sense of that for a subset of our components.
There's still going to be fluctuation in some areas. Memory is a good example where there's going to continue to be fluctuation in pricing, and we'll continue to monitor that.

I think -- look, we continue to add more software capabilities across the portfolio. We continue to transition -- we've transitioned a lot of our portfolio to subscription-based even for the hardware side of the business. Most of the acquisitions that we do come in as subscription or SaaS software businesses. So we would expect to continue just this move towards it becoming a greater percentage of our portfolio.
And in the next couple of years, we think we also will see some of the renewal volume will start kicking in on top of it as well. But it's already -- the transformation has already made a big difference. Scott and I were looking at last quarter when we did guidance for Q4. Having the software revenue that came off the balance sheet significantly altered positively what we were able to guide from a revenue perspective in Q4 versus what we would have done 5 or 6 years ago. I mean it was meaningful. And so we're going to continue to invest in this capability. We're going to continue to drive software. It's a huge important part of the business. Teams have done a great job. Scott?"

If what's underneath your question is what you saw in applications, I'll go back to what we said earlier about what's happening in applications. Underneath that, you got to remember, that includes the entire Collaboration portfolio. So not just the software pieces and not just the recurring software pieces, there's hardware elements there. There's some legacy on-prem elements there. Both of those were headwinds. In the subscription software revenue piece of both applications and Security, we saw double-digit growth. We had nice growth year-on-year for the full year in both of those. So I actually feel good about where we're headed on that."

The long term is anything beyond that. So it's not surprising to see long term grow a little bit more. We're not seeing a big change in duration overall.
And maybe I'll go ahead and hit the last one, Chuck, and then leave the D&A question for you. As we look at the renewal rates and the actions we have to take, our renewal base is obviously growing and becoming much more important to us ahead. And obviously, renewals are dependent on adoption. So we put in place very specific processes to understand where our customers are on usage and on adoption. And you got to -- if you don't drive the adoption, you don't get the renewal. And so we're attacking it at that level. I think the team has done a nice job getting some headlights on that, some early warning and getting ahead of ensuring that we actually get the adoption we need."

As it relates to D&A, the -- we've had sort of a handful in the first half of this year of those renewals that will come through. There's a little bit more in the second half. And in fiscal '23 is where it's actually a much more meaningful number. And our teams have been working on the underlying processes, the metrics, the process, the systems, measurements. And the engineering teams have been working really hard on continuing to evolve the offer to ensure that there's enough innovation going forward that will optimize our opportunity on the renewal side of it.

We look forward to spending time with you today. 
First, I'd like to thank those of you who joined us for our Investor Day in September, where we showcased the strong foundation we've built for helping to generate long-term profitable growth. We're striving to maximize value creation through our focus on higher concentrations of software and subscription-based revenue streams. This gives us and you greater visibility and predictability into our future growth. 
We also highlighted our unique portfolio of market-leading franchises, which are well positioned to drive growth in highly attractive existing and expansion markets. Lastly, we showcased the depth of our leadership team and outlined the next phase of our strategy. 
Moving into fiscal year '22. We are off to a great start with robust order growth of 33% and continued strong demand across our portfolio. Our teams are executing well, our ARR grew double digits, and our momentum is accelerating, driven by digital transformation and cloud. Even with the ongoing supply-constrained environment, we are solidly on track to deliver against our long-term financial targets by investing for growth while delivering breakthrough innovation. 
The past 18 to 24 months have no doubt accelerated the digital revolution we are all experiencing as technology is permanently changing nearly every aspect of our lives. The technology we build is powering the modern secure infrastructure that sits at the heart of this revolution and Cisco is well positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. 
Our customers want digital and cloud-enabled solutions that allow them to move with greater speed, agility and efficiency. We're already seeing the positive impact of our investments to drive accelerated innovation across high-growth areas, including hybrid cloud, web scale, cloud security, 5G, WiFi 6, 400 gig and full stack observability. 
A key trend in front of us is enabling employees to work from anywhere, and this is much broader than meetings. It's about the holistic capabilities to support a highly distributed workforce that require new infrastructure architectures, observability and security. Many companies are in the process of defining their hybrid work strategy, which will be based on the technology we build across our networking, security and collaboration portfolios. We are also leading the way with new innovation, including our recently expanded WebEx portfolio, purpose-built for inclusive experiences across hybrid work, work spaces and events. 
Now I'd like to discuss our Q1 performance. Building on the momentum from last quarter, I'm proud to say we achieved another strong quarter in line with our expectations despite supply constraints, which I will discuss shortly. We delivered balanced revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth with healthy margins driven by continued economic recovery, strong execution and exceptional demand for our products. We also generated a strong quarter of double-digit growth in ARR and RPO, reflecting the ongoing success of our transformation. We have continued to operate successfully in a very dynamic environment, staying nimble in order to navigate the evolving conditions related to the Delta variant and global component shortages. 
Now let me discuss the performance of our customer market segments. Q1 marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating order momentum with broad-based strength across our business. Every geographic region in 3 of the 4 customer markets grew product orders at 30% or higher. We again experienced the strongest demand in over a decade as our customers increase their investments in digital transformation. 
In our enterprise and commercial businesses, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth. We also saw solid growth in public sector. Our Service Provider segment delivered its highest level of order growth in over 5 years with 66% growth as these customers address their growing bandwidth requirements. 
In our web scale business, our robust momentum continues. Our performance was once again a record with order growth of over 200%. That's 120% growth on a trailing 4-quarter basis. We are very pleased with the early traction of our 400-gig solutions, Cisco 8000 platform, Silicon One portfolio and rapid growth in our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products. It's clear we are expanding our footprint as our cloud growth rate is outpacing our peers. 
We continue to invest in web scale innovations with differentiated customer value, launching this quarter the latest member of the Silicon One family, the 19.2 terabit P100 routing device, the 11th chip in the Silicon One family. In addition, Acacia marked a major milestone by unveiling the industry's first pluggable module capable of delivering 1.2 terabit capacity on a single wavelength. 
Our product revenue was up nearly $1 billion year-over-year, demonstrating the competitive advantages of our scale and reach as well as our ongoing momentum. We saw broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. In addition, we continue to see steady progress in our business model transition. Our focus on subscriptions allows us to deliver innovation faster to our customers while providing more predictability and visibility, leading to a more durable growth business over the long term. 
We delivered software revenue of $3.7 billion, with 80% sold as a subscription. Subscription revenue increased by 4% to nearly $5.5 billion, while ARR increased by 10% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. We saw strong product ARR growth of 21% and product RPO grew 18%, reflecting our rapid transformation to a software-led business model. 
While our revenue growth was solid, it was impacted by the supply constraints which are affecting our technology peers and nearly every other industry. Our product orders were extremely strong and balanced across our markets, but we are constrained in what we can build and ship to our customers. 
We have a world-class supply chain team that works to deliver an incredibly high volume of products given our scale and reach. They continue to execute well in this highly fluid and complex environment. We have been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans. We are doing this at a breadth and scale that is significantly greater than most in our industry. 
Of course, all of these steps, while necessary to maximize our production and delivery to customers, add to our cost structure. When combined with cost increases we are seeing from many of our suppliers, these factors are putting pressure on our gross margins. While we thoughtfully raised prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters. Our focus remains on our customers to ensure we provide them with the products they need as quickly as possible. 
Now I'd like to share the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. In September, we committed to being net zero greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025 and net zero for all emissions, including Scope 3 by 2040. We believe we will do this by focusing on 4 areas: building more efficient products, accelerating the use of renewable energy, embracing hybrid work and investing in innovative carbon removal solutions. We believe we have a deep responsibility to use our industry leadership position and our innovation to make the world a better place and look forward to continuing to do our part. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. Our teams are executing on our strategy while navigating a challenging operating environment, and this is reflected in our Q1 results. Demand remains strong. And with the momentum in our business transformation, we have set the stage for another year of accelerated growth in fiscal 2022. 
Our performance is a testament to the power of our differentiated innovation, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to excellence. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. We will continue to strategically invest across our portfolio to drive growth and innovation, strengthen our competitive advantage and position Cisco for success. And I continue to have great confidence in our future. 
I'll now turn it over to Scott."

We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1 performance. We executed well, resulting in another quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio and demonstrating continued robust demand for our products and services. We also had strong results across revenue, net income and earnings per share. 
Total revenue increased to $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to execute well in this highly dynamic environment, but ongoing component supply constraints are impacting our ability to convert historically high demand into revenue as quickly as we'd like. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.3%, up 60 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, both up 8% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS coming in above the high end of our guidance range. 
Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.5 billion, up 11%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Secure Agile Networks performed very well, with revenues up 10%. Switching had strong growth, driven by a double-digit increase in campus switching led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. The enterprise routing portfolio had high single-digit growth driven by Edge and SD-WAN. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. 
We had growth in data center switching and compute revenue declined slightly. Hybrid work was down 7% overall, driven by revenue decreases in our perpetual calling, meetings and contact center offerings. These were partially offset by the ramp of communication platform as a service, and growth in our collaboration devices. Within hybrid work, our SaaS revenue continues to show growth of high single digits, driven by cloud calling and contact center. 
End-to-end security was up 4%, driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions also offset by declines in our perpetual and hardware offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well, with double-digit growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo offerings. We also saw good growth in unified threat management. Here again, our subscription portfolio performed well, growing 15%, driven by our cloud security and Zero Trust platforms. 
Internet for the future was up 46%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers. We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in cloud, growth in core with strength in both Cisco 8000 and NCS 5500 and growth in edge with the ASR 9000. We also saw benefits from our acquisition of Acacia. 
Optimized application experiences was up 18%, driven by both ThousandEyes, which grew triple digits and Intersight, which grew in the strong double digits. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew double digits as its revenue shifted to a greater proportion from its cloud-delivered platform. 
Our transformation metrics we covered at Investor Day were solid as we continue to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, with the product portion up 3%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4% with the product portion increasing at 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. 
ARR, or annualized recurring revenue was $21.6 billion, an increase of 10% with strong product ARR growth of 21%. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.1 billion, up 10%. Product RPO increased 18% and short-term RPO grew 9% to $15.9 billion. As you can see, we continue to make significant progress on the transformation to increase software and subscriptions. 
We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q1, with total product orders up 33%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 31%. EMEA was up 36% and APJC was up 39%. Total emerging markets were up 37% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 47%. In our customer markets, service provider was up 66%, commercial was up 46% and enterprise was up 30% and public sector was up 10%. As you can see, it was broad strength across the business. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margins came in at 64.5%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 63.8%, down 150 basis points and service gross margin was 66.5%, down 60 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by higher costs from freight, expedite and increased component costs related to the supply constraints. 
Pricing impact was relatively moderate and consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by positive product mix. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher costs for many of these components. We are partnering closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Our supply chain team continues to perform well with this very complex situation. We believe we're taking the right strategic actions with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure we meet customer demand despite the potential risk associated with increasing our inventory and purchase commitments. 
When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results, there was an approximate 250 basis point positive impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year driven by higher supply-related payments and timing of other payments and collections. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion, down approximately $1.2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by $2 billion in scheduled repayments of our long-term debt. 
In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $256 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed the acquisition of Epsagon and announced our intent to acquire replex. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. 
To summarize, we had a strong Q1 and a complex supply-constrained environment. We executed well with strong top line revenue and earnings per share as we delivered balanced profitable growth. We continue to make great progress on our business model shift and are continuing to make the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. 
Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q2, which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range from 32.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82.  
There's no change to our full year fiscal '22 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. 
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

And then just a second question is it looks like public sector, up 10% year-on-year. I think some of your peers have reported some very strong end market public sector trends, some of them coming from the U.S. federal government. Could you just give us an update on what's going on there? Were there things that did not get past the finish line?

I'll start, Sami, on the price increase question, and then -- and I'll let Chuck weigh in on public sector. The price increase that we put in place really just became effective at the 1st of September. Most of what we shipped during the quarter either came out of RPO, right? So prior sales that are sitting on the balance sheet and then accreted into our revenue, and we talked about having $15.9 billion now of current RPO. So none of that, of course, would have had the price increase built into it. 
And a lot of the hardware shipments came out of backlog during the quarter. And again, none of those would have included that price increase. And I think even looking ahead, Sami, you got to think about that price increase having a bigger effect toward the second half of the year than it will have during -- certainly during Q2. I think of that as more of a late Q3, Q4 by the time those price increases turn into orders. Those orders work their way through the backlog get built and then delivered to customers."

And there's a little impact in there, Ittai, from supply chain on our hardware-based network firewall business.

Product RPO, product remaining performance obligations, up 18% and product ARR growing 21%.

I would say that -- a quick comment on -- before I hand it to Scott on the second part. I think the -- we did talk about the first half of last quarter, we did see some deterioration in the -- in our supply chain component availability. And then we saw it stabilize in the second half.

And then you have to overlay on that the snarled logistics position that we find ourselves in really across all lanes, whether it's ocean or air or trucking. The layering on of both of those is what makes answering that question is so complex. 
As Chuck said, we did see stabilization and some of the signs of stabilization that we saw during the quarter. We saw better visibility to components from some of our suppliers in terms of when they could deliver in the quantities. We saw fewer decommits come in during the quarter, another sign of stabilization. And then memory costs are actually beginning -- just beginning, but beginning to decline a bit, meaning that market is coming more into balance as well. So we're seeing signs of stabilization. 
As we look ahead and look at Q2 guide and what that means for the full year, obviously, we're in a very strong position on RPO that's going to accrete into the revenue stream in the second half of the year. And we've got a backlog that provides us great visibility into exactly what we need to build. So we can be a lot more targeted in what we need to go chase down to get that.

I will tell you this. We clearly know, call it pull ahead, call it ordering against the reality of our lead times, but we clearly know that customers are ordering further out than they would normally. The large carriers, the cloud providers where we had 200% growth, I mean these are customers we're doing deep forecasting and planning with. So we know that they're ordering 2, 3, 4 quarters out to make sure that they have this stuff in the pipeline and in the right sequence for delivery. 
So we get that visibility. But then you look at a segment like commercial that grew 46%, and you tend not to see a lot -- you'll see a little bit. Some of the commercial customers are looking out. But many of them are ordering when they fill the need. And so it's a really hard question to answer. On your second one, I think the only way I can answer that is to say, it actually is part of the first answer, too. 
What we're watching real closely is we're watching cancellations, which we have not seen any change in our historic cancellation rates. In fact, it's lower. We watch pipeline growth. And I can tell you that our pipeline growth is probably as strong as it's ever been, even beyond the quarter we just finished. So we see continued demand. And I think that from that perspective, the way we think about it is our very large customers, largest enterprises, cloud players, large carriers, those we know we have visibility. There's an aspect of ordering ahead from other customers, but I think the vast majority below that probably aren't."

So it's -- so I think your point of -- at some point in the future, you would expect order rate and revenue, would they have to get in line? I think over a time period, yes, not necessarily in 1 quarter versus the other because of the transition in the business model because if you look at the RPO that we're pulling off the balance sheet every quarter, I go back and look at what that was would have been 6 years ago, it wouldn't have been anywhere remotely close to what we are.

The guide that we gave for the quarter at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1. And it's the exact same combination of effects. There's some some competing factors inside there, right, on the -- within the gross margin, we've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on, more toward the second half and really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4, we'll start to see -- that will be a tailwind to gross margin. 
We've got the cost increases. And within that, it's not just component cost increases, which are a part of it. it's also logistics cost increases as we've talked about, and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. That's -- it's strictly tied to the various elements of cost within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. 
On the cap allocation, which I think was your second question, our capital allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day, which is, first and foremost, to support the growth of the business. Beyond that to obviously continue to protect the dividend through time, offset dilution of the -- our equity plans, which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed. And then longer term, return excess cash in the most tax-efficient way we can to our investors. 
So we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter, it's a valuation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into, M&A has been a part of our strategy as a company over time. We talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. Epsagon, which closed during the quarter and replex, which we announced during the quarter, it's not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build/buy type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation.

I talked earlier about the complexity of answering that question, but I'll just repeat what we said earlier in the year that if the supply chain or the supply -- the component supply constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half, we'll be toward the high end. If it's later in the second half, we'll be toward the low end. 
So the real difficult question to answer is where in the second half, do we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter as the quarter went on. I mentioned earlier, we saw signs of stabilization. And we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO. That's going to accrete into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog. So we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So we're confident in the full year, the question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end."

We look forward to spending time with you today. 
First, I'd like to thank those of you who joined us for our Investor Day in September, where we showcased the strong foundation we've built for helping to generate long-term profitable growth. We're striving to maximize value creation through our focus on higher concentrations of software and subscription-based revenue streams. This gives us and you greater visibility and predictability into our future growth. We also highlighted our unique portfolio of market-leading franchises, which are well positioned to drive growth in highly attractive existing and expansion markets. Lastly, we showcased the depth of our leadership team and outlined the next phase of our strategy. 
Moving into fiscal year '22. We are off to a great start with robust order growth of 33% and continued strong demand across our portfolio. Our teams are executing well, our ARR grew double digits, and our momentum is accelerating, driven by digital transformation and cloud. Even with the ongoing supply-constrained environment, we are solidly on track to deliver against our long-term financial targets by investing for growth while delivering breakthrough innovation. 
The past 18 to 24 months have no doubt accelerated the digital revolution we are all experiencing as technology is permanently changing nearly every aspect of our lives. The technology we build is powering the modern secure infrastructure that sits at the heart of this revolution, and Cisco is well positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. 
Our customers want digital and cloud-enabled solutions that allow them to move with greater speed, agility and efficiency. We're already seeing the positive impact of our investments to drive accelerated innovation across high-growth areas, including hybrid cloud, web scale, cloud security, 5G, WiFi 6, 400 gig and full stack observability. 
A key trend in front of us is enabling employees to work from anywhere, and this is much broader than meetings. It's about the holistic capabilities to support a highly distributed workforce that require new infrastructure architectures, observability and security. Many companies are in the process of defining their hybrid work strategy, which will be based on the technology we build across our networking, security and collaboration portfolios. We are also leading the way with new innovation, including our recently expanded WebEx portfolio, purpose-built for inclusive experiences across hybrid work, work spaces and events. 
Now I'd like to discuss our Q1 performance. Building on the momentum from last quarter, I'm proud to say we achieved another strong quarter in line with our expectations despite supply constraints, which I will discuss shortly. We delivered balanced revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth with healthy margins driven by continued economic recovery, strong execution and exceptional demand for our products. We also generated a strong quarter of double-digit growth in ARR and RPO, reflecting the ongoing success of our transformation. We have continued to operate successfully in a very dynamic environment, staying nimble in order to navigate the evolving conditions related to the Delta variant and global component shortages. 
Now let me discuss the performance of our customer market segments. Q1 marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating order momentum with broad-based strength across our business. Every geographic region in 3 of the 4 customer markets grew product orders at 30% or higher. We again experienced the strongest demand in over a decade as our customers increase their investments in digital transformation. 
In our enterprise and commercial businesses, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth. We also saw solid growth in public sector. Our service provider segment delivered its highest level of order growth in over 5 years with 66% growth as these customers address their growing bandwidth requirements. 
In our web scale business, our robust momentum continues. Our performance was once again a record with order growth of over 200%. That's 120% growth on a trailing 4-quarter basis. We are very pleased with the early traction of our 400-gig solutions, Cisco 8000 platform, Silicon One portfolio and rapid growth in our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products. It's clear we are expanding our footprint as our cloud growth rate is outpacing our peers. 
We continue to invest in web scale innovations with differentiated customer value, launching this quarter the latest member of the Silicon One family, the 19.2 terabit P100 routing device, the 11th chip in the Silicon One family. In addition, Acacia marked a major milestone by unveiling the industry's first pluggable module capable of delivering 1.2 terabit capacity on a single wavelength. 
Our product revenue was up nearly $1 billion year-over-year, demonstrating the competitive advantages of our scale and reach as well as our ongoing momentum. We saw broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. In addition, we continue to see steady progress in our business model transition. Our focus on subscriptions allows us to deliver innovation faster to our customers while providing more predictability and visibility, leading to a more durable growth business over the long term. 
We delivered software revenue of $3.7 billion, with 80% sold as a subscription. Subscription revenue increased by 4% to nearly $5.5 billion, while ARR increased by 10% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. We saw strong product ARR growth of 21% and product RPO grew 18%, reflecting our rapid transformation to a software-led business model. 
While our revenue growth was solid, it was impacted by the supply constraints which are affecting our technology peers and nearly every other industry. Our product orders were extremely strong and balanced across our markets, but we are constrained in what we can build and ship to our customers. 
We have a world-class supply chain team that works to deliver an incredibly high volume of products given our scale and reach. They continue to execute well in this highly fluid and complex environment. We have been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible, and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans. We are doing this at a breadth and scale that is significantly greater than most in our industry. 
Of course, all of these steps, while necessary to maximize our production and delivery to customers, add to our cost structure. When combined with cost increases we are seeing from many of our suppliers, these factors are putting pressure on our gross margins. While we thoughtfully raised prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters. Our focus remains on our customers to ensure we provide them with the products they need as quickly as possible. 
Now I'd like to share the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. In September, we committed to being net zero greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025, and net zero for all emissions, including Scope 3 by 2040. We believe we will do this by focusing on 4 areas: building more efficient products, accelerating the use of renewable energy, embracing hybrid work and investing in innovative carbon removal solutions. We believe we have a deep responsibility to use our industry leadership position and our innovation to make the world a better place and look forward to continuing to do our part. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. Our teams are executing on our strategy while navigating a challenging operating environment, and this is reflected in our Q1 results. Demand remains strong. And with the momentum in our business transformation, we have set the stage for another year of accelerated growth in fiscal 2022. 
Our performance is a testament to the power of our differentiated innovation, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to excellence. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. We will continue to strategically invest across our portfolio to drive growth and innovation, strengthen our competitive advantage and position Cisco for success. And I continue to have great confidence in our future. 
I'll now turn it over to Scott."

We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1 performance. We executed well, resulting in another quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio and demonstrating continued robust demand for our products and services. We also had strong results across revenue, net income and earnings per share. 
Total revenue increased to $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to execute well in this highly dynamic environment, but ongoing component supply constraints are impacting our ability to convert historically high demand into revenue as quickly as we'd like. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.3%, up 60 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, both up 8% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS coming in above the high end of our guidance range. 
Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.5 billion, up 11%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Secure Agile Networks performed very well, with revenues up 10%. Switching had strong growth, driven by a double-digit increase in campus switching led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. The enterprise routing portfolio had high single-digit growth driven by Edge and SD-WAN. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We had growth in data center switching and compute revenue declined slightly. 
Hybrid work was down 7% overall, driven by revenue decreases in our perpetual calling, meetings and contact center offerings. These were partially offset by the ramp of communication platform-as-a-service, and growth in our collaboration devices. Within hybrid work, our SaaS revenue continues to show growth of high single digits, driven by cloud calling and contact center. 
End-to-end security was up 4%, driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions, also offset by declines in our perpetual and hardware offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well, with double-digit growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo offerings. We also saw good growth in unified threat management. Here again, our subscription portfolio performed well, growing 15%, driven by our cloud security and Zero Trust platforms. 
Internet for the future was up 46%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers. We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in cloud, growth in core with strength in both Cisco 8000 and NCS 5500, and growth in edge with the ASR 9000. We also saw benefits from our acquisition of Acacia. 
Optimized application experiences was up 18%, driven by both ThousandEyes, which grew triple digits and Intersight, which grew in the strong double digits. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew double digits as its revenue shifted to a greater proportion from its cloud-delivered platform. 
Our transformation metrics we covered at Investor Day were solid as we continue to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, with the product portion up 3%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4%, with the product portion increasing at 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. 
ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, was $21.6 billion, an increase of 10%, with strong product ARR growth of 21%. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.1 billion, up 10%. Product RPO increased 18% and short-term RPO grew 9% to $15.9 billion. As you can see, we continue to make significant progress on the transformation to increase software and subscriptions. 
We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q1, with total product orders up 33%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 31%. EMEA was up 36% and APJC was up 39%. Total emerging markets were up 37% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 47%. In our customer markets, service provider was up 66%, commercial was up 46% and enterprise was up 30% and public sector was up 10%. As you can see, it was broad strength across the business. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margins came in at 64.5%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 63.8%, down 150 basis points and service gross margin was 66.5%, down 60 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by higher costs from freight, expedite and increased component costs related to the supply constraints. 
Pricing impact was relatively moderate and consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by positive product mix. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher costs for many of these components. We are partnering closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Our supply chain team continues to perform well with this very complex situation. We believe we're taking the right strategic actions with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure we meet customer demand despite the potential risk associated with increasing our inventory and purchase commitments. 
When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results, there was an approximate 250-basis-point positive impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, driven by higher supply-related payments and timing of other payments and collections. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion, down approximately $1.2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by $2 billion in scheduled repayments of our long-term debt. 
In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $256 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed the acquisition of Epsagon and announced our intent to acquire Replex. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. 
To summarize, we had a strong Q1 and a complex supply-constrained environment. We executed well with strong top line revenue and earnings per share as we delivered balanced profitable growth. We continue to make great progress on our business model shift and are continuing to make the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. 
Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q2, which is as follows: We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range from 32.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82.  
There's no change to our full year fiscal '22 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year.

Or were there prior contracts in place that honored prior price sheets for some of your key customers? Could you give us maybe an idea on mix and maybe a straightforward answer on that side? 
And then just a second question is it looks like public sector, up 10% year-on-year. I think some of your peers have reported some very strong end market public sector trends, some of them coming from the U.S. federal government. Could you just give us an update on what's going on there? Were there things that did not get past the finish line? Or any holdups or any kind of key things you're seeing that's met with some resistance on deploying more public sector or federal government activity?"

I'll start, Sami, on the price increase question, and then -- and I'll let Chuck weigh in on public sector. The price increase that we put in place really just became effective at the 1st of September. Most of what we shipped during the quarter either came out of RPO, right? So prior sales that are sitting on the balance sheet and then accreted into our revenue, and we talked about having $15.9 billion now of current RPO. So none of that, of course, would have had the price increase built into it. 
And a lot of the hardware shipments came out of backlog during the quarter. And again, none of those would have included that price increase. And I think even looking ahead, Sami, you got to think about that price increase having a bigger effect toward the second half of the year than it will have during -- certainly during Q2. I think of that as more of a late Q3, Q4. By the time those price increases turn into orders, those orders work their way through the backlog, get built and then delivered to customers."

I would say that -- a quick comment on -- before I hand it to Scott on the second part. I think the -- we did talk about the first half of last quarter, we did see some deterioration in the -- in our supply chain component availability. And then we saw it stabilize in the second half.

And then you have to overlay on that the snarled logistics position that we find ourselves in really across all lanes, whether it's ocean or air or trucking. The layering on of both of those is what makes answering that question is so complex. 
As Chuck said, we did see stabilization and some of the signs of stabilization that we saw during the quarter. We saw better visibility to components from some of our suppliers in terms of when they could deliver in the quantities. We saw fewer decommits come in during the quarter, another sign of stabilization. And then memory costs are actually beginning -- just beginning, but beginning to decline a bit, meaning that market is coming more into balance as well. So we're seeing signs of stabilization. 
As we look ahead and look at Q2 guide and what that means for the full year, obviously, we're in a very strong position on RPO that's going to accrete into the revenue stream in the second half of the year. And we've got a backlog that provides us great visibility into exactly what we need to build. So we can be a lot more targeted in what we need to go chase down to get that.

I will tell you this. We clearly know -- call it pull ahead, call it ordering against the reality of our lead times, but we clearly know that customers are ordering further out than they would normally. The large carriers, the cloud providers, where we had 200% growth, I mean, these are customers we're doing deep forecasting and planning with. So we know that they're ordering 2, 3, 4 quarters out to make sure that they have this stuff in the pipeline and in the right sequence for delivery. So we get that visibility. 
But then you look at a segment like commercial that grew 46%, and you tend not to see a lot -- you'll see a little bit. Some of the commercial customers are looking out. But many of them are ordering when they feel the need. And so it's a really hard question to answer. 
On your second one, I think the only way I can answer that is to say -- it actually is part of the first answer, too. What we're watching real closely is we're watching cancellations, which we have not seen any change in our historic cancellation rates. In fact, it's lower. We watch pipeline growth. And I can tell you that our pipeline growth is probably as strong as it's ever been, even beyond the quarter we just finished. So we see continued demand. And I think that from that perspective, the way we think about it is our very large customers, largest enterprises, cloud players, large carriers, those we know we have visibility. There's an aspect of ordering ahead from other customers, but I think the vast majority below that probably aren't."

Because if you look at the RPO that we're pulling off the balance sheet every quarter, I go back and look at what that was -- would have been 6 years ago, it would have been anywhere remotely close to what we are.

The guide that we gave for the quarter at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1. And it's the exact same combination of effects. There's some  competing factors inside there, right, on the -- within the gross margin. We've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on, more toward the second half. And really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4, we'll start to see -- that will be a tailwind to gross margin. 
We've got the cost increases. And within that, it's not just component cost increases, which are a part of it. It's also logistics cost increases as we talked about, and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. That's -- it's strictly tied to the various elements of cost within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. 
On the cap allocation, which I think was your second question, our cap allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day, which is, first and foremost, to support the growth of the business. Beyond that to obviously continue to protect the dividend through time, offset dilution of the -- our equity plans, which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed. And then longer term, return excess cash in the most tax-efficient way we can to our investors. 
So we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter, it's a valuation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into, M&A has been a part of our strategy as a company over time. We talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. Epsagon, which closed during the quarter and Replex, which we announced during the quarter, is not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build/buy type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation.

And the second question is, even if I look at the hardware side on these 2 areas, there was a major increase year-over-year in the growth rate, meaning from minus 16 to plus 10, for example, in secure and agile networks, even higher on the optical side.

I think to your second question, it's so hard. I talked earlier about the complexity of answering that question, but I'll just repeat what we said earlier in the year that if the supply chain or the supply -- the component supply constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half, we'll be toward the high end. If it's later in the second half, we'll be toward the low end. 
So the real difficult question to answer is where in the second half, do we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter as the quarter went on. I mentioned earlier, we saw signs of stabilization. And we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO that's going to accrete into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog. So we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So we're confident in the full year. The question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end."

We look forward to spending time with you today. 
First, I'd like to thank those of you who joined us for our Investor Day in September, where we showcased the strong foundation we've built for helping to generate long-term profitable growth. We're striving to maximize value creation through our focus on higher concentrations of software and subscription-based revenue streams. This gives us and you greater visibility and predictability into our future growth. We also highlighted our unique portfolio of market-leading franchises, which are well positioned to drive growth in highly attractive existing and expansion markets. Lastly, we showcased the depth of our leadership team and outlined the next phase of our strategy. 
Moving into fiscal year '22. We are off to a great start with robust order growth of 33% and continued strong demand across our portfolio. Our teams are executing well, our ARR grew double digits, and our momentum is accelerating, driven by digital transformation and cloud. Even with the ongoing supply-constrained environment, we are solidly on track to deliver against our long-term financial targets by investing for growth while delivering breakthrough innovation. 
The past 18 to 24 months have no doubt accelerated the digital revolution we are all experiencing as technology is permanently changing nearly every aspect of our lives. The technology we build is powering the modern secure infrastructure that sits at the heart of this revolution, and Cisco is well positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. 
Our customers want digital and cloud-enabled solutions that allow them to move with greater speed, agility and efficiency. We're already seeing the positive impact of our investments to drive accelerated innovation across high-growth areas, including hybrid cloud, web scale, cloud security, 5G, WiFi 6, 400 gig and full stack observability. 
A key trend in front of us is enabling employees to work from anywhere, and this is much broader than meetings. It's about the holistic capabilities to support a highly distributed workforce that require new infrastructure architectures, observability and security. Many companies are in the process of defining their hybrid work strategy, which will be based on the technology we build across our networking, security and collaboration portfolios. We are also leading the way with new innovation, including our recently expanded WebEx portfolio, purpose-built for inclusive experiences across hybrid work, workspaces and events. 
Now I'd like to discuss our Q1 performance. Building on the momentum from last quarter, I'm proud to say we achieved another strong quarter in line with our expectations despite supply constraints, which I will discuss shortly. We delivered balanced revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth with healthy margins driven by continued economic recovery, strong execution and exceptional demand for our products. We also generated a strong quarter of double-digit growth in ARR and RPO, reflecting the ongoing success of our transformation. We have continued to operate successfully in a very dynamic environment, staying nimble in order to navigate the evolving conditions related to the Delta variant and global component shortages. 
Now let me discuss the performance of our customer market segments. Q1 marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating order momentum with broad-based strength across our business. Every geographic region in 3 of the 4 customer markets grew product orders at 30% or higher. We again experienced the strongest demand in over a decade as our customers increase their investments in digital transformation. 
In our enterprise and commercial businesses, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth. We also saw solid growth in public sector. Our service provider segment delivered its highest level of order growth in over 5 years with 66% growth as these customers address their growing bandwidth requirements. 
In our web scale business, our robust momentum continues. Our performance was once again a record with order growth of over 200%. That's 120% growth on a trailing 4-quarter basis. We are very pleased with the early traction of our 400-gig solutions, Cisco 8000 platform, Silicon One portfolio and rapid growth in our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products. It's clear we are expanding our footprint as our cloud growth rate is outpacing our peers. 
We continue to invest in web scale innovations with differentiated customer value, launching this quarter the latest member of the Silicon One family, the 19.2 terabit P100 routing device, the 11th chip in the Silicon One family. In addition, Acacia marked a major milestone by unveiling the industry's first pluggable module capable of delivering 1.2 terabit capacity on a single wavelength. 
Our product revenue was up nearly $1 billion year-over-year, demonstrating the competitive advantages of our scale and reach as well as our ongoing momentum. We saw broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. In addition, we continue to see steady progress in our business model transition. Our focus on subscriptions allows us to deliver innovation faster to our customers while providing more predictability and visibility, leading to a more durable growth business over the long term. 
We delivered software revenue of $3.7 billion, with 80% sold as a subscription. Subscription revenue increased by 4% to nearly $5.5 billion, while ARR increased by 10% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. We saw strong product ARR growth of 21% and product RPO grew 18%, reflecting our rapid transformation to a software-led business model. 
While our revenue growth was solid, it was impacted by the supply constraints which are affecting our technology peers and nearly every other industry. Our product orders were extremely strong and balanced across our markets, but we are constrained in what we can build and ship to our customers. 
We have a world-class supply chain team that works to deliver an incredibly high volume of products given our scale and reach. They continue to execute well in this highly fluid and complex environment. We have been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible, and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans. We are doing this at a breadth and scale that is significantly greater than most in our industry. 
Of course, all of these steps, while necessary to maximize our production and delivery to customers, add to our cost structure. When combined with cost increases we are seeing from many of our suppliers, these factors are putting pressure on our gross margins. While we thoughtfully raised prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters. Our focus remains on our customers to ensure we provide them with the products they need as quickly as possible. 
Now I'd like to share the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. In September, we committed to being net zero greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025, and net zero for all emissions, including Scope 3 by 2040. We believe we will do this by focusing on 4 areas: building more efficient products, accelerating the use of renewable energy, embracing hybrid work and investing in innovative carbon removal solutions. We believe we have a deep responsibility to use our industry leadership position and our innovation to make the world a better place and look forward to continuing to do our part. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. Our teams are executing on our strategy while navigating a challenging operating environment, and this is reflected in our Q1 results. Demand remains strong. And with the momentum in our business transformation, we have set the stage for another year of accelerated growth in fiscal 2022. 
Our performance is a testament to the power of our differentiated innovation, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to excellence. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. We will continue to strategically invest across our portfolio to drive growth and innovation, strengthen our competitive advantage and position Cisco for success. And I continue to have great confidence in our future. 
I'll now turn it over to Scott."

We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1 performance. We executed well, resulting in another quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio and demonstrating continued robust demand for our products and services. We also had strong results across revenue, net income and earnings per share. 
Total revenue increased to $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to execute well in this highly dynamic environment, but ongoing component supply constraints are impacting our ability to convert historically high demand into revenue as quickly as we'd like. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.3%, up 60 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, both up 8% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS coming in above the high end of our guidance range. 
Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.5 billion, up 11%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Secure Agile Networks performed very well, with revenues up 10%. Switching had strong growth, driven by a double-digit increase in campus switching led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. The enterprise routing portfolio had high single-digit growth driven by Edge and SD-WAN. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We had growth in data center switching and compute revenue declined slightly. 
Hybrid work was down 7% overall, driven by revenue decreases in our perpetual calling, meetings and contact center offerings. These were partially offset by the ramp of communication platform-as-a-service, and growth in our collaboration devices. Within hybrid work, our SaaS revenue continues to show growth of high single digits, driven by cloud calling and contact center. 
End-to-end security was up 4%, driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions, also offset by declines in our perpetual and hardware offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well, with double-digit growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo offerings. We also saw good growth in unified threat management. Here again, our subscription portfolio performed well, growing 15%, driven by our cloud security and Zero Trust platforms. 
Internet for the future was up 46%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers. We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in cloud, growth in core with strength in both Cisco 8000 and NCS 5500, and growth in edge with the ASR 9000. We also saw benefits from our acquisition of Acacia. 
Optimized application experiences was up 18%, driven by both ThousandEyes, which grew triple digits and Intersight, which grew in the strong double digits. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew double digits as its revenue shifted to a greater proportion from its cloud-delivered platform. 
Our transformation metrics we covered at Investor Day were solid as we continue to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, with the product portion up 3%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4%, with the product portion increasing at 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. 
ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, was $21.6 billion, an increase of 10%, with strong product ARR growth of 21%. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.1 billion, up 10%. Product RPO increased 18% and short-term RPO grew 9% to $15.9 billion. As you can see, we continue to make significant progress on the transformation to increase software and subscriptions. 
We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q1, with total product orders up 33%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 31%. EMEA was up 36% and APJC was up 39%. Total emerging markets were up 37% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 47%. In our customer markets, service provider was up 66%, commercial was up 46% and enterprise was up 30% and public sector was up 10%. As you can see, it was broad strength across the business. 
From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margins came in at 64.5%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 63.8%, down 150 basis points and service gross margin was 66.5%, down 60 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by higher costs from freight, expedite and increased component costs related to the supply constraints. 
Pricing impact was relatively moderate and consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by positive product mix. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher costs for many of these components. We are partnering closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Our supply chain team continues to perform well with this very complex situation. We believe we're taking the right strategic actions with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure we meet customer demand despite the potential risk associated with increasing our inventory and purchase commitments. 
When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results, there was an approximate 250-basis-point positive impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, driven by higher supply-related payments and timing of other payments and collections. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion, down approximately $1.2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by $2 billion in scheduled repayments of our long-term debt. 
In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $256 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed the acquisition of Epsagon and announced our intent to acquire Replex. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. 
To summarize, we had a strong Q1 and a complex supply-constrained environment. We executed well with strong top line revenue and earnings per share as we delivered balanced profitable growth. We continue to make great progress on our business model shift and are continuing to make the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. 
Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q2, which is as follows: We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range from 32.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82.  
There's no change to our full year fiscal '22 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%.

Or were there prior contracts in place that honored prior price sheets for some of your key customers? Could you give us maybe an idea on mix and maybe a straightforward answer on that side? 
And then just a second question is it looks like public sector, up 10% year-on-year. I think some of your peers have reported some very strong end market public sector trends, some of them coming from the U.S. federal government. Could you just give us an update on what's going on there? Were there things that did not get past the finish line? Or any holdups or any kind of key things you're seeing that's met with some resistance on deploying more public sector or federal government activity?"

I'll start, Sami, on the price increase question, and then -- and I'll let Chuck weigh in on public sector. The price increase that we put in place really just became effective at the 1st of September. Most of what we shipped during the quarter either came out of RPO, right? So prior sales that are sitting on the balance sheet and then accreted into our revenue, and we talked about having $15.9 billion now of current RPO. So none of that, of course, would have had the price increase built into it. 
And a lot of the hardware shipments came out of backlog during the quarter. And again, none of those would have included that price increase. And I think even looking ahead, Sami, you got to think about that price increase having a bigger effect toward the second half of the year than it will have during -- certainly during Q2. I think of that as more of a late Q3, Q4. By the time those price increases turn into orders, those orders work their way through the backlog, get built and then delivered to customers."

I would say that -- a quick comment on -- before I hand it to Scott on the second part. I think the -- we did talk about the first half of last quarter, we did see some deterioration in the -- in our supply chain component availability. And then we saw it stabilize in the second half.

And then you have to overlay on that the snarled logistics position that we find ourselves in really across all lanes, whether it's ocean or air or trucking. The layering on of both of those is what makes answering that question is so complex. 
As Chuck said, we did see stabilization and some of the signs of stabilization that we saw during the quarter. We saw better visibility to components from some of our suppliers in terms of when they could deliver in the quantities. We saw fewer decommits come in during the quarter, another sign of stabilization. And then memory costs are actually beginning -- just beginning, but beginning to decline a bit, meaning that market is coming more into balance as well. So we're seeing signs of stabilization. 
As we look ahead and look at Q2 guide and what that means for the full year, obviously, we're in a very strong position on RPO that's going to accrete into the revenue stream in the second half of the year. And we've got a backlog that provides us great visibility into exactly what we need to build. So we can be a lot more targeted in what we need to go chase down to get that.

I will tell you this. We clearly know -- call it pull ahead, call it ordering against the reality of our lead times, but we clearly know that customers are ordering further out than they would normally. The large carriers, the cloud providers, where we had 200% growth, I mean, these are customers we're doing deep forecasting and planning with. So we know that they're ordering 2, 3, 4 quarters out to make sure that they have this stuff in the pipeline and in the right sequence for delivery. So we get that visibility. 
But then you look at a segment like commercial that grew 46%, and you tend not to see a lot -- you'll see a little bit. Some of the commercial customers are looking out. But many of them are ordering when they feel the need. And so it's a really hard question to answer. 
On your second one, I think the only way I can answer that is to say -- it actually is part of the first answer, too. What we're watching real closely is we're watching cancellations, which we have not seen any change in our historic cancellation rates. In fact, it's lower. We watch pipeline growth. And I can tell you that our pipeline growth is probably as strong as it's ever been, even beyond the quarter we just finished. So we see continued demand.

The guide that we gave for the quarter at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1. And it's the exact same combination of effects. There's some competing factors inside there, right, on the -- within the gross margin. We've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on, more toward the second half. And really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4, we'll start to see -- that will be a tailwind to gross margin. 
We've got the cost increases. And within that, it's not just component cost increases, which are a part of it. It's also logistics cost increases as we talked about, and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. That's -- it's strictly tied to the various elements of cost within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. 
On the cap allocation, which I think was your second question, our cap allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day, which is, first and foremost, to support the growth of the business. Beyond that to obviously continue to protect the dividend through time, offset dilution of the -- our equity plans, which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed. And then longer term, return excess cash in the most tax-efficient way we can to our investors. 
So we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter, it's a valuation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into, M&A has been a part of our strategy as a company over time. We talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. Epsagon, which closed during the quarter and Replex, which we announced during the quarter, is not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build/buy type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation. Longer term, it's a space that has been part of our strategy for some time."

And the second question is, even if I look at the hardware side on these 2 areas, there was a major increase year-over-year in the growth rate, meaning from minus 16 to plus 10, for example, in secure and agile networks, even higher on the optical side.

And then as a quick follow-up for Scott. Scott, I do realize the supply chain constraints that you're highlighting here, but you're reiterating the full year revenue guide of 5% to 7%.

I think to your second question, it's so hard. I talked earlier about the complexity of answering that question, but I'll just repeat what we said earlier in the year that if the supply chain or the supply -- the component supply constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half, we'll be toward the high end. If it's later in the second half, we'll be toward the low end. 
So the real difficult question to answer is where in the second half, do we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter as the quarter went on. I mentioned earlier, we saw signs of stabilization. And we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO that's going to accrete into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog. So we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So we're confident in the full year. The question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe as we start to see the benefits of vaccine deployments and the continuing improvement in economic activity.
I want to start by acknowledging our employees, customers and partners in India, who are experiencing a devastating surge of COVID cases. Cisco is providing critical resources during this challenging time, and our thoughts remain with all of you.
While many of us are seeing great progress in our recovery efforts, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as we manage the ongoing pandemic around the world.
Turning to the quarter. We had impressive momentum in Q3, which gives me a great sense of optimism going forward. We returned to growth with revenue up 7%, driven by an improving macro environment, the strongest product portfolio in our history and great execution by our teams.
We saw broad-based demand across the business, led by our biggest growth opportunities: hybrid work, digital transformation, cloud and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings. We're also seeing early momentum in the ramping of key technology cycles that are long-term growth drivers for our business, such as 5G, 400-gig and Edge.
The next phase of the recovery and the future of work will be heavily reliant on our technology. Cisco's end-to-end portfolio will serve as the foundation for next-generation infrastructure solutions as well as cloud-enabled delivery models and innovation, allowing our customers to move with even greater speed and agility. This will require a significant investment cycle and reinforces the strength of our strategy while driving greater opportunity to create a world that is more connected, inclusive and secure.
We remain focused on accelerating innovation while simplifying the adoption of our offerings with network-wide automation, analytics and flexible as a service consumption models, all aimed at improving our customers' network performance capabilities and security, which we believe will drive tremendous long-term opportunities for us.
Our Q3 performance only reinforces my confidence about the future. These results reflect a return to a strong spending environment and an economic recovery that has gained momentum driven by vaccine rollouts and the easing of restrictions. As the economy has improved, customers have increased their investment across our portfolio to prepare for the upturn and return to office. In Q3, we saw 10% growth in product orders, the highest growth rate since Q1 of fiscal 2012, reflecting robust improvement across all of our customer segments and geographies.
From a product revenue perspective, we saw 6% growth, led by strength across our portfolio, including campus switching, routing, wireless, security, collaboration and web scale as well as from our acquisition of Acacia, which closed during Q3.
We continue to aggressively shift our business to more recurring revenue streams, which we expect to grow over time as we expand our offerings. In Q3, we achieved $3.8 billion in software revenue, with 81% of our software revenue sold as a subscription, up from 76% last quarter. We also saw another quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations. Over the past 6 years, we have made significant progress and now have one of the largest software businesses in the industry with an annual run rate well over $14 billion.
Let me now touch on infrastructure platforms. We saw strong demand across the majority of our portfolio, led by our next-generation enterprise networking and service provider solutions as companies accelerate the modernization of their infrastructure. This modern infrastructure delivers higher performance and faster access to data while offering the best user experience in an increasingly distributed environment.
Customers are turning to us to help them create the trusted workplace of the future with WiFi access points, video endpoints, cameras and IoT sensors, feeding data into DNA center and DNA spaces. We are enabling operations teams to remotely monitor workplace conditions for a safe return to office. We are also working to provide visibility beyond corporate networks, which is increasingly critical as our customers accelerate their adoption of SaaS and cloud solutions for hybrid work.
At Cisco Live, we launched the industry's first enterprise-wide full stack observability offering by integrating ThousandEyes cloud intelligence with our catalyst switching portfolio and AppDynamics. This provides IT with visibility and actionable insights across both external and internal networks to provide a seamless digital experience for users. And with users more distributed than ever, it is vital that they have the most efficient and secure connection to the cloud.
Our deep partnerships with Google, Amazon and Microsoft allow native connectivity from our SD-WAN fabric to each of these cloud offerings. With our technology, customers can reduce deployment times and connect branch offices to cloud workloads in minutes.
In our web scale business, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong order growth, which increased over 25% in the quarter and over 50% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our web scale customers are starting their 400-gig upgrade cycles and aggressively pursuing long-haul build-outs while our carrier customers are exploring new architectures to realize the full potential of 5G.
We are building the Internet for the future by creating breakthrough innovation with our routing, optical and automation technologies to deliver significant economic benefits. Recently, we launched a new routed optical networking solution, integrating our scalable, high-performance routers and Acacia's pluggable optics, which offers significant cost savings. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Sedona Systems to extend our cross-work automation platform to build on these capabilities. We also expanded our Silicon One platform from a routing focused solution to one which addresses the web scale switching market, offering 10 networking chips ranging from 3.2 to 25.6 terabits per second, making it the highest performance, programmable routing and switching silicon on the market.
We know our customers increasingly want to consume Cisco's technology in new, more flexible ways. At Cisco Live, we launched our new as a service portfolio, Cisco Plus and our first offer, Cisco Plus hybrid cloud, combining our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to deliver networking as a service, which will unify networking, security and observability across access, WAN and cloud domains to deliver an unparalleled experience for our customers.
Turning to security. We had a record quarter, surpassing $875 million in revenue, up 13% as we expanded our reach with customers around the world. Our security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and secure experience. We have an unrivaled ability to provide end-to-end security capabilities across users, devices, applications and data on any network or any cloud. This is the key reason why our customers trust us to help them proactively protect against and remediate threats. In fact, leading customers in every industry, including 100% of the Fortune 100 are using Cisco security solutions. These customers are increasingly deploying our Zero Trust and secure access service edge or SASE architectures, along with automation, authentication and analytics capabilities.
With today's distributed workforce, companies must quickly deploy highly secure trusted access to critical applications everywhere without compromising performance. Customers like Ford are using our cloud-delivered security platform umbrella as they secure over 100,000 of their remote team members. And this quarter, Lyft turned to Cisco to strengthen their security protection for all of their users accessing their applications. By deploying our duo portfolio, Lyft was able to provide strong access controls as they protect their users' sensitive personal and financial information while reducing their total cost of ownership by more than 50%.
With nearly $6 billion in annual R&D, the investment that Cisco is making in both security and the network continues to lead the momentum across our portfolio, with 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit umbrella cloud security growth, nearly 7,000 customers using our cloud-native SecureX platform and strong platform growth with security enterprise agreements.
We continue to expand our leadership with new innovations, including passwordless authentication, data loss prevention, observability, cloud-based malware detection and enhancements to SecureX. We're also complementing our organic innovation with assets that enable greater security efficacy. Our intent to acquire Kenna Security will bring together their risk-based vulnerability management platform with SecureX's threat management capabilities to prioritize and more effectively manage overall risk.
Lastly, let me touch on applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well. We had a record quarter in Webex as we execute against our strategy to power the future of hybrid work. Over the last 6 months, we've added more than 400 new features and devices to our Webex portfolio. We are enabling seamless experiences through our desk camera and desk hub solutions while extending the Webex suite of devices, including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts and environmental sensors to help enable a safe return to the office.
Well-being is top of mind for so many right now as we face a new way of working. This is why we launched People Insights to help people monitor and manage their well-being. These new features, devices and capabilities, combined with cloud calling and cloud contact center, provide our customers with the most comprehensive and inclusive hybrid work platform.
Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Socio Labs. By integrating Slido and Socio Labs into our Webex platform, we will also be able to provide the most comprehensive internal and external event management solution on the market.
In summary, we had a very good quarter. I'm so proud of the continued success of the business transformation our teams are driving. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the strongest demand in nearly a decade. We are also seeing similar component shortage supply issues as our peers. The good news, and this is reflected in our guidance, is that we are confident we will work through this as we have already put in place revised arrangements with several of our key suppliers. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors and take care of our customers by fulfilling their demand as quickly as possible.
Our strategy and commitment to leading with trust, innovation and choice, along with our continued focus and discipline are positioning us well for growth and profitability. As we accelerate the pace of innovation for our customers and partners, it's critical that we continue to support our people, our communities and our planet.
I'm very proud that Cisco was recently named the #1 Best Place to work in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This is a tremendous honor for us as it recognizes the incredible work of our people and the power of the culture we have created.
And lastly, in terms of actions we are taking to protect the planet. Last month, the Cisco Foundation announced $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. We have already achieved 100% renewable energy in the U.S. and in many countries across Europe, and this is another strong step forward.
Whether it's our deep focus on delivering the best results for our customers, partners and employees, or our commitment to making a difference in communities across the world, Cisco remains committed to our purpose, to power an inclusive future for all. I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead and confident in our team's ability to deliver.
I'll now turn it over to Scott."

Last quarter, I identified 4 key priorities that we are using to define our financial strategy: driving profitable growth; a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency; setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation; and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. We made progress on all these fronts in Q3 and are continuing to build our financial approach based on these core pillars, providing a strong foundation for enhanced financial performance as well as long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q4. As Chuck said, Q3 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well with strong product orders and solid growth in revenue, net income and earnings per share. Total revenue increased to $12.8 billion, up 7% year-on-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw broad strength in all product areas and geographies. We also saw continued recovery in our business and building momentum with sequential revenue growth of 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 4%; and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 5% year-on-year, coming in above the high end of our EPS guidance range.
Now let me provide more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 8%. Infrastructure platforms has rebounded nicely, with revenues up 6%. Within that, switching revenue increased overall with growth in campus, driven by strong double-digit growth of our Catalyst 9000 products. Routing had strong double-digit growth, driven by strength in the service provider market. Wireless had strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WiFi 6 products and strength in Meraki.
Data center revenue declined, driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were up 5%. We continue to see double-digit growth in Webex, driven by our product innovations and the value we bring to remote working. We saw growth in unified communications, IoT software and AppDynamics, offset by a decline in telepresence endpoints. Security was up 13% with growth across the entire portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and umbrella offerings. And we continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue.
Software revenue was $3.8 billion and subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-on-year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenues. In fact, the majority of our total revenue growth in the quarter came from recurring revenue streams. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q3, RPOs were $28.1 billion, up 10%. RPO for product was up 15% and for service was up 7%.
There was a 90 basis point positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter related to the acquisitions of Acacia and IMImobile, which both closed during the quarter. As a reminder, these acquisitions were not factored into our Q3 revenue guide. We had strong order momentum in Q3 with total product orders up 10%.
Looking at our geographies, the Americas were up 6%, EMEA was up 10% and APJC was up 31%. Total emerging markets were up 13%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 31%. In our customer segments, service provider was up 17%, commercial was up 16%, public sector was up 11%. Enterprise was flat, which is a significant improvement from last quarter. Non-GAAP total gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 66%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.9%, down 90 basis points. And service gross margin was 68.7%, down 20 basis points.
The decrease in product gross margin was largely driven by ongoing costs related to the supply chain challenges, offset by positive product mix, which includes some software benefit. Price erosion was relatively moderate and in line with our historical range. On the supply chain front, we continue to manage through the constraints seeing industry-wide and continue to incur additional costs. We are partnering with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extending supply commitments as we address the supply chain challenges, which we expect will continue.
The quarter did include an extra week, as we discussed on our last call. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to total revenue was approximately 3 points of growth. Total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 8%, driven by the timing of payments and restructuring costs. We expect operating cash flow to normalize for the full fiscal year.
We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.6 billion, down $7 billion sequentially, driven by $5.5 billion in payments for acquisitions as well as $3 billion in repayments of our long-term debt. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend and $510 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $6.7 billion to shareholders, which represents 64% of our free cash flow, and we have $8.7 billion in capacity remaining under our current share repurchase program authorization.
We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we closed 3 acquisitions, Acacia Communications, IMImobile and Dashbase. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also successfully closed on our acquisition of Slido on May 4. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our growth areas.
To summarize, we had a great Q3. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering growth and driving shareholder value.
Now let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Our financial guidance for Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% year-on-year, reflecting, again, the strong demand we're seeing; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%, reflecting the ongoing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.81 to $0.83.
Looking ahead, we're excited to announce we will host a virtual Cisco Financial Analyst Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021. We will post event details in the coming weeks and look forward to sharing more with you at that time.
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A."

On the -- starting with the gross margin, the impact you're seeing in the Q4 guide on gross margin is really driven by supply chain. It has a couple of elements to it. One is unit costs. So that we've got, and actually it was announced today from Gartner, we've got the #1 supply chain team in the world 2 years in a row. That team has done a great job getting ahead of the issues that everyone in the industry is seeing. So with that, though, we've locked in both supply and pricing with some of the key component providers that we've got going ahead. That's what you see built into the margin guide. And I think the supply chain issues will stay with us at least through -- from what I can see, at least through the end of this calendar year.
On the OpEx side, it's a little bit different. When you look at the -- we're right on track. Let me just start by saying -- before you ask, we're right on track with the savings associated with the restructuring that we announced earlier this year -- earlier this fiscal year. We said at the time, we would reinvest some of that into the growth of the business overall, and that's what you see happening. So when you look at the year-on-year growth in OpEx, it's driven by the integration of the acquisitions that closed during the quarter. A little bit of a headwind from FX as the dollar has weakened and then the higher commissions given the robust strength of the top line, commissions are up and reset of the variable comp plans. But that's what's driving it. And I think the  sustainability to get to your point, as I expect to see some of these supply chain issues linger with us through the end of the calendar year, first half of our fiscal year."

So as we began to realize that we were going to have the incremental cost, we had to make some decisions. And I think, obviously, we do believe these are temporary. We'll have to see how long they last. But based on that and based on the fact that we are seeing such momentum in the business right now, we decided to continue to invest in the business to drive the growth that we are feeling right now. And when you see the balance of the growth across all the businesses, as you see the regional balance, it was balanced across the technology areas, it was balanced across segments.
And then you think about that in the context of some of these real major trends that are occurring that were on the front end of like the 400-gig transition, like the success we're having in web scale, the service provider 5G build-out, the hybrid work and return to office. We talked about WiFi 6, leading to campus switching, which we're seeing play out now. And the security business had a record quarter at a time where most every customer is suggesting that they're going to be spending more over the next 12 months in cybersecurity. So we felt like it was prudent to continue to invest to meet the demand and deal with some of the short-term pain and then we think we'll get to the other side of it."

A couple of great questions. Number one, What we do know is that if we come to the conclusion that any of these cost increases or these -- this inflation, as you mentioned it, are going to be more sustained then we will look at strategic price increases where we have to. And that work is already underway. There's already some decisions that we've made. So we will do that. It's a pretty dynamic situation, as you know. And then on the pull ahead, this is a question that we've been asked. And while it's impossible to really quantify what that might be, it's going to be pretty obvious that if a customer has extended lead times, they're probably going to place order sooner than when they would. That just makes sense.
But we also have proxies that we would be looking for to really reflect that being a major issue like order cancellations if they're placing these orders in multiple -- against multiple channels and then canceling when they get it out of one channel. We don't see that. You would see more of that pull ahead from the enterprise. And obviously, commercial and small business, you probably wouldn't see as much, and those were pretty significant growth engines for us this past quarter. So we don't see any glaring red flags, although we would certainly agree that there's probably some level of early ordering going on."

The U.S. improved, and we would expect next quarter and then next fiscal year for U.S. Enterprise to actually improve significantly from where we are today.
And I think on the industry front, we were doing the review in the U.S., and we've actually seen double-digit growth in hospitality, in health care, in retail, and we've even seen the cruise lines making significant purchases as they prepare to go back out. So we think that, that is definitely a sign that we're on the road to recovery. And I would say that the other thing I would highlight is, as our customers think about hybrid work and they think about the return to office, we've talked about the prevalence of WiFi 6. We saw continued strength in WiFi. And we said once that begins to happen, that we believe there would be a campus switching upgrade follow. And the Cat 9000 has had 4 quarters of increasing growth in double digits the last few quarters from a demand perspective. So we've seen that happen as well.

So that's what we're doing.
On the year-over-year trends, I think that -- what I would point to is the real thing that I think is substantive is the demand side of what we've seen. And -- because you're right, you can do some math that gets at the revenue in Q3. But I think that based on what we see and the demand that we see, we do believe this is certainly a -- it's a positively evolving marketplace for us.

I think the other thing that we've talked about the robust demand that we've had, and you see the revenue that we printed in Q3, what you didn't see is we also have built up a healthy backlog at this point. And so I think that coming into Q4, not only do we have a very high percentage of recurring revenue as -- that we know will come into the revenue stream during Q4.

I certainly believe there are projects that customers put on hold that they're now accelerating now that they have better visibility into what the return looks like. I definitely think that's happening. Also I think your second point is happening. I think that there -- every customer is looking at modernizing their infrastructure because no one wants to be caught flat-footed by the next crisis. And everyone has realized the power of technology during this time frame. And so I think there's an element of increased investments that we'll see across all the technology areas as well as, obviously, cybersecurity, et cetera.
But the other thing I think that's really important is that we've been investing for a long time against a lot of these big market transitions that are starting to come to life. I mean, you remember, Ittai, we didn't play in the web-scale space 5 years ago. We didn't play. And now we're seeing -- that was almost 1/4 of our service provider business again this quarter and is still growing robustly. I mean it grew over 25% this quarter against a quarter a year ago that was in excess of 70% growth. So it's not -- it's still accelerating.
And then you got 5G that's starting to play out the way we -- as we've all been waiting for it to play out. You've got this return to office and hybrid work with WiFi 6 and the campus upgrades that we've talked about, and you've got this cybersecurity concern that is only exacerbated by everything we see in the press by all the continuing attacks and at a time where we had record revenue. So we -- I think all of those things are playing into it, and that's what leads us to feel pretty good about where we are right now."

The first is we see a revenue headwind from the supply chain issue in Q4. As I said earlier, if we didn't have the supply chain challenges, we would have been guiding higher on revenue, which is reflected what Scott mentioned about the backlog coming into the quarter.
The second thing is this business transformation that we have been working on for the last 5 or 6 years. If we go back to the first quarter, I was CEO and then we look at the quarter that we're entering into. The recurring revenue that we're pulling off the balance sheet that we have visibility to today that will be part of Q4 revenue is up 64% during that time frame. So we have a lot more visibility, and it just says that the whole rationale for why we've been driving this business model transformation, which is a big complex change to get to. But that has helped us in a big way, in allowing us to actually deliver the revenue we're talking about next quarter.

Is that the kind of right run rate level of growth we should expect for your software business?
And then, Scott, just to confirm, given that move in mix in revenue mix and product portfolios in a situation in which the supply chain were not disruptive, we could have expected some tiny sequential improvement in gross margins, right?"

Mix is definitely, as we continue to add more recurring revenue, particularly around software, as you pointed out, but also our tech support services. Those are higher gross margins. Those long term will be a tailwind to our gross margins. The supply chain issues, obviously, more than offset that.
In terms of your question on software growth, the numbers that you're using are a little bit rounded, but you're on the right thread. We're seeing nice growth in software. And in fact, we mentioned that 81% now of that is driven by subscription and recurring revenue. So 7-point improvement in the amount of that software revenue that's recurring. That is great news longer term, as you know, with recurring revenue, particularly when it's ratable, you see less of the impact upfront. So there's a bit of a bow wave. And you see it in the growth of our RPOs and the growth of our deferred revenue on products. So each of those are growing. That's also a sign of the growth within our software product set. I mean we're now -- when you just do the quick math, right? We're now one of the biggest software companies in the world, right, north of $14 billion in software revenue.

Just as an add-on to that. Last time we talked about 400-gig and there's always seems to be a question about 400-gig. And our customer count on 400-gig went up by 50% during the quarter. So we did see a continued uptake on that technology. And that's super early, as you know."
