Listen, the advertising levels, I don't think we are maximized on investments. What we are seeing is that the A&M line has opportunities for optimization, especially in what we call nonworking, and we're working hard on optimizing that part. And obviously, we're working on optimizing the return on investment on the advertising part of the media that impacts the consumer. 
One of the decisions we took this year was -- and if you look at Frito-Lay, for example, or some of our international business, we actually increased our A&M. And the reason for that is that within the formula for success of our portfolio, we have to have our large brands growing at a decent pace, at the market level, hopefully. And for that, we need to keep them modernized, we have to keep innovating on those large brands. But also, we need to invest in the the growth space of the category where sometimes we need to create new brands. And that requires a well funded kind of support package to get those brands up and running. 
For example, if you think about the Frito portfolio, obviously, we want to grow our Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos, Lays, Ruffles at a very good pace, and I think we're doing that. But at the same time, we need to build healthier portfolios, brands like Off The Eaten Path or smart foods or pulp corners or Bare, all those brands need to need to grow to have a portfolio of the future. The same with our beverage portfolio with bubly, with some of the smaller brands we're creating. So that's how we're thinking about our A&M optimization. Obviously, on the nonworking, get the maximum ROI on the working part, but ensure that we can support the -- both the large brands and the smaller future brands in a way that we have a sustainable growth for the future."

So just trying to understand why there couldn't be upside to the long-term algorithm should those costs drop off. Is there assumed reinvestment or higher commodities or other factors? 
And then second, Ramon, just sort of further on the question you just answered. We did see a pretty big shift in A&M spend on the Frito side this year. Obviously, a pullback in beverage given the COVID situation. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on the ROI behind the higher spend in Frito and if you think you're getting significant incremental revenue from that or the yield on those investments as you shifted the allocation within the portfolio in 2020."

We've identified the COVID costs as something we wanted to call out because it was extraordinary. There will be COVID costs and significant COVID costs still in 2021. So you really can't flow all of that to the bottom line. In addition to that, we are reporting some of the A&M, as Ramon mentioned, in snack food business and a bit in the beverage business as well. 
But as we consider the year, given the level of uncertainty, we felt like being on long-term algorithm from a revenue and profit perspective was an appropriately -- appropriate goal for us. I think if we hit these numbers as we expected, I think it will be a good [indiscernible]."

And I think it's -- to start a year thinking about our long-term algorithm is a good way to start focusing the company on a sustainable performance for many years. So that's how we're thinking about it. 
Then with regards to the marketing ROI, listen, we're getting much better at measuring the ROI on our marketing spend. And we think that, actually, we're -- based on this measurement, we're getting much better the ROI delivery of our investments. We're putting tools and we're putting kind of performance metrics to our marketing teams. In particular, where you were saying about Frito, Frito has a very low level of advertising. I mean full A&M actually, below 4%, for a brand -- for a business that has so many multiple brands and has so much growth potential, if you think about the share of macro-snacks that we have. So I would think that if you think about the levers of growth for Frito in the future, I think A&M and an increased A&M should be part of it. As we think about our push model, it's pretty optimized with our DSD execution capabilities. I think on the pool side, we have opportunities probably to maximize the frequency and to maximize the consumer connection with our brands and Frito versus what we do with other -- with some other parts of our business. So that's how we'll be thinking about the A&M investments at Frito."

The -- I would say, Europe, we're seeing different Europes. Now we're seeing Eastern Europe quite strong. I would say, Russia, extremely strong. Turkey, very strong. Some parts in Central Europe, much better. Central Europe, I mean Germany, some of the more developed Europe. We're seeing the south of Europe, very impacted by by obviously the lack of tourism and people not going there for weekends or longer vacation. So that is how we see Europe. 
When we look at '21, we think, obviously, as mobility increases, we're going to see even better performance in Western Europe. And hopefully, we can continue to see the good performance in the East. 
What we can see in Europe across the board is we're becoming more competitive. I think our share of market performance, both in beverages and snacks, was very good this year. So we managed to gain share almost in every single market, which is actually the metric that we're following the most in a period of time where the markets go up and down, depending on lockdowns, et cetera. 
In Latin America, actually, Brazil has been very strong throughout the year. And we feel very good about our Brazilian business also in terms of share of market. But also category growth has been very, very positive in Brazil. 
Mexico, at the beginning of the pandemic, we suffered a little bit in the [ capillary ] part of our business. So the more kind of smaller fragmented trade, we saw traffic down. And that impacted our sales, given we have a very good distribution and availability in the market. The business came back to much more solid performance in the last quarter in Mexico. And although we've been gaining share across the year, we've seen also the category recovery in Mexico. So hopefully, we see a much better performance in Mexico this year in absolute terms. Relative terms, I think we'll continue to gain share in the market. 
So those are the 2 big markets in Latin America. You get a good sign from those 2.

I would not expect -- from the standpoint of the third one, I would not expect much in the way of M&A as we go through the course of this year. And certainly, nothing large. So from that perspective, I think we're -- we've got a lot to digest right now. We're happy with where the portfolio sits. 
And then last, in terms of share repurchase, obviously, we're trying to balance our debt rating versus our cash return to shareholders. We felt like the dividend increase was important. And at the same time, given the level of M&A that we've had over the last couple of years, balancing that out with the debt rating, we made a decision that we weren't going to have significant share repurchase in this year. That's purely based on balancing the debt rating with our -- with our return to equity shareholders. Nothing more than that driving that decision."

A couple of big drivers behind it. #1 is the IT and digitalization spending that we're doing, that will be elevated for a couple of years as we sort of get through the combination of an SAP upgrade as well as a whole variety of digitalization efforts that we have going on in our supply chain and selling system. 
The second piece is primarily around growth capacity, and we expect that to be elevated for a couple of years. If you look at the way that we used to run the business, we ran capacity pretty close to the edge. And as we've pivoted to more of a growth strategy, we're taking capacity utilization down a little bit to enable us to capture more of the growth opportunities that are out there. So that's a big piece of the spin. 
And then the last is productivity CapEx. As we're looking at automation and looking at putting more capabilities into the plants, that will yield cost savings. That obviously is a big driver. 
So I would say I would expect the capital spending to remain elevated for the next couple of years. And then I would expect it to return back to our typical norms."

But at the end of the day, we plan to continue being the distributor of Bang until October '23 and we're going to do our best to make that brand well distributed and in the marketplace. 
But the core of our energy strategy was never Bang as a distribution cherry on top. It was obviously what we could do with our brands after the acquisition of Rockstar kind of frees us up from some of the contractual obligations we had. 
So the first pillar is obviously Rockstar. Rockstar relaunch, both in the U.S. and in expansion internationally as our core energy kind of mainstream proposition. 
The -- I would say the integration of Rockstar into our supply chain is starting to happen. It's going to be a bit of a process until we get all the formulations and everything into our our system. But obviously, that's going to make it a better supply chain in itself. 
From the consumer point of view, we are -- so we're planning to invest in the brand. I think we found the consumer space where it's going to be a bit quite differentiated. And then we're improving the formula and we're improving -- building different propositions for multiple spaces in that kind of mainstream energy. 
At the same time, you will be seeing shortly some announcements on Mountain Dew launch in the spring time. It's going to be the first big move for Mountain Dew into the energy space. We're very happy with the way the product concept, the support package and the support we're getting from our customers in terms of the launch. So that would be a good event. It will be the first move of Mountain Dew and there will be future moves as well from Mountain Dew into the energy space. 
Obviously, one of our big pillars in energy is our Starbucks partnership, which is -- I think is at an all-time high in terms of the relationship and the market performance. We continue to innovate on the kind of coffee energy, triple shots, double shots. And we have some, I think, good ideas that will -- I'm sure will make into the market shortly. 
So -- and then we're looking at other brands in the sports area and some other kind of spaces within the energy management, energy up, energy down, that I think we can have a multiple set of solutions and brands that drive consumer solutions in a space that is obviously growing and has a lot of consumer pool. 
So it's important for us, as we said, both from the growth point of view and the margin expansion point of view. And we feel good about the steps we're taking brick by brick to build a solid foundation for us to play in energy over many years. 
So that's pretty much, Laurent, and you will see more news from us in the coming weeks."

Is it fair -- I think first order of business was seemingly to kind of shore up and reinvest in your bigger franchises. And I felt like the language in the prepared remarks today, there was a little bit more emphasis on stepping up the investments in the more -- the ancillary but critical growth opportunities, whether it's smaller brands or kind of healthier segments of the categories. Can you speak to the degree to which maybe the environment of the last year kind of accelerated the support you were giving to your big brands and the impact that, that really had on accelerating, I guess, your progress vis-à-vis your long-term goals? I'd be curious to hear sort of a progress report."

And pretty much the",494,"That's great. Good question. Listen, if you think back and you see the growth opportunity for PepsiCo, we are -- you think about the large LRB category globally, we're about less than 10% on a $600 billion category growing at a 4%, 5%. And pretty much the same with macro-snacks, a large category, $500 billion, $600 billion globally, and we are less than 10%. So growth as the lever for the long-term value creation of these companies is clearly the #1. 
As we're thinking about our growth, obviously, there is a lot of growth in our core brands. Our large core brands have a lot of opportunities, both for more penetration and for, obviously, much more frequency. So we're thinking about that pillar is critical. And we are -- I think we're well invested now in our core brands. If you think about the performance, for example, of PBNA and how brick by brick we've been able to get Pepsi to growth, Mountain Dew to growth, Gatorade to growth or to accelerated growth, while we still grow our coffees, our teas and our sparkling waters. I mean that is the growth model. 
If you turn it to the snacks business, the same. You have -- we have our big core categories that play in the fun, social space. And we're building a set of brands in more, let's say, either morning or during the day solo occasions where we're less penetrated at this point. These are brands I was referring earlier, Off The Eaten Path, Smartfoods, some of the recent acquisitions like pop corners, Bare. We are building a beautiful portfolio of solutions for that -- for those spaces. That is the growth of the company long term, a well balanced growth between our core businesses and those smaller niche that one day, 10 years from now, will become the big brands. 
If you think about other models that we're working, clearly, our SodaStream has been a fantastic acquisition for us. And it gives us a platform not only to have a sweet spot between better for you and better for the planet, which I think is going to be a sweet spot of growth globally, but also a new way to customize drinks. The same, we're thinking about, for example, the questions I just got, on Beyond Meat and the partnership. 
So we're building a lot of future opportunities for our portfolios to grow. At the same time, we don't want to keep our eyes off what are the core brands that drive the majority of the growth in absolute dollars of this company and that have a massive runway for growth in the future. 
So that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about growth. Growth being our #1 value creation. Profitable growth, obviously. And I think we can do that over time by also creating those smaller spaces where I think we can enter and win in the future."

Ramon and Hugh for that matter, just building off the last question around sort of balanced growth. I wanted to come back to the margin opportunity at North America beverages because this has come up so on a number of times on previous calls. In your prepared remarks today, it's been more about delivering a better balance and improving profitability. Last quarter, I think, it seemed to me, at least the tone was more on improving profitability. So I'm just -- I just want to get a better understanding here if the current commodity cost environment which you commented on a moment ago, as well as the spending intentions of your key competitor, because one would argue that they've probably never been more constrained than they have been this past year. So I'm just curious if this will be another year of sort of really limited margin enhancement given these factors at North America beverages and want to get a better understanding of how big a priority this is for the organization? And then when can we expect to return to this sort of elusive mid-teens operating margin?"

I think when we -- I think the conversations we started about a couple of years ago was we want to make sure that we got PBNA to be a growth engine. And I think brick by brick, we've been able to build a -- kind of make sure our brands are all growth brands. And I think we're there. In the latest quarter, 5 plus growth shows that. Okay, we're -- most of our brands are performing at a very good level. That was critical because we thought that there's no way to cut your costs in a way that is sustainable. So now we have, I think, a good machine that has the right local execution capabilities and the good brands and innovation. 
Now we have the intentions to work, obviously, on the margin expansion of PBNA. That is a priority for us, a priority for the business. We see this business long-term at mid teens. We want to do it in a sustainable way, where we keep growing with the category and expand our margins. And we have obviously, ideas on how do we pivot to categories, segments of the category that are highly more profitable, how we get better at selling the right pack in the right place at the right price, so our revenue management capabilities. We have a lot of cost opportunities in the end-to-end supply chain management and also the way we support the business, some of our G&A expenses, and a little bit on our A&M, as you mentioned, optimization. So all of that should give us the opportunities to continue to grow, add the category above and it's starting to expand the margins. This year should be a year where you see already some some movement in that regard. And as I said earlier, we see this business getting into the teens margins over the long run without sacrificing competitive performance."

I think, listen, obviously, we all had to take a look at our supply chain, right, during this year because we -- it's been a challenging year from the supply chain point of view given the number of infected people that we had in our supply chain and so on. So simplifying our portfolios has been a solution to continue to have elevated levels of supply to our customers, which has been our focus. 
I think as we go forward and consumers move back to more of a bit of more of a normal life and physical stores continue to be a meaningful part of their shopping experience, I think consumers will go back to experimenting a little bit more, and they will be looking for innovation and smaller SKUs. So I think we're going to see a small -- slow return back to bit more complex portfolios. But I think we've all learned that maybe the tail of the portfolio was not really delivering the returns that we needed to have for every SKU that we had in the marketplace. So I think there's going to be an optimization of the portfolios but an increasing complexity as well versus what we have today givne that the consumers will be asking for a bit more experimentation and especially in our categories where variety is a key driver of purchase."

As we think about the future of Gatorade, we couldn't be more excited about what we see. Obviously, moving into other spaces, like I said, natural, obviously you mentioned energy, those could be spaces. But where we see the biggest opportunity for Gatorade is in creating more of a personalized solutions for athletes and kind of amateur athletes, like most of us, and creating a much more engaged relationship where we become advisers of the athletes, of their hydration needs, of all their nutrition needs and we see an opportunity to create much more of a full ecosystem of engagement with the consumer.

On the opposite side, we're obviously seeing more consumption at home, both on kind of indulgence in terms of kind of at the end of the day, there's -- people need a break or during the day and breaks, and we're seeing more solo consumption, so more multipack, small portion -- small portion format. At the end, probably a bit of a net positive for the category, but not massively in terms of what we're seeing across the world. Maybe a bit more developed -- in developed markets where we have more in-home consumption, maybe a more positive impact.

So that's our strategic driver. 
In terms of the promotional effort, I think we've simplified promotional calendars with our customers everywhere, given the simplification of the supply chain that we had to do. I think we've all learned that there are some opportunities there, but I'm sure there will be a little bit of additional promotional efforts as the world opens up again. But I think we've all learned that the relative price of the beverage category in some formats in the U.S., even you compare to other markets around the world, was very, very low.

Listen, the advertising levels, I don't think we are maximized on the investments. What we are seeing is that the A&M line has opportunities for optimization, especially in what we call nonworking, and we're working hard on optimizing that part. And obviously, we're working on optimizing the return on investment on the advertising part of the media that impacts the consumer.  
One of the decisions we took this year was -- and if you look at Frito-Lay, for example, or some of our international business, we actually increased our A&M. And the reason for that is that within the formula for success of our portfolio, we have to have our large brands growing at a decent pace, at the market level, hopefully. And for that, we need to keep them modernized, we have to keep innovating on those large brands. But also, we need to invest in the growth space of the category where sometimes we need to create new brands. And that requires a well-funded kind of support package to get those brands up and running.  
For example, if you think about the Frito portfolio, obviously, we want to grow our Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos, Lays, Ruffles at a very good pace, and I think we're doing that. But at the same time, we need to build healthier portfolios, brands like Off The Eaten Path or Smartfoods or PopCorners or Bare, all those brands need to grow to have a portfolio of the future, the same with our beverage portfolio with bubly or with some of the smaller brands we're creating. So that's how we're thinking about our A&M optimization. Obviously, on the nonworking, get the maximum ROI on the working part, but ensure that we can support the -- both the large brands and the smaller future brands in a way that we have a sustainable growth for the future."

And then second, Ramon, just sort of further on the question you just answered. We did see a pretty big shift in A&M spend on the Frito side this year. Obviously, a pullback in beverage given the COVID situation. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on the ROI behind the higher spend in Frito and if you think you're getting significant incremental revenue from that or the yield on those investments as you shifted the allocation within the portfolio in 2020."

In addition to that, we are reporting some of the A&M, as Ramon mentioned, in snack food business and a bit in the beverage business as well.

So that's how we're thinking about it.  
Then with regards to the marketing ROI, listen, we're getting much better at measuring the ROI on our marketing spend. And we think that, actually, we're -- based on this measurement, we're getting much better at the ROI delivery of our investments. We're putting tools and we're putting kind of performance metrics to our marketing teams. In particular, where you were saying about Frito, Frito has a very low level of advertising. I mean full A&M actually, below 4%, for a brand -- for a business that has so many multiple brands and has so much growth potential, if you think about the share of macro-snacks that we have. So I would think that -- if you think about the levers of growth for Frito in the future, I think A&M and an increased A&M should be part of it. As we think about our push model, it's pretty optimized with our DSD execution capabilities. I think on the pool side, we have opportunities probably to maximize the frequency and to maximize the consumer connection with our brands and Frito versus what we do with other -- with some other parts of our business. So that's how we'll be thinking about the A&M investments at Frito."

The -- I would say, Europe, we're seeing different Europes. Now we're seeing Eastern Europe quite strong. I would say, Russia, extremely strong. Turkey, very strong. Some parts in Central Europe, much better. With Central Europe, I mean Germany, some of the more developed Europe. We're seeing the south of Europe, very impacted by obviously the lack of tourism and people not going there for weekends or longer vacation. So that is how we see Europe.  
When we look at '21, we think, obviously, as mobility increases, we're going to see even better performance in Western Europe. And hopefully, we can continue to see the good performance in the East.  
What we can see in Europe across the board is we're becoming more competitive. I think our share of market performance, both in beverages and snacks, was very good this year. So we managed to gain share almost in every single market, which is actually the metric that we're following the most in a period of time where the markets go up and down, depending on lockdowns, et cetera.  
In Latin America, actually, Brazil has been very strong throughout the year. And we feel very good about our Brazilian business also in terms of share of market. But also category growth has been very, very positive in Brazil.  
Mexico, at the beginning of the pandemic, we suffered a little bit in the [ capital ] part of our business. So the more kind of smaller fragmented trade, we saw traffic down. And that impacted our sales, given that we have a very good distribution and availability in the market. The business came back to much more solid performance in the last quarter in Mexico. And although we've been gaining share across the year, we've seen also the category recovery in Mexico. So hopefully, we see a much better performance in Mexico this year in absolute terms. Relative terms, I think we'll continue to gain share in the market.  
So those are the 2 big markets in Latin America. You get a good sign from those 2.

So from that perspective, I think we're -- we've got a lot to digest right now. We're happy with where the portfolio sits.  
And then last, in terms of share repurchase, obviously, we're trying to balance our debt rating versus our cash return to shareholders. We felt like the dividend increase was important. And at the same time, given the level of M&A that we've had over the last couple of years, balancing that out with the debt rating, we made a decision that we weren't going to have significant share repurchase in this year. That's purely based on balancing the debt rating with our return to equity shareholders. Nothing more than that driving that decision."

A couple of big drivers behind it. Number one is the IT and digitalization spending that we're doing. That will be elevated for a couple of years as we sort of get through the combination of an SAP upgrade as well as a whole variety of digitalization efforts that we have going on in our supply chain and selling system.  
The second piece is primarily around growth capacity, and we expect that to be elevated for a couple of years. If you look at the way that we used to run the business, we ran capacity pretty close to the edge. And as we've pivoted to more of a growth strategy, we're taking capacity utilization down a little bit to enable us to capture more of the growth opportunities that are out there. So that's a big piece of the spin.  
And then the last is productivity CapEx. As we're looking at automation and looking at putting more capabilities into the plants, that will yield cost savings. That obviously is a big driver.  
So I would say I would expect the capital spending to remain elevated for the next couple of years. And then I would expect it to return back to our typical norms."

But at the end of the day, we plan to continue being the distributor of Bang until October '23 and we're going to do our best to make that brand well distributed and -- in the marketplace. 
But the core of our energy strategy was never Bang as a distribution cherry on top. It was obviously what we could do with our brands after the acquisition of Rockstar kind of free us up from some of the contractual obligations we had. 
So the first pillar is obviously Rockstar. Rockstar relaunch, both in the U.S. and in expansion internationally as our core energy kind of mainstream proposition. 
The -- I would say the integration of Rockstar into our supply chain is starting to happen. It's going to be a bit of a process until we get all the formulations and everything into our system. But obviously, that's going to make it a better supply chain in itself. 
From the consumer point of view, we are -- so we're planning to invest in the brand. I think we found the consumer space where it's going to be a bit quite differentiated. And then we're improving the formulas and we're improving -- building different propositions for multiple spaces in that kind of mainstream energy. 
At the same time, you will be seeing shortly some announcements on Mountain Dew launch in the springtime. It's going to be the first big move for Mountain Dew into the energy space. We're very happy with the way the product concept, the support package and the support we're getting from our customers in terms of the launch. So that would be a good event. It will be the first move of Mountain Dew and there will be future moves as well from Mountain Dew into the energy space. 
Obviously, one of our big pillars in energy is our Starbucks partnership, which is, I think, is at an all-time high in terms of the relationship and the market performance. We continue to innovate on the kind of coffee energy, triple shots, double shots. And we have some, I think, good ideas that will -- I'm sure will make into the market shortly. 
So -- and then we're looking at other brands in the sports area and some other kind of spaces within the energy management, energy up, energy down, that I think we can have multiple set of solutions and brands that drive consumer solutions in a space that is obviously growing and has a lot of consumer pool. 
So it's important for us, as we said, both from the growth point of view and the margin expansion point of view. And we feel good about the steps we're taking brick by brick to build a solid foundation for us to play in energy over many years. 
So that's pretty much, Laurent, and you will see more news from us in the coming weeks."

Listen, if you think back and you see the growth opportunity for PepsiCo, we are -- you think about the large LRB category globally, we're about less than 10% on a $600 billion category growing at a 4%, 5%. And pretty much the same with macro-snacks, a large category, $500 billion, $600 billion globally, and we are less than 10%. So growth as a lever for the long-term value creation of these companies is clearly the #1. 
As we're thinking about our growth, obviously, there is a lot of growth in our core brands. Our large core brands have a lot of opportunities, both for more penetration and for, obviously, much more frequency. So we're thinking about that pillar is critical. And we are -- I think we're well invested now in our core brands. If you think about the performance, for example, of PBNA and how brick by brick we've been able to get Pepsi to growth, Mountain Dew to growth, Gatorade to growth or to accelerated growth, while we still grow our coffees, our teas and our sparkling waters, I mean that is the growth model. 
If you turn it to the snacks business, the same. You have -- we have our big core categories that play in the fun, social space. And we're building a set of brands in more, let's say, either morning or during the day solo occasions where we're less penetrated at this point. These are brands I was referring earlier, Off The Eaten Path, Smartfoods, some of the recent acquisitions like pop corners, Bare. We are building a beautiful portfolio of solutions for that -- for those spaces. That is the growth of the company long term, a well balanced growth between our core businesses and those smaller niche that one day, 10 years from now, will become the big brands. 
If you think about other models that we're working, clearly, our SodaStream has been a fantastic acquisition for us. And it gives us a platform not only to have a sweet spot between better for you and better for the planet, which I think is going to be a sweet spot of growth globally, but also a new way to customize drinks. The same, we're thinking about, for example, the questions I just got, on Beyond Meat and the partnership. 
So we're building a lot of future opportunities for our portfolios to grow. At the same time, we don't want to keep our eyes off what are the core brands that drive the majority of the growth in absolute dollars of this company and that have a massive runway for growth in the future. 
So that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about growth, growth being our #1 value creation. Profitable growth, obviously. And I think we can do that over time by also creating those smaller spaces where I think we can enter and win in the future."

So I'm just -- I just want to get a better understanding here of the current commodity cost environment, which you commented on a moment ago, as well as the spending intentions of your key competitor, because one would argue that they've probably never been more constrained than they have been this past year. So I'm just curious if this will be another year of sort of really limited margin enhancement given these factors at North America beverages and want to get a better understanding of how big a priority this is for the organization? And then when can we expect to return to this sort of elusive mid-teens operating margin?"

I think when we -- I think the conversations we started about a couple of years ago was we want to make sure that we got PBNA to be a growth engine. And I think brick by brick, we've been able to build a -- kind of make sure our brands are all growth brands. And I think we're there. In the latest quarter, a 5-plus growth shows that. Okay, we're -- most of our brands are performing at a very good level. That was critical because we thought that there's no way to cut your costs in a way that is sustainable. So now we have, I think, a good machine that has the right local execution capabilities and the good brands and innovation. 
Now we have the intentions to work, obviously, on the margin expansion of PBNA. That is a priority for us, a priority for the business. We see this business long term at mid-teens. We want to do it in a sustainable way, where we keep growing with the category and expand our margins. And we have, obviously, ideas on how do we pivot to categories, segments of the category that are highly more profitable, how we get better at selling the right pack in the right place at the right price, so our revenue management capabilities. We have a lot of cost opportunities in the end-to-end supply chain management and also the way we support the business, some of our G&A expenses, and a little bit on our A&M, as you mentioned, optimization. So all of that should give us the opportunities to continue to grow, add the category above and it's starting to expand the margins. This year should be a year where you see already some movement in that regard. And as I said earlier, we see this business getting into the teens margins over the long run without sacrificing competitive performance."

I think, listen, obviously, we all had to take a look at our supply chain, right, during this year because we -- it's been a challenging year from the supply chain point of view given the number of infected people that we had in our supply chain and so on. So simplifying our portfolios has been a solution to continue to have elevated levels of supply to our customers, which has been our focus. 
I think as we go forward and consumers move back to more of a -- a bit of -- more of a normal life and physical stores continue to be a meaningful part of their shopping experience, I think consumers will go back to experimenting a little bit more, and they will be looking for innovation and smaller SKUs. So I think we're going to see a small -- slow return back to bit more complex portfolios. But I think we've all learned that maybe the tail of the portfolio was not really delivering the returns that we needed to have for every SKU that we had in the marketplace. So I think there's going to be an optimization of the portfolios but an increasing complexity as well versus what we have today given that the consumers will be asking for a bit more experimentation and especially in our categories where variety is a key driver of purchase."

As we think about the future of Gatorade, we couldn't be more excited about what we see. Obviously, moving into other spaces, like I said, natural, obviously you mentioned energy, those could be spaces. But where we see the biggest opportunity for Gatorade is in creating more of a personalized solutions for athletes and kind of amateur athletes, like most of us, and creating a much more engaged relationship where we become advisers of the athletes, of their hydration needs, of all their nutrition needs and we see an opportunity to create much more of a full ecosystem of engagement with the consumer.

On the opposite side, we're obviously seeing more consumption at home, both on kind of indulgence in terms of kind of at the end of the day, there's -- people need a break or during the day some breaks, and we're seeing more solo consumption, so more multipack, small portion formats. At the end, probably a bit of a net positive for the category, but not massively in terms of what we're seeing across the world. Maybe a bit more developed -- in developed markets where we have more in-home consumption, maybe a more positive impact.

So that's our strategic driver. 
In terms of the promotional effort, I think we've simplified promotional calendars with our customers everywhere, given the simplification of the supply chain that we had to do. I think we've all learned that there are some opportunities there, but I'm sure there will be a little bit of additional promotional efforts as the world opens up again. But I think we've all learned that the relative price of the beverage category in some formats in the U.S., even you compare to other markets around the world, was very, very low.

And then the -- looking out more longer term, we've obviously -- we're seeing a really pronounced rise in the commodity spectrum across-the-board in CPG lately core. And certainly, one of those is up substantially year-over-year. So can you talk about how much you're covered for 2021 on commodities? But what I'm really more interested in strategically is in the event that these higher commodities do fully flow through to your P&L as we look later in the year or even into 2022 because it does feel like we're certainly in a normal commodity environment, how do you approach that from an organizational standpoint? Can we expect more aggressive pricing? And how do you sort of approach that higher commodity spectrum theoretically as an organization given it does seem like an outsized increase?"

I'll jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question. If you look at really over the last 3 quarters, the gross margin decline we've had is really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent International M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition, and we expect that to continue into Q2. That's the last quarter before we finally lap out of that. 
In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now. 
And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities. In terms of managing it, we'll take a balanced approach. And this, as we always have, between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers. 
If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, up 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the international M&A and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country. Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I'd probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. 
As for '22, it's premature really to talk about that. I mean we're so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that's something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on."

Certainly, a strong quarter despite really being the toughest comp of the year. So maybe you could drill down further on some of the momentum you're seeing in this business and give us a sense of how strong results could have been without the winter storms. 
And then separately, could you help us understand consumer consumption patterns around pack sizes? Are your large pack sizes still driving the majority of the growth at Frito-Lay and maybe how you expect that to trend? 
And finally, just curious to hear if you've seen any recovery in the impulse portion of that business yet? And then if not, why?"

The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So we feel good about that part. And we've been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So that's very positive. 
Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south. A lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So we're slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing, and we're very close to having a normal supply chain now. 
Your question on consumer trends, I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past and is the fact that we're seeing more and more small portion consumption in the Snacks business and, to a certain extent, also in the Beverage business. So smaller units, especially now in the form of multi-packs, given there is an increase in home consumption, that's the consumer package that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that, creating more combination of multipacks, which drives eventually -- given that consumers like variety, it drives performance, and we're seeing a lot of growth there. I think that's going to be a structural trend in that business. 
Now to your question on mobility, yes, we're seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact, by definition, in in consumption trends in both large format and small format. So we're seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels, large format and small format. So those are all some trends that we're seeing. 
There's still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think. And we're going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day.

Listen, it's clearly a focused category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So let me go one by one on the different components of it. 
The first thing I would say, the Starbucks Energy segment, which is, as you know, we've been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continue to grow at a double digit. And our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. 
Now when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things. As you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So we're feeling good about that part. 
When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say. From the customer, very strong reaction on our Mountain Dew Rise. Clearly, that's a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with Lebron James, and that's going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. 
When it comes to Rockstar, also, I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the products, with the international launch and relaunch here in the U.S. The early -- again, it's only 6 weeks in the market, really with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It's now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. But I would say, it's too early to call whether we're really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we're going to need a few more quarters to really understand what's happening at the consumer level. But from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the 4 vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events. So good start in [indiscernible]"

Yes, China is a bit of a very special case, now given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We're seeing -- obviously, there's a little bit of noise in our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. 
But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending. We're obviously benefiting from that. On top of it, in snacks, we continue to gain share. We're building new manufacturing. We're building new agro programs. We're building -- we're investing in rural areas for better distribution of our Snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought [indiscernible] which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we've been building for many years. 
On the snack side, I would say, very encouraged by the by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we've made on rural areas and more capital distribution. 
With regards to beverages, it's been a -- it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we've been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high-growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. 
The growth expectations of the economy are positive as was recently laid out by the government, and we're seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market, and what we're seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. So there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend. But overall, as a country, it continues to be a very important and very large business opportunity for us."

At this point, there are still shortages, I think, in supply from many of the players in the category. And we're all becoming better at understanding the -- improving our net revenue management capabilities and understand the return on promotions and we're becoming more sophisticated, working with our partners on getting the best return on the promotion.

Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've",526,"Thank you. Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. 
So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing -- has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. 
We went in with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it's being 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. 
And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand. It took us a little bit longer but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last 2 quarters, especially the last quarter, it's been very high, right? And it's not only the fact that we've added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. 
So we see our 3 core brands continue to -- or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the subsegments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we're clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we're also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. 
So we continue to play on the periphery, but we're making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and obviously, very meaningful for the overall category. So we're very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that -- in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. 
So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future. So a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we're very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brands. So we're feeling good. We're feeling very good about PBNA."

And then the -- looking out more longer term, we've obviously -- we're seeing a really pronounced rise in the commodity spectrum across-the-board in CPG lately. Corn, certainly, one of those is up substantially year-over-year. So can you talk about how much you're covered for 2021 on commodities? 
But what I'm really more interested in strategically is in the event that these higher commodities do fully flow through to your P&L as we look later in the year or even into 2022, because it does feel like we're certainly in abnormal commodity environment, how do you approach that from an organizational standpoint? Can we expect more aggressive pricing? And how do you sort of approach that higher commodity spectrum theoretically as an organization given it does seem like an outsized increase?"

I'll jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question. If you look at really over the last 3 quarters, the gross margin decline we've had is really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent International M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition, and we expect that to continue into Q2. That's the last quarter before we finally lap out of that. 
In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now. And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities. 
In terms of managing it, we'll take a balanced approach on this as we always have, between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers. 
If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, of the 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the International M&A, and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country. Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I'd probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. 
As for '22, it's premature really to talk about that. I mean, we're so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that's something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on."

And then separately, could you help us understand consumer consumption patterns around pack sizes? Are your large pack sizes still driving the majority of the growth at Frito-Lay? And maybe how you expect that to trend.

The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So we feel good about that part. And we've been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So that's very positive. 
Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south. A lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So we're slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing, and we're very close to having a normal supply chain now. 
Your question on consumer trends, I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past. And it's the fact that we're seeing more and more small-portion consumption in the snacks business and, to a certain extent, also in the beverage business. So smaller units, especially now in the form of multi-packs, given there is an increase in home consumption, that's the consumer package that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that, creating more combination of multipacks, which drives eventually -- given that consumers like variety, it drives performance. And we're seeing a lot of growth there. I think that's going to be a structural trend in that business. 
Now to your question on mobility, yes, we're seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact, by definition, in consumption trends, in both large format and small format. So we're seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels, large format and small format. So those are all some trends that we're seeing. 
There's still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think. And we're going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day. So we have obviously a lot of insights, and we're -- all our future projections are based on those insights.

There is, as you say, a better revenue management across the different channels. But there is also an important productivity journey that the team started. So our cost per unit across many levers of the P&L are also improving. So we're seeing both a better mix management, better price realization and a better cost management through the P&L. 
We're also seeing a better returns on our A&M. We're seeing ROI on our A&M getting better, which will give us probably an opportunity also to optimize our A&M as we go forward in the year. So multiple vectors and good output from a lot of these different elements that will drive the overall profit improvement of PBNA."

Having said that, we're continuing to get much better at understanding and measuring the ROI of the different types of marketing we can do for the different brands, the different channels, the different types of content. And we're getting better at optimizing that, what is a very sizable A&M budget across the company.

Listen, it's clearly a focused category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So let me go one by one on the different components of it. 
The first thing I would say, the Starbucks Energy segment, which is, as you know, we've been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continue to grow at a double digit. And our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. 
Now when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things. As you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So we're feeling good about that part. 
When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say, from the customer, very strong reaction on our Mountain Dew Rise. Clearly, that's a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with Lebron James, and that's going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. 
When it comes to Rockstar, also, I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the products, with the international launch and relaunch here in the U.S. The early -- again, it's only 6 weeks in the market, really with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It's now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. 
But I would say, it's too early to call whether we're really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we're going to need a few more quarters to really understand what's happening at the consumer level. But from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the 4 vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have -- we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events. So good [ starting down the line ]."

Yes, China is a bit of a very special case now given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We're seeing -- obviously, there's a little bit of noise in our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending. We're obviously benefiting from that. 
On top of it, in snacks, we continue to gain share. We're building new manufacturing. We're building new agro programs. We're building -- we're investing in rural areas for better distribution of our snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought Be & Cheery, which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we've been building for many years. 
On the snack side, I would say, very encouraged by the by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we've made on rural areas and more capital distribution. 
With regards to beverages, it's been a -- it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we've been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China, in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high-growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. 
The growth expectations of the economy are positive as was recently laid out by the government, and we're seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market, and what we're seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. And so there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend. But overall, as a country, it continues to be a very important and very large business opportunity for us."

I did want to clarify one thing in regards to Kaumil's question. I mentioned $20 million to $30 million of period -- periods of internal term that we use.

And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing -- has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and is starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. 
We went in with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it's been 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean, the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. 
And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand. It took us a little bit longer but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last 2 quarters, especially the last quarter, it's been very high, right? And it's not only the fact that we've added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. 
So we see our 3 core brands continue to -- or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That, complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the subsegments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we're clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we're also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. So we continue to play on the periphery, but we're making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and obviously, very meaningful for the overall category.  
So we're very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that -- in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. 
So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future. So a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we're very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brands.

And then the -- looking out more longer term, we've obviously -- we're seeing a really pronounced rise in the commodity spectrum across the board in CPG lately. Corn, certainly, one of those is up substantially year-over-year. So can you talk about how much you're covered for 2021 on commodities? 
But what I'm really more interested in strategically is in the event that these higher commodities do fully flow through to your P&L as we look later in the year or even into 2022, because it does feel like we're certainly in abnormal commodity environment, how do you approach that from an organizational standpoint? Can we expect more aggressive pricing? And how do you sort of approach that higher commodity spectrum theoretically as an organization given it does seem like an outsized increase?"

I'll jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question. If you look at really over the last 3 quarters, the gross margin decline we've had has really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent International M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition, and we expect that to continue into Q2. That's the last quarter before we finally lap out of that. 
In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now. And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities. 
In terms of managing it, we'll take a balanced approach on this as we always have, between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers. 
If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, of the 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the International M&A, and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country. Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I'd probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. 
As for '22, it's premature really to talk about that. I mean, we're so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that's something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on."

So maybe you could drill down further on some of the momentum you're seeing in this business. And give us a sense of how strong results could have been without the winter storms. 
And then separately, could you help us understand consumer consumption patterns around pack sizes? Are your large pack sizes still driving the majority of the growth at Frito-Lay? And maybe how you expect that to trend.

The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So we feel good about that part. And we've been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So that's very positive. 
Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south. A lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So we're slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing, and we're very close to having a normal supply chain now. 
Your question on consumer trends, I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past. And it's the fact that we're seeing more and more small-portion consumption in the snacks business and, to a certain extent, also in the beverage business. So smaller units, especially now in the form of multi-packs, given there is an increase in home consumption, that's the consumer package that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that, creating more combination of multipacks, which drives eventually -- given that consumers like variety, it drives performance. And we're seeing a lot of growth there. I think that's going to be a structural trend in that business. 
Now to your question on mobility, yes, we're seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact, by definition, in consumption trends, in both large format and small format. So we're seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels, large format and small format. So those are all some trends that we're seeing. 
There's still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think. And we're going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day. So we have obviously a lot of insights, and we're -- all our future projections are based on those insights. I think the consumer will show us more as we go along in the next, I would say, 6 to 9 months, yes."

Listen, it's clearly a focus category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So let me go one by one on the different components of it. 
The first thing I would say, the Starbucks Energy segment, which is, as you know, we've been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continue to grow at a double digit. And our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. 
Now when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things. As you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So we're feeling good about that part. 
When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say, from the customer, very strong reaction on our Mountain Dew Rise. Clearly, that's a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with LeBron James, and that's going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. 
When it comes to Rockstar, also, I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the products, with the international launch and relaunch here in the U.S. The early -- again, it's only 6 weeks in the market, really with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It's now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. 
But I would say, it's too early to call whether we're really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we're going to need a few more quarters to really understand what's happening at the consumer level. But from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the 4 vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have -- we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events. So good starting point, Laurent."

Yes, China is a bit of a very special case now given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We're seeing -- obviously, there's a little bit of noise in our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending. We're obviously benefiting from that. 
On top of it, in snacks, we continue to gain share. We're building new manufacturing. We're building new agro programs. We're building -- we're investing in rural areas for better distribution of our snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought Be & Cheery, which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we've been building for many years. 
On the snack side, I would say, very encouraged by the by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we've made on rural areas and more capital distribution. 
With regards to beverages, it's been a -- it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we've been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China, in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high-growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. 
The growth expectations of the economy are positive as was recently laid out by the government, and we're seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market, and what we're seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. And so there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend. But overall, as a country, it continues to be a very important and very large business opportunity for us."

In other parts of the world, we haven't seen a reduction, really. So if you think about Latin America, if you think about Europe, Africa, we see actually pretty much the same number of cases that we're seeing late in the year. So our COVID costs will continue to be, obviously, to a lower level than last year, but we'll continue to be a factor. And there is -- we go with how the government or broader society is able to manage the pandemic in the different geographies. So that is the situation.

But at least, as for right now, we're doing fine on that front. 
And then as you know, and as Ramon alluded to as well, last year, we had around $800 million of COVID costs. And as I've commented before, our exit rate on the quarter was about, I believe it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million to $30 million a period. We ought to see that number stay the same to sequentially decline over time, as Ramon noted, given the -- as COVID cases go away, obviously, our costs tend to go away as well."

In the past, when we've seen inflation in corn and other inputs that impact Frito-Lay, especially in North America, my perception is that PepsiCo has often ended up cost advantage for a period of time versus competition just because I think your hedging programs tend to be more structural and long dated versus peers. So I guess is that fair? And if so, do you see that phenomenon taking shape in the current year as well? And I guess if you do, do you see that more as an opportunity to improve profitability, maybe consolidate a bit more share while you are advantaged or perhaps a combination?

In the Frito-Lay business, we're going to sort of run our play. We have our pricing strategies in place right now, and my expectation is we'll execute against those. And frankly, we'll see how competition responds to them. So it's a little bit hard for me to project how it is they're going to operate. But I think we, by and large, have our pricing plans in place. 
Again, will we use some surgical net revenue management techniques during the course of the next few quarters? Yes, we will. But by and large, I think we're relatively locked into what we're looking to do for the year. 
I did want to clarify one thing in regards to Kaumil's question. I mentioned $20 million to $30 million a period.  Period is an internal term that we use. So I should qualify that as $60 million to $80 million a quarter is probably the exit rate that we had on COVID costs. And then we'll see where we land as the year progresses."

Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing -- has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and is starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. 
We went in with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it's been 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean, the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. 
And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand. It took us a little bit longer but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last 2 quarters, especially the last quarter, it's been very high, right? And it's not only the fact that we've added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. 
So we see our 3 core brands continue to -- or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That, complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the subsegments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we're clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we're also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. So we continue to play on the periphery, but we're making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and obviously, very meaningful for the overall category.  
So we're very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that -- in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. 
So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future. So a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we're very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brands. So we're feeling good. We're feeling very good about PBNA."

A, first, just can you give us some sense of what adjusted gross margins would have been in the quarter, ex the acquisitions and the supply chain challenges you mentioned in Texas at quarter end that you mentioned in the prepared remarks?  
And then, b, looking out more longer term, we've obviously -- we're seeing a really pronounced rise in the commodity spectrum across the board in CPG lately. Corn certainly one of those, was up substantially year-over-year. So can you talk about how much you're covered for 2021 on commodities? 
But what I'm really more interested in strategically is in the event that these higher commodities do fully flow through to your P&L, as we look later in the year or even into 2022, because it does feel like we're certainly in abnormal commodity environment, how do you approach that from an organizational standpoint? Can we expect more aggressive pricing? And how do you sort of approach that higher commodity spectrum theoretically as an organization, given it does seem like an outsized increase?"

Yes, if you look at really over the last 3 quarters, the gross margin decline we've had has really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent international M&A, primarily the Pioneer",321,"Yes. I'll jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question. Yes, if you look at really over the last 3 quarters, the gross margin decline we've had has really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent international M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition, and we expect that to continue into Q2. That's the last quarter before we finally lap out of that. 
In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now. And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities. 
In terms of managing it, we'll take a balanced approach on this, as we always have, between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers. 
If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, of the 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the International M&A and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country. Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I'd probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. 
As for '22, it's premature really to talk about that. I mean, we're so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that's something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on."

So maybe you could drill down further on some of the momentum you're seeing in this business. And give us a sense of how strong results could have been without the winter storm.
And then separately, could you help us understand consumer consumption patterns around pack sizes? Are your large pack sizes still driving the majority of the growth at Frito-Lay? And maybe how you expect that to trend.
And finally, just curious to hear if you've seen any recovery in the impulse portion of that business yet? And then if not, why?"

The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So we feel good about that part. And we've been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and on our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So that's very positive. 
Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south. A lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So we're slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing, and we're very close to having a normal supply chain now. 
Your question on consumer trends. I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past. And it's the fact that we're seeing more and more small-portion consumption in the snacks business and to a certain extent, also in the beverage business. So smaller units, especially now in the form of multipacks, given there is an increase in home consumption, that's the consumer packages that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that, creating more combination of multipacks, which drives eventually -- given that consumers like variety, it drives performance. And we're seeing a lot of growth there. I think that's going to be a structural trend in that business. 
Now to your question on mobility. Yes, we're seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact, by definition, in consumption trends in both large format and small format. So we're seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels, large format and small format. So those are all -- some trends that we're seeing. 
There's still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think. And we're going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day. So we have obviously a lot of insights, and we're -- all our future projections are based on those insights. I think the consumer will show us more as we go along in the next, I would say, 6 to 9 months, yes?"

Listen, it's clearly a focused category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So let me go one by one on the different components of it. 
The first thing I would say, the Starbucks energy segment, which is, as you know, we've been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continue to grow at a double digit, and our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. 
Now when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things. As you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So we're feeling good about that part. 
When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say, from the customer, very strong reaction on our Mtn Dew Rise. Clearly, that's a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with LeBron James, and that's going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. 
When it comes to Rockstar, also, I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the product, with the international launch and relaunch here in the U.S. The early -- again, it's only 6 weeks in the market, really, with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It's now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. 
But I would say, it's too early to call whether we're really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we're going to need a few more quarters to really understand what's happening in the consumer level. But from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the 4 vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events. So good starting point, Laurent."

Yes, China is a bit of a very special case now, given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We're seeing -- obviously, there's a little bit of noise on our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending. We're obviously benefiting from that. 
On top of it, in snacks, we continue to gain share. We're building new manufacturing. We're building new agro programs. We're building -- we're investing in rural areas for better distribution of our snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought Be & Cheery, which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we've been building for many years. 
On the snack side, I would say, very encouraged by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we've made on rural areas and more capital distribution. 
With regards to beverages, it's been a -- it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we've been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China, in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high-growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. 
The growth expectations of the economy are positive, as was recently laid out by the government, and we're seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market, and what we're seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. And so there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend. But overall, as a country, continues to be a very important and very large business opportunity for us."

In other parts of the world, we haven't seen a reduction, really. So if you think about Latin America, if you think about Europe, Africa, we see actually pretty much the same number of cases that were seen late in the year. So our COVID costs will continue to be, obviously, to a lower level than last year, but will continue to be a factor. And there is -- we go with how the government or broader society is able to manage the pandemic in the different geographies. So that is the situation.

But at least, as for right now, we're doing fine on that front. 
And then as you know, and as Ramon alluded to as well, last year, we had around $800 million of COVID cost. And as I've commented before, our exit rate on the quarter was about, I believe it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million to $30 million a period. We ought to see that number stay the same to sequentially decline over time, as Ramon noted, given the -- as COVID cases go away, obviously, our costs tend to go away as well."

In the past, when we've seen inflation in corn and other inputs that impact Frito-Lay, especially in North America, my perception is that PepsiCo has often ended up cost advantage for a period of time versus competition just because I think your hedging programs tend to be more structural and long dated versus peers. So I guess, is that fair? And if so, do you see that phenomenon taking shape in the current year as well? And I guess if you do, do you see that more as an opportunity to improve profitability, maybe consolidate a bit more share while you are advantaged or perhaps a combination?

Again, will we use some surgical net revenue management techniques during the course of the next few quarters? Yes, we will. But by and large, I think we're relatively locked into what we're looking to do for the year. 
I did want to clarify one thing in regards to Kaumil's question. I mentioned $20 million to $30 million of period -- periods of internal term that we use.

Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing -- has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and is starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. 
We went then with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it's been 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean, the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. 
And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand, where we -- it took us a little bit longer, but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last 2 quarters, especially the last quarter, it's been very high, right? And it's not only the fact that we've added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. 
So we see our 3 core brands continue to -- or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That, complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the subsegments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we're clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we're also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. So we continue to play on the periphery, but we're making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and, obviously, very meaningful for the overall category.  
So we're very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that -- in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. 
So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future. So a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we're very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business, given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brand. So we're feeling good. We're feeling very good about PBNA."

But what I'm really more interested in strategically is in the event that these higher commodities do fully flow through to your P&L, as we look later in the year or even into 2022, because it does feel like we're certainly in abnormal commodity environment, how do you approach that from an organizational standpoint? Can we expect more aggressive pricing? And how do you sort of approach that higher commodity spectrum theoretically as an organization, given it does seem like an outsized increase?"

I'll jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question. Yes, if you look at really over the last 3 quarters, the gross margin decline we've had has really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent international M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition, and we expect that to continue into Q2. That's the last quarter before we finally lap out of that. 
In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now. And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities. 
In terms of managing it, we'll take a balanced approach on this, as we always have, between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers. 
If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, of the 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the International M&A and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country. Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I'd probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. 
As for '22, it's premature really to talk about that. I mean, we're so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that's something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on."

So maybe you could drill down further on some of the momentum you're seeing in this business. And give us a sense of how strong results could have been without the winter storm.
And then separately, could you help us understand consumer consumption patterns around pack sizes? Are your large pack sizes still driving the majority of the growth at Frito-Lay? And maybe how you expect that to trend.
And finally, just curious to hear if you've seen any recovery in the impulse portion of that business yet? And then if not, why?"

The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So we feel good about that part. And we've been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and on our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So that's very positive. 
Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south. A lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So we're slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing, and we're very close to having a normal supply chain now. 
Your question on consumer trends. I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past. And it's the fact that we're seeing more and more small-portion consumption in the snacks business and to a certain extent, also in the beverage business. So smaller units, especially now in the form of multipacks, given there is an increase in home consumption, that's the consumer packages that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that, creating more combination of multipacks, which drives eventually -- given that consumers like variety, it drives performance. And we're seeing a lot of growth there. I think that's going to be a structural trend in that business. 
Now to your question on mobility. Yes, we're seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact, by definition, in consumption trends in both large format and small format. So we're seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels, large format and small format. So those are all -- some trends that we're seeing. 
There's still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think. And we're going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day. So we have obviously a lot of insights, and we're -- all our future projections are based on those insights. I think the consumer will show us more as we go along in the next, I would say, 6 to 9 months, yes?"

Listen, it's clearly a focus category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So let me go one by one on the different components of it. 
The first thing I would say, the Starbucks energy segment, which is, as you know, we've been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continue to grow at a double digit, and our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. 
Now when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things. As you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So we're feeling good about that part. 
When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say, from the customer, very strong reaction on our Mtn Dew Rise. Clearly, that's a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we're getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with LeBron James, and that's going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. 
When it comes to Rockstar, also, I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the product, with the international launch and relaunch here in the U.S. The early -- again, it's only 6 weeks in the market, really, with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It's now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. 
But I would say, it's too early to call whether we're really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we're going to need a few more quarters to really understand what's happening in the consumer level. But from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the 4 vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events. So good starting point, Laurent."

Yes, China is a bit of a very special case now, given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We're seeing -- obviously, there's a little bit of noise on our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending. We're obviously benefiting from that. 
On top of it, in snacks, we continue to gain share. We're building new manufacturing. We're building new agro programs. We're building -- we're investing in rural areas for better distribution of our snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought Be & Cheery, which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we've been building for many years. 
On the snack side, I would say, very encouraged by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we've made on rural areas and more capital distribution. 
With regards to beverages, it's been a -- it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we've been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China, in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high-growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. 
The growth expectations of the economy are positive, as was recently laid out by the government, and we're seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market, and what we're seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. And so there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend.

In the past, when we've seen inflation in corn and other inputs that impact Frito-Lay, especially in North America, my perception is that PepsiCo has often ended up cost advantage for a period of time versus competition just because I think your hedging programs tend to be more structural and long dated versus peers. So I guess, is that fair? And if so, do you see that phenomenon taking shape in the current year as well? And I guess if you do, do you see that more as an opportunity to improve profitability, maybe consolidate a bit more share while you are advantaged or perhaps a combination? Just how you're thinking about that and if my underlying premise is correct in the first place."

In the Frito-Lay business, we're going to sort of run our play. We have our pricing strategies in place right now, and my expectation is we'll execute against those. And frankly, we'll see how competition responds to them. So it's a little bit hard for me to project how it is they're going to operate. But I think we, by and large, have our pricing plans in place. 
Again, will we use some surgical net revenue management techniques during the course of the next few quarters? Yes, we will. But by and large, I think we're relatively locked into what we're looking to do for the year. 
I did want to clarify one thing in regards to Kaumil's question. I mentioned $20 million to $30 million a period. Period is an internal term that we use. So I should qualify that as $60 million to $80 million a quarter is probably the exit rate that we had on COVID costs. And then we'll see where we land as the year progresses."

Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing -- has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and is starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. 
We went then with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it's been 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean, the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. 
And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand, where we -- it took us a little bit longer, but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last 2 quarters, especially the last quarter, it's been very high, right? And it's not only the fact that we've added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. 
So we see our 3 core brands continue to -- or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That, complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the subsegments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we're clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we're also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. So we continue to play on the periphery, but we're making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and, obviously, very meaningful for the overall category.  
So we're very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that -- in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. 
So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future. So a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we're very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business, given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brand. So we're feeling good. We're feeling very good about PBNA."

Yes, I think the results of the PBNA business are a consequence of the work we've been doing for the last, I would say, 3 years or so trying to improve the equity of the brands, improve the execution, improve the organizational focus, et cetera. We're very pleased with the performance of all our brands. We are -- if you think about Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Gatorade, all our large brands are growing very nicely. And then on top of that, our, let's say, small or medium-sized brands like Starbucks or Purely for bubly, others are also growing at a very nice pace. So I think the portfolio is working very well for us as a consequence of the great work the team has done on innovation and brand and the field teams are doing on execution. So that is the area we feel more proud about. 
Obviously, as you mentioned, there is a channel shift as consumers are moving more in the U.S. There's more mobility. The foodservice, away from home channel, is growing faster in Q2 obviously as you compare to last year. And that's a tailwind to the business that I think will continue over the next quarters. But the most important thing, I think, for us to assess is that the business has been investing, and it's delivering as a content of that. We're gaining share if you -- I'm sure you've looked at the share numbers for the business in the last few months, and the business keeps gaining share, keeps getting more competitive.

You mentioned the on-premise strength, obviously, in beverages versus accelerating corporate market share. And maybe just give us a little more detail and the numbers around market share performance? 
And then on a go-forward basis, given the strong market share trends, given the gross margin pressure we saw in Q2, can you just talk a little bit conceptually about pricing plans going forward in Frito and beverages and how the near-term promotional environment also may impact that, but just sort of your thoughts around pricing going forward in light of the market share strength and some of the gross margin pressure."

I think when you look at the overall PepsiCo business, obviously, I mean, the biggest highlight for me is that the resilience of our snack business, right? So if you think about last year, it grew high single digits. This year, it's growing high single digit. That is extraordinary if you think about the shifting consumer behavior, how our portfolio is able to adapt to more of an in-home-consumption pattern or more of an away-from-home consumption part. And so that part of the business is solid. It continues to grow at very high level in the U.S. and also internationally. Obviously, the beverage category is benefiting from the change of patterns and behaviors of consumers. And it was very negatively affected in the away-from-home consumption last year. Obviously, we're benefiting now from that. And you see that in the acceleration of obviously our North America business. But globally, our beverage business is growing much faster in the away-from-home business, obviously, as stores are open and people are moving around. So that from the category dynamics. 
Across the board, we're seeing a share of market momentum in the business as a consequence of the investments we've been making for the last few years. And this is not only the U.S. This is across most of our large markets internationally, developing and emerging markets. And that, as I said, is we're having better innovation, better focus on our brand messaging, better execution in store, better demand to supply connectivity. And so all that is working very well to our advantage. So that's in terms of growth and the key levers as you were asking on what's driven the acceleration of the business. 
When you come to our pricing and our -- how we're going to deal with pricing in the coming months. I would say, obviously, same as everybody else, we're seeing inflation in our business across many of our ingredients and some of our inputs in labor and freight and everything else. So we operate in the same context. We feel very quite comfortable or confident that through a combination of net revenue management initiatives and increased productivity, we can navigate this. And I mean we're looking at, obviously, staying within our long-term guidance for the coming year. So it is a combination of tools that we're having. We're working with our partners in the retail space and in the away-from-home space to make the right decisions in pricing to give the consumers with us once we improve our margin there."

Channel mix, obviously, is a benefit as small foodservice as well as the convenience store channel continues to do well. Convenience grew double digits. The foodservice channel as you saw doubled, and that's a good profitable channel for us. So that clearly was a tailwind. But keep in mind, that's really getting us back to normal in a lot of ways as well. so I don't view this as extraordinary. I'd just view it as we're getting back to sort of a more normal world, although clearly not all the way back. 
In addition to that, the energy category, which we participate in, in a bigger way, obviously, has higher margins. Mountain Dew Rise is off to a terrific start. Rockstar, we're slowly steadily making progress on that. As we said, we believe that would take some time, and we continue to believe that will take some time, but we're seeing some of the right indications there. And then as you noted, the combination of sort of operating leverage in the business plus a reduction in COVID costs as we expected also contributed. So some of the things that we've talked about in past quarters in terms of getting PBNA on the road to much stronger margins, we are certainly very acutely aware of it, and we are focused as a team on continuing to drive that improved performance."

So you now expect $1 billion in incremental annual savings through 2026. I think this was generally expected by the market and translates to over 100 basis points per annum of margins per any sort of reinvestment. So the question is, do you see a greater likelihood that shareholders could see a greater degree of earnings flow through in this phase of the restructuring program? And I ask that in the context of a clearly healthier top line coming out of the pandemic and multiyear investments that the company has made, some of which we've discussed on this call that have already been put into the P&L. So -- and if the answer is no, what do you see as the most attractive areas of investment within the portfolio, whether this is by product line or geography?"

Number two, part of what we're trying to do is shape the company for the future. And in doing so, we're obviously taking cost out in certain places, and then we're investing in certain places like digitalizing the supply chain and making our interactions with customers and consumers much more efficient than they were in the past. So I think what you'll see is, to some degree, those things will balance out. We've always talked about something in the range of 30 bps of margin improvement, that 20 to 30 range that we've been in. And I think you should assume that that's where we're going to be going forward as well on an ongoing basis. Now obviously, quarter-to-quarter, those things may shift around a little bit, but that's sort of the track that we remain on along with accelerated revenue growth. So the combination of accelerating revenue growth and 20 to 30 basis points of margin improvement translates into nice EPS. How much we deliver in every quarter, obviously, it will be a product of the specifics of that quarter."

Obviously, gross margin was down in the quarter. That was no surprise to anyone. The biggest driver of that, by far, were the big international acquisitions that we had that are just inherently lower gross margin businesses, still good businesses to be sure, but lower gross margin. So the math of that, obviously dragged them down to some degree. 
In addition to that, obviously, there's sort of ongoing inflationary pressure. We insulate ourselves to some degree based on our forward buying program, and that has actually helped us clearly this year. There'll be a bit more pressure in the back half. But at the same time, as you know, we tend to take pricing after Labor Day in both of our businesses, and I think you would expect to see that pattern continue. So is there somewhat more inflation out there? There is. Are we going to be pricing to deal with it? We certainly are. The investments in our brands and the investments that we've made in supplying our customers, I think, is what enables us to take that pricing as we have every year."

The Mountain Dew Rise, we're very happy with the initial execution and the initial consumer reaction. So execution was very good from our teams. We tend to do that quite well. We have good system that executes granularly at a good level. And we're seeing very good initial trial from consumers. Very good repeats.

It's going very well. It's going above our initial expectations for the business. We'll continue to invest. 
When it comes to the U.S., several acquisitions, the CytoSport business, which that was a Muscle Mill brand and Evolve brand and others, that business is really thriving. Clearly, we see that consumers are moving into protein and sports, and that's a space that will continue to grow. Very positive momentum with the 2 brands. And there were some jewels in that business like Volt and some others that we're trying to take the maximum out of those brands as you will see in the coming future. 
The Rockstar, I mentioned. Rockstar was an acquisition that gave us a great business, but also an enablement for a broader strategy. I think we're executing against those plans. And we feel very good about it. The other acquisition we did in the U.S. in the snack business was the Better For You company, the PopCorners brands and some other brands that, that business had. That is an amazing performance. And we knew that there was a space for the pop-in technology and for the PopCorners brands playing in the healthier space for snacking and a bit premium. The truth is that we keep adding capacity. And the Frito team are really doing a fantastic work in terms of expanding distribution and building the brand. So we feel very good about that one. Then when you go internationally, there were 2 focused acquisitions, 1 based in the Africa expansion, Pioneer business. And that is we're in the middle of the integration. Obviously, COVID has had an impact in the integration of that business. But we're proceeding -- this is a horizon 5 type of investment. Africa will be source of growth for all our company's around the world in the coming decades. And that's an investment with that time of that type of perspective. 
And then the other business was the Bee and Cheery business in China, which is a direct-to-consumer snack business that complement our potato chips and corn business in China with a lot of local snacks and a new go-to-market in the form of direct-to-consumer. That is also working very well. We're starting to integrate. We're launching some of the Bee and Cheery products into our, let's say, brick-and-mortar distribution system that we -- that's pretty good in China. And the other way around, we're putting some of our brands into the Bee and Cheery direct-to-consumer model. So I would say the execution is good. The strategic intent that we had with all these acquisitions is working. The business case continues to be as we thought. So good progress, I would say, in all these different acquisitions."

The rest of Asia, a bit more challenged. So we're seeing -- when you think about Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, even in Australia, there have been challenges more there in the -- I think consumers going back to normal behavior. So that might take a little bit of time. 
Obviously, Africa, Middle East, India, you guys are reading the news now. So there's a lot of -- still a lot of challenges there with running normal operations in all those markets. So it will be a while before those markets go back to normality. 
Eastern Europe, very strong, actually, in spite of some of the COVID challenges in Russia specifically. Consumers are moving around. And Eastern Europe is very strong, Turkey included where they had some latest lockdown. So we see those markets performing very well. 
Western Europe, obviously, away from home is improving compared to last year. But still, you don't see the normal traffic north south in Europe this time of the day -- this time of the year, sorry. Consumers are staying in their countries. They are not -- there's not going to be the usual movement of people in Europe, north south. So that's -- we plan for that, and we plan to execute our summer programs around that. 
Latin America, and I happen to be -- I was in Mexico a few weeks ago. Still, the pandemic is very visible. But consumers are increasing their mobility. And that obviously is having positive impact in our small shops performance and somehow the restaurant business. The same with Brazil.

Listen, we're still obviously looking at consumer behaviors, and I think consumers are also trying to figure it out at this point. We see some trends that I think we are going to stay. The most important one probably is the shopping behavior is changing. I think e-commerce or, let's call it, e-commerce in a broader sense is going to continue to be a preferred way of shopping, something that a lot of families tried during the pandemic, and we're seeing those families stick into that behavior. So that is going to be a permanent trend. And obviously, we've been investing in e-commerce for quite some time, capabilities, supply chain, advertising models, et cetera. And we're working very closely with all our customers to pivot to that. So I think that's something that's going to stay. 
The home as a hub is also a trend that we're seeing more. I think consumers are venturing out, but they're still doing a lot of their activities at home. And we foresee a flexible working model where consumers are going to spend more time at home, and they're not going to go back to the office kind of every day of the week. Obviously, certain type of people, not everybody. We see that as an opportunity for our snacks and our breakfast and our food business in general and also for our beverages business. 
We see consumers in general being more concerned about what we call holistic health, so mental health, physical health. Consumers are exercising more. Consumers are more -- making more balances between their food choices, which, for us, generates a couple of important trends. Portion control, we're seeing that as a strategy consumers are following, and that's giving us a huge growth in our variety packs and multipacks, and it's a trend that we're capturing and I think will continue. 
The other one is consumers move into healthier spaces in our categories. Clearly, nonsugar is growing very fast. I think we're very well positioned from the R&D point of view and the innovation point of view on non-sugar. And the same with more permissible snacks where we -- in the last few years, we've been -- between acquisitions and on development, we have a very good portfolio that is gaining share in that in their particular space. So those are some of the trends that we're seeing. Obviously, consumers will continue to evolve. But obviously, we're following very close to what's happening across different parts of the world and adapting very fast our brands and our innovation, our channel resources to that -- to those new trends."

Listen, I think the -- obviously, consumers are moving, I think, and it's going to be a long-term trend into healthier choices in beverages and in snacks, right? And so we've been working on this for a long time in our R&D. And I think we're getting very good at providing the consumers with very good taste experiences and functional experiences with zero sugar. And that is a great capability we have in the system. We have great examples of that. If you only think about for example, Gatorade Zero, right, I mean, this is a massive innovation. It's over $1 billion in innovation with only for, I would say, 20 months, something like that in the marketplace. So we're able to provide functionality, good taste at a zero Sugar even in spaces like Gatorade. Clearly, for more refreshing experiences or more indulgent experiences, I think the Pepsi Zero solution or the Mountain Dew Zero solutions, those are extremely great tasting products that are getting a lot of consumer favor. If you think about our European business, for example, the equivalent of Pepsi Zero, which is Pepsi Max in Europe is leader in many of the European markets. We have a much higher share in the nonsugar category than we have in the sugar category. And I think that's where we've been investing for a long time. We'll continue to invest. We see that trend not stopping for the foreseeable future. And it's where we are putting our R&D investments, our brand investments and our innovation investment.

Bonnie, let me try to answer a few of those elements. Yes, I think the results of the PBNA business are a consequence of the work we've been doing for the last, I would say, 3 years or so, trying to improve the equity of the brands, improve the execution, improve the organizational focus, et cetera. 
We're very pleased with the performance of all our brands. We are -- if you think about Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Gatorade, all our large brands are growing very nicely. And then on top of that, our, let's say, small or medium-sized brands like Starbucks or Pure Leaf or bubly, others are also growing at a very nice pace. So I think the portfolio is working very well for us as a consequence of the great work the team has done on innovation and brand and the field teams are doing on execution. So that is the area we feel more proud about. 
Obviously, as you mentioned, there is a channel shift as consumers are moving more in the U.S. There's more mobility. The foodservice, away from home channel, is growing faster in Q2 obviously as you compare to last year. And that's a tailwind to the business that I think will continue. -- over the next quarters. But the most important thing, I think, for us to assess is that the business has been investing, and it's delivering as a consequence of that. We're gaining share if you -- I'm sure you've looked at the share numbers for the business in the last few months, and the business keeps gaining share, keeps getting more competitive. So that's a good sign of the return on those investments."

Obviously, a strong organic sales result in the quarter, to your average trends also accelerated sequentially. And presumably, it was -- the top line was better than you expected with the raised full year sales guidance. So I was just hoping for a bit more granularity on how much of the upside or the acceleration sequentially was driven by stronger category growth. You mentioned the on-premise strength, obviously, in beverages versus accelerating corporate market share. And maybe just give us a little more detail and the numbers around market share performance? 
And then on a go-forward basis, given the strong market share trends, given the gross margin pressure we saw in Q2, can you just talk a little bit, conceptually, about pricing plans going forward in Frito and beverages and how the near-term promotional environment also may impact that, but just sort of your thoughts around pricing going forward in light of the market share strength and some of the gross margin pressure?"

I think when you look at the overall PepsiCo business, obviously, I mean, the biggest highlight for me is that the resilience of our snack business, right? So if you think about last year, it grew high single digits. This year, it's growing high single digit. That is extraordinary if you think about the shift in consumer behavior, how our portfolio is able to adapt to more of an in-home consumption pattern or a more of an away-from-home consumption part. And so that part of the business is solid. It continues to grow at very high level in the U.S. and also internationally. 
Obviously, the beverage category is benefiting from the change of patterns and behaviors of consumers and it was very negatively affected in the away-from-home consumption last year. Obviously, we're benefiting now from that and you see that in the acceleration of, obviously, our North America business. But globally, our beverage business is growing much faster in the away-from-home business, obviously, as stores are open and people are moving around. So that's from the category dynamics. 
Across the board, we're seeing a share of market momentum in the business as a consequence of the investments we've been making for the last few years. And this is not only the U.S. This is across most of our large markets internationally, developing and emerging markets. And that, as I said, is we're having better innovation, better focus on our brand messaging, better execution in store, better demand to supply connectivity. And so all that is working very well to our advantage. So that's in terms of growth and the key levers as you were asking on what's driven the acceleration of the business. 
When you come to our pricing and our -- how we're going to deal with pricing in the coming months, I would say, obviously, same as everybody else, we're seeing inflation in our business, across many of our raw ingredients and some of our inputs in labor and freight and everything else. So we operate in the same context. We feel very --quite comfortable or confident that through a combination of net revenue management initiatives and increased productivity, we can navigate this. And, I mean, we're looking at, obviously, staying within our long-term guidance for the coming year. So it is a combination of tools that we're having. We're working with our partners in the retail space and in the away-from-home space to make the right decisions in pricing to keep the consumers with us whilst we improve our margin, yes."

Channel mix, obviously, is a benefit as small foodservice as well as the convenience store channel continues to do well. Convenience grew double digits. The foodservice channel, as you saw doubled, and that's a good profitable channel for us. So that clearly was a tailwind. But keep in mind, that's really getting us back to normal in a lot of ways as well. so I don't view this as extraordinary. I'd just view it as we're getting back to sort of a more normal world, although clearly not all the way back. 
In addition to that, the energy category, which we participate in, in a bigger way, obviously, has higher margins. Mtn Dew Rise is off to a terrific start. ROCKSTAR, we're slowly steadily making progress on that. As we said, we believe that would take some time, and we continue to believe that'll take some time, but we're seeing some of the right indications there. 
And then as you noted, the combination of sort of operating leverage in the business plus a reduction in COVID costs, as we expected, also contributed. So some of the things that we've talked about in past quarters in terms of getting PBNA on the road to much stronger margins, we are certainly very acutely aware of it, and we are focused, as a team, on continuing to drive that improved performance."

So you now expect $1 billion in incremental annual savings through 2026. I think this was generally expected by the market and translates to over 100 basis points per annum of margins pre- any sort of reinvestment. 
So the question is, do you see a greater likelihood that shareholders could see a greater degree of earnings flow through in this phase of the restructuring program? And I ask that in the context of a clearly healthier top line coming out of the pandemic and multiyear investments that the company has made, some of which we've discussed on this call that have already been put into the P&L. So -- and if the answer is no, what do you see as the most attractive areas of investments within the portfolio, whether this is by product line or geography?"

Number two, part of what we're trying to do is shape the company for the future. And in doing so, we're obviously taking cost out in certain places, and then we're investing in certain places like digitalizing the supply chain and making our interactions with customers and consumers much more efficient than they were in the past. 
So I think what you'll see is, to some degree, those things will balance out. We've always talked about something in the range of 30 bips of margin improvement, that 20 to 30 range that we've been in. And I think you should assume that, that's where we're going to be going forward as well on an ongoing basis. Now obviously, quarter-to-quarter, those things may shift around a little bit, but that's sort of the track that we remain on along with accelerated revenue growth. So the combination of accelerating revenue growth and 20 to 30 basis points of margin improvement translates into nice EPS. How much we deliver in every quarter, obviously, will be a product of the specifics of that quarter."

The biggest driver of that, by far, were the big international acquisitions that we had that are just inherently lower gross margin businesses. Still good businesses to be sure, but lower gross margin. So the math of that, obviously dragged them down to some degree. 
In addition to that, obviously, there's sort of ongoing inflationary pressure. We insulate ourselves to some degree based on our forward buying program, and that has actually helped us clearly this year. There'll be a bit more pressure in the back half. But at the same time, as you know, we tend to take pricing after Labor Day in both of our businesses, and I think you would expect to see that pattern continue. So is there somewhat more inflation out there? There is. Are we going to be pricing to deal with it? We certainly are. The investments in our brands and the investments that we've made in supplying our customers, I think, is what enables us to take that pricing as we have every year."

So as we sort of evaluate scenarios for the balance of the year, we obviously contemplate both the opportunity factors that you've mentioned, all of which are quite real as well as the risk factors of we're not fully out of the pandemic at this point yet.
There's sort of lots of volatility to some degree in the U.S. and developed countries, but to an even greater degree in developing and emerging countries. So as we sort of think about our guidance, we sort of package all of that up, and we adopt the posture that gives us the ability to deliver under pretty well almost all scenarios, and that's why we've been as consistent as we have been in delivering our guidance. So I think as you think about our posture, I'll just remind you that, that's the way we tend to approach this."

But also, we're aware of the ups and downs that may come in the coming months, especially as we move into the colder months in the northern hemisphere.

Starbucks, we're super happy with the performance of that portfolio and the partnership with Starbucks is stronger than ever. And we continue to innovate. And I think the new products are excellent. The execution is excellent. That business is growing. When take-home and now away-from-home, it's really firing in all cylinders. 
The Mtn Dew Rise, we're very happy with the initial execution and the initial consumer reaction. So execution was very good from our teams. We tend to do that quite well. We have good DSD system that executes granularly at a good level. And we're seeing very good initial trial from consumers, very good repeats. If you follow on social networks, all the comments are extremely positive about the taste, about the efficacy of the product, so good. It's 1% of energy, 1% share is clearly -- we're aspiring for much more, but it's only been in the market for 3 months. So very a good start. I think it's a solid foundation for what is going to be, I think, a great business. As you say, we continue to distribute the bank business as per our commitment, and that's going well. 
And then on ROCKSTAR, we were always very transparent. This is a multiyear effort, right? We're trying to put strong foundations, strong foundations in the areas of product. So we're changing some of the formulas. I think the nonsugar portfolio is excellent. And that's the area of the category that's growing the fastest. 
Our execution is improving a lot. We gain distribution, and we gain better visibility of the brand. And I think our brand position is quite good. We found a niche that is -- wasn't there, clearly, is differentiated from Red Bull and from Monster, and it's a unique position in that we plan to insist on, and I think we're getting good feedback as well on that positioning. So we -- as I said, it's going to be a multiyear. We're very focused on the domestic business here in the U.S., but also the international teams are very focused on that priority. and we will execute on a multiquarter, multiyear basis. And we're very positive with what we're seeing. Again, we'll keep updating you every quarter on how things are evolving, but positive so far."

That business continues to thrive, I would say, in Europe and also in the U.S.. We're gaining a lot of household penetration in the U.S.. What we're -- the latest thing we're doing, and it's working quite well is putting some of our large beverage brands into the SodaStream, let's say, consumption model. We started in Europe. In the U.S., we started with bubly. bubly drops are working very, very well as an enhancer of the SodaStream experience, and we continue to push that combination of the bubly flavors and the SodaStream sparkling water experience. 
So I would say, still far from its potential. I mean, the household penetration is good in some sales. The European market is low. Everywhere else, we continue to build that. We continue to build the direct-to-consumer model, trying to get many more insights on consumption behaviors, and that is helping us, not only to develop the SodaStream business, but to develop the rest of our innovation and categories. 
So a pretty good ecosystem we're building of consumption at home, but also insights and innovation for the broader business. So we feel good about the momentum of the business, and we'll continue to -- it's going to continue to be a priority for us going forward."

I think it's, as I say, it's in a future consumption model that we're betting on. It's great in terms of consumer personalization of the product and obviously better for the planet. It's going very well. It's going above our initial expectations for the business. We'll continue to invest. 
When it comes to the U.S., several acquisitions, the CytoSport business, which that was a Muscle Milk brand, and EVOLVE brand and some others. That business is really thriving. Clearly, we see that consumers are moving into protein and sports, and that's a space that will continue to grow. Very positive momentum with the 2 brands. And there were some jewels in that business like EVOLVE and some others that we're trying to take the maximum out of those brands as you will see in the coming future. 
ROCKSTAR, I mentioned. ROCKSTAR was an acquisition that gave us a great business, but also an enablement for a broader strategy. I think we're executing against those plans and we feel very good about it. The other acquisition we did in the U.S. in the snack business was the Better For You company, the PopCorners brands and some other brands that, that business had. That is an amazing performance. And we knew that there was a space for the pop-in technology and for the PopCorners brands playing in the healthier space for snacking and a bit premium. 
The truth is that we keep adding capacity. And the Frito team are really doing a fantastic work in terms of expanding distribution and building the brand. So we feel very good about that one. Then when you go internationally, there were 2 focused acquisitions, 1 based in the Africa expansion, Pioneer business. And that is -- we're in the middle of the integration. Obviously, COVID has had an impact in the integration of that business. But we're proceeding -- this is a horizon-5 type of investment. Africa will be a source of growth for all our companies around the world in the coming decades. And that's an investment with that time of that type of perspective. 
And then the other business was the Be & Cheery business in China, which is a direct-to-consumer snack business that complement our potato chips and corn business in China with a lot of local snacks and a new go-to-market in the form of direct-to-consumer. That is also working very well. We're starting to integrate. We're launching some of the Be & Cheery products into our, let's say, brick-and-mortar distribution system that we -- that's pretty good in China. 
And the other way around, we're putting some of our brands into the Be & Cheery direct-to-consumer model. So I would say the execution is good. The strategic intent that we had with all these acquisitions is working. The business case continues to be as we thought. So good progress, I would say, in all these different acquisitions."

Our snacks business continues to do very strong, the same with beverages. So good macros in China. The rest of Asia, a bit more challenged. So we're seeing -- when you think about Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, even in Australia, there have been challenges more there in the -- I think consumers are going back to normal behavior. So that might take a little bit of time. 
Obviously, Africa, Middle East, India, you guys are reading the news now. So there's a lot of -- still a lot of challenges there with running normal operations in all those markets. So it will be a while before those markets go back to normality. 
Eastern Europe, very strong, actually, in spite of some of the COVID challenges in Russia specifically. Consumers are moving around. And Eastern Europe is very strong, Turkey included where they had some latest lockdowns. So we see those markets performing very well. 
Western Europe, obviously, away-from-home is improving compared to last year. But still, you don't see the normal traffic North, South in Europe this time of the day -- this time of the year, sorry. Consumers are staying in their countries. They are not -- there's not going to be the usual movement of people in Europe, North South. So that's -- we plan for that, and we plan to execute our summer programs around that. 
Latin America, and I happen to be -- I was in Mexico a few weeks ago. Still, the pandemic is very visible. But consumers are increasing their mobility. And that obviously is having positive impact in our small shops performance and somehow the restaurant business. The same with Brazil. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a picture of how the different parts of the world are behaving and the trends in our channels."

Listen, we're still obviously looking at consumer behaviors, and I think consumers are also trying to figure it out at this point. We see some trends that I think -- we -- are going to stay. The most important one probably is the shopping behavior is changing. I think e-commerce or, let's call it, e-commerce in a broader sense, it's going to continue to be a preferred way of shopping, something that a lot of families tried during the pandemic, and we're seeing those families stick into that behavior. So that is going to be a permanent trend. 
And obviously, we've been investing in e-commerce for quite some time, capabilities, supply chain, advertising models, et cetera. And we're working very closely with all our customers to pivot to that. So that -- I think that's something that's going to stay. 
The home as a hub is also a trend that we're seeing more. I think consumers are venturing out, but they're still doing a lot of their activities at home. And we foresee a flexible working model where consumers are going to spend more time at home, and they're not going to go back to the office kind of every day of the week. Obviously, certain type of people, not everybody. We see that as an opportunity for our snacks and our breakfast and our food business in general and also for our beverages business. 
We see consumers in general being more concerned about what we call holistic health, so mental health, physical health. Consumers are exercising more. Consumers are more -- making more balances between their food choices, which, for us, generates a couple of important trends. Portion control, we're seeing that as a strategy consumers are following, and that's giving us a huge growth in our variety packs and multipacks, and that is a trend that we're capturing, I think, will continue. 
The other one is consumers move into healthier spaces in our categories. Clearly, nonsugar is growing very fast. I think we're very well positioned from the R&D point of view and the innovation point of view on nonsugar. And the same with more permissible snacks where we -- in the last few years, we've been -- between acquisitions and on development, we have a very good portfolio that is gaining share in that particular space. So those are some of the trends that we're seeing. Obviously, consumers will continue to evolve. But obviously, we're following very close what's happening across different parts of the world and adapting very fast our brands and our innovation, our channel resources to that -- to those new trends."

And so we've been working on this for a long time in our R&D. And I think we're getting very good at providing the consumers with very good taste experiences and functional experiences with zero sugar. And that is a great capability we have in the system. 
We have great examples of that. If you only think about for example, Gatorade Zero, right? I mean, this is a massive innovation. It's over $1 billion innovation with only for, I would say, 20 months, something like that in the marketplace. So we're able to provide functionality, good taste at a zero sugar even in spaces like Gatorade. 
Clearly, for more refreshing experiences or more indulgent experiences, I think the Pepsi Zero solution or the Mountain Dew Zero solutions, those are extremely great tasting products that are getting a lot of consumer favor. 
If you think about our European business, for example, the equivalent of Pepsi Zero, which is Pepsi Max in Europe is leader in many of the European markets. We have a much higher share in the nonsugar category than we have in the sugar category. And I think that's where we've been investing for a long time. We'll continue to invest.

So I think we're playing in categories that are doing very well, I would say, during pandemic now as we are exiting the pandemic in many markets around the world. So that's one thing. 
The other component of our success is I think we're becoming much more competitive across both our categories in most of the markets where we operate. And that's been a consequence of the investments we've been making in the brands, I think, pretty good innovation. Obviously, investments we've made in go-to-market capacity, new capabilities, talent, everything else we've been talking to you for the last couple of years. So we're seeing the momentum across the business, and we're seeing that momentum continuing into the balance of the year. That's why we are kind of elevating our guidance for top line.

Historically, you've been with us for a long time, you know we typically don't talk about the following year until we get to February. But given the level of question and given the level of volatility, I think we thought it was prudent at least to give some indication of where we are on '22. 
In short, we expect our organic revenue growth and our core constant currency EPS growth to be in line with our long-term objectives in 2022. I know that's going to sort of create a lot of additional questions and, candidly, we're not ready to get into all of the details of that because, frankly, we're still early in our planning process. But I think we can say with confidence that we expect both revenue and core -- core constant currency EPS to be in line with the long-term objectives for '22.

And we're connecting better, I think, insights with R&D and the whole commercial execution to get the maximum return on those innovations. So I think the machine is ready and I think it keeps getting better year after year. 
So yes, our pipeline is strong. I would say our pipeline in 2021 was very strong as well and we're seeing the return from that innovation across the world. We're trying to be much more local, much more midterm or long term, much more incremental in the way we think about our innovation. 
So yes, when it comes to the investment behind the innovation, I think we have the right level of A&M, Bonnie, in our business to support innovation in a big way. And it's not only A&M but, as you know, we have a very strong push system that allows us to give innovation a lot of visibility and separated from the rest of the category to make sure that the trial levels are higher and the repeat levels are good.

You know that we forward buy 6 to 9 months those hedges that we had in the beginning of the year, starting to roll off, the new ones that are in place are higher cost. We had shared on the last call as well as in the prepared remarks today that we expect to be able to price through the inflation that we're facing, whether it be commodities inflation or other types of operating expense inflation. Some of that pricing occurred in the summer, much more of it is occurring in the fall in the beverage business and substantially all of it for 2021 in the snack food business is occurring really as we speak during these weeks right now. You also know that we forward buy that 6 to 9 months out. 
So we'll have a better handle on where exactly 2022 costs are going to land as we get into the first quarter of 2022. And I would expect us to price a bit more to be reflective of some of that sort of finalization of costs during the course of 2022. 
So Q4, some of the pricing coming through, the balance of it coming in Q1 of 2022. And the EPS guidance is reflective of all of that."

What we're seeing across the world is much lower elasticity on the pricing that we've seen historically. And that applies to developing markets, Western Europe and the U.S. So across the world, consumer seems to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before. 
It could be several hypothesis. I think in our case, our brands are stronger and I think our innovation is stronger, as you were saying. So that could be a factor. There could be also some behaviors as consumers are shopping faster in store and they might be paying less attention to pricing as a decision factor and they might be giving more relevance to the brands or brands that they feel more a bit closer to or more close -- yes, I would say, closer more and more emotionally attached to our brand. So we're seeing less elasticity and we're adjusting our models as we go. And that's obviously informing our decisions as we price balance of the year and into 2022."

So clearly, it was more impacted by the COVID mobility restrictions. So we're seeing those business coming back. And we have high scale and we have high share in many of those markets and our advertising and marketing is doing very well. So part of that is lapping. 
Your second question on scale. Yes, scale is getting -- obviously, every year, you see the growth level on the top line. We're getting to scale levels that are pretty good in many of the critical markets in that region. And that's giving us obviously the opportunity to do better in the marketplace and the flow-through is also stronger. 
So I think the 2 are relevant. If you think about the business going forward, those are very strategic markets for us going forward. And we continue to invest in everything from technologies so we can expand the portfolio. Talent, obviously, there's a war for talent in that part of the world. I think we're a scaled company that does a good job with developing talent in that part of the world. And then, obviously, our go-to-market being very strong. We have very good bottlers. And whenever we have our own operations, especially in the food business, we're also investing in digitalization and everything that goes with being more precise and more agile.

Or are there things you can do, either pricing- or restructuring-wise to get the gross margins in those acquired businesses up?"

Regarding the investments, I think the indication was that we're going to invest broadly back in the business, not just specifically into those acquired businesses as it relates to CapEx. Clearly, they're a part of that mix, you're absolutely right, but it was a broader comment around CapEx. 
And CapEx is at a higher sustained level than it was perhaps a few years ago as we're driving a faster rate of growth in the company and making our supply chain more resilient as well. So I think from that standpoint, the numbers are pretty consistent with the strategic intent that we had articulated a bit earlier.

Obviously, the U.S., Western Europe and also developing markets. We're seeing, obviously, the away-from-home business picking up. We -- I think in Q3, our away-from-home business is 90% indexed to '19. It keeps going up with every month that goes by. So clearly, that's a very positive sign. Now our convenience store business continues to do very well as consumers are having higher mobility. But the remarkable thing is that the in-home consumption continues to be quite high. So consumers are not -- are still using the home as a hub and continue to entertain at home and continue to do more things at home. And that's driving additional consumption at home versus the previous '19 level. 
So I think we're in a very good place where consumption at home is higher, consumption on the go is increasing and most of the channels in our food service business are picking up. So pretty good momentum. We expect those trends to continue for a while. We think that consumers have changed some of their habits from what we're reading in our insights. And we think that the beverage category is in a very positive situation for the upcoming future. 
We see the same with snacks, by the way. So the snack business, which is obviously a big part of our growth and sales and profits, we see that category very consistent across the world. And it was [ during ] the pandemic, it is now growing a very fast pace as consumers are gaining mobility as well. 
So I think, as I said at the beginning, our 2 categories where we operate are growing significantly higher than the food and beverage categories overall. And that is an advantage that we have as a company as we play in 2 categories that are from the consumer point of view are very preferred."

As you were saying, it was a focus and we invested to gain additional space, not only for our energy business, but for making sure that our innovation was incremental in space as that's what really makes a difference in the overall output of the company. 
We have -- if you think about the other variable, which is secondary displays or overall inventory on the floor, because we've had some supply chain constraints in some of our products, we've pulled back on some of the inventory on the perimeter during the summer, voluntarily I would say, just to make sure that we were able to service the customers at the right level. That's something temporary that obviously we will push back as we improve our -- the reliability of the supply chain. But clearly, it's a positive element, I would say, of our mix, of our top line growth, the additional space that we're driving for both our beverages and snacks across all the channels.

We're seeing a higher mobility than we were expecting earlier in the year.

Clearly, the consumers have found ways to increase their mobility and going back to their  routines of work, of school or whatever. So that's helped us. 
The other thing we've seen positive, as I mentioned earlier, is that the elasticity to pricing has been better than we had initially in our models as well. So we're seeing consumers staying with our brands better. I think that's a consequence of the investments we've been putting in our brands. And the way we're executing our pricing decisions are much more informed by data and granularity and we're able to execute different strategies by channel, by brand in a very nuanced way. I think those 2 elements are reducing the elasticity impact on our business and making our international business, I think, more competitive and thriving in the majority of the market.

There's a few things we're doing structurally with that business that I think will even accelerate its growth. One is we're building a direct-to-consumer business with SodaStream that is very relevant as it gives us a lot of first-party data and it allows us to have a lot of individual connection with consumers, understand their behaviors. And with that, we can ideate new products and we can also increase the -- let say, the lifetime value of those consumers. So that's one big driver. 
The other thing we're doing, especially in Europe, we're putting our brands in the SodaStream model. So we're giving consumers the opportunity not only to drink sparkling water, but to drink sparkling water with the best preferred flavors and the best brands of all their favorite brands. Be it bubly, be it Pepsi, be it Mountain Dew, be 7UP, whatever, in our international markets. So that's a big driver of how we think we can increase the lifetime value of those households and generate additional value.

I mean that is our commitment. We are going to continue to give you the best-tasting products in better, let's say, nutritional forms. 
Now you should also imagine new consumption models. As I was saying, Gatorade in powder or in tablets, that's clearly better for the planet and probably easier for consumers as well. 
You should think about SodaStream as a consumption model or you should think about SodaStream professional in the offices. So we move consumption to -- with refillable, reusable models. 
And then you should also think about innovation in a way that we bring to the consumer products that are better for the consumer and better for the planet. For example, more legumes. We're adding legumes to our snacks portfolio. Legumes are -- can we use -- can be used as cover crops that clearly impact better agriculture, but at the same time are more nutritional to consumer, chickpeas and others. You 
should think about innovations like we are working on with our beyond meat partnership, where we're going to have protein solutions that are none from animals and therefore it will be better for consumers and better for the planet. 
So multiple levers of how we're planning to evolve the portfolio, with a lot of emphasis on making our current portfolio, which is beautiful, more, say more nutritious, innovating in new consumption models and also innovating in new platforms that will be better for consumers and better for the planet. That's how you should visualize the evolution of the portfolio in the coming years.

The other component of our success is I think we're becoming much more competitive across both our categories in most of the markets where we operate. And that's been a consequence of the investments we've been making in the brands, I think, pretty good innovation. Obviously, investments we've made in go-to-market capacity, new capabilities, talent, everything else we've been talking to you for the last couple of years.

Well, it's good that you're hearing from our customers is that innovation is good. It's always a good feedback.
Listen, more seriously. I think we've always seen innovation as a key driver of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we've been investing a lot in R&D. We're investing a lot in insights. And we're connecting better, I think, insights with R&D and the whole commercial execution to get the maximum return on those innovations. So I think the machine is ready and I think it keeps getting better year after year.
So yes, our pipeline is strong. I would say our pipeline in 2021 was very strong as well, and we're seeing the return from that innovation across the world. We're trying to be much more local, much more midterm or long term, much more incremental in the way we think about our innovation.
So yes, when it comes to the investment behind the innovation, I think we have the right level of A&M, Bonnie, in our business to support innovation in a big way. And it's not only A&M but, as you know, we have a very strong push system that allows us to give innovation a lot of visibility and separate it from the rest of the category, make sure that the trial levels are higher and the repeat levels are good. 
So I would say, yes, there will be strong innovation across beverages and snacks. We think it's going to be quite incremental. And we think we have the right level of resources to support that innovation within our current algorithm. So I would not expect a higher A&M next year."

You know that we forward buy 6 to 9 months; those hedges that we had in the beginning of the year, starting to roll off. The new ones that are in place are higher cost. 
We had shared on the last call as well as in the prepared remarks today that we expect to be able to price through the inflation that we're facing, whether it be commodities inflation or other types of operating expense inflation. Some of that pricing occurred in the summer. Much more of it is occurring in the fall in the beverage business and substantially, all of it for 2021 in the snack/food business is occurring really as we speak during these weeks right now. You also know that we forward buy that 6 to 9 months out. 
So we'll have a better handle on where exactly 2022 costs are going to land as we get into the first quarter of 2022. And I would expect us to price a bit more to be reflective of some of that sort of finalization of costs during the course of 2022.

What we're seeing across the world is much lower elasticity on the pricing that we've seen historically.

It could be several hypothesis. I think in our case, our brands are stronger and I think our innovation is stronger, as you were saying. So that could be a factor. 
There could be also some behaviors as consumers are shopping faster in store, and they might be paying less attention to pricing as a decision factor. And they might be giving more relevance to the brands or brands that they feel more -- a bit closer to or more close -- yes, I would say, closer and more and more emotionally attached to us as our brand. So we're seeing less elasticity and we're adjusting our models as we go. And that's obviously informing our decisions as we price balance of the year and into 2022."

Your second question on scale. Yes, scale is getting -- obviously, every year, you see the growth level on the top line. We're getting to scale levels that are pretty good in many of the critical markets in that region. And that's giving us, obviously, the opportunity to do better in the marketplace and the flow-through is also stronger. So I think the 2 are relevant.

And that's why we decided to make this -- this decision. We found a great partner in PAI. They have very good experience with previous similar partnerships with other large food companies. We believe we have a way for this JV that we're creating to continue to create synergies on the operational side for the juice business, continue to innovate, and make sure that our brands, because we're going to be 40% of that JV, continue to thrive and compete in a better way that they would probably do in our portfolio where we have a lot of choices where to invest and where to focus.

Now our convenience store business continues to do very well as consumers are having higher mobility. But the remarkable thing is that the in-home consumption continues to be quite high.

We expect those trends to continue for a while. And we think that consumers have changed some of their habits from what we're reading in our insights. And we think that the beverage category is in a very positive situation for the upcoming future. 
We see the same with snacks, by the way. So we -- the snack business, which, obviously, a big part of our growth and sales and profits, we see that category very consistent across the world. And it was during the pandemic. It is now growing a very fast pace as consumers are gaining mobility as well.
So I think, as I said at the beginning, our 2 categories where we operate are growing significantly higher than the food and beverage categories overall. And that is an advantage that we have as a company as we play in 2 categories that are, from the consumer point of view, are very preferred."

But I would say that we're gaining space both in convenience. As you were saying, it was a focus and we invested to gain additional space, not only for our energy business, but for making sure that our innovation was incremental in space as that's what really makes a difference in the overall output of the company.
We have -- if you think about the other variable, which is secondary displays or overall inventory on the floor, because we've had some supply chain constraints in some of our products, we've pulled back on some of the inventory on the perimeter during the summer, voluntarily I would say, just to make sure that we were able to service the customers at the right level. That's something temporary that, obviously, we will push back as we improve our -- the reliability of the supply chain. 
But clearly, it's a positive element, I would say, of our mix, of our top line growth, the additional space that we're driving for both our beverages and snacks across all the channels. That's where we see the value of our push model, where DSD is really helping us to execute with precision. And not just muscle, but we're putting more and more intelligence in where we drive the space, how do we execute that space and all the positive feedback loop that we're creating with our people on the ground, our associates on the ground, to make that a differentiation for our company."

We're seeing a higher mobility than we were expecting earlier in the year. So we've seen -- maybe we're a bit conservative as we were planning the year in terms of how COVID would impact some of the developing markets. Clearly, the consumers have found ways to increase their mobility and going back to their routines of work or of school or whatever. So that's helped us. 
The other thing we've seen positive, as I mentioned earlier, is that the elasticity to pricing has been better than we had initially in our models as well. So we're seeing consumers staying with our brands better. I think that's a consequence of the investments we've been putting in our brands. And the way we're executing our pricing decisions are much more informed by data and granularity, and we're able to execute different strategies by channel, by brand in a very nuanced way. I think those 2 elements are reducing the elasticity impact on our business and making our international business, I think, more competitive and thriving in the majority of the market. So those 2 would be the elements, Steve, if I had to single out what's been differential versus our original estimations."

But clearly, the business has, as we continue to invest in that business, it's very successful. And it's a key strategic driver of our future growth as a company.
In terms of the performance, I would say we keep gaining penetration in what are the core markets, core markets being Central Europe, Northern Europe, Canada and the U.S., some parts of the U.S. So household penetration is increasing. Retention of those households is improving.
There's a few things we're doing structurally with that business that I think will even accelerate its growth. One is we're building a direct-to-consumer business with SodaStream that is very relevant as it gives us a lot of first-party data, and it allows us to have a lot of individual connection with consumers, understand their behaviors. And with that, we can ideate new products, and we can also increase the, let say, the lifetime value of those consumers. So that's one big driver.
The other thing we're doing, especially in Europe, we're putting our brands in the SodaStream model. So we're giving consumers the opportunity not only to drink sparkling water, but to drink sparkling water with the best preferred flavors and the best brands of all their favorite brands, be it bubly, be it Pepsi, be it Mountain Dew, 7UP, whatever, in our international markets. So that's a big driver of the -- how we think we can increase the lifetime value of those households and generate additional value. If you think about the -- our pep+ commitments and how we think we can change the footprint -- environmental footprint of our categories, SodaStream is a big driver of that future consumption model."

One of them is precisely on the portfolio of Positive Choices. And I think you could visualize this as multiple vectors. One is, yes, we want to make sure that our products -- current products are much better. So imagine a Lay's, let's say, Lay's, for example. You should imagine Lay's continuing to have the same great taste but having the lowest sodium levels in the market and being cooked with the best cooking oils. I mean that is our commitment. We are going to continue to give you the best-tasting products in better, let's say, nutritional forms. 
Now you should also imagine new consumption models. As I was saying, Gatorade in powder or in tablets, that's clearly better for the planet and probably easier for consumers as well. You should think about SodaStream as a consumption model or you should think about SodaStream professional in the offices. So we move consumption to -- with refillable, reusable models. 
And then you should also think about innovation in a way that we bring to the consumer products that are better for the consumer and better for the planet. For example, more legumes. We're adding legumes to our snacks portfolio. Legumes are -- can we use -- can be used as cover crops that clearly impact better agriculture, but at the same time are more nutritional to consumer, chickpeas and others. You should think about innovations like we are working on with our Beyond Meat partnership, where we're going to have protein solutions that are none from animals and, therefore, it will be better for consumers and better for the planet. 
So multiple levers of how we're planning to evolve the portfolio, with a lot of emphasis on making our current portfolio, which is beautiful, more, say more nutritious, innovating in new consumption models and also innovating in new platforms that will be better for consumers and better for the planet. That's how you should visualize the evolution of the portfolio in the coming years.
