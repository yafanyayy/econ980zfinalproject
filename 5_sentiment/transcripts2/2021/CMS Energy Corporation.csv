I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple of months as I've transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another yea",1056,"Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple of months as I've transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. 
Before I discuss our year-end results and our updated 5-year capital investment plan, I want to take a moment to reiterate our simple but powerful investment thesis. 
While simple to put on paper, it's not easy to replicate and that is what sets us apart. It starts with our industry-leading commitments to clean energy. Our net 0 methane and carbon goals require significant investment as we update our expansive electric and gas systems to achieve decarbonization. 
These investment opportunities are supported by constructive energy legislation as well as alignment with our commission and the MPSC staff. This strong regulatory and legislative framework is why Michigan has consistently ranked a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction but investment opportunities in a supportive regulatory environment are not enough. Our focus on affordability is critical, so our customers can afford these investments. 
Now I've been with the company for 18 years, much of it in operations. Over that time, we've demonstrated our ability to consistently manage costs as we've invested in the safety and reliability of our systems while improving customer service. That ability to manage cost is not driven from the top-down but from the bottom up. It's our 8,500 coworkers who are committed to excellence, delivering the highest value to our customers at the lowest cost possible. This is embedded in our culture and was built in partnership with our union over the last 2 decades. These unique attributes to the CMS story are what allow us to deliver for our customers and you, our investors. 
Our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. 
Our ability to deliver this growth each and every year is something we are uniquely capable of doing. 
Regardless of weather, a global pandemic, who's leading our state, our commission or our company, we have delivered consistent industry-leading results year in and year out, 2020 prove this. 2021 will be no different. 
In 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, up 7% from 2019 and achieved operating cash flow of almost $2 billion, excluding $700 million of voluntary pension contributions in 2020. 
Today, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 by $0.01 to $2.83 to $2.87, with a focus on the midpoint. This reflects annual growth of 6% to 8% from our 2020 results. 
Last month, we announced our 15th dividend increase in as many years, $1.74 per share, up 7% from the prior year. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again, with a focus on the midpoint. 
Today, we're also increasing our 5-year capital plan to $13.2 billion, up $1 billion from our prior plan. 18 consecutive years of industry-leading financial performance. 
I'll let that sit with you for a moment. 
I'm pleased with our financial performance. But equally important is our commitment to the triple bottom line. We balance everything we do for our coworkers, customers and the communities we serve, our planet and our investors as demonstrated on Slide 6. 
2020. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. The global pandemic impacted all of us emotionally, physically and financially. Through it all, I'm proud of the work done by our coworkers. We were able to provide over $80 million of support to our customers and communities in 2020 through support programs, low-income assistance, donations to foundations and reinvestment to improve safety and reliability. We focused our efforts on COVID relief for residential and small business customers, payment forgiveness as well as enhanced support in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Despite changing our work practices as a result of the pandemic, we maintained first quartile employee engagement, achieved first quartile customer experience and attracted 126 megawatts of new load to our state, which brings with a significant investment in over 4,000 new jobs. 
From a planet perspective, we continue to lead the clean energy transition. We added over 800 megawatts of new wind and are executing on 300 megawatts of new solar, the first tranche of our integrated resource plan. Further in our commitment, over $700 million of investments were made to advance our clean energy transition. 
Additionally, our demand response and energy efficiency programs continue to save our customers' money, reduce carbon and earn an incentive. 
And last, but certainly not least. Cost savings driven by the 
be a strong signal. I'll tell you this. We are positioned well, but there is still more opportunity. Through the CE Way, we will continue to improve reliability, reduce waste and deliver better customer service, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. 
There are opportunities in every corner of the company to achieve excellence through the CE Way. My coworkers and I remain committed and focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system as we move toward net 0 carbon and methane emissions. 
In fact, 40% of our plan directly supports our clean energy transition and includes our renewable generation and electric distribution investments to support this generation, grid modernization as well as programs like our main invented service replacement programs, which reduce methane emissions. 
In addition to our traditional rate base returns, our wind investments, renewable PPAs and demand signed resources are supported by regulatory incentives above and beyond our ROE and combined with our investments in clean energy, our growing percentage of our earnings mix. Our customers' ability to afford the investments in our system opportunity to reduce cost in the future. We have unique cost-saving opportunities relative to peers and 2 above market PPAS, Palisades and MCV, which will generate nearly $140 million of power coupled with the future retirement of our remaining coal facilities, provides over $200 million or 5% cost combined with the and keep customer bills affordable. 
Regulatory docket with no securitization and in the first quarter and our of our integrated resource plan in June, I'm sure many great storage and customer-driven solutions as they become more I'll turn the call over to Reggie."

I'll also note that our treasury team had a banner year of equity, while investor. 
Turning the page to 2021. As mentioned, we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.83 to $2.87 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth off our 2020 actuals. 
Unsurprisingly, the majority of our growth will be of anticipated upside at the parent and other segment in [ 2020  ] operating flex items executed range of 7% at year end, which is in excess of the sector average. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 15 will plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.06 per share a positive year-over-year variance, given the mild winter weather experienced in 2020. Additionally, we anticipate 41 largely driven by the orders received in the second half of 2020. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of EPS impact here is in part due to the absence of an electric rate increase in 2020, which was a to file an electric case in Q1 the impact for that case will commence in 2022. 
As we look at our cost structure in 2021, you'll note approximately $0.27 per share of approved in our recent rate cases to support key initiatives of safety, reliability to say, we have underlying assumptions elimination, driven by the for our customers. 
Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around, while the pandemic remains relatively around mid year. In the event, the teleworking trend persists and/or we see an experiential and commercial margin. 
As always, mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long-term given widespread concerns, energy and/or environmental policy. And our answer remains the same. Irrespective risk and capitalize on opportunities as they emerge  resulting from the pandemic in the form of mild winter weather, our course of action and counted on the perennial will of our 8,500 coworkers expect 6% to 8% adjusted EPS and dividend growth and strong operating cash flow generation. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings and will manage the key credit metrics accordingly. One item I'll note in this regard is that we have slightly modified our FFO to debt targets to align better with the various rating agency methodologies. 
Given the increase in our 5-year capital plan, we anticipate annual equity needs of up to $250 million in 2021 and beyond, which we are confident that we can comfortably raise through our equity dribble program to minimize pricing risk. And 2 additional items I'll mention with respect to our financial strength as we kick off 2021 that are not on the page but no less important or that we concluded 2020 with $1.6 billion of net liquidity, which positions our balance sheet well as we execute our updated capital plan going forward. And we have fully funded benefit plans for the second year in a row due to proactive funding, the latter of which benefits roughly 3,000 of our active coworkers and 8,000 of our retirees. 
Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers are safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well-trained and cared for in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. 
To conclude my prepared remarks, on Slide 18, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions, rate orders already in place and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan will minimize. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for some final comments before Q&A."

It's -- I'd say starting with the second part of your question first. It really is a ratable increase with the capital investment plan, which obviously has increased by $1 billion vintage over vintage. And so because the capital plan at the utility increased by $1 billion, we've had the equity needs increase, roughly commensurate with that. And so the prior plan, as you know, is about $150 million per year run rate, and now we're at $250 million. 
Now when you think about that years, maybe around 250. Some years a little less, we'll look at where the market is and how receptive it is to our currency, and we'll look at the price of stock obviously. I will just add, for the first [ 250  million ] that we're planning to do in 2021. We've already taken about 20% of that pricing risk off the table with fords. We execute back half of 2020. And so we'll be opportunistic. So I wouldn't say it's going to be a clean 250 in each year, but that's the target. And in some years, a little more, some years a little less.

I'm -- I think it's going to feel like a little bit of reiteration for me on this answer, but we've got an aggressive plan. It's net 0 by 2040. And obviously, we're looking at the potential to accelerate part of that plan with Campbell 1 and 2 as part of this plan. But we're also in the broader context of the Biden administration in the [ 2035. ] And even our governor's goals within the state of Michigan were also considering what does that mean? And what does that look like? 
And so right now, Campbell 3 is a 2039. And so we will continue to take a look at what it means for Campbell 3. But again, there's a lot that goes into this modeling. There's a ton of analysis that needs to go into this. I mean in addition to what I shared earlier, we're looking at what is the cost of renewables out in the future. We want to feather in those renewables over time to take advantage of the cost as those cost come down. We want to take a look at storage. Right now, storage is not at the right price. And so how does that storage come in? And how do we fit that in over time. 
Because if we go too fast in this, you -- there's going to be risk from a reliability perspective. And frankly, when you get out to the end part of that plan, it counts -- on that last 8%, it counts on technology in terms of carbon capture and carbon free [indiscernible] to make up the balance. And so important part of this is making sure that we also not only be carbonized, but we ensure affordability, and we ensure reliability, affordability. And I think we can answer all 3. It's just that we have to pace it and allow technology. And so when it comes to the Biden administration, not only will CMS, but our industry will push in for more R&D and more technology advancements to be able to have the aspirations and meet the aspirations that the new administration is putting out, which, frankly, we support from a planet perspective. And so I'll offer that in terms of the plan. And then I know Rejji has some thoughts on this, too. 
So Rejji?"

One, we plan conservative and no big bets. And so in this plan, we've rolled out, we have not made any major presumptions around what will be an IRP 2.0 so that's not flowing through this '21 through '25 plan. And in fact, the components, as Garrick highlighted earlier, you've got a little bit, call it, just out of $400 million of RPS related spend that still taking through for some of the wind investments that we're making, about $1.5 billion related to the IRP. And again, it's just execution on the solar, just add another year. And then on the hydro side, which Garrick, again, mentioned earlier. So this is all just incremental blocking and tackling. And again, we do not swing to defenses when it comes to financial planning. And when it comes to regulatory approaches, we just do not make big bets. So it's a very conservative plan, and we think it's highly got it."

John Carey, who's part of the bin administration and for the climate Envoy as well as Gene McCarthy. He's also part of the Biden administration here and engaged in the planet ambitions. Furthermore, our relationship with former Governor Grant Home and now likely lead of the Department of Energy here shortly. So it gives us a good context around some of these emissions. And what we've heard clearly is from a net 0 perspective for all sectors by 25 -- I mean 2050 and for the electric sector by 2035 from a net 0 perspective. 
And John Carey was specific to say that it was an all-in approach. And that also is ambitious -- these were ambitious goals. But again, it was going to be about R&D type development and technology development to move it forward. And then he also offered the thought this was not a regulatory approach because that takes too long, and it would be incentives based on the market to spur and increase the market. And so I believe we're well positioned for that. Again, where we sit at 2040 to 2035. We can do that. But again, the important piece really from an industry perspective, is that we maintain the affordability, reliability and decarbonization. All 3 of those can be addressed. And it's going to require more R&D from a federal policy perspective. And so that one, we develop the technology, but also moves at scale, so we can get the economics of it for all our customers. And so that's an important piece, and we'll be leaning in from an industry perspective to shape that."

And so obviously, there has been some just change in the way we do business this year. We're not flying places. We're not having hotel room stays, and those aren't sustainable. At some point, we'll go back and we'll do those things, right, as part of the business. 
But through the CE Way, we've done -- 50% of it is clearly sustainable. And there are a number of actions that we've taken, which will continue to provide savings for our customers and create headroom as we go forward. So I want to give you an example. And this is a longer-term one, but there was also a value that was seen here in 2020 I mean 2020 here, we had 2.7 million calls, a drop of 3 million calls over that time period. It's roughly $3 a call. And so -- and I'll just give you 1 real example of the work, and it speaks to the empowerment. And what is unique is that we empower our coworkers to do this. And so some people still pay by calling in and dialing and inputting the credit card information. That's subset of our customers. That team took that process, took 24 steps out of the process, moved it from 405 seconds to 305 seconds. And so as you imagine, a customer who wants to pay that way, the more steps they have, the longer it takes, the more they get frustrated, it turns into a defect and goes over to our call center. So that's just 1 example of how we've improved the process. Made it better for our customers, made it better for our quarters, and then the cost falls out of that. And that's small. 
And imagine multiplying that by 8,500 people that are doing that type because they're empowered. That's the unique piece. And so that's, right? We're not going to go back and make that experience worse for our customers, that's the type of cost savings opportunities. I can go through hundreds of them. And in fact, we have delivered hundreds of them and we'll continue to deliver on hundreds of them. And so that's how I think about it. And there's more opportunity across our company to deliver on excellence from CE way. Now to your question, we're very successful in the midst of a pandemic, and I think it speaks to our regulatory construct and getting gas settlement in 2020 and an electric rate case. And so as we look at forward test years and we look at the work we're underway, we've got recovery in place. 
And so when you see that uptick in O&M, much of that support improved customer service. We increased and it was awarded through the electric rate case outcome in December. Our forestry work, our tree trimming work, which is the #1 cause of outages, we increased it by $30 million. So that's already recovered, and we're going forward with that work to improve customer service for all our customers. That's just 1 example of the increase that you note there. But again, big picture to our perspective, there's more opportunity. We continue to improve the way we do business excellent to the CE Way."

So that compares with 2019, which was 88% in 2017 -- I'm sorry, 2018, which was 89%. And so there is an impact there. But as you see, it's pretty light in terms of what is kind of our historical receivables to 30 days. 
And so -- and really, we believe that's by design. One, we work closely with the commissioners and made sure that, one, we didn't have a mandatory moratorium shut off. It's been a voluntary. We work closely with the commission to do that. We've put invested a number of dollars in both payment forgiveness as well as foundation help, specifically $15 million in 2020. 
We put another $24 million into our foundation, which has also started to provide some of that benefit in 2021. And so we continue to increase that work. In fact, I was on the phone with the Attorney General's office this week, and we're looking at how -- and we work together on this issue to do even more in 2021. 
And so there are a variety of ways. We've helped out those particularly in need during this time, and we will continue through the course of the pandemic. I'm going to offer 1 more thing, particularly around Michigan. Because we are in the midst of this pandemic. But I think there is a lot of bright things that are occurring, both from a COVID perspective but also from Michigan's economy perspective. 
One, we've got great distribution of the vaccine. And if you look at our numbers, the state of Michigan has improved in that performance. And so we've seen restaurants open. We've seen this movement of kids going back-to-school that's already underway. But I even take a bigger picture perspective and look at some of the economic things that I've seen here in Michigan, and I sit on 2 economic development boards. 
126 megawatts of new load, $2.5 billion of investment for 4,000 new jobs. That's not just a highlight from this year. 
If I look back to the last 3 to 4 years, it's been very similar to that. And if you go to a place like Kalamazoo, Michigan. This is where they manufacture the vaccine for Pfizer. That place is going gangbuster. All the industries that support that are going to gangbusters. Many people paint us as the automotive state. We truly have an automotive back of life science. Although, we're in the midst of a pandemic, and there certainly we need to be sensitive to doing our efforts there. I'm also optimistic about what Michigan offers and the growth that I've seen here over the last 4, 5 years."

And so when you take into account the deferred tax flowback, it's only about 40 basis points of rate making equity thickness reduction. So again, modest level of degradation. But at the end of the day, we're still are now 2, 3 years beyond tax reform and the balance sheet and cash flow generative effects of tax reform are very real. And so we would like to see that equity thickness accrete some to offset the effects of that. And so again, to Garrick's point, the [indiscernible] is on us to make the compelling case that equity thickness at worse should stay where it is today but ideally accrete some, and we've seen other jurisdictions do that.

And I'd put a level out there about 150, just as an early marker. And I think what is the important key about this is fleet. And I'm really excited about what came out of the electric rate case because we're going to offer a concierge service to help businesses make the choice. That will be a big difference on how this moves because some of these fleets, when you have to expand by 2 to 3 to 4 megawatts, you're talking about transformers and substations and other upgrades associated with that. 
And so depending on the fleet mix is really -- it's an important variable in figuring out what that capital build out looks like. As GM announced here, I think it was about 1.5 week ago. There's an inflection point between when it makes sense to be an electric vehicle fleet for some of your trucking versus going to hydrogen. And I think that point right there is an important point that we need to understand a bit more, and we're working to do that. And that's the importance of this fleet program we got in the last electric rate case, and we'll see more of that grow and be able to better pinpoint our capital investment opportunities. 
And Rejji, go ahead on that one, I know you got more to add."

The only thing I would add is just -- it also just depends on customer or end user behavior at the end of the day as well. And so part of the Power Michigan drive program that we put in place, an element of that is really to educate customers on when to charge and ideally charging off-peak to get better utilization out of existing assets. And there are economic incentives that we're trying to provide as part of that. But if EV owners feel compelled, and this is more on the residential side, to charge during peak periods. Well, that could have implications on the electric infrastructure as well as supply needs that we may have, which would have a direct impact on capital. And so again, we've talked a lot about shaving the peak even though that may lead to additional capital investment opportunities, we think that's suboptimal in terms of where to put the best dollar longer term. And so I think a lot of this will also be dictated on EV owner behavior."

I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple of months as I've transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another yea",1571,"Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple of months as I've transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. 
Before I discuss our year-end results and our updated 5-year capital investment plan, I want to take a moment to reiterate our simple but powerful investment thesis. 
While simple to put on paper, it's not easy to replicate and that is what sets us apart. It starts with our industry-leading commitments to clean energy. Our net 0 methane and carbon goals require significant investment, as we update our expansive electric and gas systems to achieve decarbonization. 
These investment opportunities are supported by constructive energy legislation as well as alignment with our commission and the MPSC staff. This strong regulatory and legislative framework is why Michigan has consistently ranked a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. But investment opportunities in a supportive regulatory environment are not enough. Our focus on affordability is critical, so our customers can afford these investments. 
Now I've been with the company for 18 years, much of it in operations. Over that time, we've demonstrated our ability to consistently manage costs as we've invested in the safety and reliability of our systems while improving customer service. That ability to manage cost is not driven from the top-down but from the bottom-up. It's our 8,500 coworkers who are committed to excellence, delivering the highest value to our customers at the lowest cost possible. This is embedded in our culture and was built in partnership with our union over the last 2 decades. These unique attributes to the CMS story are what allow us to deliver for our customers and you, our investors. 
Our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Our ability to deliver this growth each and every year is something we are uniquely capable of doing. Regardless of weather, a global pandemic, who's leading our state, our commission or our company, we have delivered consistent industry-leading results, year in and year out, 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different. 
In 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, up 7% from 2019 and achieved operating cash flow of almost $2 billion, excluding $700 million of voluntary pension contributions in 2020. Today, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 by $0.01 to $2.83 to $2.87, with a focus on the midpoint. This reflects annual growth of 6% to 8% from our 2020 results. 
Last month, we announced our 15th dividend increase in as many years, $1.74 per share, up 7% from the prior year. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again, with a focus on the midpoint. Today, we're also increasing our 5-year capital plan to $13.2 billion, up $1 billion from our prior plan. 18 consecutive years of industry-leading financial performance. I'll let that sit with you for a moment. 
I'm pleased with our financial performance. But equally important is our commitment to the triple bottom line. We balance everything we do for our coworkers, customers and the communities we serve, our planet and our investors, as demonstrated on Slide 6. 
2020. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. The global pandemic impacted all of us emotionally, physically and financially. Throughout all, I'm proud of the work done by our coworkers. We were able to provide over $80 million of support to our customers and communities in 2020 through support programs, low-income assistance, donations to foundations and reinvestments to improve safety and reliability. We focused our efforts on COVID relief for residential and small business customers, payment forgiveness as well as enhanced support in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Despite changing our work practices, as a result of the pandemic, we maintained first quartile employee engagement, achieved first quartile customer experience and attracted 126 megawatts of new load to our state, which brings with a significant investment in over 4,000 new jobs. 
From a planet perspective, we continue to lead the clean energy transition. We added over 800 megawatts of new wind and are executing on 300 megawatts of new solar, the first tranche of our integrated resource plan. Further in our commitment, over $700 million of investments were made to advance our clean energy transition. Additionally, our demand response and energy efficiency programs continue to save our customers' money, reduce carbon and earn an incentive. And last, but certainly not least, we finished the year with more than $100 million in cost savings driven by the CE Way.
 Many of you have asked about my commitment to the CE Way. The light blue arrow at the bottom of the slide and my experience leading this operating system over the past 5 years should be a strong signal. I'll tell you this, we are positioned well, but there is still more opportunity. Through the CE Way, we will continue to improve reliability, reduce waste and deliver better customer service, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. 
There are opportunities in every corner of the company to achieve excellence through the CE Way. My coworkers and I remain committed. We will continue to lead the clean energy transition with support from our new 5-year $13.2 billion capital investment plan, which translates to over 7% annual rate-base growth and focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system as we move toward net zero carbon and methane emissions.
In fact, 40% of our plan directly supports our clean energy transition and includes our renewable generation, electric distribution investments to support this generation, grid modernization as well as programs like our main Vintage Service Replacement programs, which reduce methane emissions. 
In addition to our traditional rate base returns, our wind investments, renewable PPAs and demand signed resources are supported by regulatory incentives above and beyond our ROE. These incremental earnings mechanisms enhance our earned returns. And combined with our investments in clean energy, our growing percentage of our earnings mix. Our customers' ability to afford the investments in our system is complemented by our continued focus on cost savings. Over the last decade, we have reduced the utility bill as a percentage of the customer's wallet, and we continue to see further opportunity to reduce costs in the future. We have unique cost-saving opportunities relative to peers and 2 above-market PPAs, Palisades and MCV, which will generate nearly $140 million of power supply cost recovery savings.
This, coupled with the future retirement of our remaining coal facilities provides over $200 million or 5% cost savings for our customers. These structural cost savings, combined with the productivity will deliver through the CE Way will ensure we deliver on our capital plan and keep customer bills affordable.
 Now the great thing, the great thing, about the CE Way is it delivers more than cost savings. What makes us unique is our engaged coworkers. We value our best in sector employee engagement and our 8,500 coworkers who work every day to deliver the best value for our customers. This engaged workforce has doubled productivity, which has enabled us to consistently increase our capital plan without significantly increasing our workforce. 
 Furthermore, we have never served our customers better as we move from the bottom quartile to top quartile, not just in the utility industry but across all industries. Slide 9 serves as an -- Slide 9 serves as an excellent example of how our team leverages the CE Way to deliver on our triple bottom line. Our ability to deliver this level of excellence for our customers and investors is supported by Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. We benefit from a legislative and regulatory construct that supports our rate case proceedings and a statute that allows for financial incentives above and beyond current authorized ROE. Michigan's regulatory jurisdiction has been ranked in the top tier since 2013. That's not by accident. It's a reflection of the hard work my coworkers do every day to earn the trust of our customers, policymakers, environmental groups and the MPSC staff. We are proud to have a commission that demonstrates strong leadership with diverse backgrounds, which was enhanced with the appointment of Commissioner Peretick. We welcome Commissioner Peretick and look forward to working with her in the future. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note we have a light regulatory docket with no financially significant regulatory outcomes in 2021. With the approval of our current securitization and electric rate case in December of last year, we'll file our next electric rate case in the first quarter and our gas rate case in December of this year. 
Notably, we'll follow a second generation of our integrated resource plan in June. I'm sure many of you would like a sneak peak, but it's too early. We're in the midst of the modeling phase. You can be confident that this next iteration will continue to build our industry-leading clean energy commitments, and we'll find ways to get cleaner, faster and incorporate storage and customer-driven solutions as they become more cost-effective. Beyond that, we'll ask you to stay tuned until our second quarter earnings call, where we will provide more information after we file.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year off our 2019 actuals. And I'll briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring it",1247,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year off our 2019 actuals. And I'll briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring items previously discussed in our third quarter earnings call and enumerated in this morning's releases. To elaborate on the key drivers of our year-end results, we released -- we realized increases in rate relief net of investments due to constructive orders and our recent gas and electric rate cases, strong performance in our nonutility segments, and most notably, our historic company-wide cost reduction efforts led by the CE Way, which Garrick noted earlier. 
These positive factors were partially offset by mild weather and reinvestments or flex up back into the business. We've talked in the past about our practice of flexing up, which enables us to put financial upside to work in the second half of the year to pull ahead or commit to work to improve the safety and reliability of our DAS and electric systems to fund customer support programs, which was particularly important in 2020 given the effects of the pandemic, invest in coworker training programs and derisk our financial plan in subsequent years. This tried and true approach benefits all stakeholders, which is the essence of the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.
On Slide 13, you'll note that we met our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive with Garrick's earlier remarks, I'll just note that we invested $2.3 billion of capital in our electric and gas infrastructure to the benefit of customers, including investments in wind farms, which add approximately $500 million of RPS related rate base, which I'll remind you, earns a premium return on equity of 10.7%. 
I'll also note that our treasury team had a banner year, successfully raising approximately $3.5 billion of cost-effective capital, which includes roughly $250 million of equity while navigating turbulent capital market conditions over the course of 2020. These efforts further strengthen our balance sheet to the benefit of customers and investors. 
Turning to page to 2021. As mentioned, we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.83 to $2.87 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth off our 2020 actuals. Unsurprisingly, the majority of our growth will be driven by the utility, and I'll also note a modest level of anticipated upside at the parent and other segment in 2021, largely due to the absence of select nonoperating flex items executed in 2020. All in, we'll continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range of 7% at year-end. which is in excess of the sector average. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2021 EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 15, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.06 per share of positive year-over-year variance, given the mild winter weather experienced in 2020. Additionally, we anticipate $0.41 of EPS pickup in 2021, attributable to rate relief net of investment costs, largely driven by the orders received in the second half of 2020. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of EPS impact here is in part due to the absence of an electric rate increase in 2020, which was a condition of our 2019 settlement agreement.
While we do plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, as Garrick mentioned, the test year and economic impact for that case will commence in 2022. As we look at our cost structure in 2021, you'll note approximately $0.27 per share of negative variance attributable to incremental O&M approved in our recent rate cases to support key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. Needless to say, we have underlying assumptions around productivity and waste elimination driven by the CE Way and will always endeavor to overachieve on those targets while delivering substantial value for our customers. 
Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other items. And I'll note that while the pandemic remains relatively uncontained, we are assuming a gradual return of weather-normalized load to pre-pandemic levels around midyear. In the event, the MAT teleworking trend persists and/or we see an accelerated reopening of the Michigan economy, we could potentially see some upside from incremental residential and commercial margin. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. 
We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term, given widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal, energy and/or environmental policy, and our answer remains the same. Irrespective of the circumstances, we view it as our job to do the worrying for you. Our familiar EPS chart on Slide 16 illustrates one of our key strengths, which is to identify and eliminate financial risk and capitalize on opportunities as they emerge to deliver additional benefits to customers while sustaining our financial success over the long term for investors. Each year provides a different fact pattern, and we've always risen to the occasion. 2020 offered some unique challenges resulting from the pandemic and more familiar sources of risk in the form of mild winter weather. And as usual, we didn't make excuses. Instead, weed offer transparency, devised our course of action and counted on the perennial will of our 8,500 coworkers to deliver for our customers, the communities we serve, and for you, our investors. 
To summarize our financial objectives in the near and long term, we expect 6% to 8% adjusted EPS and dividend growth and strong operating cash flow generation. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings and will manage the key credit metrics accordingly. One item I'll note in this regard is that we have slightly modified our FFO to debt targets to align better with the various rating agency methodologies. Given the increase in our 5-year capital plan, we anticipate annual equity needs of up to $250 million in 2021 and beyond, which we are confident that we can comfortably raise through our equity dribble program to minimize pricing risk. And 2 additional items I'll mention with respect to our financial strength as we kick off 2021 that are not on the page, but no less important or that we concluded 2020 with $1.6 billion of net liquidity, which positions our balance sheet well as we execute our updated capital plan going forward. And we have fully funded benefit plans for the second year in a row due to proactive funding, the latter of which benefits roughly 3,000 of our active coworkers and 8,000 of our retirees. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and cared for in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. 
To conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 18, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions, rate orders already in place and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for some final comments before Q&A."

So first of all, we have industry-leading commitments, and I want to be clear about that. Net 0 by 2040 is one of the best in the industry out there, and so it's an aggressive plan from a build-out perspective. In our current integrated resource plan, we have 1.1 gigawatts of solar that is part of the build-out with a broader plan of 6 gigawatts of solar. And in the course of this integrated resource plan is REV 2, which we'll file in June. We'll continue to advance our aggressive plans and our leadership in the clean energy transition. And so what you're picking up in our capital plan is an additional $1 billion. You're right on right on the mark, Jeremy. There's more renewables to the tune of about $200 million of additional solar and renewables in that plan. There's $200 million of hydro, and that might be surprising for some, but that's the original renewable-renewable that's carbon-free. And if you think about our Ludington pump storage facility, which is the largest -- fourth largest in the world, it provides an important role in intermittency. There's $300 million for electric reliability to improve service out there but also prepare the grid for the future. And then the balance is made up of investments in our gas system to further decarbonize. And so those are the important pieces. When we think about our -- on Slide 22, specifically and the investments there, right now, our integrated resource plan is a 50-50 split between purchase power agreement and build own transfer. Now it's a little better than 50-50 split because there are our renewable energy plan commitments, and we're building that win to support that, so it's greater than 50-50. But let's talk about the 50-50 for a minute. Of those PPAs, we are one of the few in the industry and certainly a leader in the industry to get a financial compensation mechanism associated with that and the rest come through bill load transfer. Now as we think about our second IRP, we're going to take a strong look at what that mix looks like, what that will be for the future. And so that will be something we explore and grow and certainly will be part of our integrated resource plan for the future. Now I'm going to pass it over to Rejji too because I know he has some additional thoughts to offer on this as well."

It's -- I'd say starting with the second part of your question first. It really is a ratable increase with the capital investment plan, which obviously has increased by $1 billion vintage over vintage. And so because the capital plan at the utility increased by $1 billion, we've had the equity needs increase, roughly commensurate with that. And so the prior plan, as you know, is about $150 million per year run rate, and now we're at $250 million. 
Now when you think about that distribution over the next 5 years, well, yes, we maybe opportunistic in some years, it may be around $250 million, some years a little less. We'll look at where the market is and how receptive it is to our currency, and we'll look at the price of stock, obviously. And I will just add for the first $250 million that we're planning to do in 2021, we've already taken about 20% of that pricing risk off the table with forwards we executed in the back half of 2020. And so we'll be opportunistic. 
So I wouldn't say it was always going to be a clean $250 million each year, but that's the target and then some years a little more, some years a little less. And so when I say a little more, up to $250 million is the ceiling and it may and some years be less than that, just to be very clear."

And every year, when there's work to do, we get after it and we flex our CE way muscle and find savings opportunities and then we reinvest it. And so again, we've positioned well for 2021. That's the broad message. But I mean, specifically from a sales perspective. Residential sales, as we talked in Q3 and still here in Q4 are a bit sticky, as people are working from home and many schools are still virtual. But as we see this pandemic playing out, we anticipate that those would decline, as you might expect, as people go back to the traditional workplace and as kids return to school. 
Also, we expect the commercial sales to grow a little bit. Restaurants have been opened up here recently, some limited capacity, but those will continue to grow, particularly as the vaccine is more readily available and distributed across Michigan. And so again, there's not aggressive assumptions in there. It's very conservative assumptions, as you might expect from us and really returning to some pre-pandemic levels, just as we shared. From an O&M Flex perspective, as I shared earlier, we feel like we're well positioned for 2021. 
We've done a lot of reinvestment for our customers at the end of the year toward -- to the tune of $0.18. That only helps our customers and provides benefit but a derisk 2021.

I'm -- I think it's going to feel like a little bit of reiteration for me on this answer, but we've got an aggressive plan. It's net 0 by 2040. And obviously, we're looking at the potential to accelerate part of that plan with Campbell 1 and 2 as part of this plan. But we're also in the broader context of the Biden administration in the 2035. And even our governor's goals within the state of Michigan were also considering what does that mean? And what does that look like? 
And so right now, Campbell 3 is at 2039. And so we will continue to take a look at what it means for Campbell 3. But again, there's a lot that goes into this modeling. There's a ton of analysis that needs to go into this. I mean in addition to what I shared earlier, we're looking at what is the cost of renewables out in the future. We want to feather in those renewables over time to take advantage of the cost as those cost come down. We want to take a look at storage. Right now, storage is not at the right price. And so how does that storage come in? And how do we feather that in over time. 
Because if we go too fast in this, you -- there's going to be risk from a reliability perspective. And frankly, when you get out to the end part of that plan, it counts on that last 8%, it counts on technology in terms of carbon capture and carbon sequestration to make up the balance. And so important part of this is making sure that we also, not only be carbonized but we ensure affordability, and we ensure reliability, affordability. And I think we can answer all 3. It's just that we have to pace it and allow technology. And so when it comes to the Biden administration, not only will CMS but our industry will push in for more R&D and more technology advancements to be able to have the aspirations and meet the aspirations that the new administration is putting out, which, frankly, we support from a planet perspective. And so I'll offer that in terms of the plan. And then I know Rejji has some thoughts on this, too. 
So Rejji?"

One, we plan conservative and no big bets. And so in this plan we've rolled out, we have not made any major presumptions around what will be an IRP 2.0 and so that's not flowing through this '21 through '25 plan. And in fact, the components, as Garrick highlighted earlier, you've got a little bit, call it, just out of $400 million of RPS related spend that's just still taking through for some of the wind investments that we're making, about $1.5 billion related to the IRP. And again, it's just execution on the solar, just out another year. And then Ludington on the hydro side, which Garrick, again, mentioned earlier. So this is all just incremental blocking and tackling. And again, we do not swing to the fences when it comes to financial planning. And when it comes to regulatory approaches, we just do not make big bets. So it's a very conservative plan, and we think it's highly executable."

And we're assuming fairly conservatively, as Garrick mentioned, that we'll get pretty close to pre-pandemic residential around midyear. And so we're showing just year-over-year, a little bit of a decline in residential, again, ticking back to pre-pandemic level. So if we're 1% -- if there's a surprise to the upside to the tune of 1%, that's worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis.

And so what we're trying to highlight in our current guidance is that we're trying to show those tailored computation so that we can maintain the solid investment grade credit rating. That's what we've historically targeted. And so that kind of takes you to a mid-teens level.

Thanks for your question, Durgesh. So I've had the opportunity to listen to 2 industry events, separate industry events, John Carey, who is part of the Biden administration and for the climate envoy as well as the Gina McCarthy, who's also part of the Biden administration here and engaged in the planet ambitions. Furthermore, our relationship with former Governor Grant Home and now likely lead at the Department of Energy here shortly. And so it gives us a good context around some of these emissions. And what we've heard clearly is from a net 0 perspective for all sectors by '25 -- I mean, 2050 and for the electric sector by 2035 from a net 0 perspective. And John Kerry was specific to say that it was an all-in approach and that also he's ambitious -- these were ambitious goals. But again, it was going to be about R&D type development and technology development to move it forward.
And then he also offered the thought this was not a regulatory approach because that takes too long, and it would be incentives based on the market to spur and increase the market. And so I believe we're well positioned for that. Again, where we sit at 2040 to 2035, we can do that. But again, the important piece, really from an industry perspective is that we maintain the affordability, reliability and decarbonization, all 3 of those can be addressed. And it's going to require more R&D from a federal policy perspective. And so that one, we develop the technology but also moves at scale, so we can get the economics of it for all our customers. And so that's an important piece, and we'll be leaning in from an industry perspective to shape that. Thanks for your question."

So from the $100 million challenge in our work there, very successful really over $100 million is a very successful year. About 50% of that I put in the category of sustainable. So let me talk about kind of the both buckets. And so obviously, there has been some just change in the way we do business this year. We're not flying places. We're not having hotel room days, those aren't sustainable. At some point, we'll go back and we'll do those things, right, as part of the business. But through the CE Way, we -- 50% of it is clearly sustainable. And there are a number of actions that we've taken, which will continue to provide savings for our customers and create headroom as we go forward. 
So I want to give you an example. And this is a longer term one, but there was also a value that was seen here in 2020. So if I go back to 2015, we see about 6 million calls in our call center or contact center. In 2017, here -- I mean, 2020 here, we did 2.7 million calls, a drop of 3 million calls over that time period. It's roughly $3 a call. And so -- and I'll just give you one real example of the work, and it speaks to the empowerment, what is unique is that we empower our coworkers to do this. And so some people still pay by calling in and dialing and putting the credit card information. That's a subset of our customers. That team took that process, took 24 steps out of the process, moved it from 405 seconds to 305 seconds. And so as you imagine, a customer who wants to pay that way, the more steps they have, the longer it takes, the more they get frustrated, it turns into a defect and goes over to our call center. So that's just one example of how we've improved the process, made it better for our customers, made it better for our quarters and then the cost falls out of that, and that's small. And imagine multiplying that by 8,500 people that are doing that type because they're empowered. That's the unique piece. And so that's to say, right? We're not going to go back and make that experience worse for our customers. That's the type of cost savings opportunities. I can go through hundreds of them. And in fact, we have delivered hundreds of them, and we'll continue to deliver on hundreds of them. And so that's how I think about it. And there's more opportunity across our company to deliver on excellence from the COA. 
Now to your question. We're very successful in the midst of a pandemic, and I think it speaks to our regulatory construct and getting gas settlement in 2020 and an electric rate case. And so as we look at forward test years and we look at the work we're underway, we've got recovery in place. And so when you see that uptick in O&M, much of that's for improved customer service. We increased, and it was awarded through the electric rate case outcome in December, our forestry work, our tree trimming work with the N1 cause of outages, we increased it by $30 million. And so that's already recovered, and we're going forward with that work to improve customer service for all our customers. That's just one example of the increase that you note there. But again, big picture perspective, there's more opportunity. We continue to improve the way we do business excellence through the CE Way."

This has been one of our biggest years in support for our customers. So let me talk about the numbers. So when I look at current to 30 days, right now, our customer -- 87% of our customers are in that bucket being current in 30 days. So that compares with 2019, which was 88% in 2017 -- I'm sorry, 2018, which was 89%. And so there is an impact there. But as you see, it's pretty light in terms of what is kind of our historical receivables to 30 days. And so -- and really, we believe that's by design. One, we work closely with the commissioners and made sure that, one, we didn't have mandatory moratorium shutoff. It's been a voluntary. We worked closely with the commissioner to do that. We've put invested a number of dollars in both payment forgiveness as well as Foundation Help, specifically $15 million in 2020. We put another $24 million into our foundation, which has also started to provide some of that benefit in 2021. And so we continue to increase that work. In fact, I was on the phone with the Attorney General's office this week, and we're looking at how we work together on this issue to do even more in 2021. And so there are a variety of ways. We've helped out those particularly in need during this time, and we will continue through the course of the pandemic. I'm going to offer one more thing, particularly around Michigan because we are in the midst of this pandemic, but I think there is a lot of bright things that are occurring, both from a COVID perspective but also Michigan's economy perspective. One, we've got great distribution of the vaccine, and if you look at our numbers, the state of Michigan has improved in that performance. And so we've seen restaurants open. We've seen this movement of kids going back to school. That's already underway. But if I even take a bigger picture perspective and look at some of the economic things that I've seen here in Michigan, I sit on 2 economic development boards: one, 126 megawatts of new low; $2.5 billion of investment; 4,000 new jobs. That's not just a highlight from this year. If I look back to the last 3 to 4 years, it's been very similar to that. And if you go to a place like Kalamazoo, Michigan. Kalamazoo, Michigan, this is where they manufacture the vaccine for Pfizer. That place is going gangbusters. And all the industries that support that are going gangbusters. Many people paying us to the automotive state. We truly have an automotive background, which is rich. But we are one of the leading states in the growth of life sciences, like we see at Pfizer and other places. 
And so although we're in the midst of a pandemic, and there's certainly we need to be sensitive about those that are low income and are working through that, and we're doing our efforts there. I'm also optimistic about what Michigan offers in the growth that I've seen here over the last 4 or 5 years."

And again, the #1 cause of outages in our state is tree trimming and so that's a big lift. We got a -- done a lot of great work on electric capital, and we made a great case and received a good portion of our electric capital and investments that will prepare the grid for the future from a renewable perspective as well as also improve reliability on electric grid.
We got some good outcomes in a distributed generation and our approach to that, which reduces the subsidy that is paid from our customers. And furthermore, our -- we haven't spoke much about electric vehicles, but our Power My Fleet, which is where I think there's a great opportunity in electric vehicles. That's a space where we got approval for. And so -- and there's a whole host of other positives that would offer in there. 
From an opportunity perspective, and we do see this as an opportunity perspective. We can do more work to justify our capital plans, particularly from a facilities perspective and a fleet perspective. We're a little short of our expectations there. And that's an area where we can build out better business cases and get better outcomes. I also think there's a better opportunity to have our commission not go look at historical 5-year IT because when -- the IT and what we invest in network with -- how fast that is changing, when you do a historical look, it doesn't provide the right amount of O&M you need. And so there is more work we need to do with our staff -- with the staff at the MPSC and with the commission to make a better case for O&M related to IT investments. And so those are a couple of examples of things that we need to strengthen. And I'll pass it over to Rejji and Rejji has some thoughts as well."

And so when you take into account the deferred tax flowback, it's only about 40 basis points of rate making equity thickness reduction. So again, modest level of degradation. But at the end of the day, we're still -- we're now 2, 3 years beyond tax reform and the balance sheet and cash flow generative effects of tax reform are very real. And so we would like to see that equity thickness accrete some to offset the effects of that. And so, again to Garrick's point, the onus is on us to continue to make the compelling case that equity thickness at worse should stay where it is today but ideally accrete some, and we've seen other jurisdictions do that. So we'll try to make that case better in subsequent cases."

We have nice scalable programs on the fleet side and the residential side that continue to grow as electric vehicle grows. And I'd put a level out there about [ 150] , just as an early marker. And I think what is the important key about this is fleets. And I'm really excited about what came out of the electric rate case because we're going to offer a concierge service to help businesses make the choice. That will be a big difference and how this moves because some of these fleets when you have to expand by 2 to 3 to 4 megawatts, you're talking about transformers and substations and other upgrades associated with that. 
And so depending on the fleet mix is really -- it's an important variable in figuring out what that capital build out looks like. As GM announced here, I think it was about 1.5 week ago, there's an inflection point between when it makes sense to be an electric vehicle fleet for something your trucking versus going to hydrogen. And I think that point right there is an important point that we need to understand a bit more, and we're working to do that. And that's the importance of this fleet program we got in the last electric rate case, and we'll see more of that grow and be able to better pinpoint our capital investment opportunities. 
And Rejji, go ahead on that one, I know you got more to add."

The only thing I would add is just -- it also just depends on customer or end user behavior at the end of the day as well. And so part of the power Michigan drive program that we put in place, an element of that is really to educate customers on when to charge and ideally charging off-peak to get better utilization out of existing assets. And then there are economic incentives that we're trying to provide as part of that. But if EV owners feel compelled, and this is more on the residential side to charge during peak periods, well, that could have implications on the electric infrastructure as well as supply needs that we may have, which would have a direct impact on capital. And so again, we've talked a lot about shaving the peak and so -- even though that may lead to additional capital investment opportunities, we think that's suboptimal in terms of where to put the best dollar longer term. And so I think a lot of this will also be dictated on EV owner behavior."

It seems kind of like over the past few years, the 5-year plan is more or less been around $5 billion, a little bit more this time than the 10-year plan around $10 billion with a little bit of upside, but is that the run rate you need in order to get to reach net 0 by 2030 with some RNG mixed in or there is something else that we have been initially looking for that might lead to an accelerating reduction in methane over time, whether it's the first 5 or next 5 years?"

Next weekend here -- this coming week I should say, in the next couple of days, it's going to be 0 and negative 1 and 1 here in Michigan. And you know what, I have an electric heat pump at home. And I'll tell you what, it does not keep up. And so I've got to supplement with gas to be able to keep my house warm. And in fact, 75% of Michigan's resident count on natural gas. And so I'm so glad you asked that question because I think it's really important when think about decarbonization, that we're thinking not only about the electric but the gas business, and that's exactly what we're doing. 
And so, we do have a 10-year plan, as you pointed out, to get to net 0 by 2030. These investments, which are represented in our 5-year plan and those in our 10-year which will have the opportunity to grow as we move forward are exactly what delivers that net 0. We invest in taking out old metal and raw materials out there, we replace it with plastic across our distribution system, which provides for safety that is so critical in our gas business. And we continue to maintain reliability, affordability and decarbonization because you can do all across that. Also within that plan, you had a little bit of renewable natural gas. We have some on our system, we're going to add little bit more renewable to get natural gas that will help to decarbonize that stream. That will get us to net 0 methane by 2030. Now I'll tell you what, there's more opportunity to decarbonize natural gas. We've got energy efficiency programs that we have ran for 10-plus years, which are great. It's a win for our customers, it saves them money. We get an incentive on it, and it helps the plan, all of the above, win-win-win. We have the ability to expand those programs on our gas business. And you can think about the technology in the home, in home envelope and the equipment in the home to further decarbonize. And then if you want belt and suspenders, we can also talk about hydrogen. And we spent a lot of time in the use cases around hydrogen. I won't go through them all now because I'm getting away from your questions. But yes, that investment spend rate there, and we have a little bit more opportunity in future cases where we even there will deliver a net methane 2030 target."

One of the things that's part of our performance metrics we already have in place is average speed of answer, right? That's a call center metric. Most of our communications and most of our activity, as I shared it with you earlier, are digital in nature.

Sophie, I appreciate the question, and I thank you for the opportunity for us to really promote our activities over the last -- not just last year, but a couple of years where similar to our mindset around flexing up on the income statement side. We also choose to flex up on the operating cash flow side. And last year, we saw pretty good upside, largely driven by cost performance, a little bit from the Cares Act that allowed us to have some upside on OCF. And so we took the liberty to put about $700 million to work in discretionary pension contributions, most of which were in the January of last year, but we did a good portion in late in Q4, and that's allowed us to fully fund the pension. And so where we sit today, we don't anticipate certainly not any -- we certainly don't anticipate any involuntary contributions. 
And I think if there are any embedded in the 5-year plan, I would say they're relatively deminimis. And so where we sit today, we think there should be really light contribution requirements over the next 5 years. Now clearly, there are variables. So if you see discount rates come down, if you see asset performance underwhelmed or underperformed, that could require additional contributions. So where we sit today, we feel quite good about the lack or limited amount of contributions over the course of 5-year plan. So there's no real material impact embedded in our equity issuance assumptions. But again, these variables toggle and you have to recalibrate every year. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like over the next couple of years. Is that helpful?"

So let me offer this, just to be very clear, Sophie. And so what we have done, and this precedes me and Garrick. It's just been -- just a long standard -- long-standing standard we've had from a financial planning perspective for OCF is we have not -- unlike the income statement and EPS, we have not guided OCF off of the prior year actuals. We have just looked at the budget or the guidance we provided from the prior year. And we said directionally, it will increase by $100 million each year off the prior year's guidance. And so for example, last year, we guided to $1.75 billion. Obviously, we delivered well in excess of that. And then this year, again, $100 million above and beyond that $1.25 billion. So yes, that is down from where actuals were, which was just under $2 billion. 
And again, a lot of that tends to do with the cost performance as well as again some CARES Act-related benefits. And so I wouldn't view that as conservatism or just any type of rate or regulatory-related actions. It's just us, again, just thinking about the annual growth that we can deliver from an OCF perspective. But we're saying all in, over the next 5 years, we're going to do over $10 billion of operating cash flow generation, and that is in excess of what we were anticipating over 5 years from the prior vintage, which I think was south of $10 billion or around $10 billion. So we feel good about our ability to deliver on operating cash flow, and it's not a result of any of the regulatory outcomes. I think the only thing you'll see in the gas settlement is about $30 million or $35 million of operating cash flow challenge because we're staying out. But again, it's relatively deminimis in the grand scheme of things."

We appreciate your interest in CMS Energy. Over the past 5 months, I've been on the virtual road and have had the opportunity to meet with many of you to share our investment thesis, which delivers for all our stakeholders. This thesis is grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit and enables the excellence you have come to expect from CMS Energy. 
Many of you have asked what will change under my leadership. And I want to reemphasize, we've changed leadership, not the simple proven investment thesis, that delivers year in and year out. Looking forward, we're committed to leading the clean energy transformation with our net 0 carbon and methane emissions plans, which are supported by our clean energy investments in our current progressive integrated resource plan. 
Furthermore, we are recognized as top tier for ESG performance, earning top ratings amongst our peers. We continue to mature our industry-leading lean operating system, the CE Way, eliminating waste and improving our performance. 
I love this system. Over the past several years, we have used it across the business to drive efficiencies, improve employee engagement and deliver sustainable cost performance. I've seen it, I've worked it, and we have plenty of gas pedal left. Today, we are crafting the next horizon, what I call CE Way 2.0, which layers in greater use of automation and analytics, and begins to position CMS Energy as a leader in digital. 
Another key differentiator of CMS Energy is Michigan's top-tier regulatory construct that has 10-month forward-looking rate cases and constructive ROEs. This all leads to our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. 
At CMS Energy, we wake up every day to get after it, deliver for our customers in all conditions: rain, snow, sleet, wind. We never quit. And for you, our investors, we never quit. This year is no different. 
Now let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we delivered $1.21 of adjusted earnings per share. This is up significantly, $0.35 from last year, primarily from incremental revenue to fund needed customer investments and sustained cost performance. As a reminder, our full year dividend is $1.74, up 7% from last year. We are reaffirming our 2021 guidance for the year of $2.83 to $2.87 of adjusted earnings per share, and our long-term earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, with a bias to the midpoint. 
At CMS Energy, we're committed to our promises to our coworkers, the communities we serve and our planet as we are to delivering our financial commitments. During my discussions with many of you, the topic of ESG often comes up. I'm proud of our leadership in this space. We continue to enhance our commitments, and our efforts are being recognized with top-tier ratings. 
We remain a AA-rated company by MSCI and have ranked top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics since 2013. This is a deep commitment that began well before it was a trend. 
Our commitments to net 0 methane emissions by 2030 and net 0 carbon emissions by 2040, among the most aggressive in the industry. As our industry approaches a cleaner energy future and we retire our legacy generating units, it is critical that we honor the contributions and service of our coworkers as well as address the economic impact on those communities. 
Now I began my career on the generation side of our business. I've walked the halls, climbed the stairs of every one of our generating plants, shaken  hands, drank coffee with the men and women who work every day to provide energy for our customers. And I'm proud of the honorable and equitable way we have cared for both our coworkers and our communities as we retire these units from service. 
We built a playbook for success. It began with the retirement of our 7 coal plants in 2016. That work will continue with retirement of Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. Our leadership and track record in this space is something I'm proud of and will continue as we look to the future. This ensures success for all stakeholders, including our investors. 
While many focus on the E of ESG, we have a strong record of delivering across all 3. In my 20 years of service, I believe our culture has never been stronger. Every single day, our coworkers show up with the heart of service for our customers, our communities and ultimately, you, our investors. Our culture anchored by our values is thriving across our company, and it's why we're recognized for top quartile safety performance, industry-leading employee engagement. Forbes Best Employer for Women, Best for Vets by Military Times and Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality in the Corporate Equality Index. And earlier this month, we were ranked by Forbes as the #1 utility in the country as Best Employers for Diversity. Our leadership, commitment and top-tier ESG performance should provide you with the confidence that our long track record will continue to deliver value for customers and investors. 
Turning to recent updates. I want to highlight our continued growth in renewables with several exciting announcements. We are pleased to announce the recent commission approval of our Heartland wind project in March, which will be online in December of next year. This project adds 201 megawatts of new capacity as a part of our renewable portfolio standard earning a 10.7% return. 
I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for the first tranche of our current integrated resource plan, which adds nearly 300 megawatts of new solar through 2 projects that we expect to come online in 2022. We are evaluating the second tranche of our current IRP, another 300 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2023. In the third tranche, 500 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2024, for a total of 1,100 megawatts. 
We're on track to file our next integrated resource plan in June. It has been a popular topic in our meetings with many of you. While we're still finalizing the details, the focus of our upcoming IRP will be to accelerate the decarbonization of our fleet, ensure reliability and affordability and add renewables and demand-side resources in a way that makes sense for our customers and investors while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. 
I'm excited for this next IRP. It serves as yet another proof point that we are leading the clean energy transformation. 
As part of our clean energy transformation -- a part of our clean energy transformation includes the retirement of our remaining coal fleet. 
On Slide 7, you'll see our plan to decarbonize as both visible and data-driven. The meaningful reduction of carbon emissions in our plan will drive our ability to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2040. 
Over the past few months, I've been asked quite a bit about the future of our gas business. As I've shared with many of you, our gas business and system is critical to providing affordable and reliable heating here in Michigan. But doesn't mean we're sitting on our tails here. In fact, we are actively working to decarbonize our gas system. Now this aligns very well with the recent announcement from the Biden administration. Our first step is to reduce methane emissions, which is well underway as we accelerate the replacement of vintage maintenance and services. Both plans approved by the commission will decrease our emissions and achieve our net 0 methane goal. Our decarbonization plans also leverage energy efficiency to reduce carbon usage input renewable natural gas on our system, which will help decarbonize more difficult sectors such as agriculture. 
By replacing vintage mains and services with plastic piping, we will be positioned to deliver hydrogen or other clean molecules to our customers in the future. As we grow our renewable portfolio and decarbonize our generation fleet and gas delivery system will remain committed to delivering against the triple bottom line: people, planet and profit. 
Before I turn the call over to Rejji, I want to end with this slide. It demonstrates our consistent industry-leading performance for nearly 2 decades. As much as things change, one thing stays consistent, year in and year out, we have and will continue to deliver. 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different, marking 19 years of consistent, predictable financial performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji."
257682,710741158,2262615,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quar",1247,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. 
In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.35, above our Q1 2020 results, largely driven by rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, better weather and sustained cost performance from our 2020 efforts at the utility. Our enterprises and parent and other segments were slightly down as planned due to the absence of a onetime cost reduction item in 2020 and higher funding-related costs, respectively. 
This modest negative variance was more than offset by strong origination growth at EnerBank, which exceeded its Q1 2020 EPS contribution by $0.06 in 2021 as planned and is tracking towards the high end of our guidance for the year of $0.22 per share. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 10 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 and highlights our latest estimates for the major year-to-go drivers to meet our 2021 EPS guidance range. 
To elaborate on our year-to-date performance, while weather in the first quarter of 2020 has been below normal to date, which has led to lower volumetric gas sales, it has been better than the historically warm winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2020. And the absence of that weather has led to $0.08 per share of positive variance period-over-period. 
From a rates perspective, given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses, we're seeing $0.26 per share of positive variance. As a reminder, Our rate relief estimates are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs. It is also worth noting that our 2021 financials reflect the accelerated amortization of deferred taxes as part of our 2020 gas rate order settlement. 
On the cost side, as noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, we budgeted substantial increases in our operating and maintenance expenses in 2021 versus the prior year to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization and an alignment with our recent rate orders. As you can see, we're $0.02 per share above our spend rate in the first quarter of 2020 as planned. And I'm pleased to report that we're seeing sustained cost performance from 2020 as well as increased productivity in 2021, largely attributable to the CE Way. That said, we do expect to see the bulk of the planned O&M increases to materialize later in the year. 
The balance of our year-to-date performance is driven by the aforementioned drivers at our nonutility segments and non-weather sales, which though slightly down at about 1% below the first quarter 2020, continue to exhibit favorable mix with the higher-margin residential class up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. 
And I'll remind you that our total electric sales exclude 1 large low-margin customer. 
As we look ahead to the remaining 9 months of 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the glide path illustrated on this slide to achieve our full year EPS guidance. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.12 per share of negative variance given the above-normal weather experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020. The residual impact of the aforementioned rate relief, which equates to $0.22 per share of pickup and is not subject to any further MPSC actions, and the continued execution of our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate as an incremental $0.18 per share of spend versus the comparable period in 2020. We have also assumed the usual conservatism in our utility  non-weather sales and our nonutility segments. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021. And needless to say, we'll be prepared to flex costs up or down as the pattern evolves over the course of the year. 
As we look out over the long term, we are in the early stages of executing our $13.2 billion 5-year customer investment plan at the utility, which is highlighted on Slide 11, and will provide significant benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our investors. As a reminder, we have budgeted over $2.5 billion of investments in 2021, the vast majority of which is earmarked for safety, reliability and clean energy projects. We are on track thus far and recently filed an electric rate case in March that enumerates our customer investment priorities for the 2022 test year, which are summarized on the right-hand side of the page among other key details related to the filing. We expect an order from the commission by the end of the year. 
Despite the substantial customer investments that we intend to make on our electric and gas system over the next several years, as you know, we take great pride in taking out costs in a sustainable way to maintain affordable bills for our customers. And we have the track record to prove it. 
The left-hand side of Slide 12 summarizes the key components of our cost structure, which we have successfully managed over the past several years while investing significant capital on behalf of customers. In fact, from 2007 to 2019, we reduced utility bills as a percentage of customer wallet by 1% while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in the utility over that time frame. 
As we look ahead, we have several highly actionable event-driven cost reduction opportunities, which will provide substantial savings in the years to come. The planned expiration of our Palisades power purchase agreement and the recently approved amendment to our MCV PPA will collectively generate roughly $150 million of power supply cost recovery savings. And as you'll note, our initial estimates for the potential savings for the MCV contract amendment of approximately $50 million proved conservative with the revised estimate of over $60 million of savings per the commission's order in March. Also, the planned retirements of our 5 remaining coal units should provide another $90 million of savings in aggregate, exclusive of any potential fuel cost savings, which will create meaningful headroom in bills for future customer investments. 
Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our annual O&M productivity delivered through the CE Way, which last year generated roughly $45 million of savings and serves as a critical tool to our long-term and intra-year financial planning. 
To that end, many of you have asked about proposed changes in corporate tax policy and its potential impact to our plan. Though at this point, the final details remain unclear, trust that we are evaluating the potential effects and we'll leverage the CE Way and other cost reduction opportunities, including potential offsetting tax credits that are also being proposed as part of the legislation to minimize the impact that customers will execute in our capital plan. As we've said before, it is our job to do the worrying for you, and we are uniquely positioned over the next several years to manage any potential headwinds. With our unparalleled track record on cost management driven by our highly engaged workforce, coupled with a robust customer investment backlog and top-tier regulatory construct, we are confident that we can deliver on our ambitious operational customer and financial objectives for the foreseeable future. 
And with that, we'll move to Q&A. So Rocco, please open the line."

So you've got strong origination growth. 
And you also, I would say, have a weak comp in Q1 of last year just because as you recall, the pandemic really started to impact the global economy in the sort of latter part of March. And so Q1 of last year picked some of that up. 
We also do have a loan sale as part of that earnings growth. Now this is all on plan. We had anticipated this in our 2021 plan, but that also offers the favorability relative to Q1 of 2020. And we've always talked about the fact that we don't allocate capital to the bank. And so they have to fund their own growth. And so loan sales is certainly part of that strategy.

And they also do resi solar, and there's still good organic growth there as well. So there's decent diversification, Andrew, in the loan portfolio. And something pools certainly are quite strong. But again, we haven't seen any signs that, that will abate anytime soon. And if that does happen, let's study in 2022 or beyond well then at that point. Again, there's good HVAC volume. There's good resi solar and they also do kitchen and windows and doors.

We call it the energy transformation. And certainly, what we're leading here. And it shows up on our first and our current and I would say, a progressive integrated resource plan, the one that we're building out right now, just a ton of solar, 1,100 megawatts of solar, the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 and energy efficiency and demand response programs that are outstanding offerings for our customers. 
But with any integrated resource plan, particularly when you get to the end years of that plan, there's about a 10% to 20% gap that you got to close. And that's not unique to CMS. You'll hear our peers talk about that as well. But I will remind you, we're one of the most aggressive plans out there in decarbonization by 2040. So there does need to be technology advancements, that comes in carbon capture, that comes in hydrogen, that comes in terms of lithium ion, both from a reliability as well as affordability perspective. And so all of the above is needed. 
And so in fact, we're just -- even tomorrow, I'm going to be with on a call with the Department of Energy and Office of Management and Budget tomorrow to again, we're advocating for R&D-type funding to continue to close that gap, particularly in the out years. 
And so we'll participate as it makes sense within the regulated utility to close some of those gaps. But again, they're out in the 2035 to 2040 time frame. And then Rejji, you might have something more to add on that as well."

So as Garrick mentioned, Jeremy, in his prepared remarks, we did recently did approval from the commission on our first tranche of new solar attributable to the integrated resource plan, the current integrated resource plan. 
And we were, I'd say, pleased with the average cost we saw over the life of the projects when we looked at the owned opportunity versus the contracted. And so on a levelized cost of energy basis, we saw kind of high $50 per megawatt hour to the on solution and kind of low $50 per megawatt hour for the contracted solution. And so then that excludes kind of residual value and other sort of operational benefits and savings that the owned portion could offer over time. And so we do think that longer term, there could be good opportunities as we think through the new solar buildout to potentially own more. But again, it's early days in the context of the IRB.

Commercial, down 4%, still not quite at the pre-pandemic levels, but I think that has a bit to do with the resurgence that we've seen in terms of case counts in Michigan. And we do expect over the course of the year, both commercial and industrial, which was down about 2% will be at pre-pandemic levels around midyear. 
We're also encouraged with what we've seen for most of April in our Smart Media data, particularly for the residential segment, which is about 4% ahead of plan. And so again, the trends look quite good.

And we're seeing it too, and not just in unemployment numbers, but new service connects. The number of requested -- well, first of all, 2020 was a record year for new service connects in the midst of a pandemic. And the first Q1 is up 27% over last year over the same time period.

Not to get directly to your question on NOLs. So like we saw when tax reform was enacted in 2017, there was a remeasurement of NOLs, and that led to a noncash loss on a pretty significant one, just with the tax rate going from 35% down to 21%. So if you see it come back, let's say, to 28%, you have a favorable remeasurement. Clearly, we would carve that out like we did. But that could be beneficial because it creates a greater tax shield. 
We also see some benefit at our parent and other segment, which, as you likely know, is primarily interest expense. And so you'd see just a greater value in that tax shield as well. 
Now to your question about whether there's a push for more renewable build given the incentives to offset the rate increases, we'll hold off on our speculation around that 3-dimensional chest. But certainly on the comments we offered earlier, we do think there will be certainly potential attractive incentives and that should offset some of the rate increase implications a tax rate increase above 21%."

And so we look at a business usual -- business as usual case we look at a decent and the emerging technologies, we look at environmental policy changes. And then we have various variables that low price, low growth, gas prices, et cetera. And so there are hundreds of permutations as we structure the IRP, and we do take into account a number of different scenarios, and then we do try to choose what's best from a triple bottom line perspective. when you put it all through that regime. 
And so I'd say there's a lot of dynamism what's taking place now, I do think is, to some extent, accounted for, but we know that we'll file another one in a few years if the world changes. And so that's the other benefit of this process is that it's very iterative as well."

We appreciate your interest in CMS Energy. Over the past 5 months, I've been on the virtual road and have had the opportunity to meet with many of you to share our investment thesis, which delivers for all our stakeholders. This thesis is grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit and enables the excellence you have come to expect from CMS Energy. 
Many of you have asked what will change under my leadership. And I want to reemphasize, we've changed leadership, not the simple proven investment thesis that delivers year in and year out. Looking forward, we're committed to leading the clean energy transformation with our net-zero carbon and methane emissions plans, which are supported by our clean energy investments in our current progressive Integrated Resource Plan.
Furthermore, we are recognized as top tier for ESG performance, earning top ratings amongst our peers. We continue to mature our industry-leading lean operating system, the CE Way, eliminating waste and improving our performance. 
I love this system. Over the past several years, we have used it across the business to drive efficiencies, improve employee engagement and deliver sustainable cost performance. I've seen it, I've worked it, and we have plenty of gas pedal left. Today, we are crafting the next horizon, what I call CE Way 2.0, which layers in greater use of automation and analytics, and begins to position CMS Energy as a leader in digital. 
Another key differentiator of CMS Energy is Michigan's top-tier regulatory construct that has 10-month forward-looking rate cases and constructive ROEs. This all leads to our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. 
At CMS Energy, we wake up every day to get after it, deliver for our customers in all conditions: rain, snow, sleet, wind. We never quit. And for you, our investors, we never quit. This year is no different. 
Now let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we delivered $1.21 of adjusted earnings per share. This is up significantly, $0.35 from last year, primarily from incremental revenue to fund needed customer investments and sustained cost performance. As a reminder, our full year dividend is $1.74, up 7% from last year. We are reaffirming our 2021 guidance for the year of $2.83 to $2.87 of adjusted earnings per share, and our long-term earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, with a bias to the midpoint. 
At CMS Energy, we're committed to our promises to our coworkers, the communities we serve and our planet as we are to delivering our financial commitments. During my discussions with many of you, the topic of ESG often comes up. I'm proud of our leadership in this space. We continue to enhance our commitments, and our efforts are being recognized with top-tier ratings. 
We remain a AA-rated company by MSCI and have ranked top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics since 2013. This is a deep commitment that began well before it was a trend. 
Our commitments to net-zero methane emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 are among the most aggressive in the industry. As our industry approaches a cleaner energy future and we retire our legacy generating units, it is critical that we honor the contributions and service of our coworkers as well as address the economic impact on those communities. 
Now I began my career on the generation side of our business. I've walked the halls, climbed the stairs of every one of our generating plants, shaken hands, drank coffee with the men and women who work every day to provide energy for our customers. And I'm proud of the honorable and equitable way we have cared for both our coworkers and our communities as we retire these units from service. 
We built a playbook for success. It began with the retirement of our 7 coal plants in 2016. That work will continue with retirement of Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. Our leadership and track record in this space is something I'm proud of and will continue as we look to the future. This ensures success for all stakeholders, including our investors. 
While many focus on the E of ESG, we have a strong record of delivering across all 3. In my 20 years of service, I believe our culture has never been stronger. Every single day, our coworkers show up with the heart of service for our customers, our communities and ultimately, you, our investors. Our culture, anchored by our values, is thriving across our company, and it's why we're recognized for top quartile safety performance, industry-leading employee engagement, Forbes Best Employer for Women, Best for Vets by Military Times and Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality in the Corporate Equality Index. And earlier this month, we were ranked by Forbes as the #1 utility in the country as Best Employers for Diversity. Our leadership, commitment and top-tier ESG performance should provide you with the confidence that our long track record will continue to deliver value for customers and investors. 
Turning to recent updates. I want to highlight our continued growth in renewables with several exciting announcements. We are pleased to announce the recent commission approval of our Heartland Wind Project in March, which will be online in December of next year. This project adds 201 megawatts of new capacity as a part of our renewable portfolio standard earning a 10.7% return. 
I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for the first tranche of our current Integrated Resource Plan, which adds nearly 300 megawatts of new solar through 2 projects that we expect to come online in 2022. We are evaluating the second tranche of our current IRP, another 300 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2023. In the third tranche, 500 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2024, for a total of 1,100 megawatts. 
We're on track to file our next integrated resource plan in June. It has been a popular topic in our meetings with many of you. While we're still finalizing the details, the focus of our upcoming IRP will be to accelerate the decarbonization of our fleet, ensure reliability and affordability and add renewables and demand-side resources in a way that makes sense for our customers and investors while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. 
I'm excited for this next IRP. It serves as yet another proof point that we are leading the clean energy transformation. 
As part of our clean energy transformation -- part of our clean energy transformation includes the retirement of our remaining coal fleet. 
On Slide 7, you'll see our plan to decarbonize as both visible and data-driven. The meaningful reduction of carbon emissions in our plan will drive our ability to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. 
Over the past few months, I've been asked quite a bit about the future of our gas business. As I've shared with many of you, our gas business and system is critical to providing affordable and reliable heating here in Michigan. But doesn't mean we're sitting on our tails here. In fact, we are actively working to decarbonize our gas system. Now this aligns very well with the recent announcement from the Biden administration. Our first step is to reduce fugitive methane emissions, which is well underway as we accelerate the replacement of vintage mains and services, both plans approved by the commission will decrease our emissions and achieve our net-zero methane goal. Our decarbonization plans also leverage energy efficiency to reduce carbon usage, input renewable natural gas on our system, which will help decarbonize more difficult sectors such as agriculture. 
By replacing vintage mains and services with plastic piping, we will be positioned to deliver hydrogen or other clean molecules to our customers in the future. As we would grow our renewable portfolio and decarbonize our generation fleet and gas delivery system, we'll remain committed to delivering against the triple bottom line: people, planet and profit. 
Before I turn the call over to Rejji, I want to end with this slide. It demonstrates our consistent industry-leading performance for nearly 2 decades. As much as things change, one thing stays consistent, year in and year out, we have and will continue to deliver. 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different, marking 19 years of consistent, predictable financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji."
257682,710741158,2263854,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quar",1248,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. 
In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.35, above our Q1 2020 results, largely driven by rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, better weather and sustained cost performance from our 2020 efforts at the utility. Our enterprises and parent and other segments were slightly down as planned due to the absence of a onetime cost reduction item in 2020 and higher funding-related costs, respectively.
This modest negative variance was more than offset by strong origination growth at EnerBank, which exceeded its Q1 2020 EPS contribution by $0.06 in 2021 as planned and is tracking towards the high end of our guidance for the year of $0.22 per share. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 10 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 and highlights our latest estimates for the major year-to-go drivers to meet our 2021 EPS guidance range. 
To elaborate on our year-to-date performance, while weather in the first quarter of 2020 has been below normal to date, which has led to lower volumetric gas sales, it has been better than the historically warm winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2020. And the absence of that weather has led to $0.08 per share of positive variance period-over-period. 
From a rates perspective, given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses, we're seeing $0.26 per share of positive variance. As a reminder, Our rate relief estimates are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs. It is also worth noting that our 2021 financials reflect the accelerated amortization of deferred taxes as part of our 2020 gas rate order settlement. 
On the cost side, as noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, we budgeted substantial increases in our operating and maintenance expenses in 2021 versus the prior year to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization and an alignment with our recent rate orders. As you can see, we're $0.02 per share above our spend rate in the first quarter of 2020 as planned. And I'm pleased to report that we're seeing sustained cost performance from 2020 as well as increased productivity in 2021, largely attributable to the CE Way. That said, we do expect to see the bulk of the planned O&M increases to materialize later in the year. 
The balance of our year-to-date performance is driven by the aforementioned drivers at our nonutility segments and non-weather sales, which though slightly down at about 1% below the first quarter 2020, continue to exhibit favorable mix with the higher-margin residential class up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. 
And I'll remind you that our total electric sales exclude 1 large low-margin customer. 
As we look ahead to the remaining 9 months of 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the glide path illustrated on this slide to achieve our full year EPS guidance. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.12 per share of negative variance given the above-normal weather experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020. The residual impact of the aforementioned rate relief, which equates to $0.22 per share of pickup and is not subject to any further MPSC actions, and the continued execution of our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate as an incremental $0.18 per share of spend versus the comparable period in 2020. 
We have also assumed the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales and our nonutility segments. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021. And needless to say, we'll be prepared to flex costs up or down as the fact pattern evolves over the course of the year. 
As we look out over the long term, we are in the early stages of executing our $13.2 billion 5-year customer investment plan at the utility, which is highlighted on Slide 11, and will provide significant benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our investors. As a reminder, we have budgeted over $2.5 billion of investments in 2021, the vast majority of which is earmarked for safety, reliability and clean energy projects. We are on track thus far and recently filed an electric rate case in March that enumerates our customer investment priorities for the 2022 test year, which are summarized on the right-hand side of the page among other key details related to the filing. We expect an order from the commission by the end of the year. 
Despite the substantial customer investments that we intend to make on our electric and gas system over the next several years, as you know, we take great pride in taking out costs in a sustainable way to maintain affordable bills for our customers. And we have the track record to prove it. 
The left-hand side of Slide 12 summarizes the key components of our cost structure, which we have successfully managed over the past several years while investing significant capital on behalf of customers. In fact, from 2007 to 2019, we reduced utility bills as a percentage of customer wallet by 1% while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in the utility over that time frame. 
As we look ahead, we have several highly actionable event-driven cost reduction opportunities, which will provide substantial savings in the years to come. The planned expiration of our Palisades power purchase agreement and the recently approved amendment to our MCV PPA will collectively generate roughly $150 million of power supply cost recovery savings. And as you'll note, our initial estimates for the potential savings for the MCV contract amendment of approximately $50 million proved conservative with the revised estimate of over $60 million of savings per the commission's order in March. Also, the planned retirements of our 5 remaining coal units should provide another $90 million of savings in aggregate, exclusive of any potential fuel cost savings, which will create meaningful headroom in bills for future customer investments. 
Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our annual O&M productivity delivered through the CE Way, which last year generated roughly $45 million of savings and serves as a critical tool to our long-term and intra-year financial planning. 
To that end, many of you have asked about proposed changes in corporate tax policy and its potential impact to our plan. Though at this point, the final details remain unclear, trust that we are evaluating the potential effects and we'll leverage the CE Way and other cost reduction opportunities, including potential offsetting tax credits that are also being proposed as part of the legislation to minimize the impact that customers will execute in our capital plan. 
As we've said before, it is our job to do the worrying for you, and we are uniquely positioned over the next several years to manage any potential headwinds. With our unparalleled track record on cost management driven by our highly engaged workforce, coupled with a robust customer investment backlog and top-tier regulatory construct, we are confident that we can deliver on our ambitious operational customer and financial objectives for the foreseeable future. 
And with that, we'll move to Q&A. So Rocco, please open the line."

So you've got strong origination growth. 
And you also, I would say, have a weak comp in Q1 of last year just because as you recall, the pandemic really started to impact the global economy in the sort of latter part of March. And so Q1 of last year picked some of that up. 
We also do have a loan sale as part of that earnings growth. Now this is all on plan. We had anticipated this in our 2021 plan, but that also offers the favorability relative to Q1 of 2020. And we've always talked about the fact that we don't allocate capital to the bank. And so they have to fund their own growth. And so loan sales is certainly part of that strategy.

But with any integrated resource plan, particularly when you get to the end years of that plan, there's about a 10% to 20% gap that you got to close. And that's not unique to CMS. You'll hear our peers talk about that as well. But I will remind you, we're one of the most aggressive plans out there in decarbonization by 2040. So there does need to be technology advancements, that comes in carbon capture, that comes in hydrogen, that comes in terms of lithium ion, both from a reliability as well as affordability perspective. And so all of the above is needed. 
And so in fact, we're just -- even tomorrow, I'm going to be with -- on a call with the Department of Energy and Office of Management and Budget tomorrow to again, we're advocating for R&D-type funding to continue to close that gap, particularly in the out years.

Commercial, down 4%, still not quite at the pre-pandemic levels, but I think that has a bit to do with the resurgence that we've seen in terms of case counts in Michigan. And we do expect over the course of the year, both commercial and industrial, which was down about 2% will be at pre-pandemic levels around midyear.

And so you're getting really to the affordability and the headroom question. And as Rejji mentioned earlier, with the widened proposal, there's a few others out there that we're following closely, and we're advocating, frankly, with EEI in Washington. There's going to be a real tailwind here. I mean we already have a very aggressive solar build out in our current IRP and these renewable credits. And Rejji went through some of the benefits and specifics of the widened proposal, but they can provide a nice tailwind and nice savings opportunity for our customers.
And so I get excited about that. And many of the glass is half full for me, but I think there's some real opportunities there. And to the degree -- I'll just keep this in mind, to the degree there are any headwinds or tax implications for our customers, remember this: if there's one company that I'm going to bet on, it's going to be CMS Energy. 
I mean we've this proven track record of delivering year after year from a cost management perspective, and so through the CE Way and the like. And then as Rejji indicated, these event-driven cost reductions, MCV, Palisades coal plant retirements, I remain optimistic on our ability to manage it. It's still early. There's still proposals on the table. And I'm confident in our ability to manage it on behalf of our customers and keep bills affordable. But Rejji, you might have more to add."

Not to get directly to your question on NOLs, so like we saw when tax reform was enacted in 2017, there was a remeasurement of NOLs, and that led to a noncash loss on a pretty significant one, just with the tax rate going from 35% down to 21%. So if you see it come back, let's say, to 28%, you have a favorable remeasurement. Clearly, we would carve that out like we did. But that could be beneficial because it creates a greater tax shield. 
We also see some benefit at our parent and other segment, which, as you likely know, is primarily interest expense. And so you'd see just a greater value in that tax yield as well. 
Now to your question about whether there's a push for more renewable build given the incentives to offset the rate increases, we'll hold off on our speculation around that 3-dimensional chest. But certainly on the comments we offered earlier, we do think there will be certainly potential attractive incentives and that should offset some of the rate increase implications if the deferral tax rate increase above 21%."

Rejji will walk through the details of the quarter, and I'll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings. Needless to say, I'm very pleased. 
An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3x book value moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And Rejji will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today's remarks. Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan, you can see the path for more than $1 billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that's certainty in the time line for review. I'm excited about this IRP. It's a remarkable plan. Many have set net 0 goals. We have industry-leading net 0 goals and this IRP provides the path and is an important proof point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, an investment thesis gets even simpler. But now it's also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and strengthen our Luna operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality and rent affordability for our customers. and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan's apportive regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and combined with our dividend provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet in profit. As I mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net 0 commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts, making us one of the first utility intimation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out, adding about 8 gigawatts of solar by 2040. And 2 gigawatts from the previous plan. Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid. The purchase of over 2 gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we've done historically with the purchases of our Zealand and Jackson generating stations. This is a shot for us. where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that it's not a 40- to 50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important as we transition to net 0 carbon. In and, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. it would generate $650 million of savings, essentially paying or transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully considered and data-driven. We've analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn't be more proud of this plan. and especially the team that put it together. We've done our homework, and I'm confident it is the best plan for our customers, our coworkers, the great state of Michigan, and of course, you, our investors. It hits the triple bottom way -- The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan's strong regulatory construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking test years and the 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for the IRP and from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year. The visibility provided by Michigan's regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system. 
On Slide 6, you can see that our 5-year capital plan has grown every year. Our current 5-year plan, which we'll update on our year-end call, includes $13.2 billion of needed customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this path forward. And beyond there is plenty of opportunity, both given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system, which serves nearly 7 million people in all 68 counties of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future. 
So where does that put us today? As I stated in my old remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth in position of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs next year, and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward. Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74 dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60%. While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear. We are committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It's what you expect. It's why you own us, and it's a big part of our value. I'll offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately and will happen naturally as we grow our earnings. 
Finally, I want to touch on our warm term growth rate, which is [ 6% to 8%  ] This has not changed. It's driven by the capital investment needs of our system our customers' affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we've grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank we will deliver for the high end through 2025. I'll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off batches. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum. And with EnerBank in the IRP, it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji?"

Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations thereb",1012,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And while we're on Air Bank, I'll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely as the merger application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158 million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results, exclusive of EnerBank's EPS contribution last year. The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and unusual strong tax planning. Year-to-date, we've delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations. All in, we're tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 9 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes the financial performance of EnerBank. For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings with to date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided $0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. 
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering towards the high end of our EPS guidance range, as Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates $0.02 per share a negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020. We'll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share pickup. And I'll remind you, it's not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21 per share a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year. We've also seen the usual conservatism in our utility nonweather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021. 
Turning to our financing plan for the year. I'm pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs at CMS Energy, our parent company for the year. And given the high level of equity content ascribed to the ascribed to the security by the rating agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards. It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the Interbank merger agreement in the event EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. 
Closing out the financing plan, I'll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by one year to 2024, both at the parent and the utility. Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that later today, we'll file our 10-Q which will be the last 10-Q signed by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS, which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure. Glen, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. We certainly left it better than you found it, and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A."

When I think about the environmental community, 60% reduction in CO2, well above and beyond the requirements of the Paris accord, the 2-degree in the 1.5-degree scenario, well above and beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there. A big one for our customers, affordability $650 million of savings. That's a great opportunity. Reliability of maybe better stated resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan than our previous IRP. We've done more homework to ensure that we don't have a Texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors, over $1 billion of incremental investment. The ability to treat these assets not securitization is voluntary. The ability to treat these assets, the existing assets and the book value as a regulatory asset process. I feel really good there's a winning here for everyone. And then there's a win for everyone.

However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we've talked about the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our next 5-year plan, but there'll still be balance after that. And so as we continue to take costs, whether it's through the CE Way or some of these episodic opportunities like PPAs, repricing and so on, Well, that creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital.

And so -- and we're prepared to do that. As Raj alluded to a minute ago, there's a lot of detail, a lot of modeling and data that went into this. And so it's a very strong case."

And then just maybe to Rejji, can you clarify sort of the I'm trying to see the equity elimination through 2024. You don't talk about 2025.

First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this. And so the notion of falling back on as securitization. As we noted when we rolled out the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We're not thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick's comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we've already done with the inclusion of Con 1 and 2 in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet. -- as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is. So with respect to the question around equity, Yes, you're right in that as we disclosed when we announced no bank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even with the capital opportunities that we've announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that upside opportunity. So no additional equity for 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our 5-year plan. So that's still a good working assumption for now. But obviously, there's a lot time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But we now assume $250 million in that out of year of 2025. Is that helpful?"

And it's going to be in our gas business, it's going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there's some growth opportunity there. Then we'll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that's an incremental $1.3 million. And so you can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we're going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the Colbert facility.  And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some of that play out over the 5 years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource plan, it goes from '25 to '27. And so some of that will be able to fall in the 10-year piece as well. And so there's some update that will take place along those lines. So that's kind of the capital out.

So I'll put the IRP aside, we're pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses. And so the current 5-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I'll call clean energy generation spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend. And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of 5-year plans. And so we'll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we're doing a little over $1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we're seeing capital investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, Remember, we're still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt and we're going to own half of that. And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP opportunities. Again, we'll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn't do all of that in the next vintage but fortunate. And again, it's more electric and gas infrastructure as well as clean energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new we're highly confident that we'll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure like tracker and that's in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don't have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense?"

Constantine, we've been quite pleased with what we've seen really across all of the customer classes to date. And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide just we distribute also in the appendix, you can see the year-to-date trends of the presentation today. And so we've got residential year-to-date down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5% and we're ahead of plan. So that does imply that we're seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that's higher margin load. And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we're also seeing commercial and industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021 versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we're seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that creates headroom because you're introducing more kilowatt hours and do the denominator of your rate calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It's still early days, the Pandemic not behind us yet. But again, we're still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we've talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests, they're up over 30% and year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic. So we also look at 2019. And again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are strong. staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction."

We continue to have unemployment rates well below the national average here in Michigan and the heart of our service territory. Grand Rapids, it's even better. And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we've even seen growth in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan. In fact, we're under an NDA right now with the company. But it's $300 million investment, 30 megawatts, 150 jobs that are looking here in our service territory in Michigan.

Rejji will walk through the details of the quarter, and I'll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings. 
Needless to say, I'm very pleased. An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3x book value, moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And in the end, Reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today's remarks. 
Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan,  you can see the path for more than $1 billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that's certainly in the time line for review. I'm excited about this IRP. It's a remarkable plan. Many have set net zero goals. We have industry-leading net 0 goals and this IRP provides a path and is an important proof point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, our investment thesis gets even simpler.  But now it's also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and strengthen our lean operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality, ensuring affordability for our customers, and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan's [ supportive ] regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. As I mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net 0 commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts, making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out, adding about 8 gigawatts of solar by 2040, 2 gigawatts from the previous plan. 
Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid. The purchase of over 2 gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we've done historically with the purchases of our Zeeland and Jackson generating stations. This is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that is not a 40- to 50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important, as we transition to net 0 carbon. 
And, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. It will generate $650 million of savings, essentially paying for our transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully considered and data-driven. We've analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn't be more proud of this plan and especially the team that put it together. We've done our homework, and I'm confident it is the best plan for our customers, our coworkers, for great state of Michigan, of course, you, our investors to hit the triple bottom line. The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan's strong regulatory construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking test years and the 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for the IRP from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year. 
The visibility provided by Michigan's regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system. On Slide 6, you can see that our 5-year capital plan has grown every year. Our current 5-year plan, which we'll update on our year-end call includes $13.2 billion of needed customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this path forward. 
And beyond our IRP, there is plenty of opportunity for our 5-year capital plan to grow given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system, which serves nearly 7 million people in all 
68 counties of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future. 
So where does that put us today? As I stated in my opening remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth and positioning of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs next year and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward.
Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74 dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60%.
While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It's what you expect, it's what you own it, and it is big part of our value. I will offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately, it will happen naturally, as we grow our earning. 
Finally, I want to touch on long-term growth rate, which is 6% to 8%. This has not changed. It's driven by the capital investment needs of our system, our customers' affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we've grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank, we will deliver toward the high end through 2025. I'll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off of actuals. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with EnerBank and the IRP, it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji?"

Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, there",1014,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And while we're on EnerBank, I'll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely, as the merger application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158 million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results, exclusive of EnerBank's EPS contribution last year. 
The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations. 
All in, we're tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes the financial performance of EnerBank. 
For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs [ at ] the utility. The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. 
As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided $0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering towards the high end of our EPS guidance range, as Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.02 per share of negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020. We'll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share of pickup. And I'll remind you, is not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year. We have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility nonweather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021. 
Turning to our financing plan for the year. I'm pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of CMS Energy, our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards. 
It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the EnerBank merger agreement in the event EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing, which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. Closing out the financing plan, I'll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by 1 year to 2024, both at the parent and the utility. 
Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that later today, we'll file our 10-Q, which will be the last 10-Q owned by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS, which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure. 
Glenn, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. You certainly left it better than you found it, and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A."

I'd love to have a case leader, there's no pushback and there's no intervenors.  That happened with every case, as you well know. But here's why I see the IRP. 
There's a win in here. And this is why it's a remarkable plan. There is a win for everyone of the interveners or stakeholders. When I think about the environmental community, 60% reduction in CO2, well above and beyond the requirements of the Paris accord, the 2-degree and the 1.5-degree scenario, well above and beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there. 
And big win for our customers, affordability $650 million of savings. That's a great opportunity. Reliability of maybe better stated resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan than our previous IRP. We've done more homework to ensure that we don't have Texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors, over $1 billion incremental investment, the ability to treat these assets -- [indiscernible] securitization is [indiscernible], the ability to treat these assets, the existing assets and the book value as a regulatory asset process. I feel really good there's a winning here for everyone. And then there's a win for everyone. The opportunity to reach settlement. And even if it's not settlement to go to a whole distance, I feel really good about that. And just one last reminder on this. 2018 IRP

However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we've talked about the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our next 5-year plan, but there'll still be balance after that. And so as we continue to take costs, whether it's through the CE Way or some of these episodic opportunities like PPAs, repricing and so on, well, that creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital.

But to go back to Garrick's comments, our commitment is to grow the dividend beyond the $1.74 per share, where it is today. And then longer term, again, we'll certainly have that dividend grow commensurate with earnings. But certainly, the bank sale and the timing of that will have an impact in the near term and then longer term, again, right in line with earnings growth. And so we feel highly confident that we will have a competitive dividend. And we know that it's a core part of our value proposition, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks."

First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this. And so the notion of falling back on this securitization. As we noted when we rolled out the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We're not thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick's comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we've already done with the inclusion of Con 1 and 2 in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is. 
So with respect to the question around equity, yes, you're right in that as we disclosed when we announced the EnerBank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even with the capital opportunities that we've announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that upside opportunity. So no additional equity. For 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our 5-year plan. So that's still a good working assumption for now. But obviously, there's a lot of time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But for now, assume $250 million in that out of year of 2025. Is that helpful?"

And it's going to be in our gas business, it's going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there's some growth opportunity there. Then we'll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that's an incremental 1.3. And so you can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we're going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the Covert facility.  And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some of that play out over the 5 years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource plan, it goes from '25 to '27. And so some of that [ still will be able ] to fall in the 10-year piece as well. And so there's some update that will take place along those lines. So that's kind of the capital layout.

So I'll put the IRP aside, we're pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses. And so the current 5-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I'll call clean energy generation spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend. 
And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of 5-year plans. And so we'll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we're doing a little over $1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we're seeing capital investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, remember, we're still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt tranche, and we're going to own half of that. 
And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP opportunities. Again, we'll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn't do all of that in the next vintage, but a portion of it. And again, it's more electric and gas infrastructure, as well as clean energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new IRP. We're highly confident that we'll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure, like a tracker and that's in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don't have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense?"

And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide [ just ] we distributed. Also in the appendix, you can see the year-to-date trends in the presentation today. And so we've got residential year-to-date down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5% and we're ahead of plan. So that does imply that we're seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that's higher-margin load. 
And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we're also seeing commercial and industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021 versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we're seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that creates headroom because you're introducing more kilowatt hours [ into ] the denominator of your rate calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It's still early days, the pandemic is not behind us yet. 
But again, we're still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we've talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests, they're up over 30% year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic. So we also look at 2019, again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are strong, staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction."

We continue to have unemployment rates well below the national average here in Michigan in the heart of our service territory. Grand Rapids, it's even better. And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we've even seen growth in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan. In fact, we're under an NDA right now with the company. But it's $300 million investment, 30 megawatts, 150 jobs that are locating here in our service territory in Michigan.

It's great to be with you, and we thank you for your continued interest and support. I'm going to start today with the end in mind, strong quarter and a great first half of the year, giving us confidence as we target the high end of the guidance range. Rejji will walk through the details of the quarter, and I'll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings. 
Needless to say, I'm very pleased. An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3x book value, moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And in the end, Reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today's remarks. 
Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan,  you can see the path for more than $1 billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that's certainly in the time line for review. I'm excited about this IRP. It's a remarkable plan. Many have set net zero goals. We have industry-leading net 0 goals and this IRP provides a path and is an important proof point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, our investment thesis gets even simpler.  But now it's also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and strengthen our lean operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality, ensuring affordability for our customers, and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan's supportive regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. As I mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net 0 commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts, making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out, adding about 8 gigawatts of solar by 2040, 2 gigawatts from the previous plan. 
Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid. The purchase of over 2 gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we've done historically with the purchases of our Zeeland and Jackson generating stations. This is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that is not a 40- to 50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important, as we transition to net 0 carbon. 
And, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. It will generate $650 million of savings, essentially paying for our transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully considered and data-driven. We've analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn't be more proud of this plan and especially the team that put it together. We've done our homework, and I'm confident it is the best plan for our customers, our coworkers, for great state of Michigan, of course, you, our investors to hit the triple bottom line. The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan's strong regulatory construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking test years and the 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for the IRP from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year. 
The visibility provided by Michigan's regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system. On Slide 6, you can see that our 5-year capital plan has grown every year. Our current 5-year plan, which we'll update on our year-end call includes $13.2 billion of needed customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this path forward. 
And beyond our IRP, there is plenty of opportunity for our 5-year capital plan to grow given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system, which serves nearly 7 million people in all
68 counties of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future. 
So where does that put us today? As I stated in my opening remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth and positioning of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs next year and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward.
Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74 dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60%.
While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It's what you expect, it's what you own it, and it is big part of our value. I will offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately, it will happen naturally, as we grow our earning. 
Finally, I want to touch on long-term growth rate, which is 6% to 8%. This has not changed. It's driven by the capital investment needs of our system, our customers' affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we've grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank, we will deliver toward the high end through 2025. I'll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off of actuals. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with EnerBank and the IRP, it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji?"

Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, there",1012,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And while we're on EnerBank, I'll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely, as the merger application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158 million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results, exclusive of EnerBank's EPS contribution last year. 
The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations. 
All in, we're tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes the financial performance of EnerBank. 
For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. 
As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided $0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering towards the high end of our EPS guidance range, as Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.02 per share of negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020. We'll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share of pickup. And I'll remind you, is not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year. We have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility nonweather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021. 
Turning to our financing plan for the year. I'm pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of CMS Energy, our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards. 
It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the EnerBank merger agreement in the event EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing, which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. Closing out the financing plan, I'll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by 1 year to 2024, both at the parent and the utility. 
Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that later today, we'll file our 10-Q, which will be the last 10-Q owned by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS, which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure. 
Glenn, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. You certainly left it better than you found it, and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A."

There's a win in here. And this is why it's a remarkable plan. There is a win for everyone of the interveners or stakeholders. When I think about the environmental community, 60% reduction in CO2, well above and beyond the requirements of the Paris accord, the 2-degree and the 1.5-degree scenario, well above and beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there. 
And big win for our customers, affordability $650 million of savings. That's a great opportunity. Reliability of maybe better stated resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan than our previous IRP. We've done more homework to ensure that we don't have Texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors, over $1 billion incremental investment, the ability to treat these assets -- [indiscernible] securitization is [ voluntary ], the ability to treat these assets, the existing assets and the book value as a regulatory asset process.

We settled that case. 2021 IRP, number of intervenors in that case. And with that pattern of wins that I just walked through, there's a great way that we can reach a great outcome of our IRP.

However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we've talked about the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our next 5-year plan, but there'll still be balance after that.

And when there's a win, there's an opportunity to reach settlement or go the whole distance. And so again, I would just reference 2018. We were very successful with a number of interveners and being able to get to a settlement. But that's what's great about this regulatory construct. We're working with these interveners in the process. And if there's an opportunity to settle where there's an outcome that is good for all, we will do that.

And so we certainly looked at whether we could transition to renewable power more rapidly or fully in as a substitute for the retirements and the economics just don't get you there, plus you also introduce significant reliability and resilience trends given the lack of really long-term storage solutions. 
And so we certainly evaluated it. But as Garrick noted, we deem this plan where it sits today as the best plan for Michigan. And also with the gas facilities and obviously foregoing the O&M and capital we know we would have on our coal facilities, you take that into account with the fuel arbitrage you get from gas versus coal and just less purchases you now have controllable dispatch. It just brings substantial cost savings to customers, which would not be offered if we went to a full renewable solution in lieu of gas as a bridge fuel. So we feel like this is the most economic opportunity for all stakeholders."

First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this. And so the notion of falling back on this securitization. As we noted when we rolled out the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We're not thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick's comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we've already done with the inclusion of Con 1 and 2 in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is. 
So with respect to the question around equity, yes, you're right in that as we disclosed when we announced the EnerBank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even with the capital opportunities that we've announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that upside opportunity. So no additional equity. For 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our 5-year plan. So that's still a good working assumption for now. But obviously, there's a lot of time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But for now, assume $250 million in that out of year of 2025. Is that helpful?"

And it's going to be in our gas business, it's going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there's some growth opportunity there. Then we'll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that's an incremental 1.3. And so you can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we're going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the Covert facility.  And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some of that play out over the 5 years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource plan, it goes from '25 to '27. And so some of that [ solar build will ] fall in the 10-year piece as well. And so there's some update that will take place along those lines. So that's kind of the capital layout.

So I'll put the IRP aside, we're pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses. And so the current 5-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I'll call clean energy generation spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend. 
And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of 5-year plans. And so we'll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we're doing a little over $1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we're seeing capital investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, remember, we're still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt tranche, and we're going to own half of that. 
And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP opportunities. Again, we'll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn't do all of that in the next vintage, but a portion of it. And again, it's more electric and gas infrastructure, as well as clean energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new IRP. We're highly confident that we'll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure, like a tracker and that's in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don't have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense?"

And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide [ just ] we distributed. Also in the appendix, you can see the year-to-date trends in the presentation today. And so we've got residential year-to-date down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5% and we're ahead of plan. So that does imply that we're seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that's higher-margin load. 
And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we're also seeing commercial and industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021 versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we're seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that creates headroom because you're introducing more kilowatt hours [ into ] the denominator of your rate calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It's still early days, the pandemic is not behind us yet. 
But again, we're still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we've talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests, they're up over 30% year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic. So we also look at 2019, again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are strong, staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction."

And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we've even seen growth in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan.

And then you couple that with the fact that you're going to forego earnings on $1.2 billion of rate base over time. And so you couple sort of the impact on the denominator where you just have dollar for dollar debt of $1.2 billion, and then you have the dilution in your numerator because you're foregoing earnings on that equity portion of that rate base over that period of time.

I'm pleased to share we've delivered another strong quarter and continue to be ahead of plan for the year. I'll walk through the specifics in a moment, but I couldn't be more pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by the team. both operationally and financially. We continue to deliver every day for our customers, coworkers and for you, our investors. 
Earlier this month, we completed the sale of EnerBank, grossing over $1 billion in proceeds. I want to thank the entire team that brought this to close. The sale of the bank simplifies and focuses our business model squarely on energy, primarily the regulated utility, an important step as we continue to lead the Clean Energy transformation. 
The proceeds from this sale will fund key initiatives in our utility business related to safety, reliability, resiliency and our clean energy transformation. As shared in previous calls, we have eliminated our equity needs from 2022 through 2024. 
Furthermore, Rejji will highlight in his prepared remarks while we have continued to reduce this year's equity needs as well. The keyword there, continued. 
As we double down on the Clean Energy transformation, I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for our voluntary Green Pricing program, which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of owned renewable generation to our growing renewable portfolio. This program is in high demand and currently oversubscribed. And more importantly, it's what our customers are asking for. an important step in offering renewable energy solutions for our customers. 
As we prepare for the grid of the future, we have a highly visible and detailed capital plans outlined in our recently filed electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. This plan provides a 5-year view of the projects down to the circuit level where we plan to invest to ensure the reliability and resiliency of our electric infrastructure and aligns with our operational and financial plans. 
As always, we balance these investments with customer affordability. Our prices remain competitive as the average residential customer face about $2 a day to heat their home and $4 a day to keep the lights on. And because we know our most vulnerable customers still struggle, our team has mobilized resources at the state and federal levels to ensure their protection. 
In fact, as we approach the winter heating season, our 90-day arrears are back to prepandemic levels with an 80% reduction in our uncollectible accounts. Our commitment to identifying and eliminating waste means that we keep our prices affordable. This commitment is evident in our results. In the first 9 months of this year, we surpassed our full year cost reduction target of more than $40 million. The [ CUA ] is in our DNA, and we continue to deliver savings in the near term and well into the future. 
Speaking of the future, this year, we grew our EV program with PowerMIFleet. This is part of our long-term planning in collaboration with Michigan businesses, governments and school systems looking to electrify their vehicle fleets. Within just a few months of the program introduction, we were working with nearly 20 different customers on their fleets and have another 50 who have indicated interest in the next tranche, exceeding our expectations. This is an important contribution to our long-term sales growth. 
And finally, one of my favorites which speaks to our culture, our coworkers and our ability to attract the best talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be recognized nationwide and most recently by Forbes, where we were ranked the #1 utility in the U.S. for both America's best employers for women and #1 for diversity, delivering excellence every day continues to position the business for sustainable long-term growth. 
Strong execution leads to strong results. but 2 are linked. One drives the other. In early August, we experienced one of the worst storms in our company's history. Our team established and into command structure to deploy resources and took decisive action to restore customers. We had a record number of crews on our system. The speed of our response led to the highest positive customer sentiment we have ever received during a major storm. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank all our coworkers who responded to the call. 
During the storm, we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely restore customers. Like we do every year, through storms, pandemics, and on seasonal weather, we continue to deliver. And when there's upside, we reinvest. This is the CMS model of responding to changing conditions that allows us to deliver consistently year after year. 
Year-to-date, we've delivered ahead of plan with adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for continuing operations. Our strong performance, coupled with the completion of the EnerBank transaction and the financial flexibility that provides gives us further confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance, which we've raised to $2.63 to $2.65 from $2.61 to $2.65 for continuing operations. 
For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. And our continued strong performance in 2021 builds momentum for 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we are committed to growing our adjusted EPS toward the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range as we highlighted on our Q2 call. As previously stated, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and beyond. That's what you expect, why you own us, and we know it's a big part of our value. 
As we move forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. Many of you have asked about gas prices and the impact on our business and more importantly, our customers. 
Let me tell you about our gas business. We have one of the largest storage field in the U.S. and compression resources to match. That is a significant advantage. We started putting natural gas into our storage field in April and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low. Right now, our fields are full and ready to deliver for our customers' heating needs throughout the winter months. 
Most of the gas is already locked in at just under $3 per thousand cubic feet, which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value. Given the operational certainty of storage as well as the financial protection of a pass-through clause, our customers stay safe and warm all winter long and have affordable bills. Heat in Michigan is not an option. And we don't leave it up to the market. We buy, store and deliver. That's what we do. 
Michigan's strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best. It includes the integrated resource plan process, which is a result of legislation designed to ensure timely recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe, reliable and clean energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking test years and 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process gives visibility on our future growth. It enables the company and the commission to align on long-term generation supply planning and provide certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. 
Here's what I like about our recently filed IRP. There is a win in it for everyone. It is a remarkable plan that addresses many of the interests of our stakeholders and ensure supply reliability. It reduces costs. and it delivers industry-leading carbon emission reductions. It's clean. We continue to have constructive dialogue with the staff and other stakeholders, and we anticipate seeing their positions later today. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

I'm pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS and as a result of solid execution across the company.

I'm pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS and as a result of solid execution across the company. As a brief reminder, we are at our materials, we report the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations thereby removing it as a reportable segment in reporting our quarterly and year-to-date results from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Now on to the results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $156 million or $0.54 per share. The key drivers for the quarter were higher service restoration expenses, attributable to the August storms that Garrick mentioned and planned increases in other operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer and operational initiatives. These sources of negative variance for the quarter were partially offset by favorable weather, the continued recovery of commercial and industrial sales in our electric business and higher rate relief net of investment-related expenses. 
Year-to-date, we've delivered adjusted net income of $628 million or $2.18 per share, which is up $0.19 per share versus the first 9 months of 2020, exclusive of EnerBank's financial performance. All in, we continue to trend ahead of plan and have substantial financial flexibility heading into the fourth quarter. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. For the first 9 months of the year, rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses. 
As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. This upside has been partially offset by the aforementioned storms in the quarter, which drove $0.16 per share of negative variance versus the third quarter of 2020 and $0.11 per share of downside on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2020. 
To round out the customer initiatives bucket, planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund safety, reliability and decarbonization initiatives added the balance of spend for the first 9 months of the year, which, in addition to the August storm activity, added $0.35 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. 
As a reminder, these cost categories are still net of cost savings realized to date, which as Garrick mentioned, have already exceeded our target for the year with more upside to come. To close out our year-to-date performance, we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.07 per share and another $0.02 per share of upside, largely driven by recovering commercial and industrial load. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path for delivering on our EPS guidance range, which has been revised upward to $2.63 to $2.65 per share, as Garrick noted. As we look ahead, we continue to plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.06 per share of positive variance given the absence of the unfavorable weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll also continue to benefit from the residual impact of our 2020 rate orders, which equates to $0.07 per share and is not subject to any further MPSC actions, and we'll make steady progress on our operational and customer-related initiatives which are forecasted to have a financial impact of roughly $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. 
Lastly, we'll assume the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance. All in, we are pleased with our strong execution to date in 2021 and are well positioned for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'm pleased to highlight that this year's financing plan has been completed ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 2.65%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved at Consumers Energy. We also remarketed $35 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds earlier this month at a rate of under 1% through 2026. 
Due to the strong execution implied by these record-setting issuances coupled with the EnerBank sale, which provided approximately $60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing, we now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year even further, which will now be limited to the $57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up to Q&A."

Now you know we plan conservatively. And in Q4, we'll provide our capital plan. We expect that capital plan to grow with things you would be familiar with, the gas system, the electric system and the supply system. However, the IRP, and particularly the covert plant in 2023 and the dig assets in 2025 are upside to that plan. And once we have complete certainty on that IRP process, those provide the opportunity for upside to the plan.

That does not presuppose any outcome for the IRP, and there's about [ $1.3 billion ] of additional capital investment opportunities that is on the outside looking in, which just gives us more confidence in the plan. 
We also are not planning to issue equity. And so there's a funding efficiency that will also be accretive to our financial performance as we see it. And what's also not in the plan from a capital investment perspective that Garrick offered in his prepared remarks, was a voluntary Green Pricing program that we got approval on, which offers about a gigawatt of capital investment opportunities, specifically renewable spend that we would own from '24 through '27.

And so I feel really confident about the messages and the testimony are strong and solid and will yield really good outcomes. 
But in my prepared remarks, I said there's a win in this for everyone, and I really believe that. When you look at this plan, our 2018-2019 IRP was a great plan. This is even better. The resiliency and reliability of our electric supply, we've done the modeling, it's more reliable plan than the past. It's more affordable. $650 million of savings in this plan over the previous plan. And we cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2025, well ahead of the Paris [ accord ], the equivalent of taking 12.5 million cars off the road. 
And from my standpoint here in the regulatory asset treatment as I shared in the Q2 call, great testimony, and I think we're going to have a constructive dialogue and certainly a supportive dialogue, we'll see this afternoon in the intervenor comments. And so -- there is a win in here for everyone. And when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a great path to a great outcome. And I believe that we saw that in 2018 and 2019. And so I'm looking forward to seeing staff and intervener's testimony this afternoon. It's going to be supportive. It will be balanced. It will be constructive and where the difference is.

One, we're seeing more severe weather, not just in Michigan, but across the U.S. And so that is certainly a driver in the equation. And then two, when we think about this transition to electric vehicles and be able to support those vehicles. Not only do we need the capacity out there to be able to do that. But also, we want to ensure that when we do have an interruption in service. Today, it's just the refrigerator. Tomorrow, it's the refrigerator and the EV and their ability to get to work. That's a whole new standard of performance. And so again, big picture perspective, looking at for the future, I see this as an opportunity and an inflection point where we spend more time on thinking about resiliency and grid hardening. 
I'll share one last point on this. I've had the opportunity post storm to talk with the governor to talk with the chair scripts. And I can't speak for them, but certainly a positive direction when we talked about how do we design the grid for the future with climate change and with severe weather in mind. And so again, it's an opportunity for investors and an opportunity to create additional value for our customers."

Slide 13. I'll point you to also the detailed 15-page digest also. It has some good content and load. But what I can say at a very high level is we continue to be encouraged by the residential weather-normalized load we're seeing. 
So you probably saw year-to-date down roughly 2%, but that certainly compares favorable to plan where we assumed a more aggressive return to facilities for workers. And so we do think that this sort of hybrid format or mass teleworking trend should carry on and potentially be part of a new normal. And so in our budget, we had much more bearish expectations. 
This year, we actually thought there'd be a quicker recovery and you see this down 2%. That's in excess of plan. And so we see performance to the upside there. And then we also compare it to the pre-pandemic level. And relative to 2019, we're up about 2.5%. And so we do think there's a very nice bit of resiliency to the residential load. And again, it offers a higher margin relative to the other customer classes as you know."

And so what I would add there is you do have a few sources or, I'll say, buckets of variants that lead to that delta between what we requested and where the PFD ended up. And so I would say cost of capital is a component. So we asked for a 10.5% ROE. The ALJ was at [ 9.7 ]. And so that makes up a good portion of the difference. Also, you see a difference in equity thickness. And so we were at 52% equity relative to debt. And the PFD was about 1 point lower than that, I call it, 51% [ in ] change. 
And so those are the primary sources of difference. There also were differences in opinion on the capital required to really strengthen and harden the system. And so I think -- if memory serves me, there's about $0.25 billion of capital investments that we were proposing for resiliency and reliability, which obviously we think is critically important, particularly on the heels of the August storm activity we saw. And we saw that also as a recommended disallowance of future spend. And so I'd say those are the major buckets there. And I think once you normalize for the prevailing ROE and equity thickness, you start to tighten that gap, but it's primarily to those buckets."

What it will likely entail is, as you may recall, we had -- when we rolled out our 10-year plan and, say, the back half of 2019, if memory serves me, we said we had about $3 billion to $4 billion of upside capital investment opportunities, which were not part of that 10-year, $25 billion plan, and it largely had to do with electric and gas infrastructure modernization. 
And so those will be the likely components that are added to the capital plan going forward and represent that, call it, roughly $1 billion of upside. I also think we're going to obviously roll forward our IRP-related solar investments that are part of just the existing IRP that we're executing on.

We increased our forestry spend this year by a little over 60%. And that was supported through a rate case process by the commission. And the commissioners understand that we're in the first year of that. The #1 cause for outages is tree trimming. And we have a very aggressive program now in place, which will benefit our customers. 
And so our commissioners, I believe, understand that we're in the early years of these larger investments and operational maintenance expense, which will help our customers.

And we saw that with EnerBank's outperformance over those handful of months. And so that led to about $60 million of upside from the gross proceeds we announced at signing, which was $960 million, not to the amount that we ultimately saw at closing, which was over $1 billion, call it, just under $1.20 billion.

I'm pleased to share we've delivered another strong quarter and continue to be ahead of plan for the year. I'll walk through the specifics in a moment, but I couldn't be more pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by the team, both operationally and financially. We continue to deliver every day for our customers, coworkers and for you, our investors. 
Earlier this month, we completed the sale of EnerBank, grossing over $1 billion in proceeds. I want to thank the entire team that brought this to close. The sale of the bank simplifies and focuses our business model squarely on energy, primarily the regulated utility, an important step as we continue to lead the clean energy transformation. 
The proceeds from this sale will fund key initiatives in our utility business related to safety, reliability, resiliency and our clean energy transformation. As shared in previous calls, we have eliminated our equity needs from 2022 through 2024. Furthermore, Rejji will highlight in his prepared remarks while we have continued to reduce this year's equity needs as well. The keyword there, continued. 
As we double down on the clean energy transformation, I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of owned renewable generation to our growing renewable portfolio. This program is in high demand and currently oversubscribed. And more importantly, it's what our customers are asking for, an important step in offering renewable energy solutions for our customers. 
As we prepare for the grid of the future, we have a highly visible and detailed capital plans outlined in our recently filed electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. This plan provides a 5-year view of the projects down to the circuit level where we plan to invest to ensure the reliability and resiliency of our electric infrastructure and aligns with our operational and financial plans. 
As always, we balance these investments with customer affordability. Our prices remain competitive as the average residential customer pays about $2 a day to heat their home and $4 a day to keep the lights on. And because we know our most vulnerable customers still struggle, our team has mobilized resources at the state and federal levels to ensure their protection. 
In fact, as we approach the winter heating season, our 90-day arrears are back to prepandemic levels with an 80% reduction in our uncollectible accounts. Our commitment to identifying and eliminating waste means that we keep our prices affordable. This commitment is evident in our results. In the first 9 months of this year, we surpassed our full year cost reduction target of more than $40 million. The CE Way is in our DNA, and we continue to deliver savings in the near term and well into the future. 
Speaking of the future, this year, we grew our EV program with PowerMIFleet. This is part of our long-term planning in collaboration with Michigan businesses, governments and school systems looking to electrify their vehicle fleets. Within just a few months of the program introduction, we were working with nearly 20 different customers on their fleets and have another 50 who have indicated interest in the next tranche, exceeding our expectations. This is an important contribution to our long-term sales growth. 
And finally, one of my favorites which speaks to our culture, our coworkers and our ability to attract the best talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be recognized nationwide and most recently by Forbes, where we were ranked the #1 utility in the U.S. for both America's best employers for women and #1 for diversity, delivering excellence every day continues to position the business for sustainable long-term growth. 
Strong execution leads to strong results. but 2 are linked. One drives the other. In early August, we experienced one of the worst storms in our company's history. Our team established and into command structure to deploy resources and took decisive action to restore customers. We had a record number of crews on our system. The speed of our response led to the highest positive customer sentiment we have ever received during a major storm. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank all our coworkers who responded to the call. 
During the storm, we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely restore customers. Like we do every year, through storms, pandemics, and on seasonal weather, we continue to deliver. And when there's upside, we reinvest. This is the CMS model of responding to changing conditions that allows us to deliver consistently year after year. 
Year-to-date, we've delivered ahead of plan with adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for continuing operations. Our strong performance, coupled with the completion of the EnerBank transaction and the financial flexibility that provides -- gives us further confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance, which we've raised to $2.63 to $2.65 from $2.61 to $2.65 for continuing operations. 
For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. And our continued strong performance in 2021 builds momentum for 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we are committed to growing our adjusted EPS toward the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range as we highlighted on our Q2 call. As previously stated, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and beyond. That's what you expect, why you own us, and we know it's a big part of our value. As we move forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. 
Many of you have asked about gas prices and the impact on our business and more importantly, our customers. Let me tell you about our gas business. We have one of the largest storage field in the U.S. and compressing resources to match. That is a significant advantage. We started putting natural gas into our storage field in April and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low. Right now, our fields are full and ready to deliver for our customers' heating needs throughout the winter months. 
Most of the gas is already locked in at just under $3 per thousand cubic feet, which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value. Given the operational certainty of storage as well as the financial protection of a pass-through clause, our customers stay safe and warm all winter long and have affordable bills. Heat in Michigan is not an option. And we don't leave it up to the market. We buy, store and deliver. That's what we do. 
Michigan's strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best. It includes the integrated resource plan process, which is a result of legislation designed to ensure timely recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe, reliable and clean energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking test years and 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process gives visibility on our future growth. It enables the company and the commission to align on long-term generation supply planning and provide certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. 
Here's what I like about our recently filed IRP. There is a win in it for everyone. It is a remarkable plan that addresses many of the interests of our stakeholders and ensure supply reliability. It reduces costs and it delivers industry-leading carbon emission reductions. It's clean. We continue to have constructive dialogue with the staff and other stakeholders, and we anticipate seeing their positions later today. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji."
257682,1684670042,2416160,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS, as a result of solid execution across the company.

I'm pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS, as a result of solid execution across the company. As a brief reminder, throughout our materials, we report the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations thereby removing it as a reportable segment in reporting our quarterly and year-to-date results from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Now on to the results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $156 million or $0.54 per share. The key drivers for the quarter were higher service restoration expenses, attributable to the August storms that Garrick mentioned and planned increases in other operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer and operational initiatives. These sources of negative variance for the quarter were partially offset by favorable weather, the continued recovery of commercial and industrial sales in our electric business and higher rate relief net of investment-related expenses. 
Year-to-date, we've delivered adjusted net income of $628 million or $2.18 per share, which is up $0.19 per share versus the first 9 months of 2020, exclusive of EnerBank's financial performance. All in, we continue to trend ahead of plan and have substantial financial flexibility heading into the fourth quarter. 
The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. For the first 9 months of the year, rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses. 
As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. This upside has been partially offset by the aforementioned storms in the quarter, which drove $0.16 per share of negative variance versus the third quarter of 2020 and $0.11 per share of downside on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2020. 
To round out the customer initiatives bucket, planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund safety, reliability and decarbonization initiatives added the balance of spend for the first 9 months of the year, which, in addition to the August storm activity, added $0.35 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. 
As a reminder, these cost categories are still net of cost savings realized to date, which as Garrick mentioned, have already exceeded our target for the year with more upside to come. To close out our year-to-date performance, we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.07 per share and another $0.02 per share of upside, largely driven by recovering commercial and industrial load. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path for delivering on our EPS guidance range, which has been revised upward to $2.63 to $2.65 per share, as Garrick noted. As we look ahead, we continue to plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.06 per share of positive variance, given the absence of the unfavorable weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll also continue to benefit from the residual impact of our 2020 rate orders, which equates to $0.07 per share and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And we'll make steady progress on our operational and customer-related initiatives which are forecasted to have a financial impact of roughly $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. 
Lastly, we'll assume the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance. All in, we are pleased with our strong execution to date in 2021 and are well positioned for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'm pleased to highlight that this year's financing plan has been completed ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 2.65%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved at Consumers Energy. We also remarketed $35 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds earlier this month at a rate of under 1% through 2026. 
Due to the strong execution implied by these record-setting issuances coupled with the EnerBank sale, which provided approximately $60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing, we now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year even further, which will now be limited to the $57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A."

And we reaffirmed our guidance for that time period, $2.85 to $2.87. And as we said in previous calls, when I look out at office 2022 base, it continues to be at this growth rate of 6% to 8%, and I would expect us to be towards the high end of that. 
Now you know we plan conservatively. And in Q4, we'll provide our capital plan. We expect that capital plan to grow with the things you would be familiar with, the gas system, the electric system and the supply system. However, the IRP, and particularly the Covert plan in 2023 and the dig assets in 2025 are upside to that plan. And once we have complete certainty on that IRP process, those provide the opportunity for upside to the plan. 
And so I mean that's the -- there's a great deal of confidence that I have about our -- this 5-year window. When I look at from 2021 through 2025. But certainly, Rejji jump in to add some additional context."

And Constantine, the only thing I would add just to give you a bit more specifics around the numbers, so our current plan that we're executing on for 5 years or '21 through 2025, it's about $13.2 billion. We have not changed that, but we are assuming that we'll increase that by about $1 billion next year and the next vintage, into Garrick's comments. That does not presuppose any outcome for the IRP, and there's about $1.3 billion of additional capital investment opportunities that is on the outside looking in, which just gives us more confidence in the plan. 
We also are not planning to issue equity. And so there's a funding efficiency that will also be accretive to our financial performance as we see it. And what's also not in the plan from a capital investment perspective that Garrick offered in his prepared remarks, was a voluntary Green Pricing program that we got approval on, which offers about a gigawatt of capital investment opportunities, specifically renewable spend that we would own from '24 through '27. And so all of that's in the outside looking in. So you can see why we have great confidence in our ability to deliver towards that high end off of the 2022 base."

And so I feel really confident about -- the messages and the testimony are strong and solid and will yield really good outcomes. 
But in my prepared remarks, I said there's a win in this for everyone, and I really believe that. When you look at this plan, our 2018-2019 IRP was a great plan. This is even better. The resiliency and reliability of our electric supply, we've done the modeling, it's more reliable plan than the past. It's more affordable. $650 million of savings in this plan over the previous plan. And we cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2025, well ahead of the Paris accord, the equivalent of taking 12.5 million cars off the road. 
And from my standpoint here in the regulatory asset treatment, as I shared in the Q2 call, great testimony, and I think we're going to have a constructive dialogue and certainly a supportive dialogue, we'll see this afternoon in the intervenor comments. And so -- there is a win in here for everyone. And when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a great path to a great outcome. And I believe that we saw that in 2018 and 2019. And so I'm looking forward to seeing staff and intervener's testimony this afternoon. It's going to be supportive. It will be balanced. It will be constructive and where there are differences, we've done that before. And just look at our 2018, 2019 IRP. I feel good about where we're at in the process."

And I'll be really clear, the fact pattern of storms has been different across the state. We've had one major storm. But if you stand back and look at the big picture and look forward from a strategy perspective, there certainly is a call for greater resiliency and grid hardening. And that's an opportunity, opportunity from an investment perspective and an opportunity to create greater value for our customers. And so I think there's a couple of things driving that. 
One, we're seeing more severe weather, not just in Michigan, but across the U.S. And so that is certainly a driver in the equation. And then two, when we think about this transition to electric vehicles and be able to support those vehicles, not only do we need the capacity out there to be able to do that. But also, we want to ensure that when we do have an interruption in service. Today, it's just the refrigerator. Tomorrow, it's the refrigerator and the EV and their ability to get to work. That's a whole new standard of performance. And so again, big picture perspective, looking at towards the future, I see this as an opportunity and an inflection point where we spend more time on thinking about resiliency and grid hardening. 
I'll share one last point on this. I've had the opportunity, post-storm, to talk with the governor to talk with the chair scripts. And I can't speak for them, but certainly a positive direction when we talked about how do we design the grid for the future with climate change and with severe weather in mind. And so again, it's an opportunity for investors and an opportunity to create additional value for our customers."

Slide 13. I'll point you to also the detailed 15-page digest also. It has some good content and load. But what I can say at a very high level is we continue to be encouraged by the residential weather-normalized load we're seeing. 
So you probably saw year-to-date down roughly 2%, but that certainly compares favorable to plan where we assumed a more aggressive return to facilities for workers. And so we do think that this sort of hybrid format or mass teleworking trend should carry on and potentially be part of a new normal. And so in our budget, we had much more bearish expectations. 
This year, we actually thought there'd be a quicker recovery and you see this down 2%. That's in excess of plan. And so we see performance to the upside there. And then we also compare it to the prepandemic level. And relative to 2019, we're up about 2.5%. And so we do think there's a very nice bit of resiliency to the residential load. And again, it offers a higher margin relative to the other customer classes as you know."

And so what I would add there is you do have a few sources or, I'll say, buckets of variants that lead to that delta between what we requested and where the PFD ended up. And so I would say cost of capital is a component. So we asked for a 10.5% ROE. The ALJ was at [ 9.7 ]. And so that makes up a good portion of the difference. Also, you see a difference in equity thickness. And so we were at 52% equity relative to debt. And the PFD was about 1 point lower than that, I call it, 51% and change. 
And so those are the primary sources of difference. There also were differences in opinion on the capital required to really strengthen and harden the system. And so I think -- if memory serves me, there's about $0.25 billion of capital investments that we were proposing for resiliency and reliability, which obviously we think is critically important, particularly on the heels of the August storm activity we saw. And we saw that also as a recommended disallowance of future spend. And so I'd say those are the major buckets there. And I think once you normalize for the prevailing ROE and equity thickness, you start to tighten that gap, but it's primarily to those buckets."

What it will likely entail is, as you may recall, we had -- when we rolled out our 10-year plan, in say, the back half of 2019, if memory serves me, we said we had about $3 billion to $4 billion of upside capital investment opportunities, which were not part of that 10-year, $25 billion plan, and it largely had to do with electric and gas infrastructure modernization. 
And so those will be the likely components that are added to the capital plan going forward and represent that, call it, roughly $1 billion of upside.

We increased our forestry spend this year by a little over 60%. And that was supported through a rate case process by the commission. And the commissioners understand that we're in the first year of that. The #1 cause for outages is tree trimming. And we have a very aggressive program now in place, which will benefit our customers. 
And so our commissioners, I believe, understand that we're in the early years of these larger investments and operational maintenance expense, which will help our customers.

And we saw that with EnerBank's outperformance over those handful of months. And so that led to about $60 million of upside from the gross proceeds we announced at signing, which was $960 million, not to the amount that we ultimately saw at closing, which was over $1 billion, call it, just under $1.20 billion. And so that's what gave us the upside and financial flexibility to reduce the equity needs.

I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple of months as I've transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another yea",1571,"Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple of months as I've transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. 
Before I discuss our year-end results and our updated 5-year capital investment plan, I want to take a moment to reiterate our simple but powerful investment thesis. 
While simple to put on paper, it's not easy to replicate and that is what sets us apart. It starts with our industry-leading commitments to clean energy. Our net 0 methane and carbon goals require significant investment, as we update our expansive electric and gas systems to achieve decarbonization. 
These investment opportunities are supported by constructive energy legislation as well as alignment with our commission and the MPSC staff. This strong regulatory and legislative framework is why Michigan has consistently ranked a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. But investment opportunities in a supportive regulatory environment are not enough. Our focus on affordability is critical, so our customers can afford these investments. 
Now I've been with the company for 18 years, much of it in operations. Over that time, we've demonstrated our ability to consistently manage costs as we've invested in the safety and reliability of our systems while improving customer service. That ability to manage cost is not driven from the top-down but from the bottom-up. It's our 8,500 coworkers who are committed to excellence, delivering the highest value to our customers at the lowest cost possible. This is embedded in our culture and was built in partnership with our union over the last 2 decades. These unique attributes to the CMS story are what allow us to deliver for our customers and you, our investors. 
Our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Our ability to deliver this growth each and every year is something we are uniquely capable of doing. Regardless of weather, a global pandemic, who's leading our state, our commission or our company, we have delivered consistent industry-leading results, year in and year out, 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different. 
In 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, up 7% from 2019 and achieved operating cash flow of almost $2 billion, excluding $700 million of voluntary pension contributions in 2020. Today, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 by $0.01 to $2.83 to $2.87, with a focus on the midpoint. This reflects annual growth of 6% to 8% from our 2020 results. 
Last month, we announced our 15th dividend increase in as many years, $1.74 per share, up 7% from the prior year. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again, with a focus on the midpoint. Today, we're also increasing our 5-year capital plan to $13.2 billion, up $1 billion from our prior plan. 18 consecutive years of industry-leading financial performance. I'll let that sit with you for a moment. 
I'm pleased with our financial performance. But equally important is our commitment to the triple bottom line. We balance everything we do for our coworkers, customers and the communities we serve, our planet and our investors, as demonstrated on Slide 6. 
2020. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. The global pandemic impacted all of us emotionally, physically and financially. Throughout all, I'm proud of the work done by our coworkers. We were able to provide over $80 million of support to our customers and communities in 2020 through support programs, low-income assistance, donations to foundations and reinvestments to improve safety and reliability. We focused our efforts on COVID relief for residential and small business customers, payment forgiveness as well as enhanced support in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Despite changing our work practices, as a result of the pandemic, we maintained first quartile employee engagement, achieved first quartile customer experience and attracted 126 megawatts of new load to our state, which brings with a significant investment in over 4,000 new jobs. 
From a planet perspective, we continue to lead the clean energy transition. We added over 800 megawatts of new wind and are executing on 300 megawatts of new solar, the first tranche of our integrated resource plan. Further in our commitment, over $700 million of investments were made to advance our clean energy transition. Additionally, our demand response and energy efficiency programs continue to save our customers' money, reduce carbon and earn an incentive. And last, but certainly not least, we finished the year with more than $100 million in cost savings driven by the CE Way.
 Many of you have asked about my commitment to the CE Way. The light blue arrow at the bottom of the slide and my experience leading this operating system over the past 5 years should be a strong signal. I'll tell you this, we are positioned well, but there is still more opportunity. Through the CE Way, we will continue to improve reliability, reduce waste and deliver better customer service, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. 
There are opportunities in every corner of the company to achieve excellence through the CE Way. My coworkers and I remain committed. We will continue to lead the clean energy transition with support from our new 5-year $13.2 billion capital investment plan, which translates to over 7% annual rate-base growth and focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system as we move toward net zero carbon and methane emissions.
In fact, 40% of our plan directly supports our clean energy transition and includes our renewable generation, electric distribution investments to support this generation, grid modernization as well as programs like our main Vintage Service Replacement programs, which reduce methane emissions. 
In addition to our traditional rate base returns, our wind investments, renewable PPAs and demand signed resources are supported by regulatory incentives above and beyond our ROE. These incremental earnings mechanisms enhance our earned returns. And combined with our investments in clean energy, our growing percentage of our earnings mix. Our customers' ability to afford the investments in our system is complemented by our continued focus on cost savings. Over the last decade, we have reduced the utility bill as a percentage of the customer's wallet, and we continue to see further opportunity to reduce costs in the future. We have unique cost-saving opportunities relative to peers and 2 above-market PPAs, Palisades and MCV, which will generate nearly $140 million of power supply cost recovery savings.
This, coupled with the future retirement of our remaining coal facilities provides over $200 million or 5% cost savings for our customers. These structural cost savings, combined with the productivity will deliver through the CE Way will ensure we deliver on our capital plan and keep customer bills affordable.
 Now the great thing, the great thing, about the CE Way is it delivers more than cost savings. What makes us unique is our engaged coworkers. We value our best in sector employee engagement and our 8,500 coworkers who work every day to deliver the best value for our customers. This engaged workforce has doubled productivity, which has enabled us to consistently increase our capital plan without significantly increasing our workforce. 
 Furthermore, we have never served our customers better as we move from the bottom quartile to top quartile, not just in the utility industry but across all industries. Slide 9 serves as an -- Slide 9 serves as an excellent example of how our team leverages the CE Way to deliver on our triple bottom line. Our ability to deliver this level of excellence for our customers and investors is supported by Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. We benefit from a legislative and regulatory construct that supports our rate case proceedings and a statute that allows for financial incentives above and beyond current authorized ROE. Michigan's regulatory jurisdiction has been ranked in the top tier since 2013. That's not by accident. It's a reflection of the hard work my coworkers do every day to earn the trust of our customers, policymakers, environmental groups and the MPSC staff. We are proud to have a commission that demonstrates strong leadership with diverse backgrounds, which was enhanced with the appointment of Commissioner Peretick. We welcome Commissioner Peretick and look forward to working with her in the future. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note we have a light regulatory docket with no financially significant regulatory outcomes in 2021. With the approval of our current securitization and electric rate case in December of last year, we'll file our next electric rate case in the first quarter and our gas rate case in December of this year. 
Notably, we'll follow a second generation of our integrated resource plan in June. I'm sure many of you would like a sneak peek, but it's too early. We're in the midst of the modeling phase. You can be confident that this next iteration will continue to build our industry-leading clean energy commitments, and we'll find ways to get cleaner, faster and incorporate storage and customer-driven solutions as they become more cost-effective. Beyond that, we'll ask you to stay tuned until our second quarter earnings call, where we will provide more information after we file.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year off our 2019 actuals. And I'll briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring it",1247,"Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year off our 2019 actuals. And I'll briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring items previously discussed in our third quarter earnings call and enumerated in this morning's releases. To elaborate on the key drivers of our year-end results, we released -- we realized increases in rate relief net of investments due to constructive orders and our recent gas and electric rate cases, strong performance in our nonutility segments, and most notably, our historic company-wide cost reduction efforts led by the CE Way, which Garrick noted earlier. 
These positive factors were partially offset by mild weather and reinvestments or flex up back into the business. We've talked in the past about our practice of flexing up, which enables us to put financial upside to work in the second half of the year to pull ahead or commit to work to improve the safety and reliability of our DAS and electric systems to fund customer support programs, which was particularly important in 2020 given the effects of the pandemic, invest in coworker training programs and derisk our financial plan in subsequent years. This tried and true approach benefits all stakeholders, which is the essence of the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.
On Slide 13, you'll note that we met our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive with Garrick's earlier remarks, I'll just note that we invested $2.3 billion of capital in our electric and gas infrastructure to the benefit of customers, including investments in wind farms, which add approximately $500 million of RPS related rate base, which I'll remind you, earns a premium return on equity of 10.7%. 
I'll also note that our treasury team had a banner year, successfully raising approximately $3.5 billion of cost-effective capital, which includes roughly $250 million of equity while navigating turbulent capital market conditions over the course of 2020. These efforts further strengthen our balance sheet to the benefit of customers and investors. 
Turning to page to 2021. As mentioned, we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.83 to $2.87 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth off our 2020 actuals. Unsurprisingly, the majority of our growth will be driven by the utility, and I'll also note a modest level of anticipated upside at the parent and other segment in 2021, largely due to the absence of select nonoperating flex items executed in 2020. All in, we'll continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range of 7% at year-end. which is in excess of the sector average. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2021 EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 15, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.06 per share of positive year-over-year variance, given the mild winter weather experienced in 2020. Additionally, we anticipate $0.41 of EPS pickup in 2021, attributable to rate relief net of investment costs, largely driven by the orders received in the second half of 2020. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of EPS impact here is in part due to the absence of an electric rate increase in 2020, which was a condition of our 2019 settlement agreement.
While we do plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, as Garrick mentioned, the test year and economic impact for that case will commence in 2022. As we look at our cost structure in 2021, you'll note approximately $0.27 per share of negative variance attributable to incremental O&M approved in our recent rate cases to support key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. Needless to say, we have underlying assumptions around productivity and waste elimination driven by the CE Way and will always endeavor to overachieve on those targets while delivering substantial value for our customers. 
Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other items. And I'll note that while the pandemic remains relatively uncontained, we are assuming a gradual return of weather-normalized load to pre-pandemic levels around midyear. In the event, the MAT teleworking trend persists and/or we see an accelerated reopening of the Michigan economy, we could potentially see some upside from incremental residential and commercial margin. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. 
We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term, given widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal, energy and/or environmental policy, and our answer remains the same. Irrespective of the circumstances, we view it as our job to do the worrying for you. Our familiar EPS chart on Slide 16 illustrates one of our key strengths, which is to identify and eliminate financial risk and capitalize on opportunities as they emerge to deliver additional benefits to customers while sustaining our financial success over the long term for investors. Each year provides a different fact pattern, and we've always risen to the occasion. 2020 offered some unique challenges resulting from the pandemic and more familiar sources of risk in the form of mild winter weather. And as usual, we didn't make excuses. Instead, weed offer transparency, devised our course of action and counted on the perennial will of our 8,500 coworkers to deliver for our customers, the communities we serve, and for you, our investors. 
To summarize our financial objectives in the near and long term, we expect 6% to 8% adjusted EPS and dividend growth and strong operating cash flow generation. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings and will manage the key credit metrics accordingly. One item I'll note in this regard is that we have slightly modified our FFO to debt targets to align better with the various rating agency methodologies. Given the increase in our 5-year capital plan, we anticipate annual equity needs of up to $250 million in 2021 and beyond, which we are confident that we can comfortably raise through our equity dribble program to minimize pricing risk. And 2 additional items I'll mention with respect to our financial strength as we kick off 2021 that are not on the page, but no less important or that we concluded 2020 with $1.6 billion of net liquidity, which positions our balance sheet well as we execute our updated capital plan going forward. And we have fully funded benefit plans for the second year in a row due to proactive funding, the latter of which benefits roughly 3,000 of our active coworkers and 8,000 of our retirees. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and cared for in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. 
To conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 18, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions, rate orders already in place and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for some final comments before Q&A."

So first of all, we have industry-leading commitments, and I want to be clear about that. Net 0 by 2040 is one of the best in the industry out there, and so it's an aggressive plan from a build-out perspective. In our current integrated resource plan, we have 1.1 gigawatts of solar that is part of the build-out with a broader plan of 6 gigawatts of solar. And in the course of this integrated resource plan is REV 2, which we'll file in June. We'll continue to advance our aggressive plans and our leadership in the clean energy transition. And so what you're picking up in our capital plan is an additional $1 billion. You're right on right on the mark, Jeremy. There's more renewables to the tune of about $200 million of additional solar and renewables in that plan. There's $200 million of hydro, and that might be surprising for some, but that's the original renewable-renewable that's carbon-free. And if you think about our Ludington pump storage facility, which is the largest -- fourth largest in the world, it provides an important role in intermittency. There's $300 million for electric reliability to improve service out there but also prepare the grid for the future. And then the balance is made up of investments in our gas system to further decarbonize. And so those are the important pieces. When we think about our -- on Slide 22, specifically and the investments there, right now, our integrated resource plan is a 50-50 split between purchase power agreement and build own transfer. Now it's a little better than 50-50 split because there are our renewable energy plan commitments, and we're building that win to support that, so it's greater than 50-50. But let's talk about the 50-50 for a minute. Of those PPAs, we are one of the few in the industry and certainly a leader in the industry to get a financial compensation mechanism associated with that and the rest come through bill load transfer. Now as we think about our second IRP, we're going to take a strong look at what that mix looks like, what that will be for the future. And so that will be something we explore and grow and certainly will be part of our integrated resource plan for the future. Now I'm going to pass it over to Rejji too because I know he has some additional thoughts to offer on this as well."

It's -- I'd say starting with the second part of your question first. It really is a ratable increase with the capital investment plan, which obviously has increased by $1 billion vintage over vintage. And so because the capital plan at the utility increased by $1 billion, we've had the equity needs increase, roughly commensurate with that. And so the prior plan, as you know, is about $150 million per year run rate, and now we're at $250 million. 
Now when you think about that distribution over the next 5 years, well, yes, we maybe opportunistic in some years, it may be around $250 million, some years a little less. We'll look at where the market is and how receptive it is to our currency, and we'll look at the price of stock, obviously. And I will just add for the first $250 million that we're planning to do in 2021, we've already taken about 20% of that pricing risk off the table with forwards we executed in the back half of 2020. And so we'll be opportunistic. 
So I wouldn't say it was always going to be a clean $250 million each year, but that's the target and then some years a little more, some years a little less. And so when I say a little more, up to $250 million is the ceiling and it may and some years be less than that, just to be very clear."

That's the broad message. But I mean, specifically from a sales perspective. Residential sales, as we talked in Q3 and still here in Q4 are a bit sticky, as people are working from home and many schools are still virtual. But as we see this pandemic playing out, we anticipate that those would decline, as you might expect, as people go back to the traditional workplace and as kids return to school. 
Also, we expect the commercial sales to grow a little bit. Restaurants have been opened up here recently, some limited capacity, but those will continue to grow, particularly as the vaccine is more readily available and distributed across Michigan. And so again, there's not aggressive assumptions in there. It's very conservative assumptions, as you might expect from us and really returning to some pre-pandemic levels, just as we shared. From an O&M Flex perspective, as I shared earlier, we feel like we're well positioned for 2021. 
We've done a lot of reinvestment for our customers at the end of the year toward -- to the tune of $0.18. That only helps our customers and provides benefit but a derisk 2021.

When you say that next year we could get an update on the 5-year plan, obviously, there's one larger plant that's out there, it's got a pretty long-dated retirement. I mean, is there a chance that we could see that in the 5-year window? And could that impact the 5-year Capex? I just want to clarify.

I'm -- I think it's going to feel like a little bit of reiteration for me on this answer, but we've got an aggressive plan. It's net 0 by 2040. And obviously, we're looking at the potential to accelerate part of that plan with Campbell 1 and 2 as part of this plan. But we're also in the broader context of the Biden administration in the 2035. And even our governor's goals within the state of Michigan were also considering what does that mean? And what does that look like? 
And so right now, Campbell 3 is at 2039. And so we will continue to take a look at what it means for Campbell 3. But again, there's a lot that goes into this modeling. There's a ton of analysis that needs to go into this. I mean in addition to what I shared earlier, we're looking at what is the cost of renewables out in the future. We want to feather in those renewables over time to take advantage of the cost as those cost come down. We want to take a look at storage. Right now, storage is not at the right price. And so how does that storage come in? And how do we feather that in over time. 
Because if we go too fast in this, you -- there's going to be risk from a reliability perspective. And frankly, when you get out to the end part of that plan, it counts on that last 8%, it counts on technology in terms of carbon capture and carbon sequestration to make up the balance. And so important part of this is making sure that we also, not only be carbonized but we ensure affordability, and we ensure reliability, affordability. And I think we can answer all 3. It's just that we have to pace it and allow technology. And so when it comes to the Biden administration, not only will CMS but our industry will push in for more R&D and more technology advancements to be able to have the aspirations and meet the aspirations that the new administration is putting out, which, frankly, we support from a planet perspective. And so I'll offer that in terms of the plan. And then I know Rejji has some thoughts on this, too. 
So Rejji?"

One, we plan conservative and no big bets. And so in this plan we've rolled out, we have not made any major presumptions around what will be an IRP 2.0 and so that's not flowing through this '21 through '25 plan. And in fact, the components, as Garrick highlighted earlier, you've got a little bit, call it, just out of $400 million of RPS related spend that's just still taking through for some of the wind investments that we're making, about $1.5 billion related to the IRP. And again, it's just execution on the solar, just out another year. And then Ludington on the hydro side, which Garrick, again, mentioned earlier. So this is all just incremental blocking and tackling. And again, we do not swing to the fences when it comes to financial planning. And when it comes to regulatory approaches, we just do not make big bets. So it's a very conservative plan, and we think it's highly executable."

And we're assuming fairly conservatively, as Garrick mentioned, that we'll get pretty close to pre-pandemic residential around midyear. And so we're showing just year-over-year, a little bit of a decline in residential, again, ticking back to pre-pandemic level. So if we're 1% -- if there's a surprise to the upside to the tune of 1%, that's worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis.

And so what we're trying to highlight in our current guidance is that we're trying to show those tailored computation so that we can maintain the solid investment grade credit rating. That's what we've historically targeted. And so that kind of takes you to a mid-teens level.

Thanks for your question, Durgesh. So I've had the opportunity to listen to 2 industry events, separate industry events, John Carey, who is part of the Biden administration and for the climate envoy as well as the Gina McCarthy, who's also part of the Biden administration here and engaged in the planet ambitions. Furthermore, our relationship with former Governor Grant Home and now likely lead at the Department of Energy here shortly. And so it gives us a good context around some of these emissions. And what we've heard clearly is from a net 0 perspective for all sectors by '25 -- I mean, 2050 and for the electric sector by 2035 from a net 0 perspective. And John Kerry was specific to say that it was an all-in approach and that also he's ambitious -- these were ambitious goals. But again, it was going to be about R&D type development and technology development to move it forward.
And then he also offered the thought this was not a regulatory approach because that takes too long, and it would be incentives based on the market to spur and increase the market. And so I believe we're well positioned for that. Again, where we sit at 2040 to 2035, we can do that. But again, the important piece, really from an industry perspective is that we maintain the affordability, reliability and decarbonization, all 3 of those can be addressed. And it's going to require more R&D from a federal policy perspective. And so that one, we develop the technology but also moves at scale, so we can get the economics of it for all our customers. And so that's an important piece, and we'll be leaning in from an industry perspective to shape that. Thanks for your question."

So from the $100 million challenge in our work there, very successful really over $100 million is a very successful year. About 50% of that I put in the category of sustainable. So let me talk about kind of the both buckets. And so obviously, there has been some just change in the way we do business this year. We're not flying places. We're not having hotel room days, those aren't sustainable. At some point, we'll go back and we'll do those things, right, as part of the business. But through the CE Way, we -- 50% of it is clearly sustainable. And there are a number of actions that we've taken, which will continue to provide savings for our customers and create headroom as we go forward. 
So I want to give you an example. And this is a longer term one, but there was also a value that was seen here in 2020. So if I go back to 2015, we see about 6 million calls in our call center or contact center. In 2017, here -- I mean, 2020 here, we did 2.7 million calls, a drop of 3 million calls over that time period. It's roughly $3 a call. And so -- and I'll just give you one real example of the work, and it speaks to the empowerment, what is unique is that we empower our coworkers to do this. And so some people still pay by calling in and dialing and putting the credit card information. That's a subset of our customers. That team took that process, took 24 steps out of the process, moved it from 405 seconds to 305 seconds. And so as you imagine, a customer who wants to pay that way, the more steps they have, the longer it takes, the more they get frustrated, it turns into a defect and goes over to our call center. So that's just one example of how we've improved the process, made it better for our customers, made it better for our quarters and then the cost falls out of that, and that's small. And imagine multiplying that by 8,500 people that are doing that type because they're empowered. That's the unique piece. And so that's to say, right? We're not going to go back and make that experience worse for our customers. That's the type of cost savings opportunities. I can go through hundreds of them. And in fact, we have delivered hundreds of them, and we'll continue to deliver on hundreds of them. And so that's how I think about it. And there's more opportunity across our company to deliver on excellence from the COA. 
Now to your question. We're very successful in the midst of a pandemic, and I think it speaks to our regulatory construct and getting gas settlement in 2020 and an electric rate case. And so as we look at forward test years and we look at the work we're underway, we've got recovery in place. And so when you see that uptick in O&M, much of that's for improved customer service. We increased, and it was awarded through the electric rate case outcome in December, our forestry work, our tree trimming work with the N1 cause of outages, we increased it by $30 million. And so that's already recovered, and we're going forward with that work to improve customer service for all our customers. That's just one example of the increase that you note there. But again, big picture perspective, there's more opportunity. We continue to improve the way we do business excellence through the CE Way."

This has been one of our biggest years in support for our customers. So let me talk about the numbers. So when I look at current to 30 days, right now, our customer -- 87% of our customers are in that bucket being current in 30 days. So that compares with 2019, which was 88% in 2017 -- I'm sorry, 2018, which was 89%. And so there is an impact there. But as you see, it's pretty light in terms of what is kind of our historical receivables to 30 days. And so -- and really, we believe that's by design. One, we work closely with the commissioners and made sure that, one, we didn't have mandatory moratorium shutoff. It's been a voluntary. We worked closely with the commissioner to do that. We've put invested a number of dollars in both payment forgiveness as well as Foundation Help, specifically $15 million in 2020. We put another $24 million into our foundation, which has also started to provide some of that benefit in 2021. And so we continue to increase that work. In fact, I was on the phone with the Attorney General's office this week, and we're looking at how we work together on this issue to do even more in 2021. And so there are a variety of ways. We've helped out those particularly in need during this time, and we will continue through the course of the pandemic. I'm going to offer one more thing, particularly around Michigan because we are in the midst of this pandemic, but I think there is a lot of bright things that are occurring, both from a COVID perspective but also Michigan's economy perspective. One, we've got great distribution of the vaccine, and if you look at our numbers, the state of Michigan has improved in that performance. And so we've seen restaurants open. We've seen this movement of kids going back to school. That's already underway. But if I even take a bigger picture perspective and look at some of the economic things that I've seen here in Michigan, I sit on 2 economic development boards: one, 126 megawatts of new low; $2.5 billion of investment; 4,000 new jobs. That's not just a highlight from this year. If I look back to the last 3 to 4 years, it's been very similar to that. And if you go to a place like Kalamazoo, Michigan. Kalamazoo, Michigan, this is where they manufacture the vaccine for Pfizer. That place is going gangbusters. And all the industries that support that are going gangbusters. Many people paying us to the automotive state. We truly have an automotive background, which is rich. But we are one of the leading states in the growth of life sciences, like we see at Pfizer and other places. 
And so although we're in the midst of a pandemic, and there's certainly we need to be sensitive about those that are low income and are working through that, and we're doing our efforts there. I'm also optimistic about what Michigan offers in the growth that I've seen here over the last 4 or 5 years."

And that's an area where we can build out better business cases and get better outcomes. I also think there's a better opportunity to have our commission not go look at historical 5-year IT because when -- the IT and what we invest in network with -- how fast that is changing, when you do a historical look, it doesn't provide the right amount of O&M you need. And so there is more work we need to do with our staff -- with the staff at the MPSC and with the commission to make a better case for O&M related to IT investments. And so those are a couple of examples of things that we need to strengthen. And I'll pass it over to Rejji and Rejji has some thoughts as well."

And so when you take into account the deferred tax flowback, it's only about 40 basis points of rate making equity thickness reduction. So again, modest level of degradation. But at the end of the day, we're still -- we're now 2, 3 years beyond tax reform and the balance sheet and cash flow generative effects of tax reform are very real. And so we would like to see that equity thickness accrete some to offset the effects of that. And so, again to Garrick's point, the onus is on us to continue to make the compelling case that equity thickness at worse should stay where it is today but ideally accrete some, and we've seen other jurisdictions do that. So we'll try to make that case better in subsequent cases."

We have nice scalable programs on the fleet side and the residential side that continue to grow as electric vehicle grows. And I'd put a level out there about [ 150] , just as an early marker. And I think what is the important key about this is fleets. And I'm really excited about what came out of the electric rate case because we're going to offer a concierge service to help businesses make the choice. That will be a big difference and how this moves because some of these fleets when you have to expand by 2 to 3 to 4 megawatts, you're talking about transformers and substations and other upgrades associated with that. 
And so depending on the fleet mix is really -- it's an important variable in figuring out what that capital build out looks like. As GM announced here, I think it was about 1.5 week ago, there's an inflection point between when it makes sense to be an electric vehicle fleet for something your trucking versus going to hydrogen. And I think that point right there is an important point that we need to understand a bit more, and we're working to do that. And that's the importance of this fleet program we got in the last electric rate case, and we'll see more of that grow and be able to better pinpoint our capital investment opportunities. 
And Rejji, go ahead on that one, I know you got more to add."

The only thing I would add is just -- it also just depends on customer or end user behavior at the end of the day as well. And so part of the power Michigan drive program that we put in place, an element of that is really to educate customers on when to charge and ideally charging off-peak to get better utilization out of existing assets. And then there are economic incentives that we're trying to provide as part of that. But if EV owners feel compelled, and this is more on the residential side to charge during peak periods, well, that could have implications on the electric infrastructure as well as supply needs that we may have, which would have a direct impact on capital. And so again, we've talked a lot about shaving the peak and so -- even though that may lead to additional capital investment opportunities, we think that's suboptimal in terms of where to put the best dollar longer term. And so I think a lot of this will also be dictated on EV owner behavior."

And I'll tell you what, it does not keep up. And so I've got to supplement with gas to be able to keep my house warm. And in fact, 75% of Michigan's resident count on natural gas. And so I'm so glad you asked that question because I think it's really important when think about decarbonization, that we're thinking not only about the electric but the gas business, and that's exactly what we're doing. 
And so, we do have a 10-year plan, as you pointed out, to get to net 0 by 2030. These investments, which are represented in our 5-year plan and those in our 10-year which will have the opportunity to grow as we move forward are exactly what delivers that net 0. We invest in taking out old metal and raw materials out there, we replace it with plastic across our distribution system, which provides for safety that is so critical in our gas business. And we continue to maintain reliability, affordability and decarbonization because you can do all across that. Also within that plan, you had a little bit of renewable natural gas. We have some on our system, we're going to add little bit more renewable to get natural gas that will help to decarbonize that stream. That will get us to net 0 methane by 2030. Now I'll tell you what, there's more opportunity to decarbonize natural gas. We've got energy efficiency programs that we have ran for 10-plus years, which are great. It's a win for our customers, it saves them money. We get an incentive on it, and it helps the plan, all of the above, win-win-win. We have the ability to expand those programs on our gas business. And you can think about the technology in the home, in home envelope and the equipment in the home to further decarbonize. And then if you want belt and suspenders, we can also talk about hydrogen. And we spent a lot of time in the use cases around hydrogen. I won't go through them all now because I'm getting away from your questions. But yes, that investment spend rate there, and we have a little bit more opportunity in future cases where we even there will deliver a net methane 2030 target."

Sophie, I appreciate the question, and I thank you for the opportunity for us to really promote our activities over the last -- not just last year, but a couple of years where similar to our mindset around flexing up on the income statement side. We also choose to flex up on the operating cash flow side. And last year, we saw pretty good upside, largely driven by cost performance, a little bit from the Cares Act that allowed us to have some upside on OCF. And so we took the liberty to put about $700 million to work in discretionary pension contributions, most of which were in the January of last year, but we did a good portion in late in Q4, and that's allowed us to fully fund the pension. And so where we sit today, we don't anticipate certainly not any -- we certainly don't anticipate any involuntary contributions. 
And I think if there are any embedded in the 5-year plan, I would say they're relatively deminimis. And so where we sit today, we think there should be really light contribution requirements over the next 5 years. Now clearly, there are variables. So if you see discount rates come down, if you see asset performance underwhelmed or underperformed, that could require additional contributions. So where we sit today, we feel quite good about the lack or limited amount of contributions over the course of 5-year plan. So there's no real material impact embedded in our equity issuance assumptions. But again, these variables toggle and you have to recalibrate every year.

So let me offer this, just to be very clear, Sophie. And so what we have done, and this precedes me and Garrick. It's just been -- just a long standard -- long-standing standard we've had from a financial planning perspective for OCF is we have not -- unlike the income statement and EPS, we have not guided OCF off of the prior year actuals. We have just looked at the budget or the guidance we provided from the prior year. And we said directionally, it will increase by $100 million each year off the prior year's guidance. And so for example, last year, we guided to $1.75 billion. Obviously, we delivered well in excess of that. And then this year, again, $100 million above and beyond that $1.25 billion. So yes, that is down from where actuals were, which was just under $2 billion. 
And again, a lot of that tends to do with the cost performance as well as again some CARES Act-related benefits. And so I wouldn't view that as conservatism or just any type of rate or regulatory-related actions. It's just us, again, just thinking about the annual growth that we can deliver from an OCF perspective. But we're saying all in, over the next 5 years, we're going to do over $10 billion of operating cash flow generation, and that is in excess of what we were anticipating over 5 years from the prior vintage, which I think was south of $10 billion or around $10 billion. So we feel good about our ability to deliver on operating cash flow, and it's not a result of any of the regulatory outcomes. I think the only thing you'll see in the gas settlement is about $30 million or $35 million of operating cash flow challenge because we're staying out. But again, it's relatively deminimis in the grand scheme of things."
