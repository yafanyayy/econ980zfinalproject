I'm pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter, contributing to another strong year for the McDonald's brand.

I'm pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter, contributing to another strong year for the McDonald's brand. Global comparable sales were up 2.3% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Constant currencies operating income grew 14% for the quarter and 10% for the year. 2009 marked our sixth consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our plan to win business strategy.In January, we expect to post another month of positive global comparable sales, with both Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa positive and the U.S. relatively flat. In this challenging economic environment, we feel very good about our trends. And we continue to grow by adapting to our customers' needs and elevating the key drivers for our Plan to Win. Those being: More menu variety and choice, better restaurant operations, greater convenience in daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant investment. In all of these areas, we're innovating and improving and pushing ourselves to stay and step with the consumers in order to get them the most outstanding dining experience in every way. This strategy and alignment helped us achieve strong results across the system in 2009.In the U.S., comp sales increased slightly for the quarter and up 2.6% for the year, contributing to an operating income growth of 5% to 6%, respectively.  We're proud of these results especially given the high unemployment and its impact on consumer spending. In the U.S. last year, our comp sales gap against the industry was positive every week of the year. And despite an overall decline in the informal eating-out category, we increased our market share and strengthened our leadership position. We drove results by delivering exceptional value, menu choice and convenience. U.S. maintained a strong focus on value at every level from the Dollar Menu to mid-tier and premium offerings. This continues to make us a compelling choice for customers in this uncertain time. And we continue to win through menu choice with a balance in familiar and popular core products as well as new items to keep us relevant. Our McCafé specialty coffees and our line of premium Angus burgers were new offerings in 2009 and they helped us make McDonald's a more clear destination for outstanding quality at the best value. We're pushing ahead with more choices including the national launch this month of our Mac Snack Wrap and breakfast Dollar Menu. The Mac Snack Wrap is a snack version of our Big Mac. It's a four-tier product with a good margin and it fits well into our growing snack daypart or as add-on to a meal and certainly can be eaten on the go.The breakfast Dollar Menu introduced in collaboration with our franchisees, gives us a national voice on value at breakfast. Both of these highlight our commitment to keep modernizing our menu and provide the products that our customers are looking for. In this front, we're also launching free wireless Internet access at nearly all of our U.S. restaurants. This will make us the largest provider of free Internet in the country and make our restaurant experience even more valuable.Now turning to Europe, comparable sales were up 4.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Europe's guiding strategies of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance continues to drive results. In the fourth quarter, we grew our market share in the informal eating-out category across Europe, including the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The key to this growth was the continued focus on our three-tier menu platform, everyday low price, core and premium, delivering choice and value across the menu. In addition, we continue to enhance our fourth-tier menu platform by delivering a category of smaller premium affordable products. We expanded our line of popular Petit Plaisirs in France and our Little Taster offerings in the U.K. and we've introduced four-tier products to other markets such as Germany with the Snack Deluxe. All of this is building greater relevancy for our brand and stronger results for our bottom line. Europe also saw success from an increased emphasis on daypart expansion, particularly breakfast. In Germany, we expanded our breakfast lineup with classic and new offerings as part of our Easy Morning breakfast launch and is yielding solid results. And then the U.K., our number one breakfast market in Europe, strong media support helped generate some of our highest breakfast sales to date. In addition, Europe's ongoing coffee strategy, including the standalone McCafé concept is resonating with European consumers, with McDonald's now being the number one seller of coffee in Germany. Many of these opportunities are enhanced by Europe's leading role in the reimaging, where by the end of 2011, 85% of Europe's 6,800 restaurants will be reimaged.Let's shift to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or APMEA, which delivered $1 billion in operating income in 2009. This is a long way from the $345 million they delivered in 2005. For the quarter and year, comp sales were up 1.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Operating income also continue to grow, up 28% for the quarter and 23% for the year in constant currencies. Our growth across the region continues to come from strong execution in convenience, value, core menu and breakfast. Australia remains one of the top performing markets in our system. They've reimaged their entire asset base, setting the stage to drive strong results with premium offerings like the popular Angus line and the M burger selections. They also launched the next version of their Value Picks menu, as well as enhance the drive-through experience, leading to better operations and service trends. Now China, although their economy is improving and we delivered an increase in comp sales and guest counts in December, we expect it will still be some time before consumers regain confidence and are willing to spend more. In the meantime, we're making the right moves to grow our business and strengthen our connection with our Chinese consumers. We're improving our operations, which is differentiating our brand on service and helping build capacity during peak hours. We also launched the highly popular Value Lunch initiative that has helped drive guest counts and incremental sales. And as we announced recently, we're adding to our footprint by planning to open up 150 to 175 restaurants in China in 2010. So we remain excited about our potential growth and expansion in this region. McDonald's Japan made solid progress last year in the face of significant economic headwinds delivering positive comp sales across the majority of months. Our results were driven largely by the introduction of the Quarter Pounder, the launch of Premium Roast coffee and a strong focus on affordability, highlighted by our popular Value Lunch. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we made gains through our focus on drive-through, the relaunch of McChicken and the continued success of our Premium Coffee products. So those are some of the recent highlights from around the world. As we turn to the year ahead, I want to say to say a few words on our continued commitment to financial discipline and enhancing shareholder value. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends. With a three-year total of $16.6 billion in our $15 billion to $17 billion three-year target. Going forward, our philosophy regarding the use of our cash flow remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Our reinvestment strategies, our financial discipline and especially our Plan to Win are the mainstays of our success. And the blueprint we will continue to follow to drive future growth. We're pleased with 2009's results. We remain confident in and committed to our Plan to Win and our customer-focused strategies. And as always, we feel we have the very best leadership team in place to help us achieve our goals. As you all know, Don Thomson recently became our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Don has a deep knowledge of the business and has done an outstanding job leading our U.S. business and Don will continue to drive value for the brand in his new role.At McDonald's, we pride ourselves in our commitment to talent management leadership development and always having a deep bench of strong, capable leaders. We have a great management team in place that is highly talented, well aligned and ready to deliver results.Moving forward, we're all focused on the appropriate business drivers to be more relevant for our customers every day, from the best tasting food and beverage offerings to the greatest value and convenience, to an unparalleled restaurant experience. With our franchisees, suppliers and employees all working together, I'm certain we will continue to succeed on all these fronts. And I'm confident we will keep delivering positive results for our system and our shareholders. And now, I'll turn things over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."

Everyday, more than 60 million customers around the world come at McDonald's for convenience, variety and value. All our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow and returns. I'm proud to say that we delivered",1277,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Everyday, more than 60 million customers around the world come at McDonald's for convenience, variety and value. All our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow and returns. I'm proud to say that we delivered for customers and investors alike in 2009, with sales, operations, profitability and returns all improving amid a historic economic downturn.For the fourth quarter and the year, we delivered double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. Even after adjusting 2008 results for the gain on sale of Pret A Manger and 2009 results for the income related to the Redbox transactions and the resolution of certain Latin America liabilities, earnings per share rose 10% in the quarter and 13% for the year in constant currencies. During the fourth quarter, primarily due to the resolution of certain Latin America retained liabilities, we recorded $65 million of pretax income as well as a $22 million benefit in tax expense, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In total, this resulted in an $0.08 benefit to earnings per share and a 240 basis point benefit for the effective tax rate for the quarter.Combined operating margin improved significantly in 2009. At about 30%, our combined operating margin is significantly higher than that of many global consumer companies. This combined operating margin performance reflects our ability to drive strong franchise in company-operated margins, while controlling G&A spending. Total margin dollars for McDonald's restaurants reached a record $8.8 billion in 2009, up about 6% in constant currencies. Franchise margin dollars, which represents nearly $6 billion of the total, grew at a faster pace as we continue to execute our re-franchising strategy. As a percent of revenues, franchise margins were strong at 82.1% for both the quarter and the year. Over the last two years, we've re-franchised more than 1100 restaurants in connection with our re-franchising strategy. And today, more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are franchised. We expect to re-franchise a couple of hundred more restaurants in 2010.Company operating margins were up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.8%, driven by positive comparable sales, lower commodity costs and re-franchising. For the year, company operated margins increased 60 basis points to 18.2%, the highest level in a decade. Throughout 2009, our U.S. business outperformed the overall informal eating-out industry and the fourth quarter was no exception. Easing commodity costs benefited margins in the fourth quarter, as our grocery bill declined about 4%. re-franchising also enhanced the margin increase. As a result, our U.S. business delivered outstanding company operating margins of 20.3% for the quarter and 19.4% for the year. Strong company operating margins are a key indicator of our business health and restaurant level cash flow. In 2009, average restaurant cash flow growth for our owner operators was the strongest in 15 years. We closed the year with average annual pre-debt cash flow approaching $320,000 per restaurant. This strong owner operator cash flow helps enable future reinvestments in the business, like support for breakfast Dollar Menu or reimaging. In Europe, company operating margins increased 130 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and utility costs. The U.K., France and many other countries drove this improvement as our menu, variety and value continue to appeal to customers.While Europe's local currency grocery bill declined 3% in the quarter, currency rates continue to pressure commodity costs in Russia and other Eastern European countries, making the net impact of food and paper costs slightly negative. For the year, company operating margins rose 40 basis points in Europe, reaching a 10-year high of 18.4%.In Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, company operating margins increased 260 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year, company operating margins rose 90 basis points to a very healthy 16.8%. Our sustained strong performance in Australia and operating efficiencies and lower commodity cost throughout the segment drove the improvement for both periods. We are confident we can deliver strong company operating margins going forward, as we continue to execute our strategies related to price, product mix and promotion, while driving efficiencies and managing costs. As it relates to food and paper costs, our initial outlook for 2010 is for our basket of goods to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe, with easier comparisons in the first half of the year.Turning to G&A, in constant currencies, G&A was up slightly for the quarter and down for the year. 2009 marks the fifth consecutive year that G&A declined as a percent of both sales and revenues. And we expect G&A as a percent of sales and revenues will continue to decline in 2010. While total G&A dollars will be up slightly on a reported basis at today's exchange rates, G&A should be relatively flat in constant currency. The timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biannual Worldwide Owner Operator Convention will impact the quarterly comparisons. Our proven ability to drive sales, deliver strong margins and control spending, along with our franchise business model, all have positive implications for our cash flow. As we continue to be disciplined in how we use this cash, our philosophy has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business, as Jim said. We have the financial capacity and the local talent to invest capital back into our business when many others cannot. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to leverage to further differentiate the McDonald's experience.In 2010, we will invest about $2.4 billion in capital expenditures. Our goal is to elevate our brand to drive sustainable growth while continuing to earn strong returns. Approximately half of our capital expenditures will be used to open about 1,000 new restaurants around the world, including roughly 500 in Asia/Pacific, 250 in Europe and 150 in the U.S. The other half of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward reimaging over 2,000 existing locations. Nearly half of these remodels will be in Europe, 600 in Asia/Pacific and 500 in the U.S. Reimaging has a direct positive impact on sales and market share as our experience in the U.S., France and Australia demonstrates. In 2010, our reimaging efforts will be focused on both the interior and exterior of our restaurants. As we've done in the past, we will co-invest with our owner operators in this high-impact reimaging efforts. It's important to remember that as we make these investments, we are also upgrading our asset base. This is because we own the land and buildings or hold long-term leases on the property underlying our restaurants. In addition, by sharing in the investment, we can accelerate initiatives, reach scale faster and positively impact our business sooner.On a final note, as you know for most of 2009, currency translation was a significant headwind, negatively impacting full year earnings per share by $0.15. However, this headwind became a tailwind in the fourth quarter, a benefit we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters. Based on current rates, we estimate that currency translation will positively impact first quarter earnings by about five or $0.06 per share and the full year benefit is estimated to be approximately $0.06 to $0.08 per share. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a strong balance sheet and cash flow and owner operators and suppliers who are aligned and focused. As we move forward in 2010, we will continue to leverage our competitive strengths to extend our lead in the marketplace and drive value for our shareholders and global system. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

So when we talk about not having as much pricing elasticity that Pete had talked about earlier because our commodities and other kinds of things in the past are certainly in the inflationary environment, and more importantly, the consumer confidence and the unemployment, we don't have as much pricing power as we might have had. So we really don't even talk about how we're able to pass on any cost that we might have to absorb when we do our pricing models and how we communicate with our consumers around value. We decide that it's important for us to continue to have everyday affordability, present to our consumers a value proposition that makes us a compelling choice relative to eating-out when they choose to eat out. And all those factors are considered. But we do that on a regular basis, not just during recessionary times. And of course, since we've been in this situation now, some would argue for more than two years, it continues to be the consumer insight that we use and make our decisions around. And it doesn't necessarily leverage any movement back and forth, determining the strength around our messaging, except to say it's been fairly consistent."

We were a little bit surprised to see the ruble still down against the dollar in the fourth quarter. We thought it might snap back a little bit by that, but Russia in December was strong. We saw good sales for the year in Russia, and it continues to be a highly-profitable and great long-term market for us.

I'm pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter, contributing to another strong year for the McDonald's brand. Global comparable sales were up 2.3% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Constant currencies operating income grew 14% for the quarter and 10% for the year. 2009 marked our sixth consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our plan to win business strategy.In January, we expect to post another month of positive global comparable sales, with both Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa positive and the U.S. relatively flat. In this challenging economic environment, we feel very good about our trends. And we continue to grow by adapting to our customers' needs and elevating the key drivers for our Plan to Win. Those being: More menu variety and choice, better restaurant operations, greater convenience in daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant investment. In all of these areas, we're innovating and improving and pushing ourselves to stay and step with the consumers in order to get them the most outstanding dining experience in every way. This strategy and alignment helped us achieve strong results across the system in 2009.In the U.S., comp sales increased slightly for the quarter and up 2.6% for the year, contributing to an operating income growth of 5% to 6%, respectively.  We're proud of these results especially given the high unemployment and its impact on consumer spending. In the U.S. last year, our comp sales gap against the industry was positive every week of the year. And despite an overall decline in the informal eating-out category, we increased our market share and strengthened our leadership position. We drove results by delivering exceptional value, menu choice and convenience. U.S. maintained a strong focus on value at every level from the Dollar Menu to mid-tier and premium offerings. This continues to make us a compelling choice for customers in this uncertain time. And we continue to win through menu choice with a balance in familiar and popular core products as well as new items to keep us relevant. Our McCafé specialty coffees and our line of premium Angus burgers were new offerings in 2009 and they helped us make McDonald's a more clear destination for outstanding quality at the best value. We're pushing ahead with more choices including the national launch this month of our Mac Snack Wrap and breakfast Dollar Menu. The Mac Snack Wrap is a snack version of our Big Mac. It's a four-tier product with a good margin and it fits well into our growing snack daypart or as add-on to a meal and certainly can be eaten on the go.The breakfast Dollar Menu introduced in collaboration with our franchisees, gives us a national voice on value at breakfast. Both of these highlight our commitment to keep modernizing our menu and provide the products that our customers are looking for. In this front, we're also launching free wireless Internet access at nearly all of our U.S. restaurants. This will make us the largest provider of free Internet in the country and make our restaurant experience even more valuable.Now turning to Europe, comparable sales were up 4.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Europe's guiding strategies of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance continues to drive results. In the fourth quarter, we grew our market share in the informal eating-out category across Europe, including the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The key to this growth was the continued focus on our three-tier menu platform, everyday low price, core and premium, delivering choice and value across the menu. In addition, we continue to enhance our fourth-tier menu platform by delivering a category of smaller premium affordable products. We expanded our line of popular Petit Plaisirs in France and our Little Taster offerings in the U.K. and we've introduced four-tier products to other markets such as Germany with the Snack Deluxe. All of this is building greater relevancy for our brand and stronger results for our bottom line. Europe also saw success from an increased emphasis on daypart expansion, particularly breakfast. In Germany, we expanded our breakfast lineup with classic and new offerings as part of our Easy Morning breakfast launch and is yielding solid results. And then the U.K., our number one breakfast market in Europe, strong media support helped generate some of our highest breakfast sales to date. In addition, Europe's ongoing coffee strategy, including the standalone McCafé concept is resonating with European consumers, with McDonald's now being the number one seller of coffee in Germany. Many of these opportunities are enhanced by Europe's leading role in the reimaging, where by the end of 2011, 85% of Europe's 6,800 restaurants will be reimaged.Let's shift to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or APMEA, which delivered $1 billion in operating income in 2009. This is a long way from the $345 million they delivered in 2005. For the quarter and year, comp sales were up 1.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Operating income also continue to grow, up 28% for the quarter and 23% for the year in constant currencies. Our growth across the region continues to come from strong execution in convenience, value, core menu and breakfast. Australia remains one of the top performing markets in our system. They've reimaged their entire asset base, setting the stage to drive strong results with premium offerings like the popular Angus line and the M burger selections. They also launched the next version of their Value Picks menu, as well as enhance the drive-through experience, leading to better operations and service trends. Now China, although their economy is improving and we delivered an increase in comp sales and guest counts in December, we expect it will still be some time before consumers regain confidence and are willing to spend more. In the meantime, we're making the right moves to grow our business and strengthen our connection with our Chinese consumers. We're improving our operations, which is differentiating our brand on service and helping build capacity during peak hours. We also launched the highly popular Value Lunch initiative that has helped drive guest counts and incremental sales. And as we announced recently, we're adding to our footprint by planning to open up 150 to 175 restaurants in China in 2010. So we remain excited about our potential growth and expansion in this region. McDonald's Japan made solid progress last year in the face of significant economic headwinds delivering positive comp sales across the majority of months. Our results were driven largely by the introduction of the Quarter Pounder, the launch of Premium Roast coffee and a strong focus on affordability, highlighted by our popular Value Lunch. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we made gains through our focus on drive-through, the relaunch of McChicken and the continued success of our Premium Coffee products. So those are some of the recent highlights from around the world. As we turn to the year ahead, I want to say to say a few words on our continued commitment to financial discipline and enhancing shareholder value. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends. With a three-year total of $16.6 billion in our $15 billion to $17 billion three-year target. Going forward, our philosophy regarding the use of our cash flow remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Our reinvestment strategies, our financial discipline and especially our Plan to Win are the mainstays of our success. And the blueprint we will continue to follow to drive future growth. We're pleased with 2009's results. We remain confident in and committed to our Plan to Win and our customer-focused strategies. And as always, we feel we have the very best leadership team in place to help us achieve our goals. As you all know, Don Thomson recently became our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Don has a deep knowledge of the business and has done an outstanding job leading our U.S. business and Don will continue to drive value for the brand in his new role.At McDonald's, we pride ourselves in our commitment to talent management leadership development and always having a deep bench of strong, capable leaders. We have a great management team in place that is highly talented, well aligned and ready to deliver results.Moving forward, we're all focused on the appropriate business drivers to be more relevant for our customers every day, from the best tasting food and beverage offerings to the greatest value and convenience, to an unparalleled restaurant experience. With our franchisees, suppliers and employees all working together, I'm certain we will continue to succeed on all these fronts. And I'm confident we will keep delivering positive results for our system and our shareholders. And now, I'll turn things over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."

All our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow and returns. I'm proud to say that we delivered for customers and investors alike in 2009, with sales, operations, profitability and returns all improving amid a historic economic downturn.For the fourth quarter and the year, we delivered double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. Even after adjusting 2008 results for the gain on sale of Pret A Manger and 2009 results for the income related to the Redbox transactions and the resolution of certain Latin America liabilities, earnings per share rose 10% in the quarter and 13% for the year in constant currencies. During the fourth quarter, primarily due to the resolution of certain Latin America retained liabilities, we recorded $65 million of pretax income as well as a $22 million benefit in tax expense, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In total, this resulted in an $0.08 benefit to earnings per share and a 240 basis point benefit for the effective tax rate for the quarter.Combined operating margin improved significantly in 2009. At about 30%, our combined operating margin is significantly higher than that of many global consumer companies. This combined operating margin performance reflects our ability to drive strong franchise in company-operated margins, while controlling G&A spending. Total margin dollars for McDonald's restaurants reached a record $8.8 billion in 2009, up about 6% in constant currencies. Franchise margin dollars, which represents nearly $6 billion of the total, grew at a faster pace as we continue to execute our re-franchising strategy. As a percent of revenues, franchise margins were strong at 82.1% for both the quarter and the year. Over the last two years, we've re-franchised more than 1100 restaurants in connection with our re-franchising strategy. And today, more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are franchised. We expect to re-franchise a couple of hundred more restaurants in 2010.Company operating margins were up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.8%, driven by positive comparable sales, lower commodity costs and re-franchising. For the year, company operated margins increased 60 basis points to 18.2%, the highest level in a decade. Throughout 2009, our U.S. business outperformed the overall informal eating-out industry and the fourth quarter was no exception. Easing commodity costs benefited margins in the fourth quarter, as our grocery bill declined about 4%. re-franchising also enhanced the margin increase. As a result, our U.S. business delivered outstanding company operating margins of 20.3% for the quarter and 19.4% for the year. Strong company operating margins are a key indicator of our business health and restaurant level cash flow. In 2009, average restaurant cash flow growth for our owner operators was the strongest in 15 years. We closed the year with average annual pre-debt cash flow approaching $320,000 per restaurant. This strong owner operator cash flow helps enable future reinvestments in the business, like support for breakfast Dollar Menu or reimaging. In Europe, company operating margins increased 130 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and utility costs. The U.K., France and many other countries drove this improvement as our menu, variety and value continue to appeal to customers.While Europe's local currency grocery bill declined 3% in the quarter, currency rates continue to pressure commodity costs in Russia and other Eastern European countries, making the net impact of food and paper costs slightly negative. For the year, company operating margins rose 40 basis points in Europe, reaching a 10-year high of 18.4%.In Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, company operating margins increased 260 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year, company operating margins rose 90 basis points to a very healthy 16.8%. Our sustained strong performance in Australia and operating efficiencies and lower commodity cost throughout the segment drove the improvement for both periods. We are confident we can deliver strong company operating margins going forward, as we continue to execute our strategies related to price, product mix and promotion, while driving efficiencies and managing costs. As it relates to food and paper costs, our initial outlook for 2010 is for our basket of goods to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe, with easier comparisons in the first half of the year.Turning to G&A, in constant currencies, G&A was up slightly for the quarter and down for the year. 2009 marks the fifth consecutive year that G&A declined as a percent of both sales and revenues. And we expect G&A as a percent of sales and revenues will continue to decline in 2010. While total G&A dollars will be up slightly on a reported basis at today's exchange rates, G&A should be relatively flat in constant currency. The timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biannual Worldwide Owner Operator Convention will impact the quarterly comparisons. Our proven ability to drive sales, deliver strong margins and control spending, along with our franchise business model, all have positive implications for our cash flow. As we continue to be disciplined in how we use this cash, our philosophy has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business, as Jim said. We have the financial capacity and the local talent to invest capital back into our business when many others cannot. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to leverage to further differentiate the McDonald's experience.In 2010, we will invest about $2.4 billion in capital expenditures. Our goal is to elevate our brand to drive sustainable growth while continuing to earn strong returns. Approximately half of our capital expenditures will be used to open about 1,000 new restaurants around the world, including roughly 500 in Asia/Pacific, 250 in Europe and 150 in the U.S. The other half of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward reimaging over 2,000 existing locations. Nearly half of these remodels will be in Europe, 600 in Asia/Pacific and 500 in the U.S. Reimaging has a direct positive impact on sales and market share as our experience in the U.S., France and Australia demonstrates. In 2010, our reimaging efforts will be focused on both the interior and exterior of our restaurants. As we've done in the past, we will co-invest with our owner operators in this high-impact reimaging efforts. It's important to remember that as we make these investments, we are also upgrading our asset base. This is because we own the land and buildings or hold long-term leases on the property underlying our restaurants. In addition, by sharing in the investment, we can accelerate initiatives, reach scale faster and positively impact our business sooner.On a final note, as you know for most of 2009, currency translation was a significant headwind, negatively impacting full year earnings per share by $0.15. However, this headwind became a tailwind in the fourth quarter, a benefit we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters. Based on current rates, we estimate that currency translation will positively impact first quarter earnings by about five or $0.06 per share and the full year benefit is estimated to be approximately $0.06 to $0.08 per share. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a strong balance sheet and cash flow and owner operators and suppliers who are aligned and focused. As we move forward in 2010, we will continue to leverage our competitive strengths to extend our lead in the marketplace and drive value for our shareholders and global system. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

We're seeing, and it's early in this test, but we're seeing a nice trade between the espresso-based coffees, which are over 50% in the morning, and these smoothies and frappes, they're a much smaller percent in the morning and a much greater percent in that kind of snack daypart, which had helped fill in there.

I'm pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter, contributing to another strong year for the McDonald's brand.

I'm pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter, contributing to another strong year for the McDonald's brand. Global comparable sales were up 2.3% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Constant currencies operating income grew 14% for the quarter and 10% for the year. 2009 marked our sixth consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our plan to win business strategy.In January, we expect to post another month of positive global comparable sales, with both Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa positive and the U.S. relatively flat. In this challenging economic environment, we feel very good about our trends. And we continue to grow by adapting to our customers' needs and elevating the key drivers for our Plan to Win. Those being: More menu variety and choice, better restaurant operations, greater convenience in daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant investment. In all of these areas, we're innovating and improving and pushing ourselves to stay and step with the consumers in order to get them the most outstanding dining experience in every way. This strategy and alignment helped us achieve strong results across the system in 2009.In the U.S., comp sales increased slightly for the quarter and up 2.6% for the year, contributing to an operating income growth of 5% to 6%, respectively.  We're proud of these results especially given the high unemployment and its impact on consumer spending. In the U.S. last year, our comp sales gap [ph] against the industry was positive every week of the year. And despite an overall decline in the informal eating-out category, we increased our market share and strengthened our leadership position. We drove results by delivering exceptional value, menu choice and convenience. U.S. maintained a strong focus on value at every level from the Dollar Menu to mid-tier and premium offerings. This continues to make us a compelling choice for customers in this uncertain time. And we continue to win through menu choice with a balance in familiar and popular core products as well as new items to keep us relevant. Our McCafé specialty coffees and our line of premium Angus burgers were new offerings in 2009 and they helped us make McDonald's a more clear destination for outstanding quality at the best value. We're pushing ahead with more choices including the national launch this month of our Mac Snack Wrap and breakfast Dollar Menu. The Mac Snack Wrap is a snack version of our Big Mac. It's a four-tier product with a good margin and it fits well into our growing snack daypart or as add-on to a meal and certainly can be eaten on the go.The breakfast Dollar Menu introduced in collaboration with our franchisees, gives us a national voice on value at breakfast. Both of these highlight our commitment to keep modernizing our menu and provide the products that our customers are looking for. In this front, we're also launching free wireless Internet access at nearly all of our U.S. restaurants. This will make us the largest provider of free Internet in the country and make our restaurant experience even more valuable.Now turning to Europe, comparable sales were up 4.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Europe's guiding strategies of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance continues to drive results. In the fourth quarter, we grew our market share in the informal eating-out category across Europe, including the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The key to this growth was the continued focus on our three-tier menu platform, everyday low price, core and premium, delivering choice and value across the menu. In addition, we continue to enhance our fourth-tier menu platform by delivering a category of smaller premium affordable products. We expanded our line of popular Petit Plaisirs in France and our Little Taster offerings in the U.K. and we've introduced four-tier products to other markets such as Germany with the Snack Deluxe. All of this is building greater relevancy for our brand and stronger results for our bottom line. Europe also saw success from an increased emphasis on daypart expansion, particularly breakfast. In Germany, we expanded our breakfast lineup with classic and new offerings as part of our Easy Morning breakfast launch and is yielding solid results. And then the U.K., our number one breakfast market in Europe, strong media support helped generate some of our highest breakfast sales to date. In addition, Europe's ongoing coffee strategy, including the standalone McCafé concept is resonating with European consumers, with McDonald's now being the number one seller of coffee in Germany. Many of these opportunities are enhanced by Europe's leading role in the reimaging, where by the end of 2011, 85% of Europe's 6,800 restaurants will be reimaged.Let's shift to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or APMEA, which delivered $1 billion in operating income in 2009. This is a long way from the $345 million they delivered in 2005. For the quarter and year, comp sales were up 1.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Operating income also continue to grow, up 28% for the quarter and 23% for the year in constant currencies. Our growth across the region continues to come from strong execution in convenience, value, core menu and breakfast. Australia remains one of the top performing markets in our system. They've reimaged their entire asset base, setting the stage to drive strong results with premium offerings like the popular Angus line and the M burger selections. They also launched the next version of their Value Picks menu, as well as enhance the drive-through experience, leading to better operations and service types [ph].Now China, although their economy is improving and we delivered an increase in comp sales and guest counts in December, we expect it will still be some time before consumers regain confidence and are willing to spend more. In the meantime, we're making the right moves to grow our business and strengthen our connection with our Chinese consumers. We're improving our operations, which is differentiating our brand on service and helping build capacity during peak hours. We also launched the highly popular Value Lunch initiative that has helped drive guest counts and incremental sales. And as we announced recently, we're adding to our footprint by planning to open up 150 to 175 restaurants in China in 2010. So we remain excited about our potential growth and expansion in this region. McDonald's Japan made solid progress last year in the face of significant economic headwinds delivering positive comp sales across the majority of months. Our results were driven largely by the introduction of the Quarter Pounder, the launch of Premium Roast coffee and a strong focus on affordability, highlighted by our popular Value Lunch. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we made gains through our focus on drive-through, the relaunch of McChicken and the continued success of our Premium Coffee products. So those are some of the recent highlights from around the world. As we turn to the year ahead, I want to say to say a few words on our continued commitment to financial discipline and enhancing shareholder value. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends. With a three-year total of $16.6 billion in our $15 billion to $17 billion three-year target. Going forward, our philosophy regarding the use of our cash flow remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Our reinvestment strategies, our financial discipline and especially our Plan to Win are the mainstays of our success. And the blueprint we will continue to follow to drive future growth. We're pleased with 2009's results. We remain confident in and committed to our Plan to Win and our customer-focused strategies and as always, we feel we have the very best leadership team in place to help us achieve our goals. As you all know, Don Thomson recently became our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Don has a deep knowledge of the business and has done an outstanding job leading our U.S. business and Don will continue to drive value for the brand in his new role.At McDonald's, we pride ourselves in our commitment to talent management leadership development and always having a deep bench of strong, capable leaders. We have a great management team in place that is highly talented, well aligned and ready to deliver results.Moving forward, we're all focused on the appropriate business drivers to be more relevant for our customers every day, from the best tasting food and beverage offerings to the greatest value and convenience, to an unparalleled restaurant experience. With our franchisees, suppliers and employees all working together, I'm certain we will continue to succeed on all these fronts. And I'm confident we will keep delivering positive results for our system and our shareholders. And now, I'll turn things over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."
139488,82628600,46627,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-22-2010",2010-01-22,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Everyday, more than 60 million customers around the world come at McDonald's for convenience, variety and value. All our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow and returns. I'm proud to say that we delivered",1274,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Everyday, more than 60 million customers around the world come at McDonald's for convenience, variety and value. All our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow and returns. I'm proud to say that we delivered for customers and investors alike in 2009, with sales, operations, profitability and returns all improving amid a historic economic downturn.For the fourth quarter and the year, we delivered double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. Even after adjusting 2008 results for the gain on sale of [indiscernible] and 2009 results for the income related to the Redbox transactions and the resolution of certain Latin America liabilities, earnings per share rose 10% in the quarter and 13% for the year in constant currencies. During the fourth quarter, primarily due to the resolution of certain Latin America retained liabilities, we recorded $65 million of pretax income as well as a $22 million benefit in tax expense, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In total, this resulted in an $0.08 benefit to earnings per share and a 240 basis point benefit to the effective tax rate for the quarter.Combined operating margin improved significantly in 2009. At about 30%, our combined operating margin is significantly higher than that of many global consumer companies. This combined operating margin performance reflects our ability to drive strong franchise and company-operated margins, while controlling G&A spending. Total margin dollars for McDonald's restaurants reached a record $8.8 billion in 2009, up about 6% in constant currencies. Franchise margin dollars, which represents nearly $6 billion of the total, grew at a faster pace as we continue to execute our refranchising strategy. As a percent of revenues, franchise margins were strong at 82.1% for both the quarter and the year. Over the last two years, we've refranchised more than 1,100 restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy. And today, more than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are franchised. We expect to refranchise a couple of hundred more restaurants in 2010.Company operating margins were up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.8%, driven by positive comparable sales, lower commodity costs and refranchising. For the year, company operating margins increased 60 basis points to 18.2%, the highest level in a decade. Throughout 2009, our U.S. business outperformed the overall informal eating-out industry, and the fourth quarter was no exception. Easing commodity costs benefited margins in the fourth quarter, as our grocery bill declined about 4%. Refranchising also enhanced the margin increase. As a result, our U.S. business delivered outstanding company-operated margins of 20.3% for the quarter and 19.4% for the year. Strong company operating margins are a key indicator of our business health and restaurant level cash flow. In 2009, average restaurant cash flow growth for our owner operators was the strongest in 15 years. We closed the year with average annual pre-debt cash flow approaching $320,000 per restaurant. This strong owner operator cash flow helps enable future reinvestments in the business, like support for breakfast Dollar Menu or reimaging. In Europe, company operating margins increased 130 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and utility costs. The U.K., France and many other countries drove this improvement as our menu, variety and value continue to appeal to customers.While Europe's local currency grocery bill declined 3% in the quarter, currency rates continue to pressure commodity costs in Russia and other Eastern European countries, making the net impact of food and paper costs slightly negative. For the year, company operating margins rose 40 basis points in Europe, reaching a 10-year high of 18.4%.In Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, company operating margins increased 260 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year, company operating margins rose 90 basis points to a very healthy 16.8%. Our sustained strong performance in Australia and operating efficiencies and lower commodity cost throughout the segment drove the improvement for both periods. We are confident we can deliver strong company operating margins going forward, as we continue to execute our strategies related to price, product mix and promotion, while driving efficiencies and managing costs. As it relates to food and paper costs, our initial outlook for 2010 is for our basket of goods to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe, with easier comparisons in the first half of the year.Turning to G&A, in constant currencies, G&A was up slightly for the quarter and down for the year. 2009 marks the fifth consecutive year that G&A declined as a percent of both sales and revenues. And we expect G&A as a percent of sales and revenues will continue to decline in 2010. While total G&A dollars will be up slightly on a reported basis at today's exchange rates, G&A should be relatively flat in constant currency. The timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biannual Worldwide Owner Operator Convention will impact the quarterly comparisons. Our proven ability to drive sales, deliver strong margins and control spending, along with our franchise business model, all have positive implications for our cash flow. As we continue to be disciplined in how we use this cash, our philosophy has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business, as Jim said. We have the financial capacity and the local talent to invest capital back into our business when many others cannot. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to leverage to further differentiate the McDonald's experience.In 2010, we will invest about $2.4 billion in capital expenditures. Our goal is to elevate our brand to drive sustainable growth while continuing to earn strong returns. Approximately half of our capital expenditures will be used to open about 1,000 new restaurants around the world, including roughly 500 in Asia-Pacific, 250 in Europe and 150 in the U.S. The other half of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward reimaging over 2,000 existing locations. Nearly half of these remodels will be in Europe, 600 in Asia-Pacific and 500 in the U.S. Reimaging has a direct positive impact on sales and market share as our experience in the U.S., France and Australia demonstrates. In 2010, our reimaging efforts will be focused on both the interior and exterior of our restaurants. As we've done in the past, we will co-invest with our owner operators in this high-impact reimaging efforts. It's important to remember that as we make these investments, we are also upgrading our asset base. This is because we own the land and buildings or hold long-term leases on the property underlying our restaurants. In addition, by sharing in the investment, we can accelerate initiatives, reach scale faster and positively impact our business sooner.On a final note, as you know for most of 2009, currency translation was a significant headwind, negatively impacting full year earnings per share by $0.15. However, this headwind became a tailwind in the fourth quarter, a benefit we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters. Based on current rates, we estimate that currency translation will positively impact first quarter earnings by about $0.05 or $0.06 per share and the full year benefit is estimated to be approximately $0.06 to $0.08 per share. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a strong balance sheet and cash flow and owner operators and suppliers who are aligned and focused. As we move forward in 2010, we will continue to leverage our competitive strengths to extend our lead in the marketplace and drive value for our shareholders and global system. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

We don't normally like to talk about weather, but we can't avoid it when you look at the first 14 or 15 days of the month. And the severity of the weather, I think it was impacting us at probably around 3% a day in the sales because whenever we had a weather that was normalized, we saw much better results. And so if anything, I would say that the trends are a little bit better than they were in December."

And we know from our test markets that there's plenty of cash flow and return for both us and the owner operators. On the specific U.S. initiative that's going to move forward, we do not have a final decision on what that contribution is going to be. So once we get that figured out, we will be able to communicate that. But I wouldn't expect it to be dramatically different from what we've done in the past, or dramatically different from what we've done with something like the beverage initiative. But until we get that worked out and finalized, we don't want to share that. But definitely, it is focused on allocating returns at appropriate level for us and the owner operators. And when we do the full reimage, we don't have a whole lot of them done in the U.S. But we do know from other markets that generally, we see a 6% to 7% sales lift relative to the rest of the marketplace when we do the holistic reimage, meaning, a really nice blowout job on the dining room in the inside along with the exterior of the building and the landscaping and everything."

So when we talk about not having as much pricing elasticity that Pete had talked about earlier because of commodities and other kinds of things in the past are certainly in the inflationary environment.

So we really don't even talk about how we're able to pass on any cost that we might have to absorb when we do our pricing models and how we communicate with our consumers around value. We decide that it's important for us to continue to have everyday affordability, present to our consumers a value proposition that makes us a compelling choice relative to eating out when they choose to eat out. And all those factors are considered. But we do that on a regular basis, not just during recessionary times. And of course, since we've been in this situation now, some would argue for more than two years, it continues to be the consumer insight that we use and make our decisions around.

I'm joining you from our McDonald's Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in Orlando. Every two years we bring together our franchisees from around the world and along with a number of our suppliers and company employees we celebrate our success, but mostly we calibrate about our future. But we're in the middle of it now and it's been a tremendous week so far. From the Convention floor to our business meetings, we are focused on operations, menu, reinvestment and building this great brand.
'
We're sharing ideas and learning from each other further strengthening our alignment, which I know is critical to our future success. We're energized and confident about what we're doing regarding our business and taking our business to the next level. So as we come together and looked ahead I'm proud of the results we achieved this quarter. Global comparable sales were up 4.2%. Operating income increased 13% in constant currency and earnings per share reached $1, a 9% increase in constant currency.
Our success continues to be a system wide effort driven by strong results in each area of the world. In the U.S. comparable sales for the quarter increased 1.5% and operating income grew 12%. Comparable sales in Europe rose 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currencies and in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 5.7% with operating income rising 9% in constant currencies.
Our momentum is continuing at April with comparable sales trending positive across all of our geographies. We are now into our seventh year of positive comp sales growth in every part of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevance of our plan to win business strategy.
Guided by the plan, we continue to focus on differentiating our brands through common business drivers, mainly a variety of beverage choice, better restaurant operations, convenience in daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant reinvestment. On all of these fronts we're improving and re-innovating. As a result, we are growing our business in widening our market share lead around the world.
Together, we're aligned around these drivers in delivering them in the most locally relevant liege. Regarding menu, we made gains by promoting our iconic core products while delivering new food and beverage news. In the U.S. as growing Olympic theme promotion help ignite our Chicken McNuggets sales and drove sustained sales growth across our entire chicken category.
Our new product news included McSnack Wrap with all the great taste of Big Mac and a portable wrap which has helped lift the entire Snack Wrap line or category across the menu. Looking ahead, the U.S. is continuing the expansion of McCafé line with the introduction of Frappes and Smoothies.
Frappe is now around about 90% of the U.S. Restaurants, and are already exceeding expectations, and that's without any national advertising, and later this summer we will be launching Wild Berry and Straw Berry Banana Smoothies. With these new additions were becoming even more of the beverage destination serving familiar and popular drinks with the quality convenience and value that only McDonald's can provide.
Looking at Europe, we continue to delight customers and drive sales with our fourth tier menu offerings, which deliver a popular option of smaller premium portable sandwiches. Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany have both delivered solid sales results and our latest line of Petit plaisirs in France has exceeded expectations. Europe is also driving momentum with its premium offerings from the Big Tasty in France and the Chicken Bacon Onion Sandwich in the U.K. to the launch of McKinley Burgers, which have performed strongly across our entire market.
In APMEA, Japan has driven sales with its recent line of American theme burgers. In addition the number of markets are rolling out extensive campaigns to elevate our core products including the upcoming launch of our Quarter Pounder in Singapore. We also continue to offer strong value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonalds for branded affordability. In China, we've maintained our popular value lunch which is driving guest counts and sales.
In the U.S. we launched our Dollar Menu with breakfast to provide the kind of everyday predictable value our customers expect from us. As a result, we've reinvigorated this vital daypart and experienced strong sales in guest count gross into the first quarter. Meanwhile everyday affordability and pricing from our value menus remains a strong traffic driver across Europe and year-to-date our extra value meals throughout Europe have been extremely robust.
Italy saw 30% increases as they supported the Big Mac while France experienced strong extra value meal growth and the U.K, Germany and Spain also achieved strong results. So we're continuing to drive traffic as we connect with consumers through core menus, favorites, new food news and the most relevant value offerings and we're complimenting it with even better all around restaurant experience from how our restaurants look to how they are operated to the convenience they provide in our customers daily lives.
As many of you know, we have a system wide effort to re-image and modernize our locations inside and out. Australia and Europe have led the way and our other geographies have seen the benefits and are leveraging these learning's. In the U.S. over the past few years we've refreshed about one third of our restaurants with an emphasis on the interior. This year, the U.S. will re-image 400 to 500 restaurants, concentrating on both the interior and exterior.
In China, where we're celebrating our 20th anniversary we have an extensive plan to refresh our current restaurants and still plan to open between 150 to 175 new restaurants this year. Wherever we have critical mass, our re-imaged restaurants were seeing improved perception of our brand and higher sales and returns.
As in Australia where many of our brand perception scores have increased over the last three years and we've delivered a three year return on incremental invest in capital of more than 60%. We feel this initiative will set the stage to take the McDonald's brand well into the future. The strength of the brand is also dependent on great service through innovative technology and better training of our people; we will continue to enhance the experience of our customers.
APMEA continues to lead the way generating our top customer satisfaction scores year-to-date. In particular, China and Japan are truly differentiating our brand on service with Japan achieving its best satisfaction scores ever earlier this year. The U.S. and Europe have also continued to make great progress on improving their customer satisfaction scores. This is a key measure that we pay very close attention to in order to ensure we are getting better at being better.
Key to Europe's results have been nearly full implementation of our bridge operating platform, which creates a better organized kitchen increases capacity and puts less pressure on the crew through simplified operations. Its now a nearly 90% of our European restaurants and it enables us to expand our menu variety at the same time improving our customer service.
Finally, we are leveraging greater convenience in daypart expansion to continue to drive growth. In the U.S. more than one third of our restaurants are now open 24 hours, and we know there are opportunities to do more. In addition, nearly 80% of our stores are now open by 5:00 a.m. continuing to add to the comp for that particular daypart.
In APMEA, convenience remains a key driver of our business. Our McDonald's Celebrity Service now operates in 19 countries throughout the region and contributed to measurable comp growth in China, Hong Kong and Korea. Our continued expansion of 24 hour service drove sales in Japan and Australia, improvements and drive through execution across all markets erupt a greater capacity in cash flow.
Meanwhile we've now made breakfast available in 75% of our restaurants in APMEA, and we are excited about the tremendous opportunity that breakfast provides. So those are a few highlights on how the momentum is continuing this year. We are delivering the food and beverages our customers want, they value they expect and an overall dining experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers lives.
We are committed to our business plans and our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. We have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry allowing us to access capital and help facilitate owner owner/operators to obtain the credit they need to reinvest in their restaurants.
We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase and in the first quarter we returned $1 billion to shareholders. Overall I'm very pleased by our first quarter performance and confident that we will continue to achieve strong results. What I've experienced at this weeks meeting is encouraging and motivating.
Our entire system is determined to get even better and all we deliver to keep McDonalds moving forward. The optimism, confidence and alignment is truly inspiring and will continue. Thank you, and now I'll introduce Pete Bensen, our CFO.
Pete Bensen
Thanks Jim and hello everyone. As I walk our Convention floor and visit with people this week, it's even more clear to me that the system alignment behind our plan to win is the fuel that continues to drive increased sales, debt counts, cash flow and market share around the world.
Owner/operators, suppliers and company employees are focused on satisfying the evolving needs of our customers by delivering unbeatable value, menu choice and convenience in a contemporary environment everyday in our restaurants. These collective efforts resulted in first quarter as reported operating income growth of 20% to nearly $1.7 billion. Every area of the world contributed with top line sales growth, effective management of expenses and strong margin performance.
As a result, combined operating margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 30%. U.S. Company operating margins rose 210 basis points to 20.4% primarily due to lower food and paper cost and to a lesser extent, the impact to refranchising. For a perspective, the last time the quarterly U.S. Company operating margin exceeded 20.4% with second quarter 1994 nearly 16 years ago. We continue to experience lower commodity cost in the first quarter as our basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 5%.
This compares to the 6.7% increase in first quarter 2009. For the full-year 2010, our commodity outlook in the U.S. is favorable with cost expected to be down 2% to 3%. Lower food and paper cost have allowed us to continue to grow margins while holding the line on price increases. We remain focused on building traffic, which is critical to growing our market share over the long-term.
Regarding Europe, Company operating margins increased 200 basis points in the first quarter to 17.3% down comparable sales in France, Russia, the U.K. and many other markets as well as lower commodity cost were partly offset by higher labor and occupancy cost. Broad currency pressures on imports in Russia and Eastern Europe have eased since last year which also benefited margins.
Europe's grocery bill also declined 5% in the quarter and for the full-year we expect commodity costs to be down slightly. In APMEA, company operated margins increased 220 basis points, also driven by lower commodity costs, operating efficiencies and positive comparable sales. Turning to franchise margins, we continue to benefit from a more heavily franchise structure as first quarter franchise margin dollars rose to nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency, driven in part by system wide sales growth of 6%.
The consolidated franchise margin percent declined slightly, yet remains strong at 81.2%. Our positive global comparable sales were offset by higher depreciation cost in the U.S and the impact of refranchising. In addition the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar in the first quarter of 2010 negatively impacted the mix of APMEA's franchise margins.
The final factor in our combined operating margin is G&A control. First quarter G&A increased in total dollars, but improved slightly as a percentage of revenues. This was in line with our internal expectations. As I mentioned on January's call, the timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention will impact quarterly comparisons this year.
We still expect full year 2010 G&A to be up slightly on an as reported basis and relatively flat in constant currencies. As a system, we continue to concentrate on initiatives and assets that grow our business over the long-term, where necessary tough decisions are being made to close certain capacity constraint sites. Japan, our 50% owned affiliate decided to close approximately 430 restaurants with lower volumes and returns by mid-year 2011.
Accordingly, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $30 million after tax or $0.03 per share. We expect minimal additional charges for the remainder of the year. So, we are revising downward the total estimate for these costs in 2010 from $40 million to $50 million to less than $40 million. Somewhat offsetting the impairment charges in Japan were about $30 million in gains in our U.S. business from the dissolution of a few of our joint partnerships.
These gains were reflected in other operating income. This is a continuation of our broader efforts to optimize our ownership mix, to leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of our proven owner/operators and enhance our portfolio of Company operated restaurants. While pruning underperforming assets in certain markets and continuing ownership optimization certainly makes us stronger.
We are also focused on the opportunity to build future returns and enhance long-term shareholder value with new restaurant development and re-imaging of our existing restaurants. Re-imaging as contributed to sustain momentum and outstanding returns in France, Australia and other markets, that have a significant percentage of contemporary restaurants.
Fresh new looking restaurants helped to retain existing customers while attracting new ones. They also enhance our ability to introduce more premium offerings. Australia's recent success with the Angus Burger is a testament to that. We believe the timing for expanding our re-imaging efforts is ideal, but simply together with our franchises, we are investing on a scale that cannot be matched.
We plan to re-image over 2000 locations this year. About half of those will be in Europe, another 600 in APMEA with the remaining 400 to 500 locations in the U.S. The opportunity to update our brand is significant. Globally, only about 20% of our exteriors reflect our current contemporary look. Approximately twice as many interiors, or about 40% has been updated. Therefore, the majority of our restaurants do not yet have a contemporary look on either the inside or the outside.
In general, Europe is farther along than either in the U.S. or APMEA, particularly with interior re-imaging. A combination of both, an exterior and interior re-image produces the most significant sales lease, so that will be our plan going forward. In the U.S. the first 400 to 500 re-image sites will tend to be older higher volume locations, where permitting time is reasonable and we either own the land or have significant lease term remaining.
Geographically, we expect them to fairly disperse around the country with about 20 restaurants in each of our 22 regions, and in addition to our re-imaging efforts, we will rebuild over 150 restaurants in the U.S. this year. We are co-investing with our owner/operators on the re-imaging effort in a similar manner as we have in the past.
We expect our investment per restaurant will be in the range of $150,000 to $200,000 depending on the scope or the remodel. Our owner/operators will contribute the remaining $250,000 to $500,000. The total re-imaging cost per restaurant will vary considerably depending on the age of the building, whether any previously updating has occurred, maintenance and repair needs and compliance with local zoning requirements such as interior sprinklers, lighting, signage and accessibility.
We've seen an average sales lift above overall market performance of at least 6% to 7%. So, we expect returns from re-imaging to be good for both the Company and our owner operators. Lastly, I would like to update you on currency translation.
Our currency benefit came in at the low end of expectations that we provided on our call in January. Above the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro and the British Pound over the last two months, this was mostly offset by improved operating performance particularly in markets like Australia and Russia, where currencies remain more stable, and having approximately 45% of our total debt denominated in foreign currency also provides a hedge against volatility.
Based on current exchange rate in business outlook, we expect the comparisons will begin to turn negative in the second half of the year, but for the full-year, currency translation is expected to provide a slight benefit. We recognize this estimate becomes outdated within days, but at least to give you some perspective at today's rate.
McDonald's first quarter numbers are a testament to the alignment of our system around growing both top and bottom line results in a challenging environment. McDonald continues to gain strength and looking ahead my experience this week with the franchises hear their owner/operator convention gives me more confidence that we can do even better as the economy improves.
Thank you, now I will turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.

If you see consumer confidence, score is getter better over the last couple of months. We see a little more spending in the market place and yet the stubborn unemployment being at 9.7% is still as a factor I think relative to that overall spending in that confidence.
I don't believe that the spending levels are going to get back to pre-recession until people have some confidence over the fact they are going to have a place to go to work and put food on the table at home or away from home. I think that's going to continue to be an issue, and I believe that the results that we are achieving are result of our strategies around the value orientation of our menu. It is absolutely continuing to be the most important thing relative to our customers, and that is everyday affordability and yet of course we continue to grow guest counts during this very difficult time, and have opportunity for them to partake of value across the menu even in our premium sandwiches. So, I think it's as much our strategies as it is the confidence of the QSR consumer.

The actually great, great visit to I was in China, Japan here recently, specific to drive through and actually I'll talk a little broader about the development strategy in China first.

So, in China, great strategy, we beeped our infrastructure. We are driving stronger margin. We are running better restaurant, some of the lowest customer satisfaction opportunities that we have within the system, which means really great operations and so all of those things are helping us in China and the drive through strategy is continuing.

We had a chance to hear from some of our owner/operators who are executing the smoothies and interestingly enough in Michigan and really out performing based upon their execution in the restaurant and so a lot of excitement in the operator community and we're moving forward very effectively in terms of getting those products into the restaurants.

We've got an outstanding group of folks that work in our supply chain at McDonald's. They work with some of our risk management people and ultimately though its our independent suppliers that end up making these final decisions but they -- we do a combination of things.
We do some fixed price contracts after looking at markets and trying to anticipate what's going to happen, do some forward buying, some auctions and really through some of the long-term relationships are able to negotiate some pretty favorable pricing and its all about for us trying to provide some stability and predictability in the prices.
It's important to be able to go to owner/operators and talk about what promotions we're going to be running six or nine months from now and have them feel confident that they have some idea of what the cost of those items are going to be. So, in times like this when you're starting to see maybe the commodity markets take off a little bit, these tactics allow us to mitigate the impact on our margins and our commodity costs. And again there is no one item in our basket of goods that’s more than 15% of our cost of sales. So its spread amongst a broad base of items where we have the opportunity to be as opportunistic as we can.

It would seem that if the sales lift was about the same in prior remodels but the cost was higher so the returns would be lower, if you can just check me on that. And I can't leave the March comp question alone. You said April was better than the first quarter. Is April also better than March?

This is the first time that we've officially given guidance on what those costs are going to be. I know there has been some estimates out there and stuff but the range, we wanted to get across the point that there isn’t going to be -- it's going to be hard to come up with an average remodel when you look across 6,000 restaurants in the U.S. system, varying ages, varying sizes and individual owner/operator decisions that they make in terms of what they want to invest in. So there is going to be the specific items that we know are going to really enhance the brand and there can be other items that an operator may take the opportunity to invest in at the time.
So, I was visiting with some owner/operators about a month ago and while they were doing the remodel of both the interior and the exterior, they chose to do a replacement of their HVAC and to basically redo their whole parking lot instead of just reseal it because they knew that was coming up in a couple of years anyway and they take the opportunity to do it right now.
So, you are going to see a wide range of spending, but ideally I would like to say the average would be in the middle but that's really hard to say. When you look at the sales lift from these, the fact that we do the combination of the interior and the exterior, we're getting a bigger sales lift than if we just did the interior and this is a lift if you think about the environment we're in John. Sales are strong and we're getting a lift above the general market in addition to that.
So, as we look at it and pencil it out, even at some of the higher ends of our contributions and the lower end of the sales increases, we're seeing returns in the low double digits as the first year cash-on-cash return that we know will grow from there. So, we feel pretty confident about that and that the level of investment and the sales expectations will warrant this level of investment.
For April, what we said in the release was that we expect April to be at least as strong as the quarter on a global basis. So what we're setting there is a floor saying that it won't be any lower than 4.2 is what our expectation is.

Relative to breakfast and the mix in terms of what we're seeing, clearly we are selling more coffee and if you look at the products that are part of that dollar menu its basically a sausage biscuit, a sausage muffin. We've got hash browns in there and then you've got coffee. And then you've got the other products that were already on dollar menu such as a fruit and yogurt parfait.
So when you look at it broadly, we're selling more coffee. We're selling more hash browns. We're selling clearly more sandwiches there. You are talking about sandwiches that have a relatively low food and paper cost. So the overall impact is not a large impact from a margin perspective as you can see from the margins that we were able to deliver.
So all-in-all we're really pleased. The notion here was to really recapture guest counts and Jim mentioned this earlier. With unemployment at the level it is, our goal was to reach out and pull people out of homes and when you've got food at home still down 2% and you've got food away from home elevated at about 3.5%, we know we can't take a lot of price and so as a result of that, this breakfast menu has been helping us quite a bit to pull people back into the restaurant and we're really happy with the guest count what we're seeing at breakfast.

First of all as you all know, this is going to be implemented and mandated in 2014. So we've got a few years here to figure out what that direct impact might be to us. We're a federation of small businesses as franchisees as you all know, as I just mentioned and the impacts are going to vary across those franchisees. There are so many moving parts now. When you do the math its difficult to figure out exactly where it might settle because we're just into the implementation process now. It will vary by the number of employees that are full time for each franchisee.
And then the bill of course, we have some things in it that have been beneficial for us, where there's a 90 day waiting period before our employers are required to enroll employees which is very important for us because sometimes it takes 90 days for us to realize whether or not a person is going to be a full time employee for us or whether they wouldn't be a full time employee for us. So that will be helpful in the overall invitation. And yet we have taken a shot at the math like a lot of other people and we think in the U.S it might be $10,000 to $30,000 per store. So it will be determined. We don’t really have it sorted out yet. I don’t think anybody really does.
Relative to the corporate level, there is really going to be minimal impact for us. You've seen other companies come on who have legacy costs because of retiring health benefits. We don’t have that problem. We have about 100 retirees that are in our program. They pay full premium including prescription rebates and so we don’t have that legacy problem and therefore you wont be seeing any negative impact relative to the overall corporate coffers if you will relative to our overall situation, which is a very good thing. We really are structured in a way with our 401(k)s and our profit sharing and all the other kinds of things. We don't have any of those legacy issues that many companies have and we're very fortunate.

Just a few things. When we started this back a while ago, our share in coffee was really low as you all know and if you looked at an overall share of coffee, we were somewhere around 2% overall. That is more than triple and if you just really broke it down, in terms of brew coffee, we now sell more brew coffee than anyone. That number has been a large growth opportunity for us.
If you look at Espresso base, clearly we've more than doubled since the first part of just 2009. We've doubled our espresso base coffees and then clearly in the ice coffee arena, we've had tremendous growth there as well. So, all of the coffee strategies have been intended to really bring in more customers. We talked earlier about the incremental nature of it and about 40 odd percentile of the customers being incremental. That still holds true even as we move into frappes, which is still a coffee based, espresso based drink. So, all of our measures and metrics in terms of coffee have moved in a positive direction substantially.

So I think about 30 restaurants really got closed this quarter of the ones that were announced and while they were of a lower volume and lower return than the average in the market, just getting 30 of them closed this quarter really didn’t have a significant impact.
And really as we go forward, we don’t think there is going to be a tremendous impact on the equity and earnings. They weren’t a significant drag. We'll have some, what we call sales transfer as we close these restaurants. So other restaurants in the market will pick up sales and those are the higher performing operations. So we'll see a slight benefit in our earnings from the ongoing operations there in Japan.
But the real benefit of doing that was we had these group of restaurants that were constrained for future growth. They weren’t really representative of where the Japanese team wanted to take the brand in the future and so its really more positive going forward about the state in the group of restaurants that we have which ultimately leads to better operating results and performance.

I will tell you this. On April 25th, we are reopening about 13 restaurants in Tokyo.
We're going to open on all of them on the exact same day. They will be the re-imaged restaurants that are going to be very iconic in Japan and that is the future of where we want to go there.

We have people working feverishly over here to capture all of that but on the first one, investment level, you asked about the older program versus the newest one. Here is the difference. Before what we did was we had a fixed amount, $85,000 that we contributed toward a re-image when we did the whole re-imaging program.
What ended up happening was the franchisees actually invested. We thought the investment would be somewhere around $170,000. To the point that was made earlier and Pete made it, the franchisees ended up spending about $250,000 because they saw other things they wanted to invest in. This time this is not a $6 investment. What we're looking at now is somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 percentile of leasehold improvement.
So we're talking physical plant type improvements in the restaurant. Now the reason we're able to do that this time is because we already did have a re-imaging program for the interiors before. If a franchisee did not benefit from that then this time they're going to have to put forth some dollars to be able to do the interior of the restaurant and we have a very small contribution there. But the gist of this is the leasehold improvement and so that’s the different between the older program and the newer one.
The other thing is and Pete mentioned it but we should reiterate it again, this time there is a broad range. Some restaurants only need to do the exterior. Others will want to do a full interior exterior, the core package change, signage and M&R around equipment. That’s why you see such a broad range. So, very different investment profile on our end. The next one, speed of service wise, we have not seen speed of service hindrances and the reason we haven’t is if you look at when we implemented the combine beverage solution, the biggest part of that, about 80% of our restaurants did we called a full remodel of the beverage sale.
What that meant was that they actually put in a built in additional capacity and a drive through. We had additional equipment. We had better spacing in the drive through. We went from five foot, three boots way out over nine feet in many cases and so when you look at what we did in drive through, we built in additional capacity. So, for some of the products we have now, its really flowing well in the restaurants. We have not seen a decrease in service. As a matter of fact in the U.S. they just posted their best quality, service and cleanliness scores for the month of March historically. So, we're doing real well on that end.
Discounting level, we don't really look at this as a discounting level and the reason is because we have consistent value across the year is the reason for breakfast value menu, dollar menu, consistent value across the year which allows us then having set that up in the minds of our customers, they know its consistent. Now we can come in with our promotional activity and talk about frappes or smoothie or Angus. It's really important for us. So we're not jumping in and out of quote-unquote discounting. We have a consistent value message across the year.

I'm joining you from our McDonald's Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in Orlando.

I'm joining you from our McDonald's Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in Orlando. Every two years, we bring together our franchisees from around the world, and along with a number of our suppliers and company employees, we celebrate our success. But mostly, we calibrate about our future. 
Well, we're in the middle of it now, and it's been a tremendous week so far. From the convention floor to our business meetings, we are focused on operations, menu, reinvestment and building this great brand. We're sharing ideas and learning from each other, further strengthening our alignment, which I know is critical to our future success. We're energized and confident about what we're doing regarding our business and taking our business to the next level.
So as we come together and look ahead, I'm proud of the results we achieved this quarter. Global comparable sales were up 4.2%, operating income increased 13% in constant currency and earnings per share reached $1, a 9% increase in constant currency. Our success continues to be a system-wide effort, driven by strong results in each area of the world.
In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter increased 1.5% and operating income grew 12%. Comparable sales in Europe rose 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currencies. And in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 5.7% with operating income rising 9% in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing into April with comparable sales trending positive across all of our geographies.
We are now into our seventh year of positive comp sales growth in every part of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevance of our Plan to Win business strategy. Guided by the plan, we continue to focus on differentiating our brand through common business drivers: Menu variety and beverage choice; better restaurant operations; convenience in daypart expansion; everyday predictable low prices; and ongoing restaurant reinvestment. 
On all of these fronts, we're improving and we're innovating. As a result, we're growing our business and widening our market share lead around the world. Together, we're aligned around these drivers and delivering them in the most locally relevant ways. 
Regarding menu, we made gains by promoting our iconic core products, while delivering new food and beverage news. In the U.S., a strong Olympic-themed promotion helped ignite our Chicken McNuggets sales and drove sustained sales growth across our entire Chicken category. 
Our new product news included Mac Snack Wrap, with all the great taste of Big Mac in a portable wrap, which has helped lift the entire Snack Wrap line or category across the menu. 
Looking ahead, the U.S. is continuing the expansion of McCafé line with the introduction of frappes and smoothies. Frappes now are in about 90% of the U.S. restaurants and are already exceeding expectations, and that's without any national advertising. And later this summer, we will be launching wild berry and strawberry banana smoothies. 
With these new additions, we're becoming even more of a beverage destination, serving familiar and popular drinks with the quality, convenience and value that only McDonald's can provide.
Looking at Europe, we continued to delight customers and drive sales with our fourth tier menu offerings, which deliver a popular option of smaller premium affordable sandwiches. Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany have both delivered solid sales results. And our latest line of Petit Plaisirs in France has exceeded expectations. 
Europe is also driving momentum with its premium offerings, from the Big Tasty and France and the Chicken Bacon Onion Sandwich in the U.K. to the launch of McItaly burgers which have performed strongly across our Italian market. 
In APMEA, Japan has driven sales with its recent line of American-themed burgers. In addition, a number of markets are rolling out extensive campaigns to elevate our core products, including the upcoming launch of our Quarter Pounder in Singapore. We also continue to offer strong value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for branded affordability.
In China, we've maintained our popular value lunch, which is driving guest counts and sales. In the U.S., we launched our Dollar Menu at Breakfast to provide the kind of everyday predictable value our customers expect from us. As a result, we've reinvigorated this vital daypart and experienced strong sales and guest count growth into the first quarter. 
Meanwhile, everyday affordability and pricing from our value menus remains a strong traffic driver across Europe. And year-to-date, our Extra Value Meals throughout Europe have been extremely robust. Italy saw 30% increases as they supported the Big Mac, while France experienced strong Extra Value Meal growth, and the U.K. Germany and Spain also achieved strong results.
So we're continuing to drive traffic as we connect with consumers through core menu favorites, new food news and the most relevant value offerings. And we're complementing it with even better all-around restaurant experience, from how our restaurants look, to how they are operated, to the convenience they provide in our customers' daily lives. 
Now as many of you know, we have a system-wide effort to reimage and modernize our locations inside and out. Australia and Europe have led the way, and our other geographies have seen the benefits and are leveraging these learnings. 
In the U.S., over the past few years, we've refreshed about 1/3 of our restaurants with an emphasis on the interior. This year, the U.S. will reimage 400 to 500 restaurants concentrating on both the interior and exterior. In China, where we're celebrating our 20th anniversary, we have an extensive plan to refresh our current restaurants and still plan to open between 150 to 175 new restaurants this year.
Wherever we have critical mass, at reimaged restaurants we're seeing improved perception of our brand and higher sales and returns. As in Australia, where many of our brand perception scores have increased over the last three years, and we've delivered a three-year return on incremental invested capital of more than 60%. We feel this initiative will set the stage to take the McDonald's brand well into the future.
The strength of the brand is also dependent on great service. Through innovative technology and better training of our people, we will continue to enhance the experience of our customers. 
APMEA continues to lead the way, generating our top customer satisfaction scores year-to-date. In particular, China and Japan are truly differentiating our brand on service, with Japan achieving its best satisfaction scores ever earlier this year. 
The U.S. and Europe have also continued to make great progress on improving their customer satisfaction scores. This is a key measure that we pay very close attention to in order to ensure we are getting better at being better.
The key to Europe results have been the nearly full implementation of our bridge operating platform which creates a better organized kitchen, increases capacity and puts less pressure on the crew through simplified operations. It's now in nearly 90% of our European restaurants and it enables us to expand our menu variety, at the same time improving our customer service. 
Finally, we're leveraging greater convenience in daypart expansion to continue to drive growth. In the U.S., more than 1/3 of our restaurants are now open 24 hours. And we know there are opportunities to do more. In addition, nearly 80% of our stores are now open by 5:00 a.m., continuing to add to the comp for that particular daypart.
In APMEA, convenience remains a key driver of our business. Our McDonald's Delivery Service now operates in 19 countries throughout the region and contributed to measurable comp growth in China, Hong Kong and Korea. Our continued expansion of 24-hour service drove sales in Japan and Australia. Improvements in drive-thru execution across all markets have led to greater capacity and cash flow.
Meanwhile, we've now made breakfast available in 75% of our restaurants in APMEA. And we are excited about the tremendous opportunity that breakfast provides. So those are a few highlights of how the momentum is continuing this year. 
We are delivering the food and beverages our customers want, the value that they expect and an overall dining experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers' lives. We are committed to our business plans and our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. 
We have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry, allowing us to access capital and help facilitate Owner/Operators to obtain the credit they need to reinvest in their restaurants. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we've returned $1 billion to shareholders.
Overall, I'm very pleased by our first quarter performance and confident that we will continue to achieve strong results. What I've experienced at this week's meeting is encouraging and motivating. Our entire system is determined to get even better at all we deliver to keep McDonald's moving forward. The optimism, confidence and alignment is truly inspiring and will continue. Thank you. And now I'll introduce Pete Bensen, our CFO."

As I walk our convention floor and visit with people this week, it's even more clear to me that the system alignment behind our Plan to Win is the fuel that continues to drive increased sales, guests counts, cash flow and market share around the world. 
Owner/Operators, suppliers and company employees are focused on satisfying the evolving needs of our customers by delivering unbeatable value, menu choice and convenience in a contemporary environment every day in our restaurants. These collective efforts resulted in first quarter as reported operating income growth of 20% to nearly $1.7 billion. Every area of the world contributed with top line sales growth, effective management of expenses and strong margin performance. As a result, combined operating margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 30%.
U.S. company operating margins rose 210 basis points to 20.4%, primarily due to lower food and paper cost, and to a lesser extent, the impact of re-franchising. For a perspective, the last time the quarterly U.S. company operating margin exceeded 20.4% was second quarter 1994, nearly 16 years ago.
We continued to experience lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter as our basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 5%. This compares to the 6.7% increase in first quarter 2009. For the full year 2010, our commodity outlook in the U.S. is favorable with costs expected to be down 2% to 3%.
Lower food and paper costs have allowed us to continue to grow margins, while holding the line on price increases. We remain focused on building traffic, which is critical to growing our market share over the long term.
Regarding Europe, company operating margins increased 200 basis points in the first quarter to 17.3%. Strong comparable sales in France, Russia, the U.K., and many other markets, as well as lower commodity costs, were partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. Cross-currency pressures on imports in Russia and Eastern Europe have eased since last year, which also benefited margins.
Europe's grocery bill also declined also 5% in the quarter, and for the full year we expect commodity costs to be down slightly. In APMEA, company operating margins increased 220 basis points, also driven by lower commodity costs, operating efficiencies and positive comparable sales.
Turning to franchise margins, we continue to benefit from a more franchised structure as first quarter franchised margin dollars rose to nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency, driven in part by system-wide sales growth of 6%. 
The consolidated franchise margin percent declined slightly, yet remained strong at 81.2%. Our positive global comparable sales were offset by higher depreciation cost in the U.S. and the impact of re-franchising. In addition, the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar in the first quarter of 2010 negatively impacted the mix of APMEA's franchise margin. 
The final factor in our combined operating margin is G&A control. First quarter G&A increased in total dollars but improved slightly as a percentage of revenues. This was in line with our internal expectations. As I mentioned on January's call, the timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention will impact quarterly comparisons this year. We still expect full year 2010 G&A to be up slightly on an as-reported basis and relatively flat in constant currencies.
As a system, we continue to concentrate on initiatives and assets that grow our business over the long term. Where necessary, tough decisions are being made to close certain capacity constrained sites. Japan, our 50% owned affiliate decided to close approximately 430 restaurants with lower volumes and returns by midyear 2011. Accordingly, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $30 million after tax or $0.03 per share. We expect minimal additional charges for the remainder of the year, so we are revising downward the total estimate for these costs in 2010 from $40 million to $50 million to less than $40 million.
Somewhat offsetting the impairment charges in Japan were about $30 million in gains in our U.S. business from the dissolution of a few of our joint partnerships. These gains were reflected in other operating income. This is a continuation of our broader efforts to optimize our ownership mix, to leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of our proven Owner/Operators and enhance our portfolio of company-operated restaurants.
While pruning underperforming assets in certain markets and continuing ownership optimization certainly makes us stronger, we are also focused on the opportunity to build future returns and enhance long-term shareholder value with new restaurant development and reimaging of our existing restaurants.
Reimaging has contributed to sustaining momentum and outstanding returns in France, Australia and other markets that have a significant percentage of contemporary restaurants. Fresh, new-looking restaurants help to retain existing customers, while attracting new ones. They also enhance our ability to introduce more premium offerings. Australia's recent success with the Angus burger is a testament to that.
We believe the timing for expanding our reimaging efforts is ideal. Put simply, together with our franchisees, we are investing on a scale that cannot be matched. We plan to reimage over 2,000 locations this year. About half of those will be in Europe, another 600 in APMEA, with the remaining 400 to 500 locations in the U.S.
The opportunity to update our brand is significant. Globally, only about 20% of our exteriors reflect our current contemporary look. Approximately twice as many interiors, or about 40% have been updated. Therefore, the majority of our restaurants do not yet have a contemporary look on either the inside or the outside. In general, Europe is farther along than either the U.S. or APMEA, particularly with interior reimaging.  The combination of both an exterior and interior reimage produces the most significant sales lifts, so that will be our plan going forward.
In the U.S. the first 400 to 500 reimage sites will tend to be older, higher volume locations, where permitting time is reasonable, and we either own the land or have significantly lease term remaining. Geographically, we expect them to be fairly dispersed around the country with about 20 restaurants in each of our 22 regions. And in addition to our reimaging efforts, we will rebuild over 150 restaurants in the U.S. this year.
We are co-investing with our Owner/Operators on the reimaging effort in a similar manner as we have in the past. We expect our investment per restaurant will be in the range of $150,000 to $200,000 depending on the scope of the remodel. Our Owner/Operators will contribute the remaining $250,000 to $500,000. The total reimaging cost per restaurant will vary considerably depending on the age of the building, whether any previously updating has occurred, maintenance and repair needs and compliance with local zoning requirements, such as interior sprinklers, lighting, signage and accessibility. We have seen an average sales lift above overall market performance of at least 6% to 7%, so we expect the returns from reimaging to be good for both the company and our Owner/Operators.
Lastly, I would like to update you on currency translation. Our currency benefit came in at the low end of expectations that we provided on our call in January. While the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro and the British pound over the last two months, this was mostly offset by improved operating performance, particularly in markets like Australia and Russia, where currencies remain more stable. And having approximately 45% of our total debt denominated in foreign currency also provides a hedge against volatility. 
Based on current exchange rates and business outlooks, we expect the comparisons will begin to turn negative in the second half of the year. But for the full year, currency translation is expected to provide a slight benefit. We recognize this estimate becomes outdated within days, but at least it gives you some perspective at today's rates.
McDonald's first quarter numbers are a testament to the alignment of our system around growing both top and bottom line results in a challenging environment. McDonald's continues to gain strength. And looking ahead, my experience this week with the franchisees here at our Owner/Operator Convention gives me more confidence that we can do even better as the economy improves. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

I don't believe that the spending levels are going to get back to a pre-recession until people have some confidence over the fact that they're going to have a place to go to work and put food on the table at home or away from home. And I think that's going to continue to be an issue. And I believe that the results that we're achieving are a result of our strategies around the value orientation of our menu. It is absolutely continuing to be the most important thing relative to our customers, and that is everyday affordability. And yet, of course, we continue to grow guest counts during this very difficult time. And have opportunity for them to partake of value across the menu even in our premium sandwiches. So I think it's as much our strategies as it is the confidence of the QSR consumer."

The one thing that they really focused on to your point, is beginning to expand drive-thrus, but I think we're learning how to do it even more effectively, and being able to develop drive-thrus in the outer rings, as we call it, where you have a little less density and you have a little bit more car traffic coming into the more urban areas. And so the drive-thru part of that focus is a great big focus around the transportation hubs there, tremendous amount of density and the potential for us to continue to grow the business. And so the combination of those two things really are a major part of our strategy and also the building of more freestanding restaurants. And so in China, great strategy. We've beefed-up our infrastructure. We're driving stronger margins. We're running better restaurants. Some of the lowest customer satisfaction opportunities that we have within a system, which means really great operations. And so all of those things are helping us in China.

And it's all about for us trying to provide some stability and predictability in the prices. It's important to be able to go to Owner/Operators and talk about what promotions we're going to be running six or nine months from now and have them feel confident that they have some idea of what the cost of those items are going to be. So in times like this, when you're starting to see maybe the commodity markets take off a little bit, these tactics allow us to mitigate the impact on our margins and our commodity cost.

This is the first time that we've officially given guidance on what those costs are going to be. I know there's been some estimates out there and stuff, but the range -- we wanted to get across the point that there isn't going to be -- it's going to be hard to come up with an average remodel, when you look across 6,000 restaurants in the U.S. system, varying ages, varying sizes and individual Owner/Operator decisions that they make in terms of what they want to invest in. So there's going to be the specific items that we know are going to really enhance the brand, and there can be other items that an Operator may take the opportunity to invest in at the time. So I was visiting with some Owner/Operators about a month ago, and while they were doing the remodel of both the interior and the exterior, they chose to do a replacement of their HVAC and to basically redo their whole parking lot instead of just reseal it, because they knew that was coming up in a couple years anyway and they take the opportunity to do it right now. So you are going to see a wide range of spending. But ideally, I'd like to say the average would be in the middle, but that's really hard to say. When you look at the sales lift from these, the fact that we do the combination of the interior and the exterior, we're getting a bigger sales lift than if we just did the interior. And this is a lift, if you think about the environment we're in, John, sales are strong and we're getting a lift above the general market in addition to that. So as we look at it and pencil it out, even at some of the higher ends of our contributions and the lower end of the sales increases, we're seeing returns in the low double digits as a first year cash-on-cash return that we know will grow from there. So we feel pretty confident about that and that the level of investment and the sales expectations will warrant this level of investment. For April, what we said in the release was that we expect April to be at least as strong as the quarter on a global basis. So what we're setting there is a floor, saying that it won't be any lower than 4.2% is what our expectation is."

We're [audio gap] Small Businesses as franchisees, as you all know, as I just mentioned. And the impact's going to vary across those franchisees. There's so many moving parts now. When you do the math, it's difficult to figure out exactly where it might settle because we're just into the implementation process now. It will vary by the number of employees that are full-time for each franchisee. And then the Bill of course has some things in it that have been beneficial for us, whether it's a 90-day waiting period before employers are required to enroll employees, which is very important for us because sometimes it takes 90 days for us to realize whether or not a person is going to be a full-time employee for us or whether they want to be a full-time employee for us. So that'll be helpful in the overall implementation. And yes, we've taken a shot at the math like a lot of other people, and we think in the U.S. it might be $10,000 to $30,000 per store. So to be determined. We don't really have it sorted it out yet. I really don't think anybody really does. Relative to the corporate level, there's really going to be minimal impact for us. You've seen other companies come out who've had legacy cost because of retiree health benefits. We don't have that problem. We have about 100 retirees that are in our program. They pay full premium, including prescription rebates. And so we don't have that legacy problem. And therefore, you won't be seeing any negative impact relative to the overall corporate coffers, if you will, relative to our overall situation, which is a very good thing.

We'll have some, what we call, sales transfer as we close these restaurants. So other restaurants in the market will pick up sales, and those are the higher performing operations. So we'll see a slight benefit in our earnings from the ongoing operations there in Japan. But the real benefit of doing that was we had this group of restaurants that were constrained for future growth, they weren't really representative of where the Japanese team wanted to take the brand in the future, and so it's really more positive going forward about the estate and the group of restaurants that we have, which ultimately leads to better operating results and performance."

And we continue to be aggressive around the development of menu and wouldn't expect that we'll see any failures along the way."

I'm joining you from our McDonald's Worldwide owner/operator Convention in Orlando.

I'm joining you from our McDonald's Worldwide owner/operator Convention in Orlando. Every two years, we bring together our franchisees from around the world, and along with a number of our suppliers and company employees, we celebrate our success. But mostly, we calibrate about our future. 
Well, we're in the middle of it now, and it's been a tremendous week so far. From the convention floor to our business meetings, we are focused on operations, menu, reinvestment and building this great brand. We're sharing ideas and learning from each other, further strengthening our alignment, which I know is critical to our future success. We're energized and confident about what we're doing regarding our business in taking our business to the next level.
So as we come together and look ahead, I'm proud of the results we achieved this quarter. Global comparable sales were up 4.2%, operating income increased 13% in constant currency and earnings per share reached $1, a 9% increase in constant currency. Our success continues to be a system-wide effort, driven by strong results in each area of the world.
In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter increased 1.5% and operating income grew 12%. Comparable sales in Europe rose 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currencies. And in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 5.7% with operating income rising 9% in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing into April with comparable sales trending positive across all of our geographies.
We are now into our seventh year of positive comp sales growth in every part of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevance of our Plan to Win business strategy. Guided by the plan, we continue to focus on differentiating our brand through common business drivers: menu variety and beverage choice; better restaurant operations; convenience in daypart expansion; everyday predictable low prices; and ongoing restaurant reinvestment. 
On all of these fronts, we're improving and we're innovating. As a result, we're growing our business and widening our market share lead around the world. Together, we're aligned around these drivers and delivering them in the most locally relevant ways. 
Regarding menu, we made gains by promoting our iconic core products, while delivering new food and beverage news. In the U.S., a strong Olympic-themed promotion helped ignite our Chicken McNuggets sales and drove sustained sales growth across our entire Chicken category. 
Our new product news included Mac Snack Wrap, with all the great taste of Big Mac in a portable wrap, which has helped lift the entire Snack Wrap line or category across the menu. 
Looking ahead, the U.S. is continuing the expansion of its McCafé line with the introduction of frappes and smoothies. Frappes now are in about 90% of the U.S. restaurants and are already exceeding expectations, and that's without any national advertising. And later this summer, we will be launching wild berry and strawberry banana smoothies. 
With these new additions, we're becoming even more of a beverage destination, serving familiar and popular drinks with the quality, convenience and value that only McDonald's can provide.
Looking at Europe, we continued to delight customers and drive sales with our fourth tier menu offerings, which deliver a popular option of smaller premium affordable sandwiches. Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany have both delivered solid sales results. And our latest line of Petit Plaisirs in France has exceeded expectations. 
Europe is also driving momentum with its premium offerings, from the Big Tasty in France and the Chicken Bacon Onion Sandwich in the U.K. to the launch of McItaly burgers which have performed strongly across our Italian market. 
In APMEA, Japan has driven sales with its recent line of American-themed burgers. In addition, a number of markets are rolling out extensive campaigns to elevate our core products, including the upcoming launch of our Quarter Pounder in Singapore. We also continue to offer strong value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for branded affordability.
In China, we've maintained our popular value lunch, which is driving guest counts and sales. In the U.S., we launched our Dollar Menu at Breakfast to provide the kind of everyday predictable value our customers expect from us. As a result, we've reinvigorated this vital daypart and experienced strong sales and guest count growth into the first quarter. 
Meanwhile, everyday affordability and pricing from our value menus remains a strong traffic driver across Europe. And year-to-date, our Extra Value Meals throughout Europe have been extremely robust. Italy saw 30% increases as they supported the Big Mac, while France experienced strong Extra Value Meal growth, and the U.K. Germany and Spain also achieved strong results.
So we're continuing to drive traffic as we connect with consumers through core menu favorites, new food news and the most relevant value offerings. And we're complementing it with even better all-around restaurant experience, from how our restaurants look, to how they are operated, to the convenience they provide in our customers' daily lives. 
Now as many of you know, we have a system-wide effort to reimage and modernize our locations inside and out. Australia and Europe have led the way, and our other geographies have seen the benefits and are leveraging these learnings. 
In the U.S., over the past few years, we've refreshed about 1/3 of our restaurants with an emphasis on the interior. This year, the U.S. will reimage 400 to 500 restaurants concentrating on both the interior and exterior. In China, where we're celebrating our 20th anniversary, we have an extensive plan to refresh our current restaurants and still plan to open between 150 to 175 new restaurants this year.
Wherever we have critical mass, at reimaged restaurants we're seeing improved perception of our brand and higher sales and returns. As in Australia, where many of our brand perception scores have increased over the last three years, and we've delivered a three-year return on incremental invested capital of more than 60%. We feel this initiative will set the stage to take the McDonald's brand well into the future.
The strength of the brand is also dependent on great service. Through innovative technology and better training of our people, we will continue to enhance the experience of our customers. 
APMEA continues to lead the way, generating our top customer satisfaction scores year-to-date. In particular, China and Japan are truly differentiating our brand on service, with Japan achieving its best satisfaction scores ever earlier this year. 
The U.S. and Europe have also continued to make great progress on improving their customer satisfaction scores. This is a key measure that we pay very close attention to in order to ensure we are getting better at being better.
The key to Europe results have been the nearly full implementation of our bridge operating platform which creates a better organized kitchen, increases capacity and puts less pressure on the crew through simplified operations. It's now in nearly 90% of our European restaurants and it enables us to expand our menu variety, at the same time improving our customer service. 
Finally, we're leveraging greater convenience in daypart expansion to continue to drive growth. In the U.S., more than 1/3 of our restaurants are now open 24 hours. And we know there are opportunities to do more. In addition, nearly 80% of our stores are now open by 5:00 a.m., continuing to add to the comp for that particular daypart.
In APMEA, convenience remains a key driver of our business. Our McDonald's Delivery Service now operates in 19 countries throughout the region and contributed to measurable comp growth in China, Hong Kong and Korea. Our continued expansion of 24-hour service drove sales in Japan and Australia. Improvements in drive-thru execution across all markets have led to greater capacity and cash flow.
Meanwhile, we've now made breakfast available in 75% of our restaurants in APMEA. And we are excited about the tremendous opportunity that breakfast provides. So those are a few highlights of how the momentum is continuing this year. 
We are delivering the food and beverages our customers want, the value that they expect and an overall dining experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers' lives. We are committed to our business plans and our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. 
We have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry, allowing us to access capital and help facilitate owner/operators to obtain the credit they need to reinvest in their restaurants. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we've returned $1 billion to shareholders.
Overall, I'm very pleased by our first quarter performance and confident that we will continue to achieve strong results. What I've experienced at this week's meeting is encouraging and motivating. Our entire system is determined to get even better at all we deliver to keep McDonald's moving forward. The optimism, confidence and alignment is truly inspiring and will continue. Thank you. And now I'll introduce Pete Bensen, our CFO."

As I walk our convention floor and visit with people this week, it's even more clear to me that the system alignment behind our Plan to Win is the fuel that continues to drive increased sales, guests counts, cash flow and market share around the world. 
owner/operators, suppliers and company employees are focused on satisfying the evolving needs of our customers by delivering unbeatable value, menu choice and convenience in a contemporary environment every day in our restaurants. These collective efforts resulted in first quarter as reported operating income growth of 20% to nearly $1.7 billion. Every area of the world contributed with top line sales growth, effective management of expenses and strong margin performance. As a result, combined operating margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 30%.
U.S. company operating margins rose 210 basis points to 20.4%, primarily due to lower food and paper cost, and to a lesser extent, the impact of re-franchising. For a perspective, the last time the quarterly U.S. company operating margin exceeded 20.4% was second quarter 1994, nearly 16 years ago.
We continued to experience lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter as our basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 5%. This compares to the 6.7% increase in first quarter 2009. For the full year 2010, our commodity outlook in the U.S. is favorable with costs expected to be down 2% to 3%.
Lower food and paper costs have allowed us to continue to grow margins, while holding the line on price increases. We remain focused on building traffic, which is critical to growing our market share over the long term.
Regarding Europe, company operating margins increased 200 basis points in the first quarter to 17.3%. Strong comparable sales in France, Russia, the U.K., and many other markets, as well as lower commodity costs, were partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. Cross-currency pressures on imports in Russia and Eastern Europe have eased since last year, which also benefited margins.
Europe's grocery bill also declined also 5% in the quarter, and for the full year we expect commodity costs to be down slightly. In APMEA, company operating margins increased 220 basis points, also driven by lower commodity costs, operating efficiencies and positive comparable sales.
Turning to franchise margins, we continue to benefit from a more franchised structure as first quarter franchised margin dollars rose to nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency, driven in part by system-wide sales growth of 6%. 
The consolidated franchise margin percent declined slightly, yet remained strong at 81.2%. Our positive global comparable sales were offset by higher depreciation cost in the U.S. and the impact of re-franchising. In addition, the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar in the first quarter of 2010 negatively impacted the mix of APMEA's franchise margin. 
The final factor in our combined operating margin is G&A control. First quarter G&A increased in total dollars but improved slightly as a percentage of revenues. This was in line with our internal expectations. As I mentioned on January's call, the timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biennial Worldwide owner/operator Convention will impact quarterly comparisons this year. We still expect full year 2010 G&A to be up slightly on an as-reported basis and relatively flat in constant currencies.
As a system, we continue to concentrate on initiatives and assets that grow our business over the long term. Where necessary, tough decisions are being made to close certain capacity constrained sites. Japan, our 50% owned affiliate decided to close approximately 430 restaurants with lower volumes and returns by midyear 2011. Accordingly, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $30 million after tax or $0.03 per share. We expect minimal additional charges for the remainder of the year, so we are revising downward the total estimate for these costs in 2010 from $40 million to $50 million to less than $40 million.
Somewhat offsetting the impairment charges in Japan were about $30 million in gains in our U.S. business from the dissolution of a few of our joint partnerships. These gains were reflected in other operating income. This is a continuation of our broader efforts to optimize our ownership mix, to leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of our proven owner/operators and enhance our portfolio of company-operated restaurants.
While pruning underperforming assets in certain markets and continuing ownership optimization certainly makes us stronger, we are also focused on the opportunity to build future returns and enhance long-term shareholder value with new restaurant development and reimaging of our existing restaurants.
Reimaging has contributed to sustaining momentum and outstanding returns in France, Australia and other markets that have a significant percentage of contemporary restaurants. Fresh, new-looking restaurants help to retain existing customers, while attracting new ones. They also enhance our ability to introduce more premium offerings. Australia's recent success with the Angus burger is a testament to that.
We believe the timing for expanding our reimaging efforts is ideal. Put simply, together with our franchisees, we are investing on a scale that cannot be matched. We plan to reimage over 2,000 locations this year. About half of those will be in Europe, another 600 in APMEA, with the remaining 400 to 500 locations in the U.S.
The opportunity to update our brand is significant. Globally, only about 20% of our exteriors reflect our current contemporary look. Approximately twice as many interiors, or about 40% have been updated. Therefore, the majority of our restaurants do not yet have a contemporary look on either the inside or the outside. In general, Europe is farther along than either the U.S. or APMEA, particularly with interior reimaging.  The combination of both an exterior and interior reimage produces the most significant sales lifts so that will be our plan going forward.
In the U.S. the first 400 to 500 reimage sites will tend to be older, higher volume locations, where permitting time is reasonable, and we either own the land or have significant lease term remaining. Geographically, we expect them to be fairly dispersed around the country with about 20 restaurants in each of our 22 regions. And in addition to our reimaging efforts, we will rebuild over 150 restaurants in the U.S. this year.
We are co-investing with our owner/operators on the reimaging efforts in a similar manner as we have in the past. We expect our investment per restaurant will be in the range of $150,000 to $200,000 depending on the scope of the remodel. Our owner/operators will contribute the remaining $250,000 to $500,000. The total reimaging cost per restaurant will vary considerably depending on the age of the building, whether any previously updating has occurred, maintenance and repair needs, and compliance with local zoning requirements, such as interior sprinklers, lighting, signage and accessibility. We have seen an average sales lift above overall market performance of at least 6% to 7%, so we expect the returns from reimaging to be good for both the company and our owner/operators.
Lastly, I would like to update you on currency translation. Our currency benefit came in at the low end of expectations that we provided on our call in January. While the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro and the British pound over the last two months, this was mostly offset by improved operating performance, particularly in markets like Australia and Russia, where currencies remain more stable. And having approximately 45% of our total debt denominated in foreign currency also provides a hedge against volatility. 
Based on current exchange rates and business outlooks, we expect the comparisons will begin to turn negative in the second half of the year. But for the full year, currency translation is expected to provide a slight benefit. We recognize this estimate becomes outdated within days, but at least it gives you some perspective at today's rates.
McDonald's first quarter numbers are a testament to the alignment of our system around growing both top and bottom line results in a challenging environment. McDonald's continues to gain strength. And looking ahead, my experience this week with the franchisees here at our owner/operator Convention gives me more confidence that we can do even better as the economy improves. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

And I think that's going to continue to be an issue. And I believe that the results that we're achieving are a result of our strategies around the value orientation of our menu. It is absolutely continuing to be the most important thing relative to our customers, and that is everyday affordability.

Specific to drive-thru, and actually I'll talk a little broader about the development strategy in China first. The one thing that they really focused on to your point, is beginning to expand drive-thrus, but I think we're learning how to do it even more effectively, and being able to develop drive-thrus in the outer rings, as we call it, where you have a little less density and you have a little bit more car traffic coming into the more urban areas. And so the drive-thru part of that focus is a great big focus around the transportation hubs there, tremendous amount of density and the potential for us to continue to grow the business. And so the combination of those two things really are a major part of our strategy and also the building of more freestanding restaurants. And so in China, great strategy. We've beefed-up our infrastructure. We're driving stronger margins. We're running better restaurants. Some of the lowest customer satisfaction opportunities that we have within a system, which means really great operations. And so all of those things are helping us in China. And the drive-thru strategy is continuing; it will be a big growth target for us in China."

They work with some of our risk management people. And ultimately, though it's our independent suppliers that end up making these final decisions, but we do a combination of things. We do some fixed contracts, fixed-price contracts, after looking at markets and trying to anticipate what's going to happen. Do some forward buying, some options, and really through some of the long-term relationships are able to negotiate some pretty favorable pricing. And it's all about for us trying to provide some stability and predictability in the prices. It's important to be able to go to owner/operators and talk about what promotions we're going to be running six or nine months from now and have them feel confident that they have some idea of what the cost of those items are going to be. So in times like this, when you're starting to see maybe the commodity markets take off a little bit, these tactics allow us to mitigate the impact on our margins and our commodity cost. And again, there's no one item in our basket of goods that's more than 15% of our cost of sales. So it's spread amongst a broad base of items where we have the opportunity to be as opportunistic as we can."

It would seem that if the sales lift was about the same in prior remodels but the cost is higher, so the returns would be lower, if you can just check me on that.

This is the first time that we've officially given guidance on what those costs are going to be. I know there's been some estimates out there and stuff, but the range -- we wanted to get across the point that there isn't going to be -- it's going to be hard to come up with an average remodel, when you look across 6,000 restaurants in the U.S. system, varying ages, varying sizes and individual owner/operator decisions that they make in terms of what they want to invest in. So there's going to be the specific items that we know are going to really enhance the brand, and there can be other items that an Operator may take the opportunity to invest in at the time. So I was visiting with some owner/operators about a month ago, and while they were doing the remodel of both the interior and the exterior, they chose to do a replacement of their HVAC and to basically redo their whole parking lot instead of just reseal it, because they knew that was coming up in a couple years anyway and they take the opportunity to do it right now. So you are going to see a wide range of spending. But ideally, I'd like to say the average would be in the middle, but that's really hard to say. When you look at the sales lift from these, the fact that we do the combination of the interior and the exterior, we're getting a bigger sales lift than if we just did the interior. And this is a lift, if you think about the environment we're in, John, sales are strong and we're getting a lift above the general market in addition to that. So as we look at it and pencil it out, even at some of the higher ends of our contributions and the lower end of the sales increases, we're seeing returns in the low double digits as a first year cash-on-cash return that we know will grow from there. So we feel pretty confident about that and that the level of investment and the sales expectations will warrant this level of investment. For April, what we said in the release was that we expect April to be at least as strong as the quarter on a global basis. So what we're setting there is a floor, saying that it won't be any lower than 4.2% is what our expectation is."

First of all, as you all know, this is going to be implemented or mandated in 2014. So we've got a few years here to figure out what the direct impact might be to us. We're [audio gap] Small Businesses as franchisees, as you all know, as I just mentioned. And the impact's going to vary across those franchisees. There's so many moving parts now. When you do the math, it's difficult to figure out exactly where it might settle because we're just into the implementation process now. It will vary by the number of employees that are full-time for each franchisee. And then the Bill of course has some things in it that have been beneficial for us, whether it's a 90-day waiting period before employers are required to enroll employees, which is very important for us because sometimes it takes 90 days for us to realize whether or not a person is going to be a full-time employee for us or whether they want to be a full-time employee for us. So that'll be helpful in the overall implementation. And yes, we've taken a shot at the math like a lot of other people, and we think in the U.S. it might be $10,000 to $30,000 per store. So to be determined. We don't really have it sorted it out yet. I really don't think anybody really does. Relative to the corporate level, there's really going to be minimal impact for us. You've seen other companies come out who've had legacy cost because of retiree health benefits. We don't have that problem. We have about 100 retirees that are in our program. They pay full premium, including prescription rebates. And so we don't have that legacy problem. And therefore, you won't be seeing any negative impact relative to the overall corporate coffers, if you will, relative to our overall situation, which is a very good thing. We really are structured in a way with our 401(k)s and our profit sharing and all the other kinds of things, so we don't have any of those legacy issues that many companies have, and we're very fortunate."

We'll have some, what we call, sales transfer as we close these restaurants. So other restaurants in the market will pick up sales, and those are the higher performing operations. So we'll see a slight benefit in our earnings from the ongoing operations there in Japan. But the real benefit of doing that was we had this group of restaurants that were constrained for future growth, they weren't really representative of where the Japanese team wanted to take the brand in the future, and so it's really more positive going forward about the estate and the group of restaurants that we have, which ultimately leads to better operating results and performance."

We're sharing ideas and learning from each other, further strengthening our alignment, which I know is critical to our future success. We're energized and confident about what we're doing regarding our business in taking our business to the next level.
So as we come together and look ahead, I'm proud of the results we achieved this quarter. Global comparable sales were up 4.2%, operating income increased 13% in constant currency and earnings per share reached $1, a 9% increase in constant currency. Our success continues to be a system-wide effort, driven by strong results in each area of the world.
In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter increased 1.5% and operating income grew 12%. Comparable sales in Europe rose 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currencies. And in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 5.7% with operating income rising 9% in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing into April with comparable sales trending positive across all of our geographies.
We are now into our seventh year of positive comp sales growth in every part of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevance of our Plan to Win business strategy. Guided by the plan, we continue to focus on differentiating our brand through common business drivers: menu variety and beverage choice; better restaurant operations; convenience in daypart expansion; everyday predictable low prices; and ongoing restaurant reinvestment. 
On all of these fronts, we're improving and we're innovating. As a result, we're growing our business and widening our market share lead around the world. Together, we're aligned around these drivers and delivering them in the most locally relevant ways. 
Regarding menu, we made gains by promoting our iconic core products, while delivering new food and beverage news. In the U.S., a strong Olympic-themed promotion helped ignite our Chicken McNuggets sales and drove sustained sales growth across our entire Chicken category. 
Our new product news included Mac Snack Wrap, with all the great taste of Big Mac in a portable wrap, which has helped lift the entire Snack Wrap line or category across the menu. 
Looking ahead, the U.S. is continuing the expansion of its McCafé line with the introduction of frappes and smoothies. Frappes now are in about 90% of the U.S. restaurants and are already exceeding expectations, and that's without any national advertising. And later this summer, we will be launching wild berry and strawberry banana smoothies. 
With these new additions, we're becoming even more of a beverage destination, serving familiar and popular drinks with the quality, convenience and value that only McDonald's can provide.
Looking at Europe, we continued to delight customers and drive sales with our fourth tier menu offerings, which deliver a popular option of smaller premium affordable sandwiches. Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany have both delivered solid sales results. And our latest line of Petit Plaisirs in France has exceeded expectations. 
Europe is also driving momentum with its premium offerings, from the Big Tasty in France and the Chicken Bacon Onion Sandwich in the U.K. to the launch of McItaly burgers which have performed strongly across our Italian market. 
In APMEA, Japan has driven sales with its recent line of American-themed burgers. In addition, a number of markets are rolling out extensive campaigns to elevate our core products, including the upcoming launch of our Quarter Pounder in Singapore. We also continue to offer strong value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for branded affordability.
In China, we've maintained our popular value lunch, which is driving guest counts and sales. In the U.S., we launched our Dollar Menu at Breakfast to provide the kind of everyday predictable value our customers expect from us. As a result, we've reinvigorated this vital daypart and experienced strong sales and guest count growth into the first quarter. 
Meanwhile, everyday affordability and pricing from our value menus remains a strong traffic driver across Europe. And year-to-date, our Extra Value Meals throughout Europe have been extremely robust. Italy saw 30% increases as they supported the Big Mac, while France experienced strong Extra Value Meal growth, and the U.K. Germany and Spain also achieved strong results.
So we're continuing to drive traffic as we connect with consumers through core menu favorites, new food news and the most relevant value offerings. And we're complementing it with even better all-around restaurant experience, from how our restaurants look, to how they are operated, to the convenience they provide in our customers' daily lives. 
Now as many of you know, we have a system-wide effort to reimage and modernize our locations inside and out. Australia and Europe have led the way, and our other geographies have seen the benefits and are leveraging these learnings. 
In the U.S., over the past few years, we've refreshed about 1/3 of our restaurants with an emphasis on the interior. This year, the U.S. will reimage 400 to 500 restaurants concentrating on both the interior and exterior. In China, where we're celebrating our 20th anniversary, we have an extensive plan to refresh our current restaurants and still plan to open between 150 to 175 new restaurants this year.
Wherever we have critical mass, at reimaged restaurants we're seeing improved perception of our brand and higher sales and returns. As in Australia, where many of our brand perception scores have increased over the last three years, and we've delivered a three-year return on incremental invested capital of more than 60%. We feel this initiative will set the stage to take the McDonald's brand well into the future.
The strength of the brand is also dependent on great service. Through innovative technology and better training of our people, we will continue to enhance the experience of our customers. 
APMEA continues to lead the way, generating our top customer satisfaction scores year-to-date. In particular, China and Japan are truly differentiating our brand on service, with Japan achieving its best satisfaction scores ever earlier this year. 
The U.S. and Europe have also continued to make great progress on improving their customer satisfaction scores. This is a key measure that we pay very close attention to in order to ensure we are getting better at being better.
The key to Europe results have been the nearly full implementation of our bridge operating platform which creates a better organized kitchen, increases capacity and puts less pressure on the crew through simplified operations. It's now in nearly 90% of our European restaurants and it enables us to expand our menu variety, at the same time improving our customer service. 
Finally, we're leveraging greater convenience in daypart expansion to continue to drive growth. In the U.S., more than 1/3 of our restaurants are now open 24 hours. And we know there are opportunities to do more. In addition, nearly 80% of our stores are now open by 5:00 a.m., continuing to add to the comp for that particular daypart.
In APMEA, convenience remains a key driver of our business. Our McDonald's Delivery Service now operates in 19 countries throughout the region and contributed to measurable comp growth in China, Hong Kong and Korea. Our continued expansion of 24-hour service drove sales in Japan and Australia. Improvements in drive-thru execution across all markets have led to greater capacity and cash flow.
Meanwhile, we've now made breakfast available in 75% of our restaurants in APMEA. And we are excited about the tremendous opportunity that breakfast provides. So those are a few highlights of how the momentum is continuing this year. 
We are delivering the food and beverages our customers want, the value that they expect and an overall dining experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers' lives. We are committed to our business plans and our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. 
We have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry, allowing us to access capital and help facilitate owner/operators to obtain the credit they need to reinvest in their restaurants. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we've returned $1 billion to shareholders.
Overall, I'm very pleased by our first quarter performance and confident that we will continue to achieve strong results. What I've experienced at this week's meeting is encouraging and motivating. Our entire system is determined to get even better at all we deliver to keep McDonald's moving forward. The optimism, confidence and alignment is truly inspiring and will continue. Thank you. And now I'll introduce Pete Bensen, our CFO."

As I walk our convention floor and visit with people this week, it's even more clear to me that the system alignment behind our Plan to Win is the fuel that continues to drive increased sales, guests counts, cash flow and market share around the world. 
owner/operators, suppliers and company employees are focused on satisfying the evolving needs of our customers by delivering unbeatable value, menu choice and convenience in a contemporary environment every day in our restaurants. These collective efforts resulted in first quarter as reported operating income growth of 20% to nearly $1.7 billion. Every area of the world contributed with top line sales growth, effective management of expenses and strong margin performance. As a result, combined operating margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 30%.
U.S. company operating margins rose 210 basis points to 20.4%, primarily due to lower food and paper cost, and to a lesser extent, the impact of re-franchising. For a perspective, the last time the quarterly U.S. company operating margin exceeded 20.4% was second quarter 1994, nearly 16 years ago.
We continued to experience lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter as our basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 5%. This compares to the 6.7% increase in first quarter 2009. For the full year 2010, our commodity outlook in the U.S. is favorable with costs expected to be down 2% to 3%.
Lower food and paper costs have allowed us to continue to grow margins, while holding the line on price increases. We remain focused on building traffic, which is critical to growing our market share over the long term.
Regarding Europe, company operating margins increased 200 basis points in the first quarter to 17.3%. Strong comparable sales in France, Russia, the U.K., and many other markets, as well as lower commodity costs, were partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. Cross-currency pressures on imports in Russia and Eastern Europe have eased since last year, which also benefited margins.
Europe's grocery bill also declined also 5% in the quarter, and for the full year we expect commodity costs to be down slightly. In APMEA, company operating margins increased 220 basis points, also driven by lower commodity costs, operating efficiencies and positive comparable sales.
Turning to franchise margins, we continue to benefit from a more franchised structure as first quarter franchised margin dollars rose to nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency, driven in part by system-wide sales growth of 6%. 
The consolidated franchise margin percent declined slightly, yet remained strong at 81.2%. Our positive global comparable sales were offset by higher depreciation cost in the U.S. and the impact of re-franchising. In addition, the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar in the first quarter of 2010 negatively impacted the mix of APMEA's franchise margin. 
The final factor in our combined operating margin is G&A control. First quarter G&A increased in total dollars but improved slightly as a percentage of revenues. This was in line with our internal expectations. As I mentioned on January's call, the timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biennial Worldwide owner/operator Convention will impact quarterly comparisons this year. We still expect full year 2010 G&A to be up slightly on an as-reported basis and relatively flat in constant currencies.
As a system, we continue to concentrate on initiatives and assets that grow our business over the long term. Where necessary, tough decisions are being made to close certain capacity constrained sites. Japan, our 50% owned affiliate decided to close approximately 430 restaurants with lower volumes and returns by midyear 2011. Accordingly, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $30 million after tax or $0.03 per share. We expect minimal additional charges for the remainder of the year, so we are revising downward the total estimate for these costs in 2010 from $40 million to $50 million to less than $40 million.
Somewhat offsetting the impairment charges in Japan were about $30 million in gains in our U.S. business from the dissolution of a few of our joint partnerships. These gains were reflected in other operating income. This is a continuation of our broader efforts to optimize our ownership mix, to leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of our proven owner/operators and enhance our portfolio of company-operated restaurants.
While pruning underperforming assets in certain markets and continuing ownership optimization certainly makes us stronger, we are also focused on the opportunity to build future returns and enhance long-term shareholder value with new restaurant development and reimaging of our existing restaurants.
Reimaging has contributed to sustaining momentum and outstanding returns in France, Australia and other markets that have a significant percentage of contemporary restaurants. Fresh, new-looking restaurants help to retain existing customers, while attracting new ones. They also enhance our ability to introduce more premium offerings. Australia's recent success with the Angus burger is a testament to that.
We believe the timing for expanding our reimaging efforts is ideal. Put simply, together with our franchisees, we are investing on a scale that cannot be matched. We plan to reimage over 2,000 locations this year. About half of those will be in Europe, another 600 in APMEA, with the remaining 400 to 500 locations in the U.S.
The opportunity to update our brand is significant. Globally, only about 20% of our exteriors reflect our current contemporary look. Approximately twice as many interiors, or about 40% have been updated. Therefore, the majority of our restaurants do not yet have a contemporary look on either the inside or the outside. In general, Europe is farther along than either the U.S. or APMEA, particularly with interior reimaging.  The combination of both an exterior and interior reimage produces the most significant sales lifts so that will be our plan going forward.
In the U.S. the first 400 to 500 reimage sites will tend to be older, higher volume locations, where permitting time is reasonable, and we either own the land or have significant lease term remaining. Geographically, we expect them to be fairly dispersed around the country with about 20 restaurants in each of our 22 regions. And in addition to our reimaging efforts, we will rebuild over 150 restaurants in the U.S. this year.
We are co-investing with our owner/operators on the reimaging efforts in a similar manner as we have in the past. We expect our investment per restaurant will be in the range of $150,000 to $200,000 depending on the scope of the remodel. Our owner/operators will contribute the remaining $250,000 to $500,000. The total reimaging cost per restaurant will vary considerably depending on the age of the building, whether any previously updating has occurred, maintenance and repair needs, and compliance with local zoning requirements, such as interior sprinklers, lighting, signage and accessibility. We have seen an average sales lift above overall market performance of at least 6% to 7%, so we expect the returns from reimaging to be good for both the company and our owner/operators.
Lastly, I would like to update you on currency translation. Our currency benefit came in at the low end of expectations that we provided on our call in January. While the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro and the British pound over the last two months, this was mostly offset by improved operating performance, particularly in markets like Australia and Russia, where currencies remain more stable. And having approximately 45% of our total debt denominated in foreign currency also provides a hedge against volatility. 
Based on current exchange rates and business outlooks, we expect the comparisons will begin to turn negative in the second half of the year. But for the full year, currency translation is expected to provide a slight benefit. We recognize this estimate becomes outdated within days, but at least it gives you some perspective at today's rates.
McDonald's first quarter numbers are a testament to the alignment of our system around growing both top and bottom line results in a challenging environment. McDonald's continues to gain strength. And looking ahead, my experience this week with the franchisees here at our owner/operator Convention gives me more confidence that we can do even better as the economy improves. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

And I think that's going to continue to be an issue. And I believe that the results that we're achieving are a result of our strategies around the value orientation of our menu. It is absolutely continuing to be the most important thing relative to our customers, and that is everyday affordability.

They work with some of our risk management people. And ultimately, though it's our independent suppliers that end up making these final decisions, but we do a combination of things. We do some fixed contracts, fixed-price contracts, after looking at markets and trying to anticipate what's going to happen. Do some forward buying, some options, and really through some of the long-term relationships are able to negotiate some pretty favorable pricing. And it's all about for us trying to provide some stability and predictability in the prices. It's important to be able to go to owner/operators and talk about what promotions we're going to be running six or nine months from now and have them feel confident that they have some idea of what the cost of those items are going to be. So in times like this, when you're starting to see maybe the commodity markets take off a little bit, these tactics allow us to mitigate the impact on our margins and our commodity cost. And again, there's no one item in our basket of goods that's more than 15% of our cost of sales. So it's spread amongst a broad base of items where we have the opportunity to be as opportunistic as we can."

Does that mean the average is in the middle or you think it's more at the lower end but you're just providing an upper end in special cases? And I guess, can you talk about the sales lift compared to the prior remodels? It would seem that if the sales lift was about the same in prior remodels but the cost is higher, so the returns would be lower, if you can just check me on that. And I can't leave the March comp question alone. You said April was better than the first quarter. Is April also better than March?"

This is the first time that we've officially given guidance on what those costs are going to be. I know there's been some estimates out there and stuff, but the range -- we wanted to get across the point that there isn't going to be -- it's going to be hard to come up with an average remodel, when you look across 6,000 restaurants in the U.S. system, varying ages, varying sizes and individual owner/operator decisions that they make in terms of what they want to invest in. So there's going to be the specific items that we know are going to really enhance the brand, and there can be other items that an Operator may take the opportunity to invest in at the time. So I was visiting with some owner/operators about a month ago, and while they were doing the remodel of both the interior and the exterior, they chose to do a replacement of their HVAC and to basically redo their whole parking lot instead of just reseal it, because they knew that was coming up in a couple years anyway and they take the opportunity to do it right now. So you are going to see a wide range of spending. But ideally, I'd like to say the average would be in the middle, but that's really hard to say. When you look at the sales lift from these, the fact that we do the combination of the interior and the exterior, we're getting a bigger sales lift than if we just did the interior. And this is a lift, if you think about the environment we're in, John, sales are strong and we're getting a lift above the general market in addition to that. So as we look at it and pencil it out, even at some of the higher ends of our contributions and the lower end of the sales increases, we're seeing returns in the low double digits as a first year cash-on-cash return that we know will grow from there. So we feel pretty confident about that and that the level of investment and the sales expectations will warrant this level of investment. For April, what we said in the release was that we expect April to be at least as strong as the quarter on a global basis. So what we're setting there is a floor, saying that it won't be any lower than 4.2% is what our expectation is."

First of all, as you all know, this is going to be implemented or mandated in 2014. So we've got a few years here to figure out what the direct impact might be to us. We're [audio gap] Small Businesses as franchisees, as you all know, as I just mentioned. And the impact's going to vary across those franchisees. There's so many moving parts now. When you do the math, it's difficult to figure out exactly where it might settle because we're just into the implementation process now. It will vary by the number of employees that are full-time for each franchisee. And then the Bill of course has some things in it that have been beneficial for us, whether it's a 90-day waiting period before employers are required to enroll employees, which is very important for us because sometimes it takes 90 days for us to realize whether or not a person is going to be a full-time employee for us or whether they want to be a full-time employee for us. So that'll be helpful in the overall implementation. And yes, we've taken a shot at the math like a lot of other people, and we think in the U.S. it might be $10,000 to $30,000 per store. So to be determined. We don't really have it sorted it out yet. I really don't think anybody really does. Relative to the corporate level, there's really going to be minimal impact for us. You've seen other companies come out who've had legacy cost because of retiree health benefits. We don't have that problem. We have about 100 retirees that are in our program. They pay full premium, including prescription rebates. And so we don't have that legacy problem. And therefore, you won't be seeing any negative impact relative to the overall corporate coffers, if you will, relative to our overall situation, which is a very good thing. We really are structured in a way with our 401(k)s and our profit sharing and all the other kinds of things, so we don't have any of those legacy issues that many companies have, and we're very fortunate."

We'll have some, what we call, sales transfer as we close these restaurants. So other restaurants in the market will pick up sales, and those are the higher performing operations. So we'll see a slight benefit in our earnings from the ongoing operations there in Japan. But the real benefit of doing that was we had this group of restaurants that were constrained for future growth, they weren't really representative of where the Japanese team wanted to take the brand in the future, and so it's really more positive going forward about the estate and the group of restaurants that we have, which ultimately leads to better operating results and performance."

I'm very pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, Global comparable sales were up 4.8%. Operating income increased 10%. And EPS reached $1.1",1622,"Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, Global comparable sales were up 4.8%. Operating income increased 10%. And EPS reached $1.13, a 15% increase. Now these results mark our 29th consecutive quarter of Global comparable sales growth, confirming the ongoing strength of McDonald's Plan to Win, and our ability to continue to meet and exceed our customers' needs. Our momentum is continuing into July with Global comparable sales trending in line with, or better than, second quarter sales. Our strength is broad-based as each area of the world is contributing to our growth. And we're growing share nearly everywhere in an informal eating-out market that varies from declining to slightly up.
Now as we move through the mid-year point, we remain confident in our strategies and we intend to work even harder to keep delivering for our customers. Since becoming Chief Operating Officer about six months ago, I made it a point to visit all of our major markets around the world, from Europe to Asia to Latin America, and right here in the USA. And across the system, I am so impressed with our people, with their energy and with their commitment to becoming the favorite place and way to eat and drink for even more customers.
Together, we’re focused on taking our business to that next level. And we’re aligned around our top priorities for getting us there. First, it's optimizing our menu and continuing to grow the business with the right combination of food and beverage choices. Next, modernizing the experience and elevating everything from how our restaurants look, feel and operate, to how customers engage with our brand. Third, broadening our accessibility to drive growth through greater convenience, value and service initiatives. And all of these things will be brought to life by well-trained, highly motivated crew and managers. We’re working to seize the biggest opportunities in all of these areas, executing in the most relevant and meaningful ways.
So let's begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 3.7% and operating income grew 7%. These are strong results in today's environment, where we still see nearly double-digit unemployment and low consumer confidence. And I'm very pleased with this momentum as we continue to take market share and increase guest counts, and on our operator cash flow. This is especially meaningful at a time when overall restaurant traffic is still down. We're connecting with consumers in delivering an experience that they’re finding more compelling than ever. The key sales drivers in the U.S. continue to be everyday value, relevant menu choice and greater convenience. 
Now we'll continue to see strong results from the Dollar Menu at breakfast, which was launched in January. It’s generating both solid growth in sales and guest counts during this all-important daypart. This summer, we've also brought back our $1 drink offerings on both fountain and tea beverages. This was a highly popular value proposition last year that provided a strong lift in beverage sales and we’re seeing positive results very early on.
On the menu front, we're achieving success through leveraging our popular core products, while also delivering relevant new offerings. The McDonald's Shrek Forever After promotion drove strong sales of McNuggets, while the launch of frappes in May has been a huge hit with consumers, contributing to higher sales across our entire coffee line. And this month, we rolled out Wild Berry and Strawberry Banana Real Fruit Smoothies, which are already exceeding expectations and creating a tremendous buzz in the marketplace. This is a product that our customers truly love.
Now looking ahead, we'll round out the summer with the introduction of the Angus Snack Wrap, elevating our Snack Wrap line and giving consumers another premium, On-The-Go offering. And on top of all of this, we’re broadening our accessibility and becoming even more convenient. More than 1/3 of our U.S. restaurants are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And we're devoting more staffing and resources to the 5:00 a.m. hour, adding to overall sales and guest count growth.
So let's switch over to Europe. Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currency. And while the overall IEO market in Europe continued its decline, we continue to increase our market share. Europe's overall strategy of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance remains a winning approach. Through the strategies, we're pulling the right levers to manage Europe's uncertain economic situation, and remain a compelling destination for customers.
The U.K. market again led the way with a strong comp sales increase for the quarter, driven by impactful marketing and a strong combination of menu variety and value offerings. Customers responded well to the U.K.'s World Cup promotion of Big Mac, Fries and other popular core items. And we also saw success with the Great Taste of America Sandwich promotion, featuring American-themed burgers with special breads and sauces. In addition, the Little Tasters line continues to deliver results and elevate our position as a leader in the area of first-rate, mid-tier value offerings.
Our French business also remains strong. We're continuing to upgrade our entire experience in France with compelling, relevant restaurant designs. And we’re succeeding with a strong line of premium chicken and beef products, as well as our smaller Petit Plaisir offerings. Meanwhile, the reintroduction of the Double Cheeseburger in France also drove strong sales.
In Germany, we achieved solid results for the quarter and continued to grow market share, further distancing ourselves from the competition. Our new McWraps and recent line of Snack Deluxe offerings, including chicken and beef barbecue, are performing well and give us a strong platform of choice and premium offerings. In addition, Germany's Easy Morning Breakfast campaign continued to perform well, driving sales during this daypart, which represents 5.5% of total sales.
Now let's turn now to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where as we call it, APMEA. Comparable sales for the quarter grew 4.6%, and operating income increased 9% in constant currency. Across this region, value, operations and menu are key drivers of growth. 
Taking a closer look at our main markets, Australia is maintaining strong momentum by leveraging its fully reimaged restaurants and Premium entree and snack items to delight customers. In addition, our recently launched Family Dinner Box is performing extremely well in Australia. It provides a combination of sandwiches, sides and drinks at a strong value proposition and is giving consumers a great option at dinner. It's exceeding our expectations and it's elevating our dinner and our late-night dayparts.
Also, we're seeing growth at breakfast in Australia with the help of strong promotional items such as the Mighty McMuffin and a new Breakfast Wrap, both of which deliver a full meat-and-egg meal on the go. Now meanwhile, Australia continues to sharpen operations, lowering drive-thru and front counter times, which helped the market achieve its best customer satisfaction scores in more than five years.
Turning to Japan. The environment remains challenging in Japan and the recovery is particularly slow, and it's uneven. But despite this, we're following a strong plan of action with great innovative food news, such as our popular Chicken Tatsuta and Teritama burger. These products help us to differentiate our brand, and we further differentiate it through reimaging and service initiatives. And we're also strategically closing some restaurants to maximize our efforts. 
Meanwhile, China achieved nearly a 6% increase in comparable sales for the quarter as signs of recovery in the market place continued to emerge. Outstanding value and operations are keys to our growth in China. And China's customer satisfaction scores are regularly among McDonald's best globally. And the highly popular Value Lunch program is continuing to build sales and build traffic. 
Now China remains a tremendous opportunity for McDonald's, and we're committed to growing there. We have opened 48 restaurants this year and are on track to open between 150 and 175 for all of 2010. This is nearly a 15% increase over our base. We plan to continue differentiating our brand through even stronger service and food news, branded value, and maximizing our convenience, from drive-thrus to dessert kiosks to extended hours. 
Just one last note on APMEA, though. APMEA was the host region for McDonald's sponsorship of the World Cup in South Africa. And I'm very proud of our entire system for helping our brand shine brightly during this global event. Our popular Player Escort Children's program was once again a huge success. And we connected with all of our customers through a host of digital initiatives, menu promotions and charitable programs. It was really a great job done by everyone in showcasing the fun, the relevance and the modern spirit of our brand, not only in South Africa, but all around the world.
In closing, we all look forward to better economic times, but we're just not seeing it yet. The global economy remains fragile. Sustained levels of high unemployment and wavering consumer confidence continue to make this a tough operating environment. But I want to reiterate something, and that is the ongoing strength of our Global business. We remain committed to the Plan to Win and it is working all around the world. We're delivering high quality food at a great value with an increasingly modern experience, and it continues to resonate with consumers, making us a destination for more than 60 million customers each and every day. We're committed to leveraging our position of strength to grow our business today and to grow our business into the future. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Pete."

The alignment and focus of the McDonald's system around the Plan to Win continues to yield positive results.

The alignment and focus of the McDonald's system around the Plan to Win continues to yield positive results. Every area of the world generated increases in comparable sales and guests counts for the second quarter and the first six months of 2010. This growth, along with effective management of expenses, resulted in second quarter operating income increasing 10% to over $1.8 billion. In combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 180 basis points to 30.5% year-to-date June.
Second quarter results benefited from expansion of both company-operated and franchise margins. In the U.S., company-operated margins rose 260 basis points to 22.2%, primarily due to lower food and paper costs and, to a lesser extent, the impact of refranchising. Our second quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, which compared quite favorably to the 4% increase in second quarter last year.
Looking to the second half of 2010, we expect a sequential benefit of lower commodity costs to moderate. For the full year 2010, our outlook in the U.S. remains favorable, with our basket of goods expected to be down 3% to 4%.
In Europe, company-operated margins increased 220 basis points in the second quarter to 20.3%. Strong comparable sales in Russia, France, the U.K. and many other markets, coupled with lower commodity costs, were partly offset by higher labor costs. The strengthening of the Russian ruble and other Eastern European currencies benefited margins by about 40 basis points.
As we have previously discussed, for the 12 months ended June 30, comparable sales in France have benefited from a lower VAT on dine-in sales. We began lapping this benefit in July. Our European business may also face some headwinds from the austerity measures being implemented or discussed in many countries.
As the last couple of years have shown, our Plan to Win provides the framework for us to operate successfully in any economic environment, and we remain confident in the underlying strength of our European business.
Europe's grocery bill declined 4% in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect commodity costs to be down about 1% to 2%, which implies that we will experience slightly higher commodity costs in the second half, primarily in the fourth quarter.
In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 17.1%. Positive comparable sales, particularly in Australia, and lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region.
Turning to franchise margins. Second quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidated franchise margin percent increased 40 basis points to 82.7%, driven by positive global comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses.
G&A control also continues to be an area of focus. As expected, second quarter comparisons were affected by April's Biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, which accounted for about half of the $33 million increase from the prior year. Full year G&A continues to be in line with our plan and is projected to be up slightly on a constant currency basis.
Optimizing the ownership of our restaurant portfolio remains an important part of our strategy. With most of the major refranchising efforts completed over the past few years, the contribution from gains on store sales has decreased. In 2008 and 2009, at the height of our refranchising efforts, we recognized over $110 million of other operating income per year from gains on sales of restaurants. This year, the gains decreased to $11 million in the second quarter and $39 million year-to-date, reflecting the slower pace that will likely continue.
On the expense side, as a result of our decision to voluntarily recall 8 million Shrek glasses in the U.S. and Canada, we recognized a $12 million charge in other operating expense.
With half the year complete, I wanted to provide an update on our reimaging efforts. We view reimaging as a game-changing differentiator that delivers long-term, sustainable benefits to our business. Reimaging allows our facilities to stand out in the marketplace and elevates our brand, allowing it to stretch in ways that can produce significant growth in sales, market share, profitability and overall returns.
In the U.S., we expect to complete about 400 reimaged sites over the next nine months. We are encouraged by the participation thus far from our owner/operators. To date, we have received nearly 500 commitment letters across the country. These sites are at various stages of the process, which averages about five months from start to finish, but can take as long as the year, depending upon the permitting time.
The scope of these remodels is holistic, touching the exterior, interior and operational elements of the restaurants, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience. Many of the projects will increase the capacity of the restaurants as well. The company expects to contribute capital of $150,000 to $200,000 per franchise restaurant, depending on the scope of the project and the previous levels of reinvestment. As the reimaged restaurants are completed, the depreciation related to these capital expenditures will impact franchise margins.
In Europe, we expect to reimage more than 1,000 restaurants this year and have completed about 400 restaurants through June. The company's contribution to reimaging in Europe primarily takes the form of rent relief. One exception is in the U.K., where rent relief is provided until an owner/operator has at least 50% of his or her restaurants reimaged, at which point the company contributes capital for subsequent reimaging.
In APMEA, we are leveraging the learnings from Australia's highly successful reimaging program, and are making steady progress throughout the region, especially in Japan and China. Around the world, franchisees continue to have ready access to bank financing at competitive rates and terms to fund their reimaging efforts.
After investing in our business through reimaging and new restaurant openings, we expect to return all of our free cash flow to investors over the long term. Through June, we returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Finally, an earnings call would not be complete without some comments about currency. It bears repeating that wherever possible, we seek to minimize the economic or cash flow impact of fluctuating exchange rates by sourcing in local currencies, utilizing foreign-denominated debt, hedging a portion of our foreign royalties and reinvesting profits back into local markets. 
Our Global diversification also provides a natural hedge. For example, the Australian and Canadian dollar do not always move in tandem with the European currencies. The Aussie dollar has strengthened 25% and the Canadian dollar is up 16% against the U.S. dollar through June. The euro on the other hand, is relatively flat year-to-date, but declined nearly 7% in second quarter. 
The euro is our single largest foreign currency exposure, accounting for approximately 25% of consolidated operating income. All of our currency exposures and our currency risk management practices should be considered when projecting the translation impact on our results.
To provide you with some perspective, based on current exchange rates, we project currency translation to negatively impact third quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.03, and the full year by about $0.04. As you know though, these estimates become outdated within days, given the current volatility in the foreign exchange markets.
In closing, our results through the first six months of 2010 highlight the ongoing strength of our Plan to Win, particularly in light of persistent and continuing global economic headwinds. We remain committed to executing the plan to deliver long-term, sustainable growth for our system and our shareholders.

And historically, what we have told you guys before, is that 6% to 7% above market as an incremental growth was the target that we’ve had out there. I will tell you as I travel around the markets, based upon the level of reimaging that we do, that really dictates the level of the sales increase. And you can look in terms of Europe as we've gone internal and external, you'll see a little bit more based upon the amount of things that need to be reimaged.

And so almost all of that benefit was coming from the backdoor costs, and a slight benefit still from the carryover from the refranchising efforts. But mostly from the backdoor costs. In Europe, we've talked before, structurally, there are some higher cost elements to our business in Europe from a labor and occupancy side. So we never necessarily compare the U.S. to Europe and think that they can get there. What we constantly look at is do they have the right strategies and tactics in place to continue growing their margins?

There's one other piece to this, too, and that is of all the markets around the world right now, the U.S. is a market where guest counts are outpacing comp sales. And this was a very deliberate approach based upon the economy. So as you look at the U.S., what you're going to see is more than 100% of the comp sales growth is driven by guest counts. Now combine that with the fact that the Breakfast Value program in the U.S. is something that really reached out to ensure that customers who have lower disposable income due to unemployment still could come into McDonald's. That was part of the reason for the decision to appeal to those consumers. So you've got strong guest count growth, gap into the marketplace, incorporation of Value and Beverages that are still driving the business to a great extent.

The one thing I can say is that our philosophy is unchanged related to this. So with the significant amount of cash that we generate, we first invest in the business. So you know our CapEx is going to be about $2.4 billion this year. And then our next priority for that is dividends, and the dividend has grown each year for the past 33 years. Generally, we think of it growing in line with earnings. But at the end of the day, the board has the ultimate call on what the dividend should be. But I think framing it that way and then using the balance of our cash flow in a disciplined way to buy back shares has been successful for us over the last few years and continues to be how we think about it."

We think it is going to be an opportunity to continue to help stimulate the economy there. The great thing for us as well, and I know you all heard a lot of information relative to how this is impacting margins for some of our competitors. We are 10% higher than the minimum wage already in China. And this is something that we did several years ago as we addressed what we thought at that time was a gap. That's about 8% higher than our strongest competitor that's there. And so we feel as if we're in a great point relative to being able to continue to move margins forward and to benefit from the increased disposable income as a result of them doing this across the country. Here's the other thing that we're seeing: If you look at -- you asked were there any other things that we were doing. We have increased some of our marketing spend also in China, which should have some impact on margin, but I tell you, it is helping us to drive also the sales results that we're getting in China.

I’m very pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald’s, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 4.8%, operating income increased 10%, and EPS reached",1636,"Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everybody. I’m very pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald’s, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 4.8%, operating income increased 10%, and EPS reached $1.13, a 15% increase.
Now, these results marked our 29th consecutive quarter of global comparable sales growth, confirming the ongoing strength of McDonald’s Plan to Win and our ability to continue to meet and exceed our customers’ needs.
Our momentum is continuing into July with global comparable sales trending in line with or better than second quarter sales. Our strength is broad-based as each area of the world is contributing to our growth. We’re growing share nearly everywhere in an informal eating-out market that varies from declining to slightly up.
Now as we move through the mid-year point, we remain confident in our strategies and we intend to work even hard to keep delivering for our customers. Since becoming Chief Operating Officer about six months ago, I made it a point to visit all of our major markets around the world, from Europe to Asia to Latin America and right here in the USA.
Across the system, I am so impressed with our people, with their energy, and with their commitment to becoming the favorite place and a way to eat and drink for even more customers.
Together, we are focused on taking our business to that next level and we’re aligned around our top priorities for getting us fair. First, it’s optimizing our menu and continuing the growth of business with the right combination of food and beverage choices.
Next, it’s modernizing the experience and elevating everything from how our restaurants look, feel, and operate to how customers engage with our brand.
Third, broadening our accessibility to drive growth through greater convenience, value, and service initiatives. You know all of these things will be brought to life by well-trained, highly-motivated crew and managers. We’re working to seize the biggest opportunities in all of these areas, executing in the most relevant and meaningful ways.
So let’s begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 3.7% and operating income grew 7%. These are strong results in today’s environment, where we still see nearly double-digit unemployment and low consumer confidence. I am very pleased with this momentum as we continue to take market share and increase guest counts and owner/operator cash flow.
This is especially meaningful at a time when overall restaurant traffic is still down. We’re connecting with consumers in delivering an experience that they are signing more compelling than ever. The key sales drivers in the U.S. continue to be everyday value, relevant menu choice, and greater convenience.
Now, we’ll continue to see strong results from the Dollar Menu at Breakfast, which was launched in January, is generating both solid growth in sales and guest counts during this all important daypart. This summer, we’ve also brought back our $1 drink offerings on both fountain and tea beverages. This was a highly popular value proposition last year that provided a strong lift in beverage sales and we’re seeing positive results very early on.
On the menu front, we’re achieving success through leveraging our popular core products while also delivering relevant new offerings. The McDonald Shrek Forever After promotion drove strong sales of McNuggets, while the launch of Frappes in May has been a huge hit with consumers, contributing to higher sales across our entire coffee line.
In this month, we rode our Wild Berry and Strawberry Banana real fruit smoothies, which are already exceeding expectations and creating a tremendous buzz in the marketplace. This is a product that our customers truly love.
Now looking ahead, we’ll round up the summer with the introduction of the Angus Snack Wrap, elevating our Snack Wrap line and giving consumers another premium on the go offering.
On top of all of this, we’re broadening our accessibility and becoming even more convenient. More than a third of our U.S. restaurants are opened 24 hours a day, seven days a week and we are devoting more staffing and resources to the 5 AM hour, adding to our overall sales and guest count growth.
So let’s switch over to Europe, comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currency, and while the overall high yield market in Europe continued its decline, we continued to increase our market share.
Europe’s overall strategy of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency, and enhancing local relevance remains a winning approach. Through these strategies, we’re pulling the right levers to manage Europe’s uncertain economic situation and remain a compelling destination for customers.
The U.K. market again led the way with a strong comp sales increase for the quarter, driven by impactful marketing and a strong combination of menu variety and value offerings. Customers responded well to the U.K.’s World Cup promotion of Big Mac, Fries, and other popular core items, and we also success with the Great Taste of America sandwich promotion, featuring American themed burgers with special breads and sauces.
In addition, the Little Tasters line continues to deliver results and elevate our position as a leader in the area of first rate mid-tier value offerings. Our French business also remained strong.
We’re continuing to upgrade our entire experience in France with compelling, relevant restaurant designs and we are succeeding with the strong line of premium chicken and beef products as well as our small Le Petit plaisir offerings. Meanwhile the reintroduction of the Double Cheese Burger in France also drove strong sales.
In Germany, we achieved solid results for the quarter and continued to grow market share, further distancing ourselves from the competition. Our new Mac Warps and recent line of Snack Deluxe offerings including chicken and beef barbeque are performing well and give us a strong platform of choice and premium offerings.
In addition, Germany’s Easy Morning breakfast campaign continued to perform well driving sales during mid daypart, which represents 5.5% of total sales.
Now let’s turn now to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa or as we call it APMEA. Comparable sales for the quarter grew 4.6% and operating income increased 9% in constant currency. Across this region, value, operations, and menu are key drivers of growth.
Taking a closer look at our main markets; Australia, is maintaining strong momentum by leveraging its full reimaged restaurants and premium entree and snack items to delight customers.
In addition, our recently launched Family Dinner Box is performing extremely well in Australia. It provides a combination of sandwiches, size and drinks at a strong value proposition and is giving consumers a great option at dinner. It’s exceeding our expectations and its elevating our dinner and our late night dayparts.
Also, we are seeing growth at breakfast in Australia. With the help of strong promotional items such as the mighty McMuffin and a new breakfast wrap both of which deliver a full meat and egg meal on the go.
Now meanwhile, Australia continues to shock on operations, lowering drive through and front counter times which help the market achieve its best customer satisfaction scores in more than five years.
Turning to Japan, the environment remains challenging in Japan and the recovery is particularly slow and it’s uneven. But despite this we’re following a strong plan of action with great innovative food news, such as our popular Chicken Tatsuta and Teri Tama Burger.
These products help us to differentiate our brand and we further differentiated through reimaging and service initiatives, and we’re also strategically closing some restaurants to maximize our efforts. Meanwhile, China achieved nearly a 6% increase in comparable sales for the quarter as signs of recovery in the marketplace continued to emerge.
Outstanding value and operations are keys to our growth in China, and China’s customer satisfaction scores are regularly among McDonald’s best globally. The highly popular Value Lunch program is continuing to build sales and build traffic.
Now China remains a tremendous opportunity for McDonald’s and we’re committed to growing there. We have opened 48 restaurants this year and on track to open between 150 and 175 for all of 2010. This is nearly a 15% increase over our base.
We plan to continue differentiating our brand through even stronger service and food news, branded value and maximizing our convenience, from dry fruits to desserts kiosks, to extended hours.
Just one last note on APMEA, APMEA was the host region for McDonald’s sponsorship of the World Cup in South Africa. And I’m very proud of our entire system for helping our brand shine brightly during this global event.
Our popular Player Escort children’s program was once again a huge success and we connected with all of our customers through a host of digital initiatives, menu promotions, and charitable programs.
It was really a great job done by everyone in showcasing the fun, the relevance, and the modern spirit of our brand, not only in South Africa, but all around the world.
In closing, we all look forward to better economic times, but we’re just not seeing it yet. The global economy remains fragile, sustained levels of high unemployment and wavering consumer confidence continue to make this a tough operating environment.
But I want to reiterate something, and that is the ongoing strength of our global business. We remain committed to the Plan to Win, and it is working all around the world. We’re delivering high quality food at a great value with an increasingly modern experience and it continues to resonate with consumers making us a destination for more than 60 million customers each and every day.
We’re committed to leveraging our position of strength to grow our business today and to grow our business into the future.
And now, I’ll turn it over to Pete.

139488,107250159,68999,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-23-2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The alignment and focus of the McDonald’s system around the Plan to Win continues to yield positive results.

The alignment and focus of the McDonald’s system around the Plan to Win continues to yield positive results. Every area of the world generated increases in comparable sales and guest counts for the second quarter and the first six months of 2010. This growth along with effective management of expenses, resulted in second quarter operating income increasing 10% to over $1.8 billion.
In combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 180 basis points to 30.5% year-to-date June.
Second quarter results benefited from expansion of both company-operated and franchise margins. In the U.S., company-operated margins rose 260 basis points to 22.2% primarily due to lower food and paper costs, and to a lesser extent the impact of re-franchising.
Our second quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, which compared quite favorably to the 4% increase in second quarter last year. Looking to the second half of 2010, we expect the sequential benefit of lower commodity cost to moderate. For the full year 2010, our outlook in the U.S. remains favorable with our basket of goods expected to be down 3% to 4%.
In Europe, company-operated margins increased 220 basis points in the second quarter to 20.3%, strong comparable sales in Russia, France, the U.K., and many other markets coupled with lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor costs.
The strengthening of the Russian Ruble and other Eastern European currencies benefited margins by about 40 basis points. As we have previously discussed for the 12 months ended June 30 comparable sales in France have benefited from a lower VAT on dine-in sales, we begin lapping this benefit in July.
Our European business may also face some headwinds from the austerity measures being implemented or discussed in many countries. As the last couple years have shown, our Plan to Win provides the framework for us to operate successfully in any economic environment and we remain confident in the underlying strength of our European business.
Europe’s grocery bill declined 4% in the second quarter, and for the full year, we expect commodity costs to be down about 1% to 2%. Which implies that we will experience slightly higher commodity cost in the second half primarily in the fourth quarter?
In Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 17.1%. Positive comparable sales particularly in Australia and lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region.
Turning to franchise margins; second quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidate franchise margin percent increased 40 basis points to 82.7% driven by positive global comparable sales partly offset by higher occupancy expenses.
G&A control also continues to be an area of focus. As expected second quarter comparisons were affected by April’s biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, which accounted for about half of the $33 million increase from the prior year.
Full year G&A continues to be in line with our plan and is projected to be up slightly on a constant currency basis. Optimizing the ownership of our restaurant portfolio remains an important part of our strategy.
With most of the major refranchising efforts completed over the past few years, the contribution from gains on store sales has decreased. In 2008 and 2009 at the height of our refranchising efforts, we recognized over $110 million of other operating income per year from gains on sales of restaurants. This year the gains decreased to $11 million in the second quarter and $39 million year-to-date, reflecting the slower pace that will likely continue.
On the expense side as a result of our decision to voluntarily recall 8 million Shrek glasses in the U.S. and Canada, we recognized a $12 million charge in other operating expense.
With half the year complete, I wanted to provide an update on our reimaging efforts. We view reimaging as a game changing differentiator that delivers long-term sustainable benefits to our business.
Reimaging allows our facilities to standout in the marketplace and elevates our brand allowing it to stretch in ways that can produce significant growth in sales, market share, profitability and overall returns.
In the U.S., we expect to complete about 400 reimage sites over the next nine months. We are encouraged by the participation thus far from our owner operators. To-date, we have received nearly 500 commitment letters across the country. These sites are at various stages of the process which averages about five months from start to finish, while can take as long as a year depending upon the permitting time.
The scope of these remodels is holistic, touching the exterior, interior and operational elements of the restaurants thereby enhancing the overall customer experience. Many of the projects will increase the capacity of the restaurants as well.
The company expects to contribute capital of $150,000 to $200,000 per franchise restaurant depending on the scope of the project in the previous levels of reinvestment. As the reimage restaurants are completed, the depreciation related to these capital expenditures will impact franchise margins.
In Europe, we expect to reimage more than 1,000 restaurants this year and have completed about 400 restaurants through June. The company’s contribution to reimaging in Europe primarily takes the form of rent relief.
One exception is in the U.K., where rent relief is provided until an owner/operator has at least 50% of his or her restaurants reimage, at which point the company contributes capital for subsequent reimaging.
In APMEA, we are leveraging the learnings from Australia’s highly successful reimaging program and are making steady progress throughout the region, especially in Japan and China. Around the world, franchisees continue to have ready access to bank financing at competitive rates and terms to fund our reimaging efforts.
After investing in our business through reimaging and new restaurant openings, we expect to return all of our free cash flow to investors over the long term. Through June, we’ve returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Finally, an earnings call would not be complete without some comments about currency. It bears repeating that wherever possible, we seek to minimize the economic or cash flow impact of fluctuating exchange rates by sourcing in local currencies, utilizing foreign denominated debt, hedging a portion of our foreign royalties and reinvesting profits back into local markets.
Our global diversification also provides a natural hedge. For example, the Australian and Canadian dollar do not always move in tandem with the European currencies.
The Aussie dollar had strengthened 25% and the Canadian dollar is up 16% against the U.S. dollar through June. The euro on the other hand is relatively flat year-to-date, but declined nearly 7% in second quarter. The euro is our single largest foreign currency exposure accounting for approximately 25% of consolidated operating income.
All of our currency exposures and our currency rates managing practices should be considered when projecting the translation impact on our results.
To provide you with some perspective based on current exchange rates, we project currency translation to negatively impact third quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.03, and the full year by about $0.04. As you know, though, these estimates become outdated within days given the current volatility in the foreign exchange markets.
In closing, our results through the first six-month of 2010 highlight the ongoing strength of our Plan to Win, particularly in light of persistent and continuing global economic headwinds. We remain committed to executing the plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth for our systems and our shareholders.
Thank you. Now, I’ll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin the Q&A.

I think, our branded affordability proposition helps us tremendously across Europe. We’ve also got some great premium products that we’ve implemented. We’re doing some other things in Europe.
The reimaging strategy continues to help us. We still got great breakfast upside and potential relative to the consumers there. This is going to be one that we’re paying close attention to clearly with the austerity measures that are coming into play now. Will there be any impact on disposable income? It depends on the severity of those measures. But, what we’re confident in is that we’ve been doing well even when the economy has been tough, and we’ve done this not only in Europe but around the world.
So, regardless of what those austerity measures are or VAT increases, we’ve got some value propositions across the menu board. Matter of fact, in fact, in many cases like this, we look at this as an opportunity for us to appeal to even more customers, if disposable income does tighten up. But make no mistake, we’d love the economy to be doing better, we do better when it does better, but we do have some offerings that appeal to customers regardless of their disposable income levels.

From a margin perspective, beverages are more accretive to our broader margins. I haven’t said that, if you look in totality, though, you got balances. So this year we’ve got breakfast value, and its aggressive breakfast value which is bringing in a tremendous amount of guest count growth at breakfast and that would be, that does not support margins from a percentage perspective, but it brings in quite a bit more business.

In the U.S. for the quarter, almost all of that increase was driven by our commodity costs. This environment we’ve be talking about for a while is an environment where we were really focused on driving guest counts into our restaurants and the environment is not really conducive to increasing prices significantly.
So the reality is we achieve these margins with basically zero pricing increases in the U.S. system. So almost all that benefit was coming from the backdoor costs and a slight benefit is still from the carryover from the refranchising efforts, but mostly from the backdoor costs.
In Europe, we’ve talked before structurally, there are some higher cost elements to our business in Europe from a labor and occupancy side. So we never necessarily compare the U.S. to Europe and things that they can get there.
What we constantly look at is, do they have the right strategies and tactics in place to continue to growing their margins. In Europe, they actually were able to take a little bit of price this quarter. So, their margin growth was a combination of price and the commodity benefits, very healthy, very balanced and traffic was a part of that as well. So, we feel pretty good about where the margins are around the world.

Relative to the POS it does help us with some capacity improvements based upon speed of service. It’s easier to navigate for our crew.

Interestingly enough I do believe and I think you’re right. What we’ve done a really, really great job of and I have to really credit our franchises across, and really this is around the globe as well, but since we’re talking about U.S. now. They have really held the line on pricing based upon the fact that we’ve been in the lower inflationary period. Now as we move forward, do we see opportunities to take price as inflation rises; the three things that we have to consider,; one, is what we see in terms of the employment levels and the potential for additional disposable income.
And then the two things we talk about historically being food away from home and food at home, and you mentioned both of these. Historically, we price the food away from home, but over the last couple of years we’ve also been taking special note of food at home and we got to make sure we don’t get too far to whack with food at home. As we see increases there, and we’ve seen increases at food away from home, we will set up our pricing accordingly.

So, there are a couple of things that are going on year-to-date. One is, Don mentioned that with the introduction of the Dollar Menu at breakfast time, we knew average check would go down and traffic would go up significantly and we’re seeing that dynamic. So, we’re trading some check for guest count increases during that daypart.
The other dynamic is with these premium beverages, so the frappes and smoothies most significantly is we’re seeing an increase in the number of one in two items per transactions in our guest counts. Our average items per transaction is closer to four in the U.S. So when we see an increase in one in two items per visit that will pull down the check. But definitely as we mentioned, these are high margin items and getting this incremental traffic in a QSR environment that is still negative is a huge win for us.

What we do know is that it really has appealed to quite a few people and that’s based upon our volume.
On the mixed snack wrap, mixed snack wrap was very successful and has been successful. Actually, it elevated the line of snack wraps. It almost doubled the line of Snack Wraps. Just like with any new product as we move forward, that impact will lessen. So it is less now than it was initially. It’s not 50% of the overall Snack Wrap movement.
I think the thing that the U.S. team is doing right now is really good and that is to look at this as the flavor of mixed snack wrap, what it has done for the line? They’ve got some new flavors that are coming up later in the year and they’ll be looking at what happens at that point. Do we keep mixed snack wrap in at that point or do we pull it out and put another flavor in? I think this rotation of variety will be very, very good for our U.S. consumers.

A couple different things, one is keep in mind that the U.S. company is still running a sizeable gap. As I mentioned earlier, 5% year-to-date over the broader marketplace in the competition, and so it is a broader one. There is one other piece to this too. And that is of all the markets around the world right now the U.S. is a market where guest counts are outpacing comp sales. And this was a very deliberate approach based upon the economy. And so as you look at the U.S. what you’re going to see is more than 100% of the comp sales growth is driven by guest counts.
Now, combine that with the fact that the breakfast value program in the U.S. is something that really reached out to ensure the customers who have lower disposable income due to unemployment still could come into McDonald’s. That was part of the reason for the decision to appeal to those consumers. So you’ve got strong guest count growth, gap in to the marketplace, incorporation of value and beverages that are still driving the business to a great extent.
So, the U.S. business is in a good state and that’s all to Pete’s point without any substantial price increase at all. So I think that there is still tremendous upside as we see a little more inflation, and maybe a little bit more prices that can be taken. But at this point in the game, I think they’re doing a great job of capturing more market.

That’s about 8% higher than our strongest competitor this day.

Here is the other thing that we’re seeing. You asked were there any other things that we were doing, we have increased some of our marketing spend also in China, which does have some impact on margin.

I'm very pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, Global comparable sales were up 4.8%. Operating income increased 10%. And EPS reached $1.1",1619,"Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, Global comparable sales were up 4.8%. Operating income increased 10%. And EPS reached $1.13, a 15% increase. Now these results mark our 29th consecutive quarter of Global comparable sales growth, confirming the ongoing strength of McDonald's Plan to Win, and our ability to continue to meet and exceed our customers' needs. Our momentum is continuing into July with Global comparable sales trending in line with, or better than, second quarter sales. Our strength is broad-based as each area of the world is contributing to our growth. And we're growing share nearly everywhere in an informal eating-out market that varies from declining to slightly up.
Now as we move through the mid-year point, we remain confident in our strategies and we intend to work even harder to keep delivering for our customers. Since becoming Chief Operating Officer about six months ago, I made it a point to visit all of our major markets around the world, from Europe to Asia to Latin America, and right here in the USA. And across the system, I am so impressed with our people, with their energy and with their commitment to becoming the favorite place and way to eat and drink for even more customers.
Together, we’re focused on taking our business to that next level. And we’re aligned around our top priorities for getting us there. First, it's optimizing our menu and continuing to grow the business with the right combination of food and beverage choices. Next, modernizing the experience and elevating everything from how our restaurants look, feel and operate, to how customers engage with our brand. Third, broadening our accessibility to drive growth through greater convenience, value and service initiatives. And all of these things will be brought to life by well-trained, highly motivated crew and managers. We’re working to seize the biggest opportunities in all of these areas, executing in the most relevant and meaningful ways.
So let's begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 3.7% and operating income grew 7%. These are strong results in today's environment, where we still see nearly double-digit unemployment and low consumer confidence. And I'm very pleased with this momentum as we continue to take market share and increase guest counts, and on our operator cash flow. This is especially meaningful at a time when overall restaurant traffic is still down. We're connecting with consumers in delivering an experience that they’re finding more compelling than ever. The key sales drivers in the U.S. continue to be everyday value, relevant menu choice and greater convenience. 
Now we'll continue to see strong results from the Dollar Menu at breakfast, which was launched in January. It’s generating both solid growth in sales and guest counts during this all-important daypart. This summer, we've also brought back our $1 drink offerings on both fountain and tea beverages. This was a highly popular value proposition last year that provided a strong lift in beverage sales and we’re seeing positive results very early on.
On the menu front, we're achieving success through leveraging our popular core products, while also delivering relevant new offerings. The McDonald's Shrek Forever After promotion drove strong sales of McNuggets, while the launch of frappes in May has been a huge hit with consumers, contributing to higher sales across our entire coffee line. And this month, we rolled out Wild Berry and Strawberry Banana Real Fruit Smoothies, which are already exceeding expectations and creating a tremendous buzz in the marketplace. This is a product that our customers truly love.
Now looking ahead, we'll round out the summer with the introduction of the Angus Snack Wrap, elevating our Snack Wrap line and giving consumers another premium, On-The-Go offering. And on top of all of this, we’re broadening our accessibility and becoming even more convenient. More than 1/3 of our U.S. restaurants are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And we're devoting more staffing and resources to the 5:00 a.m. hour, adding to overall sales and guest count growth.
So let's switch over to Europe. Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currency. And while the overall IEO market in Europe continued its decline, we continue to increase our market share. Europe's overall strategy of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance remains a winning approach. Through the strategies, we're pulling the right levers to manage Europe's uncertain economic situation, and remain a compelling destination for customers.
The U.K. market again led the way with a strong comp sales increase for the quarter, driven by impactful marketing and a strong combination of menu variety and value offerings. Customers responded well to the U.K.'s World Cup promotion of Big Mac, Fries and other popular core items. And we also saw success with the Great Taste of America Sandwich promotion, featuring American-themed burgers with special breads and sauces. In addition, the Little Tasters line continues to deliver results and elevate our position as a leader in the area of first-rate, mid-tier value offerings.
Our French business also remains strong. We're continuing to upgrade our entire experience in France with compelling, relevant restaurant designs. And we’re succeeding with a strong line of premium chicken and beef products as well as our smaller Petit Plaisir offerings. Meanwhile, the reintroduction of the Double Cheeseburger in France also drove strong sales.
In Germany, we achieved solid results for the quarter and continued to grow market share, further distancing ourselves from the competition. Our new McWraps and recent line of Snack Deluxe offerings, including chicken and beef barbecue, are performing well and give us a strong platform of choice and premium offerings. In addition, Germany's Easy Morning Breakfast campaign continued to perform well, driving sales during this daypart, which represents 5.5% of total sales.
Now let's turn now to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or as we call it, APMEA. Comparable sales for the quarter grew 4.6%, and operating income increased 9% in constant currency. Across this region, value, operations and menu are key drivers of growth. 
Taking a closer look at our main markets, Australia is maintaining strong momentum by leveraging its fully reimaged restaurants and Premium entree and snack items to delight customers. In addition, our recently launched Family Dinner Box is performing extremely well in Australia. It provides a combination of sandwiches, sides and drinks at a strong value proposition and is giving consumers a great option at dinner. It's exceeding our expectations and it's elevating our dinner and our late-night dayparts.
Also, we're seeing growth at breakfast in Australia with the help of strong promotional items such as the Mighty McMuffin and a new Breakfast Wrap, both of which deliver a full meat-and-egg meal on the go. Now meanwhile, Australia continues to sharpen operations, lowering drive-thru and front counter times, which helped the market achieve its best customer satisfaction scores in more than five years.
Turning to Japan. The environment remains challenging in Japan and the recovery is particularly slow and it's uneven. But despite this, we're following a strong plan of action with great innovative food news, such as our popular Chicken Tatsuta and Teritama burger. These products help us to differentiate our brand, and we further differentiate it through reimaging and service initiatives. And we're also strategically closing some restaurants to maximize our efforts. 
Meanwhile, China achieved nearly a 6% increase in comparable sales for the quarter, as signs of recovery in the marketplace continued to emerge. Outstanding value and operations are keys to our growth in China. And China's customer satisfaction scores are regularly among McDonald's best globally. And the highly popular Value Lunch program is continuing to build sales and build traffic. 
Now China remains a tremendous opportunity for McDonald's, and we're committed to growing there. We have opened 48 restaurants this year and are on track to open between 150 and 175 for all of 2010. This is nearly a 15% increase over our base. We plan to continue differentiating our brand through even stronger service and food news, branded value and maximizing our convenience, from drive-thrus to dessert kiosks to extended hours. 
Just one last note on APMEA, though. APMEA was the host region for McDonald's sponsorship of the World Cup in South Africa. And I'm very proud of our entire system for helping our brand shine brightly during this global event. Our popular Player Escort Children's program was once again a huge success. And we connected with all of our customers through a host of digital initiatives, menu promotions and charitable programs. It was really a great job done by everyone in showcasing the fun, the relevance and the modern spirit of our brand, not only in South Africa, but all around the world.
In closing, we all look forward to better economic times, but we're just not seeing it yet. The global economy remains fragile. Sustained levels of high unemployment and wavering consumer confidence continue to make this a tough operating environment. But I want to reiterate something, and that is the ongoing strength of our Global business. We remain committed to the Plan to Win and it is working all around the world. We're delivering high-quality food at a great value with an increasingly modern experience, and it continues to resonate with consumers, making us a destination for more than 60 million customers each and every day. We're committed to leveraging our position of strength to grow our business today and to grow our business into the future. 
And now I'll turn it over to Pete."
139488,107250159,71095,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-23-2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The alignment and focus of the McDonald's system around the Plan to Win continues to yield positive results.

The alignment and focus of the McDonald's system around the Plan to Win continues to yield positive results. Every area of the world generated increases in comparable sales and guests counts for the second quarter and the first six months of 2010. This growth, along with effective management of expenses, resulted in second quarter operating income increasing 10% to over $1.8 billion. In combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 180 basis points to 30.5% year-to-date June.
Second quarter results benefited from expansion of both company-operated and franchise margins. In the U.S., company-operated margins rose 260 basis points to 22.2%, primarily due to lower food and paper costs and, to a lesser extent, the impact of refranchising. Our second quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, which compared quite favorably to the 4% increase in second quarter last year.
Looking to the second half of 2010, we expect a sequential benefit of lower commodity costs to moderate. For the full year 2010, our outlook in the U.S. remains favorable, with our basket of goods expected to be down 3% to 4%.
In Europe, company-operated margins increased 220 basis points in the second quarter to 20.3%. Strong comparable sales in Russia, France, the U.K. and many other markets, coupled with lower commodity costs, were partly offset by higher labor costs. The strengthening of the Russian ruble and other Eastern European currencies benefited margins by about 40 basis points.
As we have previously discussed, for the 12 months ended June 30, comparable sales in France have benefited from a lower VAT on dine-in sales. We began lapping this benefit in July. Our European business may also face some headwinds from the austerity measures being implemented or discussed in many countries.
As the last couple of years have shown, our Plan to Win provides the framework for us to operate successfully in any economic environment, and we remain confident in the underlying strength of our European business.
Europe's grocery bill declined 4% in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect commodity costs to be down about 1% to 2%, which implies that we will experience slightly higher commodity costs in the second half, primarily in the fourth quarter.
In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 17.1%. Positive comparable sales, particularly in Australia, and lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region.
Turning to franchise margins. Second quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidated franchise margin percent increased 40 basis points to 82.7%, driven by positive global comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses.
G&A control also continues to be an area of focus. As expected, second quarter comparisons were affected by April's Biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, which accounted for about half of the $33 million increase from the prior year. Full year G&A continues to be in line with our plan and is projected to be up slightly on a constant currency basis.
Optimizing the ownership of our restaurant portfolio remains an important part of our strategy. With most of the major refranchising efforts completed over the past few years, the contribution from gains on store sales has decreased. In 2008 and 2009, at the height of our refranchising efforts, we recognized over $110 million of other operating income per year from gains on sales of restaurants. This year, the gains decreased to $11 million in the second quarter and $39 million year-to-date, reflecting the slower pace that will likely continue.
On the expense side, as a result of our decision to voluntarily recall 8 million Shrek glasses in the U.S. and Canada, we recognized a $12 million charge in other operating expense.
With half the year complete, I wanted to provide an update on our reimaging efforts. We view reimaging as a game-changing differentiator that delivers long-term, sustainable benefits to our business. Reimaging allows our facilities to stand out in the marketplace and elevates our brand, allowing it to stretch in ways that can produce significant growth in sales, market share, profitability and overall returns.
In the U.S., we expect to complete about 400 reimaged sites over the next nine months. We are encouraged by the participation thus far from our owner/operators. To date, we have received nearly 500 commitment letters across the country. These sites are at various stages of the process, which averages about five months from start to finish, but can take as long as the year, depending upon the permitting time.
The scope of these remodels is holistic, touching the exterior, interior and operational elements of the restaurants, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience. Many of the projects will increase the capacity of the restaurants as well. The company expects to contribute capital of $150,000 to $200,000 per franchise restaurant, depending on the scope of the project and the previous levels of reinvestment. As the reimaged restaurants are completed, the depreciation related to these capital expenditures will impact franchise margins.
In Europe, we expect to reimage more than 1,000 restaurants this year and have completed about 400 restaurants through June. The company's contribution to reimaging in Europe primarily takes the form of rent relief. One exception is in the U.K., where rent relief is provided until an owner/operator has at least 50% of his or her restaurants reimaged, at which point the company contributes capital for subsequent reimaging.
In APMEA, we are leveraging the learnings from Australia's highly successful reimaging program, and are making steady progress throughout the region, especially in Japan and China. Around the world, franchisees continue to have ready access to bank financing at competitive rates and terms to fund their reimaging efforts.
After investing in our business through reimaging and new restaurant openings, we expect to return all of our free cash flow to investors over the long term. Through June, we returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Finally, an earnings call would not be complete without some comments about currency. It bears repeating that wherever possible, we seek to minimize the economic or cash flow impact of fluctuating exchange rates by sourcing in local currencies, utilizing foreign-denominated debt, hedging a portion of our foreign royalties and reinvesting profits back into local markets. 
Our Global diversification also provides a natural hedge. For example, the Australian and Canadian dollar do not always move in tandem with the European currencies. The Aussie dollar has strengthened 25% and the Canadian dollar is up 16% against the U.S. dollar through June. The euro on the other hand, is relatively flat year-to-date, but declined nearly 7% in second quarter. 
The euro is our single largest foreign currency exposure, accounting for approximately 25% of consolidated operating income. All of our currency exposures and our currency risk management practices should be considered when projecting the translation impact on our results.
To provide you with some perspective, based on current exchange rates, we project currency translation to negatively impact third quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.03, and the full year by about $0.04. As you know though, these estimates become outdated within days, given the current volatility in the foreign exchange markets.
In closing, our results through the first six months of 2010 highlight the ongoing strength of our Plan to Win, particularly in light of persistent and continuing global economic headwinds. We remain committed to executing the plan to deliver long-term, sustainable growth for our system and our shareholders.

And historically, what we have told you guys before, is that 6% to 7% above market as an incremental growth was the target that we’ve had out there. I will tell you as I travel around the markets, based upon the level of reimaging that we do, that really dictates the level of the sales increase. And you can look in terms of Europe as we've gone internal and external, you'll see a little bit more based upon the amount of things that need to be reimaged.

And we've done this not only in Europe but around the world. And so regardless of what those austerity measures are or VAT increases, we've got some value propositions across the menu board.

This environment we've been talking about for a while is an environment where we’re really focused on driving guest counts into our restaurants, and the environment is not really conducive to increasing prices significantly. So the reality is we achieved these margins with basically zero price increases in the U.S. system. And so almost all of that benefit was coming from the backdoor costs, and a slight benefit still from the carryover from the refranchising efforts. But mostly from the backdoor costs. In Europe, we've talked before, structurally, there are some higher cost elements to our business in Europe from a labor and occupancy side. So we never necessarily compare the U.S. to Europe and think that they can get there. What we constantly look at is do they have the right strategies and tactics in place to continue growing their margins? And in Europe, they actually were able to take a little bit of price this quarter, so their margin growth was a combination of price and the commodity benefits.

And I would tell you, it's not as much just a fourth quarter-type phenomena as it is a couple of things that were our decisions. One, the returns are stronger now. The economy in China has picked up. When the economy was a little weaker, particularly in some of the areas outside the major cities, then returns suffered. And so we slowed down in some of those, focused back on some of the core cities and now we have an opportunity as the economy picks back up to accelerate again. And so that's what we're doing in China."

As I mentioned earlier, 5% year-to-date over the broader marketplace and the competition. And so it is a broader one. There's one other piece to this, too, and that is of all the markets around the world right now, the U.S. is a market where guest counts are outpacing comp sales. And this was a very deliberate approach based upon the economy. So as you look at the U.S., what you're going to see is more than 100% of the comp sales growth is driven by guest counts. Now combine that with the fact that the Breakfast Value program in the U.S. is something that really reached out to ensure that customers who have lower disposable income due to unemployment still could come into McDonald's. That was part of the reason for the decision to appeal to those consumers. So you've got strong guest count growth, gap into the marketplace, incorporation of Value and Beverages that are still driving the business to a great extent. So the U.S. business is in a good state, and that's all, to Pete's point, without any substantial price increases at all. So I think that there's still tremendous upside as we see a little more inflation and maybe a little bit more price that can be taken.

That's about 8% higher than our strongest competitor that's there.

Here's the other thing that we're seeing: If you look at -- you asked were there any other things that we were doing.

I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest business results that reflect our continued global strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 6%. Operating income increased 11% on constant currencies and earnings per share reached $1.29, a 15% increase in constant currencies.
Our momentum is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to increase 5% to 6%. Our strength remains broad-based with each area of the world contributing to our growth. And we're continuing to grow market share in our major markets.
In an informal eating-out category that varies from markets that are in decline to markets that are just growing slightly. These results marked our 30th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases and this is truly a testament to our ability to perform in any economy. We continue to deliver what our customers are looking for: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant menu offerings, with an emphasis on local taste. And it's all resonating with our customers.
In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 5.3% and operating income grew 7%. And most important, we continue to significantly increase traffic into our restaurants.
On the big menu news, this summer was the extension of our Beverage platform with the launch of strawberry, banana and wild berry smoothies and the rehead in the front page. Sales from the Smoothies launch well exceeded our expectations in both products that are being purchased throughout the day. Both of these high-margin beverages continue to sell at a strong pace. U.S. also drove quarterly results with value across the menu including the continuation of our Breakfast Dollar Menu. And on the convenience front, we're continuing to be available for more guests more often with nearly 40% of our U.S. restaurants now open 24 hours and more than 80% open by 5:00 a.m. in the morning.
In August, we launched the Angus Snack Wrap line with three choices at $1.99. This new introduction performed very well and has lifted sales of our entire Angus Burger category.
Our new beverage and snack wrap platforms contributed to the trailing 12-month period ending in August and delivered the highest guests counts in more than 20 years in the U.S.  Even as the overall industry continued to be stagnant.
We're innovating and we're executing and it's giving more people more reasons to choose McDonald's. Our customers continue to give us permission to stretch our brand, and we're delivering at the quality, value and speed of McDonald's.
This month, we're featuring our core products at McCafé beverages through a monopoly tie-in with Wal-Mart gift cards. And in November, we will advertise the always popular McRib on a national basis for a limited time, something we've not done for years.
Early next year, we will be launching oatmeal with maple brown sugar, apples, raisins and cranberries available all day. And in market test, our customers love the taste, nutrition profile and the expanded menu choice.
Now turning to Europe, we had another strong quarter. The comparable sales increased 4.1% and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. Now while the overall informal eating-out category in Europe remained in decline, we continue to take share in all of our major markets.
The key driver of growth across Europe continues to be our focus on modernizing and elevating the customer experience. More than 2/3 of our restaurant interiors in Europe are now reimaged and provide an ever-more contemporary and relevant environment for our guests and the people working in our restaurants. Meanwhile, on a customer satisfaction scores improved across the continent as we work to continually enhance our service with the biggest gains coming from drive through times and order accuracy.
Across Europe, we're striking the right blend of variety and choice, broadening our excess ability and appealing to a wide array of consumer segments. In Germany, for example, sales benefited from the launch of McWrap, a premium range of chicken and beef wrap sandwiches. And of course, everyday affordable pricing across the menu. Germany and many other markets feature the Coca-Cola glass promotion with the purchase of an Extra Value Meal driving some of our highest Extra Value Meal sales in history. 
We also saw success with the reintroduction of menu favorites, the M sandwich in the U.K., a premium burger with Artesyn bread and the popular Double Cheeseburger in France. The Beverage platform, while different than the U.S., also contributed to results. We've recently launched Frappes, Europe's enhanced milkshakes in several markets including France and Switzerland where it is contributing to the growth of the snacking daypart. And we are now the largest seller of coffee in the U.K., as premium, bean-to-cup and specialty coffees continue to attract the growing number of consumers especially when a great McDonald's breakfast is available to go along with it.
Looking ahead, we know the economic environment remains challenging with austerity measures continuing to be implemented. In January, the VAT will increase in the U.K., Holland and Portugal and others could follow. Yet we remain confident that our business model will endure. We expect our customer focus, menu pipeline and the ongoing modernization of our restaurants will continue to deliver long-term results.
Now looking to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where we also achieved strong growth, comparable sales for the quarter increased 8.1% and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. Results were strong across the segment with nearly half the markets delivering double-digit comparable sales increases. We're driving results through a focus on convenience, value and a balance of core and local offerings. Australia made gains with new menu items including a promotional addition to its extremely popular Angus platform. The new sandwich, Angus the Third featured the popular tomato chili relish and squared extremely well with our consumers. 
The market also rolled out a new patty for all premium chicken sandwiches driving an increase in sales across the entire premium chicken category. The addition of new breakfast roll and breakfast wrap helped drove comp sales and guests counts during the breakfast daypart. And Australia continue to focus on running better restaurants as it achieved some of its best service scores on record with improvements in drive-through speed and accuracy leading the way.
Our other major markets in APMEA, China and Japan also delivered. Value continues to be a key driver. China's Value Lunch program remains popular and continues to grow sales and traffic. The Value Lunch is now moved into nearly every market in greater Asia and accounts for more than 10% of the total sales in the region. 
Outstanding operations continue to drive growth and differentiate the experience in China with the market consistently achieving some of our best customer satisfaction scores. Our strategies in China are resonating with the consumers and our fundamentals are strong as evidenced by China's third quarter 12.7% comparable sales increase.
Meanwhile in Japan we remain competitive through relevant menu offerings and promotions. We delivered gains from a strong Big Mac campaign and a new lemon chicken sandwich, both of which proved extremely popular. Japanese consumers also reacted favorably to our recent food strapped promotion which offered miniature models of our iconic products such as Big Mac and fries for customers to actually strapped to their cell phones. The program was a huge hit and helped drive sales profits and new guests visits. As we combined the popular local trend with the popularity of our iconic products.
Japan's other big win was the launch of its value breakfast featuring McDonald's Sausage McMuffin and Sausage McGriddle helping drive sales and revitalize our Breakfast business.
So those are a few of the highlights around our continued momentum. We're delivering the food and beverages our customers want and the value that they expect and on overall dining and brand experience. It is modern, relevant and in step with our customers lives.
We're also continuing our commitment to financial discipline. We have a strong balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry allowing continued access to capital. And it continues to facilitate access to credit for our owner/operators to reinvest in their restaurants.
We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share or the equivalent of $2.44 annually. Combined with share repurchases, we expected our total cash return to shareholders for 2010 to reach an approximation of $5 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance and confident that we'll continue to keep driving our business forward. 
Now while it's been said by economists that the recession has technically ended and signs of progress are slowly emerging, the global economy remains fragile and consumers continue to be cautious. By continuing to innovate, invest and deliver what our customers want, we will continue to gain market share and grow our business. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."
139488,113677100,80828,"McDonald's Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system. Our alignment behind the Plan to Win again generated significant increases across all of our key measures. Comparable sales and guests counts, mar",1355,"Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system. Our alignment behind the Plan to Win again generated significant increases across all of our key measures. Comparable sales and guests counts, market share, operating income and returns. Combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 150 basis points to 31.4% for the nine months. This is a direct result of growth in both our consolidated franchise margins and our company-operated margins along with effective G&A control.
In the U.S., the successful introduction of McCafe Smoothies in July and the ongoing demand for our core menu drove gains in both comparable sales and guest counts. While our pricing remains relatively flat versus a year ago, we are especially encouraged that our traffic growth was about 1.5x that of our comparable sales growth through September. Lower food and paper costs along with top line growth contributed to an increase in company-operated margins of 270 basis points to 22% in the third quarter.
Equally important, our U.S. franchisees are generating significant increases in their annual cash flow per restaurant, now averaging over $350,000, a 15% increase over a year ago. This speaks to the health of our overall business and contributes significantly to our operators' willingness and ability to reinvest in their restaurants.
On the cost side, our third quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, contributing around 200 basis points to the margin expansion, similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year. However, the comparisons become unfavorable in the fourth quarter as we face a 1% to 2% increase in commodity cost compared with fourth quarter 2009? This still results in our overall food and paper costs being down 3% to 4% for the full year.
In Europe, the grocery bill decline to a more modest 1% in the third quarter. We now project commodity cost will be down 2% to 3% for the full year. This means that Europe will experience a slight increase in commodity cost in the fourth quarter compared with a decline of 3% in fourth quarter last year.
European company-operated margins increased 160 basis points in the third quarter to 22%. Comparable sales gains in Russia, the U.K., Spain and many other markets coupled with lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor costs. Menu prices increased an average of 2% to 3% across the segment over the past 12 months, but varied by market. As we head into the fourth quarter, some of these price increases will roll off and the current economic environment will impact our pricing power adding to short-term margin pressure, but nothing we haven't successfully navigated through before. 
In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 18.9%. Positive comparative sales were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region. We have an effective price increase in APMEA of about 1% and similar to Europe, it varies by market.
Now turning to franchise margins. Third quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.7 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidated franchise margin percent increased 60 basis points to 83.3% driven by positive global comparable sales.
The third component of combined operating margin is G&A which we continue to actively manage. For the third quarter, G&A was up slightly due in part to increased incentive compensation accruals based on our strong results. Fourth quarter G&A should be relatively flat resulting in a full year increase of about 3%.
On the other operating income line, similar to last quarter, we experienced lower gains on sales of restaurants in the third quarter compared with the prior year. More broadly speaking, the components of other operating income often include items such as gains, asset disposition costs, asset write-offs in part due to reimaging, and other unique items. Since many of these items are transactional in nature, it makes comparisons between certain quarters difficult. This was the case in the third quarter, and we also expect comparisons will be challenging in the fourth quarter where our current estimate for total other operating income is less than half of the $67 million recognized in fourth quarter 2009.
Let's now move on to something I know you're all very interested in, the cash generated from our operations. Our first priority for this cash is to reinvest in our business to build strong sales, profitability and returns. We have slightly trend our 2010 CapEx estimate from $2.4 billion to $2.3 billion, primarily due to currency translation and fewer completions of reimaging projects in the U.S. versus our original budget. This was a purposeful and strategic reduction which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Approximately half of our capital expenditures are spent on our existing restaurants. As we expect to reimage approximately 1,800 restaurants around the world this year, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the activities in our three major segments. 
In the U.S., we have completed about 40 sites and expect another 350 restaurants to be reimaged within six months. We're being very deliberate in our approach, testing different designs, closely examining our costs, and making sure that we have adequate sales history post-reimaging to evaluate the returns. In short, we're focused on doing this right versus doing it quickly. While it is still early, given the relative small sample size and limited timeframe, preliminary results are in line with or better than our initial 6% to 7% incremental sales list estimates. 
Most importantly, we're encouraged by the support of our owner operators who are leading this transformation of this brand in the U.S. In Europe, we have reimaged about 500 restaurants through September primarily in our largest markets: France, the U.K. and Germany. Europe plans to have about 90% of its interiors remodeled by 2012. Exterior reimaging tends to take longer due to permitting time and other regulations.
In APMEA, we are leveraging some of the European designs and are focused on both interior and exterior remodels, particularly in China and Japan. Australia is virtually 100% reimaged.
In addition to reinvestment, we are spending the other half of our capital expenditures to open new restaurants. We are on track to open 1,000 new restaurants this year. Approximately half of these openings will be in APMEA including 150 to 175 in China. Another 250 new restaurants will be opened in Europe, primarily in Russia, France and Germany.
The U.S. has already opened about 100 restaurants, well on its way to a total of 150 new restaurants this year. And the remaining 100 restaurants will be opened in Latin America and Canada.
Now let's spend a few minutes talking foreign currency. As you know, exchange rates have changed significantly since I last updated you. At current rates, we now expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by only $0.01 resulting in a full year benefit from currency translation of about $0.01. 
As I have said before, current volatility renders any estimate outdated within days, so please take this as directional guidance only. As most of you know, we believe constant currency results provide a more complete picture of the underlying strength of our business.
In closing, I'm proud to say that the focused execution of our system behind the Plan to Win, the entrepreneurial power of our owner/operators who are widening the gap versus our competition, and our disciplined operational and financial controls continue to drive our business forward. 
We will be entering 2011 from a position of strength. We remain confident in our sales momentum and our system alignment has never been better. We are currently finalizing 2011 planning, visiting markets around the world and meeting with our local management teams who are focused on executing against our key business drivers, optimizing our menu, modernizing the McDonald's experience and broadening our accessibility. 
Though the global environment remains challenging, I'm confident McDonald's can continue to deliver long-term growth and value for our system and our shareholders. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

What we know is as we look at and we've dealt with it in our European business over the years, as VAT increases start to come along, we have to be very smart about how we handle that through the menu board. We know the wrong answer is to immediately increase prices the full amount of that VAT increase. So we look at doing it in smaller pieces. Sometimes, we try to get a little bit ahead of the VAT increase, do it in small chunks. But really, if you look across the whole continent as you indicate, the economies are in various forms of recovery. So we really look at the individual markets, what's the consumer's appetite to pay a little more? What is going on with inflation? So as you point out, as we look at least preliminarily into Europe next year, we think commodity costs will be up about 3%. That is not an unreasonable number for us to manage through. And if inflation is a sign that the economies are picking up a little bit and the consumer will be able to pay a little more, then we certainly ought to be able to handle that through the menu board. But as we sit here today, we're just not exactly sure in which markets and when that would be. But to our business model in total, that type of increase in commodities is not insurmountable."

Angus is still performing well. Jim talked about the Angus Snack Wraps. There will be additional media and a continues weight of media relative to frappes and smoothies in the U.S. But also even broader, we still have an opportunity relative to the broader McCafe coffee.

And again, that's a very manageable number for us and nothing that we're terribly concerned about. So all in all, from an input cost side, we feel pretty good about heading into 2011. Labor, virtually all markets around the world are seeing increases in labor. But nothing that is again out of the ordinary or something that's so extreme that we have to do something dramatic in our pricing or suffer some dramatic hit to margins. So both commodities and labor, while going up, are in line with kind of what I'd go back to kind of some more normal trends for our business. And historically, we've said in the U.S., we need a 2% to 3% comp in normal times and Europe, probably a 3% plus comp in normal times to grow margins. And so I consider this more normal times from the input cost side. The question will be exactly at what point will we be able to take some of that pricing? But our early look at some of the 2011 plans, markets are anticipating they'll be able to take some pricing next year.  From an efficiency standpoint to offset some of that, we're constantly looking at operations within the restaurants. And one of the big enhancements we're in the process of rolling out through the U.S. is our new POS system which makes it easier for the crew to take the orders, easier to get the order right, they can do it faster. And basically what that means is increased throughput especially during our peak hours which makes us more efficient per labor hour."

We felt we do 400 to 500 starting out and it looks like we'll probably end up doing 200 by the end of the year, maybe 225. And really as I said in my comments, as we started the initial wave of this, we wanted to make sure that as we really have one chance to get this right and while we realized there's an opportunity to strike right now because we have the financial strength and the momentum, that's still not a reason just to go quickly if you don't have everything exactly nailed down. So we're making sure we've got the design's right, that we've got the quality of the materials right, that we've got the pricing right and like I said, it's because we really have one chance to do this right and we're going to do it. I would see that 200 number this year probably go up to 600 in 2011 based on the plans. So there is momentum and something that we're very encouraged about the operator participation in. When we talked about the sales lift, the 6% to 7% was our initial estimate. And that lift, just to remind you, is incremental to what's happening in the marketplace. And that we know over time that, that sales halo continues in that restaurant. We don't have a five-year track record of these things in the U.S. to tell you over five years what's going to happen.

In the U.S. one of the things we've been able to benefit from is the fact we've seen France and Australia move forward. In particular, Australia move forward even more aggressively relative to reimaging. So we've been able to take some of those ideas and the things that did work very well from those markets and really employ them in the U.S. designs as we move forward. Another point is that the U.S. designs are both internal and external at the same time. And so we're not just doing the internals of the restaurant. Some of those have been done a while ago. We're refreshing those. But this is the full reimage process that we're going through. So we wanted to make sure we got it right. We consciously slowed down and went back and revisited the design. Some of them we didn't think actually were aggressive enough in designs, and the franchisees have been a major, major part of how we looked at that. When we've looked at the results in Australia, and in Europe across Europe, the second and the third years have been very positive as we continue to move forward largely because of the reasons that Pete mentioned around menu as well as the awareness from customers. And the last point is, we know that as we get more and more of these done in the marketplace, there is a broader synergy that takes place from a consumer awareness perspective and that allows us to be able to reap the benefits of that in even stronger sales. So we feel real confident about where we are in the U.S. and I know that as we move into next year, the franchisees are ready to be more aggressive as well as our teams are ready to be more aggressive as we move forward.

One of the things we look at is what's going on with the food away from home index. And that's actually up a little bit on a trailing 12-month basis ended September. But also during the last economic downturn, if you will, we started to look also at food at home, what's going on at the grocery stores. Because as Don likes to say, the refrigerator is starting to become a big competitor of ours. And so food at home is still flat to down slightly as we look at the period. So we will be keeping an eye on what's going on both at the grocery stores and in the competitive market as we look at our pricing. But obviously, the momentum that we have, some of these premium beverages, while they don't necessarily qualify as a price increase, but introducing these premium beverages with high margins is definitely helping an accretive to cash flow as maybe we aren't able to take price on some other items. But we'll definitely be actively looking at the opportunities. And again, with some optimism, the economy is going to start to get a little bit stronger next year and we'll get some price increase."

Clearly Europe has looked at some of the other premium beverages is particularly looking at frappes and smoothies. They've done one offering of those type of beverages but they're looking at the U.S. execution. APMEA is looking at the same thing. From a margin perspective, keep in mind that as we implement some of the higher margin products, we're also looking at our tiered value offerings. So we're also looking at what we do in terms of breakfast offering to stimulate that daypart which is a huge opportunity for us across the big four in Europe. We're looking at the same things relative to the regular value menu. They brought back in Europe, the Double Cheeseburger in France. And the question is relative to what happens economically, to Jim's point early our model allows us to be able to flex the pricing in and out of that relative to what the economy will yield. And what the discretionary spending will look like. So keep in mind, it's not just about the implementation of beverages, that's one part. But it's also what we do with the rest of that menu. What beverages and higher margin products allow us to do is to be able to afford to execute our value platforms so that we can continue to gain market share and grow guest counts. That's really the biggest goal that we have in economic downturns, protecting grow the guest counts which then yield us higher levels of profitability."

As Pete mentioned the consumer spending, the consumer confidence, went down in September, unemployment still at 90.6% and the recovery we think is going to be elongated in America. And so if you look over the next 12 months, I think people are still talking about maybe getting to 8.5% or 9% unemployment. When we know that normalized unemployment rates in a robust economy are 4% or 5% at the most. And so we've got a long way to go there relative to consumer confidence and that confidence of being able to put food on the table at home or away from home. And I think jobs have a lot to do with it. So the improvement in the overall segment in September, I don't think is necessarily an earmark or a bellwether of things to come relative to the overall recovery except to say that we're certainly pleased with our performance and the fact that the rest of the industry is starting to come around is good for them, but I think in an overall indicator, that's probably not something that we would look at to say, ""We'll, we are in the middle of a recovery."""

And that's why Jim had referenced it. It's a focus area for Europe. They know there's opportunities not only to add more drive-throughs to satisfy that demand but also to improve those drive-through operations to attract more customers. Historically, as Jim mentioned, these bad tax increases are probably going to be more incremental than they are substantial. And in the past, you've had that increases that have tended to be more substantial and so you had to take a longer period to get those blended to the menu board, if you will. And so again I'm not sure there's a historical comparison for us to make especially considering the economic environment and all else that's going on.

And now they're going through a lot of shorting out of the details relative to the full implication which doesn't happen until 2014. And so the administration continues to work very hard with companies like McDonald's to sort this out to make sure that we are implementing this the appropriate way. So that most people that have access to health care are going to be covered appropriately. The flap that I'm sure you're referring to had to do with the limited benefit plans, the many patches they recall, that covers some 30,000 people in McDonald's but 1.4 million people across America which is interesting to know. And there was a headline saying that we were going to drop coverage while we were never ever going to drop coverage while I was going to provide coverage. But the regulations around the insurance companies and their obligations to cover these MiniMed plans was in jeopardy without a waiver. Now we think that health and human service is going to be very good about giving waivers to companies that are going to be able to continue to cover these very important people on these smaller plans. Other than that, there's not a lot more to say about health care certainly there's a lot of pushback on the one side of the aisle relative to the Republicans in the midterm elections and everything going on here. But for us, the diligent work around proper implementation of this plan both with our franchisees through the administration and were working closely with them to make sure we get it right. It is where we're spending our time. And that's really all we have to say at the moment and it's a work in progress."

I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest business results that reflect our continued global strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 6%. Operating income increased 11% on constant currencies and earnings per share reached $1.29, a 15% increase in constant currencies.
Our momentum is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to increase 5% to 6%. Our strength remains broad-based with each area of the world contributing to our growth. And we're continuing to grow market share in our major markets.
In an informal eating-out category that varies from markets that are in decline to markets that are just growing slightly. These results marked our 30th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases and this is truly a testament to our ability to perform in any economy. We continue to deliver what our customers are looking for: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant menu offerings, with an emphasis on local taste. And it's all resonating with our customers.
In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 5.3% and operating income grew 7%. And most important, we continue to significantly increase traffic into our restaurants.
On the big menu news, this summer was the extension of our Beverage platform with the launch of strawberry, banana and wild berry smoothies and the rehit of frappes. Sales from the smoothies launch well exceeded our expectations in both products are being purchased throughout the day. Both of these high-margin beverages continue to sell at a strong pace. U.S. also drove quarterly results with value across the menu including the continuation of our Breakfast Dollar Menu. And on the convenience front, we're continuing to be available for more guests more often with nearly 40% of our U.S. restaurants now open 24 hours and more than 80% open by 5:00 a.m. in the morning.
In August, we launched the Angus Snack Wrap line with three choices at $1.99. This new introduction performed very well and has lifted sales of our entire Angus Burger category.
Our new beverage and snack wrap platforms contributed to the trailing 12-month period ending in August and delivered the highest guests counts in more than 20 years in the U.S., even as the overall industry continued to be stagnant.
We're innovating and we're executing and it's giving more people more reasons to choose McDonald's. Our customers continue to give us permission to stretch our brand, and we're delivering at the quality, value and speed of McDonald's.
This month, we're featuring our core products of McCafé beverages through a monopoly tie-in with Walmart gift cards. And in November, we will advertise the always popular McRib on a national basis for a limited time, something we've not done for years.
Early next year, we will be launching oatmeal with maple brown sugar, apples, raisins and cranberries available all day. And in market test, our customers love the taste, nutrition profile and the expanded menu choice.
Now turning to Europe, we had another strong quarter.  Comparable sales increased 4.1% and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. Now while the overall informal eating-out category in Europe remained in decline, we continued to take share in all of our major markets.
The key driver of growth across Europe continues to be our focus on modernizing and elevating the customer experience. More than 2/3 of our restaurant interiors in Europe are now reimaged and provide an ever-more contemporary and relevant environment for our guests and the people working in our restaurants. Meanwhile, our customer satisfaction scores improved across the continent as we work to continually enhance our service with the biggest gains coming from drive-thru times and order accuracy.
Across Europe, we're striking the right blend of variety and choice, broadening our accessibility and appealing to a wide array of consumer segments. In Germany, for example, sales benefited from the launch of McWrap, a premium range of chicken and beef wrap sandwiches and, of course, everyday affordable pricing across the menu. Germany and many other markets feature a Coca-Cola glass promotion with the purchase of an Extra Value Meal driving some of our highest Extra Value Meal sales in history. 
We also saw success with the reintroduction of menu favorites, the M sandwich in the U.K., a premium burger with Artisan bread and the popular Double Cheeseburger in France. The Beverage platform, while different than the U.S., also contributed to results. We've recently launched Frappes, Europe's enhanced milkshakes, in several markets including France and Switzerland where it is contributing to the growth of the snacking daypart. And we are now the largest seller of coffee in the U.K., as premium bean-to-cup and specialty coffees continue to attract the growing number of consumers especially when a great McDonald's breakfast is available to go along with it.
Looking ahead, we know the economic environment remains challenging with austerity measures continuing to be implemented. In January, the VAT will increase in the U.K., Holland and Portugal and others could follow. Yet we remain confident that our business model will endure. We expect our customer focus, menu pipeline and the ongoing modernization of our restaurants will continue to deliver long-term results.
Now looking to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where we also achieved strong growth, comparable sales for the quarter increased 8.1% and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. Results were strong across the segment with nearly half the markets delivering double-digit comparable sales increases. We're driving results through a focus on convenience, value and a balance of core and local offerings. Australia made gains with new menu items including a promotional addition to its extremely popular Angus platform. The new sandwich, Angus the Third featured the popular tomato chili relish and scored extremely well with our consumers. 
The market also rolled out a new patty for all premium chicken sandwiches driving an increase in sales across the entire premium chicken category. The addition of the new Breakfast Roll and Breakfast Wrap helped grow comp sales and guests counts during the breakfast daypart. And Australia continued to focus on running better restaurants as it achieved some of its best service scores on record with improvements in drive-thru speed and accuracy leading the way.
Our other major markets in APMEA, China and Japan also delivered. Value continues to be a key driver. China's Value Lunch program remains popular and continues to grow sales and traffic. The Value Lunch is now moved into nearly every market in greater Asia and accounts for more than 10% of the total sales in the region. 
Outstanding operations continue to drive growth and differentiate the experience in China with the market consistently achieving some of our best customer satisfaction scores. Our strategies in China are resonating with the consumers and our fundamentals are strong as evidenced by China's third quarter 12.7% comparable sales increase.
Meanwhile in Japan we remain competitive through relevant menu offerings and promotions. We delivered gains from a strong Big Mac campaign and a new lemon chicken sandwich, both of which proved extremely popular. Japanese consumers also reacted favorably to our recent Food Strap promotion which offered miniature models of our iconic products such as Big Mac and fries for customers to actually strap to their cell phones. The program was a huge hit and helped drive sales profits and new guests visits as we combined the popular local trend with the popularity of our iconic products.
Japan's other big win was the launch of its value breakfast featuring McDonald's Sausage McMuffin and Sausage McGriddle helping drive sales and revitalize our Breakfast business.
So those are a few of the highlights around our continued momentum. We're delivering the food and beverages our customers want and the value that they expect and an overall dining and brand experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers' lives.
We're also continuing our commitment to financial discipline. We have a strong balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry allowing continued access to capital. And it continues to facilitate access to credit for our owner/operators to reinvest in their restaurants.
We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share or the equivalent of $2.44 annually. Combined with share repurchases, we expected our total cash return to shareholders for 2010 to reach an approximation of $5 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance and confident that we'll continue to keep driving our business forward. 
Now while it's been said by economists that the recession has technically ended and signs of progress are slowly emerging, the global economy remains fragile and consumers continue to be cautious. By continuing to innovate, invest and deliver what our customers want, we will continue to gain market share and grow our business. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."
139488,113677100,80936,"McDonald's Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system. Our alignment behind the Plan to Win again generated significant increases across all of our key measures: comparable sales and guests counts, mar",1354,"Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system. Our alignment behind the Plan to Win again generated significant increases across all of our key measures: comparable sales and guests counts, market share, operating income and returns. Combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 150 basis points to 31.4% for the nine months. This is a direct result of growth in both our consolidated franchise margins and our company-operated margins along with effective G&A control.
In the U.S., the successful introduction of McCafe Smoothies in July and the ongoing demand for our core menu drove gains in both comparable sales and guest counts. While our pricing remains relatively flat versus a year ago, we are especially encouraged that our traffic growth was about 1.5x that of our comparable sales growth through September. Lower food and paper costs along with top line growth contributed to an increase in company-operated margins of 270 basis points to 22% in the third quarter.
Equally important, our U.S. franchisees are generating significant increases in their annual cash flow per restaurant, now averaging over $350,000, a 15% increase over a year ago. This speaks to the health of our overall business and contributes significantly to our operators' willingness and ability to reinvest in their restaurants.
On the cost side, our third quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, contributing around 200 basis points to the margin expansion, similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year. However, the comparisons become unfavorable in the fourth quarter as we face a 1% to 2% increase in commodity cost compared with fourth quarter 2009. This still results in our overall food and paper costs being down 3% to 4% for the full year.
In Europe, the grocery bill declined to a more modest 1% in the third quarter. We now project commodity cost will be down 2% to 3% for the full year. This means that Europe will experience a slight increase in commodity cost in the fourth quarter compared with a decline of 3% in fourth quarter last year.
European company-operated margins increased 160 basis points in the third quarter to 22%. Comparable sales gains in Russia, the U.K., Spain and many other markets coupled with lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor costs. Menu prices increased an average of 2% to 3% across the segment over the past 12 months, but varied by market. As we head into the fourth quarter, some of these price increases will roll off and the current economic environment will impact our pricing power adding to short-term margin pressure, but nothing we haven't successfully navigated through before. 
In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 18.9%. Positive comparative sales were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region. We have an effective price increase in APMEA of about 1% and similar to Europe, it varies by market.
Now turning to franchise margins. Third quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.7 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidated franchise margin percent increased 60 basis points to 83.3% driven by positive global comparable sales.
The third component of combined operating margin is G&A which we continue to actively manage. For the third quarter, G&A was up slightly due in part to increased incentive compensation accruals based on our strong results. Fourth quarter G&A should be relatively flat resulting in a full year increase of about 3%.
On the other operating income line, similar to last quarter, we experienced lower gains on sales of restaurants in the third quarter compared with the prior year. More broadly speaking, the components of other operating income often include items such as gains, asset disposition costs, asset write-offs in part due to reimaging, and other unique items. Since many of these items are transactional in nature, it makes comparisons between certain quarters difficult. This was the case in the third quarter, and we also expect comparisons will be challenging in the fourth quarter where our current estimate for total other operating income is less than half of the $67 million recognized in fourth quarter 2009.
Let's now move on to something I know you're all very interested in, the cash generated from our operations. Our first priority for this cash is to reinvest in our business to build strong sales, profitability and returns. We have slightly trimmed our 2010 CapEx estimate from $2.4 billion to $2.3 billion, primarily due to currency translation and fewer completions of reimaging projects in the U.S. versus our original budget. This was a purposeful and strategic reduction which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Approximately half of our capital expenditures are spent on our existing restaurants. As we expect to reimage approximately 1,800 restaurants around the world this year, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the activities in our three major segments. 
In the U.S., we have completed about 40 sites and expect another 350 restaurants to be reimaged within six months. We're being very deliberate in our approach, testing different designs, closely examining our costs, and making sure that we have adequate sales history post-reimaging to evaluate the returns. In short, we're focused on doing this right versus doing it quickly. While it is still early, given the relative small sample size and limited timeframe, preliminary results are in line with or better than our initial 6% to 7% incremental sales list estimates. 
Most importantly, we're encouraged by the support of our owner/operators who are leading this transformation of this brand in the U.S. In Europe, we have reimaged about 500 restaurants through September primarily in our largest markets: France, the U.K. and Germany. Europe plans to have about 90% of its interiors remodeled by 2012. Exterior reimaging tends to take longer due to permitting time and other regulations.
In APMEA, we are leveraging some of the European designs and are focused on both interior and exterior remodels, particularly in China and Japan. Australia is virtually 100% reimaged.
In addition to reinvestment, we are spending the other half of our capital expenditures to open new restaurants. We are on track to open 1,000 new restaurants this year. Approximately half of these openings will be in APMEA including 150 to 175 in China. Another 250 new restaurants will be opened in Europe, primarily in Russia, France and Germany.
The U.S. has already opened about 100 restaurants, well on its way to a total of 150 new restaurants this year. And the remaining 100 restaurants will be opened in Latin America and Canada.
Now let's spend a few minutes talking foreign currency. As you know, exchange rates have changed significantly since I last updated you. At current rates, we now expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by only $0.01 resulting in a full year benefit from currency translation of about $0.01. 
As I have said before, current volatility renders any estimate outdated within days, so please take this as directional guidance only. As most of you know, we believe constant currency results provide a more complete picture of the underlying strength of our business.
In closing, I'm proud to say that the focused execution of our system behind the Plan to Win, the entrepreneurial power of our owner/operators who are widening the gap versus our competition, and our disciplined operational and financial controls continue to drive our business forward. 
We will be entering 2011 from a position of strength. We remain confident in our sales momentum and our system alignment has never been better. We are currently finalizing 2011 planning, visiting markets around the world and meeting with our local management teams who are focused on executing against our key business drivers, optimizing our menu, modernizing the McDonald's experience and broadening our accessibility. 
Though the global environment remains challenging, I'm confident McDonald's can continue to deliver long-term growth and value for our system and our shareholders. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

What we know is as we look at and we've dealt with it in our European business over the years, as VAT increases start to come along, we have to be very smart about how we handle that through the menu board. We know the wrong answer is to immediately increase prices the full amount of that VAT increase. So we look at doing it in smaller pieces. Sometimes, we try to get a little bit ahead of the VAT increase, do it in small chunks. But really, if you look across the whole continent as you indicate, the economies are in various forms of recovery. So we really look at the individual markets, what's the consumer's appetite to pay a little more? What is going on with inflation? So as you point out, as we look at least preliminarily into Europe next year, we think commodity costs will be up about 3%. That is not an unreasonable number for us to manage through. And if inflation is a sign that the economies are picking up a little bit and the consumer will be able to pay a little more, then we certainly ought to be able to handle that through the menu board. But as we sit here today, we're just not exactly sure in which markets and when that will be. But to our business model in total, that type of increase in commodities is not insurmountable."

Labor, virtually all markets around the world are seeing increases in labor, but nothing that is again out of the ordinary or something that's so extreme that we'd have to do something dramatic in our pricing or suffer some dramatic hit to margins. So both commodities and labor, while going up, are in line with kind of what I'd -- go back to kind of some more normal trends for our business. And historically, we've said in the U.S., we need a 2% to 3% comp in normal times and Europe probably a 3% plus comp in normal times to grow margins. And so I consider this more normal times from the input cost side. The question will be exactly at what point will we be able to take some of that pricing? But our early look at some of the 2011 plans, markets are anticipating they'll be able to take some pricing next year.  From an efficiency standpoint to offset some of that, we're constantly looking at operations within the restaurants. And one of the big enhancements we're in the process of rolling out through the U.S. is our new POS system which makes it easier for the crew to take the orders, easier to get the order right, they can do it faster. And basically what that means is increased throughput especially during our peak hours which makes us more efficient per labor hour."

And really, as I said in my comments, as we started the initial wave of this, we wanted to make sure that as we really have one chance to get this right. And while we realize there's an opportunity to strike right now because we have the financial strength and the momentum, that's still not a reason just to go quickly if you don't have everything exactly nailed down. So we're making sure we've got the design's right, that we've got the quality of the materials right, that we've got the pricing right and, like I said, it's because we really have one chance to do this right and we're going to do it. I would see that 200 number this year probably go up to 600 in 2011 based on the plans. So there is momentum and something that we're very encouraged about the operator participation in. When we talked about the sales lift, the 6% to 7% was our initial estimate. And that lift, just to remind you, is incremental to what's happening in the marketplace and that we know over time that, that sales halo continues in that restaurant. We don't have a five-year track record of these things in the U.S. to tell you over five years what's going to happen.

In particular, Australia move forward even more aggressively relative to reimaging. So we've been able to take some of those ideas and the things that did work very well from those markets and really employ them in the U.S. designs as we move forward. Another point is that the U.S. designs are both internal and external at the same time. And so we're not just doing the internals of the restaurant. Some of those have been done a while ago. We're refreshing those. But this is the full reimage process that we're going through. So we wanted to make sure we got it right. We consciously slowed down and went back and revisited the design. Some of them we didn't think actually were aggressive enough in designs, and the franchisees have been a major, major part of how we've looked at that. When we've looked at the results in Australia and in Europe, across Europe, the second and the third years have been very positive as we continue to move forward largely because of the reasons that Pete mentioned around menu as well as the awareness from customers. And the last point is, we know that as we get more and more of these done in the marketplace, there is a broader synergy that takes place from a consumer awareness perspective and that allows us to be able to reap the benefits of that in even stronger sales. So we feel real confident about where we are in the U.S. and I know that as we move into next year, the franchisees are ready to be more aggressive as well as our teams are ready to be more aggressive as we move forward.

So we will be keeping an eye on what's going on both at the grocery stores and in the competitive market as we look at our pricing.

So we're also looking at what we do in terms of breakfast offerings to stimulate that daypart which is a huge opportunity for us across the big four in Europe. We're looking at the same things relative to the regular value menu. They brought back in Europe the Double Cheeseburger in France. And the question is relative to what happens economically. To Jim's point earlier, our model allows us to be able to flex the pricing in and out of that relative to what the economy will yield and what the discretionary spending will look like. So keep in mind, it's not just about the implementation of beverages. That's one part. But it's also what we do with the rest of that menu. What beverages and higher margin products allow us to do is to be able to afford to execute our value platforms so that we can continue to gain market share and grow guest counts.

First of all, relative to the overall segment and the improvement, we continue to look at the same things. As Pete mentioned, the consumer spending, the consumer confidence went down in September, unemployment still at 9.6% and the recovery, we think, is going to be elongated in America. And so if you look over the next 12 months, I think people are still talking about maybe getting to 8.5% or 9% unemployment when we know that normalized unemployment rates in a robust economy are 4% or 5% at the most. And so we've got a long way to go there relative to consumer confidence and that confidence of people being able to put food on the table at home or away from home. And I think jobs have a lot to do with it. So the improvement in the overall segment in September, I don't think is necessarily an earmark or a bellwether of things to come relative to the overall recovery except to say that we're certainly pleased with our performance and the fact that the rest of the industry is starting to come around is good for them. But I think in an overall indicator, that's probably not something that we would look at to say, ""We'll, we are in the middle of a recovery."""

And so when you think about the U.S. being 67% drive-thru, that's a huge opportunity for us to increase that. And that's why Jim had referenced it, it's a focus area for Europe. They know there's opportunities not only to add more drive-thrus to satisfy that demand, but also to improve those drive-thru operations to attract more customers. Historically, as Jim mentioned, these VAT tax increases are probably going to be more incremental than they are substantial. And in the past, you've had VAT increases that have tended to be more substantial and so you had to take a longer period to get those bled into the menu board, if you will. And so again I'm not sure there's a historical comparison for us to make, especially considering the economic environment and all else that's going on. But again, I get back to the confidence we have in our ability to manage through this with our business model and new products. The beverages certainly will help. I don't know that they'll have -- at least as of now as you look into 2011, they probably won't be as impactful in Europe as they are in the U.S. But certainly over time, all of the markets have beverages in their plans and on their plates to take a look at."

Well, now we think that Health and Human Services is going to be very good about giving waivers to companies that are going to be able to continue to cover these very important people on these smaller plans. Other than that, there's not a lot more to say about health care. Certainly there's a lot of pushback on the one side of the aisle relative to the Republicans and the midterm elections and everything going on here.

I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest business results that reflect our continued global strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 6%. Operating income increased 11% on constant currencies and earnings per share reached $1.29, a 15% increase in constant currencies.
Our momentum is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to increase 5% to 6%. Our strength remains broad-based with each area of the world contributing to our growth. And we're continuing to grow market share in our major markets.
In an informal eating-out category that varies from markets that are in decline to markets that are just growing slightly. These results marked our 30th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases and this is truly a testament to our ability to perform in any economy. We continue to deliver what our customers are looking for: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant menu offerings, with an emphasis on local taste. And it's all resonating with our customers.
In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 5.3% and operating income grew 7%. And most important, we continue to significantly increase traffic into our restaurants.
On the big menu news, this summer was the extension of our Beverage platform with the launch of strawberry, banana and wild berry smoothies and the rehit of frappes. Sales from the smoothies launch well exceeded our expectations in both products are being purchased throughout the day. Both of these high-margin beverages continue to sell at a strong pace. U.S. also drove quarterly results with value across the menu including the continuation of our Breakfast Dollar Menu. And on the convenience front, we're continuing to be available for more guests more often with nearly 40% of our U.S. restaurants now open 24 hours and more than 80% open by 5:00 a.m. in the morning.
In August, we launched the Angus Snack Wrap line with three choices at $1.99. This new introduction performed very well and has lifted sales of our entire Angus Burger category.
Our new beverage and snack wrap platforms contributed to the trailing 12-month period ending in August and delivered the highest guests counts in more than 20 years in the U.S., even as the overall industry continued to be stagnant.
We're innovating and we're executing and it's giving more people more reasons to choose McDonald's. Our customers continue to give us permission to stretch our brand, and we're delivering at the quality, value and speed of McDonald's.
This month, we're featuring our core products of McCafé beverages through a monopoly tie-in with Walmart gift cards. And in November, we will advertise the always popular McRib on a national basis for a limited time, something we've not done for years.
Early next year, we will be launching oatmeal with maple brown sugar, apples, raisins and cranberries available all day. And in market test, our customers love the taste, nutrition profile and the expanded menu choice.
Now turning to Europe, we had another strong quarter.  Comparable sales increased 4.1% and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. Now while the overall informal eating-out category in Europe remained in decline, we continued to take share in all of our major markets.
The key driver of growth across Europe continues to be our focus on modernizing and elevating the customer experience. More than 2/3 of our restaurant interiors in Europe are now reimaged and provide an ever-more contemporary and relevant environment for our guests and the people working in our restaurants. Meanwhile, our customer satisfaction scores improved across the continent as we work to continually enhance our service with the biggest gains coming from drive-thru times and order accuracy.
Across Europe, we're striking the right blend of variety and choice, broadening our accessibility and appealing to a wide array of consumer segments. In Germany, for example, sales benefited from the launch of McWrap, a premium range of chicken and beef wrap sandwiches and, of course, everyday affordable pricing across the menu. Germany and many other markets feature a Coca-Cola glass promotion with the purchase of an Extra Value Meal driving some of our highest Extra Value Meal sales in history. 
We also saw success with the reintroduction of menu favorites, the M sandwich in the U.K., a premium burger with Artisan bread and the popular Double Cheeseburger in France. The Beverage platform, while different than the U.S., also contributed to results. We've recently launched Frappes, Europe's enhanced milkshakes, in several markets including France and Switzerland where it is contributing to the growth of the snacking daypart. And we are now the largest seller of coffee in the U.K., as premium bean-to-cup and specialty coffees continue to attract the growing number of consumers especially when a great McDonald's breakfast is available to go along with it.
Looking ahead, we know the economic environment remains challenging with austerity measures continuing to be implemented. In January, the VAT will increase in the U.K., Holland and Portugal and others could follow. Yet we remain confident that our business model will endure. We expect our customer focus, menu pipeline and the ongoing modernization of our restaurants will continue to deliver long-term results.
Now looking to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where we also achieved strong growth, comparable sales for the quarter increased 8.1% and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. Results were strong across the segment with nearly half the markets delivering double-digit comparable sales increases. We're driving results through a focus on convenience, value and a balance of core and local offerings. Australia made gains with new menu items including a promotional addition to its extremely popular Angus platform. The new sandwich, Angus the Third featured the popular tomato chili relish and scored extremely well with our consumers. 
The market also rolled out a new patty for all premium chicken sandwiches driving an increase in sales across the entire premium chicken category. The addition of the new Breakfast Roll and Breakfast Wrap helped grow comp sales and guests counts during the breakfast daypart. And Australia continued to focus on running better restaurants as it achieved some of its best service scores on record with improvements in drive-thru speed and accuracy leading the way.
Our other major markets in APMEA, China and Japan also delivered. Value continues to be a key driver. China's Value Lunch program remains popular and continues to grow sales and traffic. The Value Lunch is now moved into nearly every market in greater Asia and accounts for more than 10% of the total sales in the region. 
Outstanding operations continue to drive growth and differentiate the experience in China with the market consistently achieving some of our best customer satisfaction scores. Our strategies in China are resonating with the consumers and our fundamentals are strong as evidenced by China's third quarter 12.7% comparable sales increase.
Meanwhile in Japan we remain competitive through relevant menu offerings and promotions. We delivered gains from a strong Big Mac campaign and a new lemon chicken sandwich, both of which proved extremely popular. Japanese consumers also reacted favorably to our recent Food Strap promotion which offered miniature models of our iconic products such as Big Mac and fries for customers to actually strap to their cell phones. The program was a huge hit and helped drive sales profits and new guests visits as we combined the popular local trend with the popularity of our iconic products.
Japan's other big win was the launch of its value breakfast featuring McDonald's Sausage McMuffin and Sausage McGriddle helping drive sales and revitalize our Breakfast business.
So those are a few of the highlights around our continued momentum. We're delivering the food and beverages our customers want and the value that they expect and an overall dining and brand experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers' lives.
We're also continuing our commitment to financial discipline. We have a strong balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry allowing continued access to capital. And it continues to facilitate access to credit for our owner/operators to reinvest in their restaurants.
We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share or the equivalent of $2.44 annually. Combined with share repurchases, we expected our total cash return to shareholders for 2010 to reach an approximation of $5 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance and confident that we'll continue to keep driving our business forward. 
Now while it's been said by economists that the recession has technically ended and signs of progress are slowly emerging, the global economy remains fragile and consumers continue to be cautious. By continuing to innovate, invest and deliver what our customers want, we will continue to gain market share and grow our business. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."
139488,113677100,1757568,"McDonald's Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system.

Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system. Our alignment behind the Plan to Win again generated significant increases across all of our key measures: comparable sales and guests counts, market share, operating income and returns. Combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 150 basis points to 31.4% for the nine months. This is a direct result of growth in both our consolidated franchise margins and our company-operated margins along with effective G&A control.
In the U.S., the successful introduction of McCafe Smoothies in July and the ongoing demand for our core menu drove gains in both comparable sales and guest counts. While our pricing remains relatively flat versus a year ago, we are especially encouraged that our traffic growth was about 1.5x that of our comparable sales growth through September. Lower food and paper costs along with top line growth contributed to an increase in company-operated margins of 270 basis points to 22% in the third quarter.
Equally important, our U.S. franchisees are generating significant increases in their annual cash flow per restaurant, now averaging over $350,000, a 15% increase over a year ago. This speaks to the health of our overall business and contributes significantly to our operators' willingness and ability to reinvest in their restaurants.
On the cost side, our third quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, contributing around 200 basis points to the margin expansion, similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year. However, the comparisons become unfavorable in the fourth quarter as we face a 1% to 2% increase in commodity cost compared with fourth quarter 2009. This still results in our overall food and paper costs being down 3% to 4% for the full year.
In Europe, the grocery bill declined to a more modest 1% in the third quarter. We now project commodity cost will be down 2% to 3% for the full year. This means that Europe will experience a slight increase in commodity cost in the fourth quarter compared with a decline of 3% in fourth quarter last year.
European company-operated margins increased 160 basis points in the third quarter to 22%. Comparable sales gains in Russia, the U.K., Spain and many other markets coupled with lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor costs. Menu prices increased an average of 2% to 3% across the segment over the past 12 months, but varied by market. As we head into the fourth quarter, some of these price increases will roll off and the current economic environment will impact our pricing power adding to short-term margin pressure, but nothing we haven't successfully navigated through before. 
In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 18.9%. Positive comparative sales were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region. We have an effective price increase in APMEA of about 1% and similar to Europe, it varies by market.
Now turning to franchise margins. Third quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.7 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidated franchise margin percent increased 60 basis points to 83.3% driven by positive global comparable sales.
The third component of combined operating margin is G&A which we continue to actively manage. For the third quarter, G&A was up slightly due in part to increased incentive compensation accruals based on our strong results. Fourth quarter G&A should be relatively flat resulting in a full year increase of about 3%.
On the other operating income line, similar to last quarter, we experienced lower gains on sales of restaurants in the third quarter compared with the prior year. More broadly speaking, the components of other operating income often include items such as gains, asset disposition costs, asset write-offs in part due to reimaging, and other unique items. Since many of these items are transactional in nature, it makes comparisons between certain quarters difficult. This was the case in the third quarter, and we also expect comparisons will be challenging in the fourth quarter where our current estimate for total other operating income is less than half of the $67 million recognized in fourth quarter 2009.
Let's now move on to something I know you're all very interested in, the cash generated from our operations. Our first priority for this cash is to reinvest in our business to build strong sales, profitability and returns. We have slightly trimmed our 2010 CapEx estimate from $2.4 billion to $2.3 billion, primarily due to currency translation and fewer completions of reimaging projects in the U.S. versus our original budget. This was a purposeful and strategic reduction which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Approximately half of our capital expenditures are spent on our existing restaurants. As we expect to reimage approximately 1,800 restaurants around the world this year, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the activities in our three major segments. 
In the U.S., we have completed about 40 sites and expect another 350 restaurants to be reimaged within six months. We're being very deliberate in our approach, testing different designs, closely examining our costs, and making sure that we have adequate sales history post-reimaging to evaluate the returns. In short, we're focused on doing this right versus doing it quickly. While it is still early, given the relative small sample size and limited timeframe, preliminary results are in line with or better than our initial 6% to 7% incremental sales list estimates. 
Most importantly, we're encouraged by the support of our owner/operators who are leading this transformation of this brand in the U.S. In Europe, we have reimaged about 500 restaurants through September primarily in our largest markets: France, the U.K. and Germany. Europe plans to have about 90% of its interiors remodeled by 2012. Exterior reimaging tends to take longer due to permitting time and other regulations.
In APMEA, we are leveraging some of the European designs and are focused on both interior and exterior remodels, particularly in China and Japan. Australia is virtually 100% reimaged.
In addition to reinvestment, we are spending the other half of our capital expenditures to open new restaurants. We are on track to open 1,000 new restaurants this year. Approximately half of these openings will be in APMEA including 150 to 175 in China. Another 250 new restaurants will be opened in Europe, primarily in Russia, France and Germany.
The U.S. has already opened about 100 restaurants, well on its way to a total of 150 new restaurants this year. And the remaining 100 restaurants will be opened in Latin America and Canada.
Now let's spend a few minutes talking foreign currency. As you know, exchange rates have changed significantly since I last updated you. At current rates, we now expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by only $0.01 resulting in a full year benefit from currency translation of about $0.01. 
As I have said before, current volatility renders any estimate outdated within days, so please take this as directional guidance only. As most of you know, we believe constant currency results provide a more complete picture of the underlying strength of our business.
In closing, I'm proud to say that the focused execution of our system behind the Plan to Win, the entrepreneurial power of our owner/operators who are widening the gap versus our competition, and our disciplined operational and financial controls continue to drive our business forward. 
We will be entering 2011 from a position of strength. We remain confident in our sales momentum and our system alignment has never been better. We are currently finalizing 2011 planning, visiting markets around the world and meeting with our local management teams who are focused on executing against our key business drivers, optimizing our menu, modernizing the McDonald's experience and broadening our accessibility. 
Though the global environment remains challenging, I'm confident McDonald's can continue to deliver long-term growth and value for our system and our shareholders. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A."

What we know is as we look at and we've dealt with it in our European business over the years, as VAT increases start to come along, we have to be very smart about how we handle that through the menu board. We know the wrong answer is to immediately increase prices the full amount of that VAT increase. So we look at doing it in smaller pieces. Sometimes, we try to get a little bit ahead of the VAT increase, do it in small chunks. But really, if you look across the whole continent as you indicate, the economies are in various forms of recovery. So we really look at the individual markets, what's the consumer's appetite to pay a little more? What is going on with inflation? So as you point out, as we look at least preliminarily into Europe next year, we think commodity costs will be up about 3%. That is not an unreasonable number for us to manage through. And if inflation is a sign that the economies are picking up a little bit and the consumer will be able to pay a little more, then we certainly ought to be able to handle that through the menu board. But as we sit here today, we're just not exactly sure in which markets and when that will be. But to our business model in total, that type of increase in commodities is not insurmountable."

There will be additional media and a continuous weight of media relative to frappes and smoothies in the U.S. But also even broader, we still have an opportunity relative to the broader McCafe coffee.

And again, that's a very manageable number for us and nothing that we're terribly concerned about. So all in all, from an input cost side, we feel pretty good about heading into 2011. Labor, virtually all markets around the world are seeing increases in labor, but nothing that is again out of the ordinary or something that's so extreme that we'd have to do something dramatic in our pricing or suffer some dramatic hit to margins. So both commodities and labor, while going up, are in line with kind of what I'd -- go back to kind of some more normal trends for our business. And historically, we've said in the U.S., we need a 2% to 3% comp in normal times and Europe probably a 3% plus comp in normal times to grow margins. And so I consider this more normal times from the input cost side. The question will be exactly at what point will we be able to take some of that pricing? But our early look at some of the 2011 plans, markets are anticipating they'll be able to take some pricing next year.  From an efficiency standpoint to offset some of that, we're constantly looking at operations within the restaurants. And one of the big enhancements we're in the process of rolling out through the U.S. is our new POS system which makes it easier for the crew to take the orders, easier to get the order right, they can do it faster. And basically what that means is increased throughput especially during our peak hours which makes us more efficient per labor hour."

I'll give you a perspective and certainly if Don or Jim want to jump in, they can do that. I think we started out with an aggressive goal this year. We felt we'd do 400 to 500 starting out and it looks like we'll probably end up doing 200 by the end of the year, maybe 225. And really, as I said in my comments, as we started the initial wave of this, we wanted to make sure that as we really have one chance to get this right. And while we realize there's an opportunity to strike right now because we have the financial strength and the momentum, that's still not a reason just to go quickly if you don't have everything exactly nailed down. So we're making sure we've got the design's right, that we've got the quality of the materials right, that we've got the pricing right and, like I said, it's because we really have one chance to do this right and we're going to do it. I would see that 200 number this year probably go up to 600 in 2011 based on the plans. So there is momentum and something that we're very encouraged about the operator participation in. When we talked about the sales lift, the 6% to 7% was our initial estimate. And that lift, just to remind you, is incremental to what's happening in the marketplace and that we know over time that, that sales halo continues in that restaurant. We don't have a five-year track record of these things in the U.S. to tell you over five years what's going to happen. But our instincts tell us that those sales will continue to be positive primarily because of the opportunity it gives us to introduce new menu items, introduce new customers back to that restaurant, et cetera. So we're very bullish on the opportunity it provides not only in year one, but sustaining."

In particular, Australia move forward even more aggressively relative to reimaging. So we've been able to take some of those ideas and the things that did work very well from those markets and really employ them in the U.S. designs as we move forward. Another point is that the U.S. designs are both internal and external at the same time. And so we're not just doing the internals of the restaurant. Some of those have been done a while ago. We're refreshing those. But this is the full reimage process that we're going through. So we wanted to make sure we got it right. We consciously slowed down and went back and revisited the design. Some of them we didn't think actually were aggressive enough in designs, and the franchisees have been a major, major part of how we've looked at that. When we've looked at the results in Australia and in Europe, across Europe, the second and the third years have been very positive as we continue to move forward largely because of the reasons that Pete mentioned around menu as well as the awareness from customers. And the last point is, we know that as we get more and more of these done in the marketplace, there is a broader synergy that takes place from a consumer awareness perspective and that allows us to be able to reap the benefits of that in even stronger sales. So we feel real confident about where we are in the U.S. and I know that as we move into next year, the franchisees are ready to be more aggressive as well as our teams are ready to be more aggressive as we move forward. We've got the right designs now. So we feel pretty good about it."

Because as Don likes to say, the refrigerator is starting to become a big competitor of ours. And so food at home is still flat to down slightly as we look at the period. So we will be keeping an eye on what's going on both at the grocery stores and in the competitive market as we look at our pricing. But obviously, the momentum that we have, some of these premium beverages, while they don't necessarily qualify as a price increase, but introducing these premium beverages with high margins is definitely helping an accretive to cash flow as maybe we aren't able to take price on some other items. But we'll definitely be actively looking at the opportunities. And again, with some optimism, the economy is going to start to get a little bit stronger next year and we'll get some price increase."

Clearly Europe has looked at some of the other premium beverages, is particularly looking at frappes and smoothies. They've done one offering of those type beverages, but they're looking at the U.S. execution. APMEA is looking at the same thing. From a margin perspective, keep in mind that as we implement some of the higher margin products, we're also looking at our tiered value offerings. So we're also looking at what we do in terms of breakfast offerings to stimulate that daypart which is a huge opportunity for us across the big four in Europe. We're looking at the same things relative to the regular value menu. They brought back in Europe the Double Cheeseburger in France. And the question is relative to what happens economically. To Jim's point earlier, our model allows us to be able to flex the pricing in and out of that relative to what the economy will yield and what the discretionary spending will look like. So keep in mind, it's not just about the implementation of beverages. That's one part. But it's also what we do with the rest of that menu. What beverages and higher margin products allow us to do is to be able to afford to execute our value platforms so that we can continue to gain market share and grow guest counts. That's really the biggest goal that we have in economic downturns, protect and grow the guest counts which then yield us higher levels of profitability."

As Pete mentioned, the consumer spending, the consumer confidence went down in September, unemployment still at 9.6% and the recovery, we think, is going to be elongated in America.

And so when you think about the U.S. being 67% drive-thru, that's a huge opportunity for us to increase that. And that's why Jim had referenced it, it's a focus area for Europe. They know there's opportunities not only to add more drive-thrus to satisfy that demand, but also to improve those drive-thru operations to attract more customers. Historically, as Jim mentioned, these VAT tax increases are probably going to be more incremental than they are substantial. And in the past, you've had VAT increases that have tended to be more substantial and so you had to take a longer period to get those bled into the menu board, if you will. And so again I'm not sure there's a historical comparison for us to make, especially considering the economic environment and all else that's going on. But again, I get back to the confidence we have in our ability to manage through this with our business model and new products. The beverages certainly will help. I don't know that they'll have -- at least as of now as you look into 2011, they probably won't be as impactful in Europe as they are in the U.S. But certainly over time, all of the markets have beverages in their plans and on their plates to take a look at."

And so when you talk about austerity in these countries, it's much about the benefits. If you look at France now, they're talking about raising the retirement age to 62 years old. Everybody's in a big flap. But what does that do to discretionary income for customers who could visit McDonald's? It's de minimis. And so the impact around a number of these austerity programs will not have a severe impact on discretionary spending of our consumers because they are supported at very high level already relative to social services and the other support they get from the government. So we've been able to absorb that over the years and, as Pete said, we will be able to do this as well during the coming months."

First of all, the Act was signed into law in March of 2010 and now they're going through a lot of sorting out of the details relative to the full implication which doesn't happen until 2014. And so the Administration continues to work very hard with companies like McDonald's to sort this out to make sure that we are implementing this the appropriate way so that most people that have access to health care are going to be covered appropriately. The flap that I'm sure you're referring to had to do with the limited benefit plans, the mini meds as they were called, that covers some 30,000 people in McDonald's, but 1.4 million people across America, which is interesting to know. And there was a headline saying that we were going to drop coverage. Well, we were never ever going to drop coverage. We're always going to provide coverage. But the regulations around the insurance companies and their obligations to cover these mini med plans was in jeopardy without a waiver. Well, now we think that Health and Human Services is going to be very good about giving waivers to companies that are going to be able to continue to cover these very important people on these smaller plans. Other than that, there's not a lot more to say about health care. Certainly there's a lot of pushback on the one side of the aisle relative to the Republicans and the midterm elections and everything going on here. But for us, the diligent work around proper implementation of this plan, both with our franchisees, through the Administration and were working closely with them to make sure we get it right, is where we're spending our time. And that's really all we have to say at the moment, and it's a work in progress."
