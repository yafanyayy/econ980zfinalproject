I guess, we're similar to our credo of our good client, U.S. Post Office. I will review the results for the quarter and the full year 2009, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance and how we see the year ahead. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail. After his remarks, I'll return with some agency-specific observations and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A.As you can see, the very tough economic environment resulted in an organic revenue decrease for the year of 10.8%. Notwithstanding, we were able to deliver operating income of $340 million and operating margin, excluding incremental severance with 6.9%. It bears mention that the high level of severance in the fourth quarter reflects softer-than-anticipated revenue in Europe and Japan. And the fact we weren't satisfied with 2010 run rates in those regions, as we move through our planning process late last year. Earnings per diluted share were $0.19. Looking at the quarter, the organic revenue decline of 8.2% represented a sequential improvement from the previous six months. This result is in keeping with our public comments since the October conference call, in which we've consistently been clear that we think the worst of the recession's impact on our business has passed. Economic conditions appear to have stabilized, and we believe that we should see improvement during the course of 2010. It's likely that progress won't be linear. But it's fair to say that it's a good time for our clients to refocus on building for the future and investing in their brands. Overall, I would characterize the tone of the business as one of tempered optimism, especially for the second half of 2010. But we have begun to see clients reengage with many of our project-driven marketing service companies and there's also a greater willingness on the part of our clients to commit to annual spending plans. That wasn't the case at the end of last year. As you remember, we indicated to you that even in a flat organic environment this year, we would be in a strong position to recoup much of the margin progress made from 2006 to 2008, and then continue building on that momentum in the years to come. Those are goals we continue to believe are readily achievable.Another item of note, as we review last year's performance is the degree to which our long-standing conservative approach to the balance sheet, again proved to be our target. We've been building a sound financial foundation for the business for a number of years. And in 2009, we made further strides in expanding our debt maturity profile and enhancing the company's cash position. Furthermore, we continued to demonstrate our ability to effectively manage costs. For the full year, expenses were down significantly, as we took over $500 million of cost out of our business. I've mentioned previously that it's not possible in such a steep downturn to cut costs in line with revenue declines and not damage the quality of the services we deliver. Nonetheless, we're pleased that the way in which our management teams around the world responded to the business conditions that prevailed last year. We acted quickly and decisively to address both fixed and variable cost. We took hard decisions on cost and did so consistently throughout the year. These actions will be critical in allowing us to return to margin improvement trajectory we are on prior to the economic downturn.It bears mention that we were able to accomplish this while continuing to build on the quality of the talent and capabilities at our various agencies. I will have more to say about the performance of our agencies and the competitiveness of our service offering later on the call. But at the macro level, it's gratifying to point out that we are at the table, winning our fair share of all major account reviews and that our agencies are receiving a degree of industry recognition across all marketing disciplines. That clearly positions us for an eventual media and advertising recovery. With that, I'll now hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our results."
108616,84225351,51770,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2010",2010-02-26,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As a reminder, I hope we will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our website as available on our website.

As a reminder, I hope we will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our website as available on our website. Before turning to the presentation, I would underscore that during the quarter, we continue to be aggressive in managing our costs, which resulted in more extensive headcount reduction than we anticipated coming out of Q3. As a result of our actions in the quarter and the year, we began 2010 with a reduction in the headcount of approximately 11% compared to a year ago. The amount of severance expense in our operating results therefore, are grouped commensurately. Severance was $71 million in Q4 and $166 million for the year. Excluding year-over-year incremental severance of $77 million, full year operating margins was 6.9%, which is consistent with our expectations coming out of the third quarter. That said, our structural expense improvement goes beyond headcount. While I'll have more detail on Q4 expenses in a few minutes, it's worth highlighting that we move into 2010 with a broadly-disciplined cost base. The investments we have made over the last few years in talent and in tools for business insight and control will provide even greater operating leverage as market conditions improve. I would also add that we concluded the year with strong cash flow from operations, well-managed working capital and in a strong position with respect to our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended with $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities compared with $2.3 billion a year ago, while retiring approximately $200 million net debt during the year.  Diluted EPS in Q4 was $0.24 per share, compared with $0.39 a year ago. For the full year, that comparison is $0.19 per share, compared to $0.52.Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides to follow. Other income was $29 million in the quarter, approximately half of this amount was due to the expiration settlement of certain liabilities that have been recognized in our 2004 restatement, with the remainder related to the sales of an investment held to an employee benefit trust.Turning to a closer look at operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, a decrease of 5.3%. Compared to Q4 2008, exchange rates had a positive impact of 2.9%. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures was de minimis. Our organic revenue change was a decrease of 8.2%, primarily the result of client reductions in scope, industry-free pressure and some lost assignments. In terms of client sectors, the top performers were retail, which increased from a year ago; packaged goods, health and personal care and financial services. It's worth noting that while auto  decreased from a year ago, the pace of decline slowed from Q's two and three. Each of the sector changes I just mentioned also showed improvement sequentially compared to Q3. Tech and telecom continued to weigh on our topline, reflecting lost assignments and generalized spending weakness in the sector. Revenue was somewhat stronger than we anticipated coming into the quarter. The organic change was less negative compared to the first nine months of the year, against softer prior performance and showed improvement from October to November, November to December. Relative our expectations among our major agency groups, we have the strongest outperformance in media, our U.S. independent agencies and the Draftfcb. At our Event business, which faced something of a perfect storm during the past year, the decrease moderated against softer results a year ago, and revenue grew outside of the U.S. Regionally, the U.S. performed better than international as a whole, with significant variance by international markets. More detail in a moment.On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks the organic change was negative 8%, with domestic performance approximately 2% better than outside of U.S. We were led by Mediabrands, Draftfcb and a strengthening in our U.S. independents.At our CMG segment, Q4 revenue decreased 9.7% organically. Here again, the U.S. decreased less than international. Our PR discipline decreased mid single digits organically as the rate decrease slowed in advance as I mentioned, while branding continued to be a difficult area.Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. As you can see, spending reductions by multinational clients and in local project assignments continue to cross our major markets in the quarter. In the U.S., the organic decrease was 7.3%. The largest driver continue to be decreased spending from existing clients. Auto continue to weigh on domestic results, while lost assignments in the technology sector were also a factor. We are encouraged to see increases at several units in the U.S., including Mediabrands, Lowe and Deutsch, Draftfcb and Hill Holliday. Results included new business revenue due to account wins in digital and media disciplines and in the healthcare sector. Internationally, revenue decreased 3%, which includes a significant lift in currency in the quarter. The organic decrease was 9.2%. In the U.K., Q4 revenue decreased 4.5% organically. Performance was led by growth in Mediabrands and Jack Morton. This was offset by a pressure across other businesses due to decreased client spending, as well as some lost assignments. While our Q4 comparison in the U.K. shows significant improvement from the prior nine months, our outlook here in the near term remains fundamentally cautious.  In Continental Europe, our organic decrease was 14.6%. In Asia-Pac, where we have a large Japan presence, it was 11.5%. And in Latin America, 7.1%. Performance in all three markets was due to factors I've already mentioned. Our other markets and regions decreased 2% organically, which reflects the timing of certain project revenue in the prior year's quarter, which had no impact in the full year over year comparison.On Slide 6, we present a longer view of organic revenue growth that tracks our trailing 12-month performance. As you can see, we are pleased to get the 2009 behind us. On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. Throughout the year, our financial priorities have been to align costs with revenue, protect margin to the extent possible and position ourselves to resume strong margin expansion, as marketers' conviction and the strength of the economic recovery takes hold. In Q4, operating expenses before the restructuring line decreased 6.5% organically, excluding incremental severance, decreased 8%. For the full year, operating expenses decreased 8.3% organically and decreased 9.6%, excluding the incremental severance. Q4 salaries and related expense were $1.05 billion compared with $1.08 billion a year ago, a decrease of 2.6% and 6.3% organically. Excluding incremental severance, salaries and related expense decreased 8.4% organically. Importantly, base salaries, benefits and tax decreased 10% organically, as a result of headcount actions taken over the preceding four quarters and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Severance expense was $71 million, compared with $48 million a year ago, or 3.9% of Q4 revenue compared with 2.5% a year ago. These expenses are the upfront cost of aligning headcount with revenue, as well as structural investments and productivity that will pay back in 2010 and beyond. As I mentioned earlier, as the quarter developed, we remained aggressive with headcount actions, focused on markets in Europe, Japan as well as the U.S. Full year severance was $166 million. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, headcount actions have addressed 14% of our workforce. Incentive expense in Q4 was 2.9% of revenue, compared with 2.3% a year ago. The comparison primarily reflects lower equity-related long term incentive expense in Q4 of 2008. For the full year, reflecting overall performance, incentive expense decreased 25%. Temporary labor expense decreased to 3% in Q4 and with 2.8% of revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. For the full year, expense for temporary labor decreased 24%.Turning to office and general expense on the lower half of the slide, O&G was $475 million in Q4, a decrease of 1.9%, while the organic decrease was 7%. O&G expenses were 26.4% of the revenue in the quarter. And for the full year, O&G decreased to 28.5% of revenue from 28.9%. Occupancy expense was 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.9% a year ago due to lower revenue in 2009. We continue to act on opportunities to lower and contain lease expense around the world, including lease restructurings that improve utilization across all our agencies. In 2009, we were able to reduce square footage by approximately 5%, despite softness in real estate markets around the globe. Professional fees were 2.1% of Q4 revenue, the same level as a year ago. We reduced professional fees by $20 million for the full year. Travel, office supplies and telecom expenses were 3.4% of revenue compared with 3.9% in Q4 '08. This was an area of our procurement focus throughout the year, which contribute to a 28% decrease, $85 million for the full year. Our all other category decreased 5.5% organically in Q4 and with 13.3% of revenue compared with 12.6% a year ago. The comparison includes the timing of certain project expenses in the prior year's quarter that had no effect in the full year-over-year comparisons, as well as currency gains in Q4 '08 that did not repeat. On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. Given the magnitude of the recession, we gave back some of the gains made in '08, but margin expansion to a fully competitive level remains one of our primary financial objectives.On Slide 9, you can see our debt maturity schedule as of the end of the year. Debt totaled $1.9 billion, a reduction of approximately $200 million during 2009. As indicated, the $214 million that remains of our floating rate notes mature in November of this year. We remain confident that we are positioned to again, use cash on hand to delever this year. Two related items not shown here but are worth noting. Toward the conclusion of fourth quarter, we're pleased to add a dedicated letter of credit facility. The new facility is sized at 45 million pounds or approximately $72 million allows us to move a portion of the LC supported by our revolving credit facility, which further enhances our total available maturity there back. At year-end, we had a total of $95 million of letters of credit outstanding. And in January, we move $60 million to the new facility. As a reminder, we have never drawn on our current revolving credit facility and we have no plans to do so.Also in January, we received the full support of our bank group for mending two covenants in our revolving credit facility, in light of the 2009 operating environment and severance expense. The leverage covenant was expanded to allow debt to EBITDA of 3.75x through March 31 and subsequently steps down included the year at 3.47. The minimum EBITDA requirement was also adjusted by $30 million to $520 million through March 31, after which it steps up. For 2009, our actual covenant EBITDA was $561 million. The new EBITDA level is conservative and precautionary in our view and there is nothing in our 2010 operating plan that would test that level. Details for the covenants are available in our filings and our related year-end calculations also appear in the presentation appendix.Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the year with $2.5 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities, which despite the very challenging year is an increase of $200 million from a year ago. As I mentioned, we used $200 million net in 2009 retired debt. On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow. This is the full year presentation. The fourth quarter is in the presentation appendix. For the year, cash flow from operations was $541 million, compared with $865 million in 2008, with a change due to mainly a decrease in net income. Cash from working capital changes was $99 million, a strong result for the year and a challenging operating environment. Our performance was due to our focus on working capital management and the growth of certain of our businesses, notably in Q4. The seasonality of our business means we typically see strong cash generation from working capital in the fourth quarter. And related to that build, we typically see seasonal use in working capital that follows in Q1. Investing activities used $128 million compared with $250 million in 2008. CapEx was $67 million, well below our historic levels. Financing activities used $267 million, which mainly reflects our redemption of 2009 and '11 maturities and a portion of our 2010s, offset by the issuance of our new 2017 notes. The net increase in cash and marketable securities for the year was $231 million. In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter continue to reflect marketers' decisions to reign in spending in 2009. Since the broader economic tone is still cautious, we will continue to manage our business conservatively as we move into 2010 with a continued focus on cost containment. Our teams will continue to execute aggressively on expense management in order to support our positioning for the strong profit growth that we believe is achievable as the economy picks up. Our financial resources remain strong. During the year, we reduced debt, extended our maturity profile, added a new letter of credit facility and increased our cash position, which has enhanced our liquidity and our financial flexibility. Now to talk about the state of our agency brands and our outlook for the year, I'd like to turn it back over to Michael."

As you can tell, we've just come through an extremely challenging year. The pressure that the recession placed on our clients had significant effects on the marketing activity and therefore, on our revenue. Our financial performance reflected this, but it also showed a strong focus on cost discipline, brought to bear by our management teams across the organization. We successfully consolidated much of the margin progress made in recent years and continued to hold our conservative approach to the balance sheet. Equally important during 2009, we saw a further confirmation that the strategic decisions we've been taking in recent years are positioning the company for long-term competitive competitiveness and growth. Full year performance of Draftfcb was very strong on both top and bottom line. This further validated the move we made to create a new agency that brings together marketing accountability and creativity in the media neutral model. There was also continued strong improvement in other areas of the business that we've been focusing on, such as Mediabrands, which performed particularly well in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., the combination of Lowe and Deutsch is tracking well and should give that network the ability to participate in more multinational new business opportunities. Our global PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris keep on delivering industry-leading work to their clients, including growing digital capabilities. This is what allows them to consistently gain share and outperform their peers. Our U.S. independents, particularly the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday also posted strong results, in spite of the economic challenges. as did our outstanding digital specialist, R/GA and HUGE. We saw ample recognition of this progress and the important year-end rankings released by the leading trade publications. The Martin Agency, R/GA and UM swept the Adweek Agency of the Year Awards in the U.S. Creative, U.S. Media and Digital categories. Martin and UM also appeared in the Ad Age A-List, along with Draftfcb and Weber Shandwick, one of the very few times a PR agency has ever made this list. Since it doesn't seem fair to put in a year's work for all these honors and not get acknowledged on our call, I have to mention that Deutsch, R/GA, Gotham and HUGE also appeared in Ad Age's list of up-and-coming agencies. You remember that last year initiative was a big winner in these awards, which coupled with UM's honors this year explains why media post named Mediabrands unit as the Media Holding Company of the Year for 2009. This performance was outstanding among our peers and particularly notable, because it included companies from across the full range of our portfolio. It shows that we're very much in the game when it comes to the competitors of our offerings that we can build on the recent momentum in new business arena and that we're well-positioned to grow once an economic recovery begins to take hold. It's also important to mention news that our largest unit, the McCann Worldgroup. Though it felt much of the impact of our issues in the tech and auto sectors last year, Worldgroup continues to have a very powerful global network and a full range of leading-edge services that include advertising, events promotion and activation, as well as CRM and digital, where they posted a significant recent win at GM that speaks of the depth and scope of their expertise. As announced, as of April 1, Nick Brien will assume the CEO role of Worldgroup from John Dooner, who remains Chairman at the balance of the year to ensure a seamless transaction. John was a major force in growing the Worldgroup into a global powerhouse, and we're indebted to him for his dedication and contributions. At Mediabrands, Nick led the introduction of many innovative digital offerings that are driving the business forward. Working closely with us at IPG and drawing on his multidisciplinary experience, Nick has also created a culture of collaboration at Mediabrands that helped us win a number of major integrated pitches. The senior leadership team that remains in place at Mediabrands is well-positioned to continue the success we've been seeing of late.This focus on an innovation, digital solutions and integrated marketing are all qualities that we believe will help us unlock greater value, from the McCann franchise. In sum, we have the talent and the tools to return to growth in line with the broader recovery. While there's still uncertainty at the world, we can expect in 2010 and we will manage the business accordingly, the economy has stabilized and begun to see signs of improvement. Clients are taking note and should increasingly move forward with their marketing and branding programs. Therefore, our goal of achieving 8% percent or greater operating margin this year in a flat revenue environment is within our reach. As is the opportunity to more aggressively expand margins if the back half of the 2010 shows marked improvement. Ultimately, our goal continues to remain to be fully competitive margin performance in the years to come. In terms of our professional offerings, we'll stay focused on the horizon by investing in digital talent across all our agencies, continue to develop tools that demonstrate the work we do as moving the needle for our clients business, adding to our strength in emerging market growth areas, such as the BRICs and MENA, this combination of contemporary forward-looking agencies and highly-disciplined financial management will be the key driver of long term value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to thank you for being with us, and open up the floor for questions."

I think it was a difficult year for everyone in 2009, and what they showed at the Worldgroup is their ability to take cost out of their business, reposition themselves in the marketplace. If you take a look at some of that severance expenses, for example, in particular, in Japan and in Europe, these just weren't headcount reductions. These were structural changes at the Worldgroup to be more efficient in the marketplace, we're adding new talent and management there that I believe will go a long way to returning McCann Worldgroup to the high levels of margin that they're used to accomplishing. That said, they still delivered margin for us and overall profitability, and their competitiveness in the marketplace is first rate."

Obviously, the key for that is as we grow revenue, the leverage effect of that, and not adding to our cost basis, will be critical to us delivering those types of margins. And given the cost disciplines that we've already indicated we have and you've seen, the only time we're going to be increasing cost is associated with revenue. And the fact that we were making structural changes, not just headcount reductions for the sake of headcount, puts together the efficiencies, as well as the cost disciplines, and that leads us to conclude that we should be able to do that. Certainly, if you back out the excess severance, we have a good head start in terms of recovering that."

It's certainly going to come from different sectors, and it's going to come from different geographical areas. We're encouraged what we're seeing in Latin America and in India and obviously, China is a growth potential for us as well. And the sectors that we're in, there's no question that we were hurt dramatically by auto and tech and telecom, and it's going to take us at least the first quarter, and some of the second quarter and actually, some of the rest of the year to really roll on through that and see some of the loss consignments, particularly in tech and telecom roll through us. So that said, so the first quarter, I think we'll continue to see a negative impact. And thereafter, we should start seeing positive improvements in terms of the revenue streams. So I would say, back half of the second quarter, on to the rest of the year, should be have this unfolds. But again, I think this recovery is somewhat tenuous and it's not going to take a lot for everyone to get spooked again, in terms of spending those dollars.

What we mean by structural is take the Worldgroup for example, eliminating layers in terms of efficiency is critical to structural changes, okay? And we've put a new man, Mike McLaren, we've put in -- to Japan, for example, and he took some actions with respect to removing layers of management, so we're more efficient and closer to the marketplace. Brett Gosper has additional responsibilities in Europe, and he, too, took a strong actions in terms of structural changes. So when we talk about structural, we're talking about efficiencies, eliminating various layers of people and really putting client-facing people where they belong. And that is in front of the clients and delivering on the value of the products and services that we have. In terms of pricing, obviously 2009 was a very difficult year from pricing. Most evident in the media pictures that are going on and the demands by our clients and in the media arena. And that sort of feeds on itself, which is why you start seeing clients looking at putting their media business up for review, because they think they can capture savings and efficiencies. And I think that's going to continue into this year. Until we have a real robust recovery, we're going to see a lot of emphasis on pricing and certainly, procurement is sitting at the table at all our negotiations. It's nice to point out, as Frank pointed out in his -- we're doing the same thing on our procurement side, not quite as much as on the client-side. But clearly, that's what has to go on in this environment. As the recovery takes hold, I think we'll see some lessening on that because the value of our services continue to be critical for the success of our clients. And once there's a recovery, then, not that they're going to go away, but the pressure has become a lot different. And so I think that's what we're going to start to see. Acquisitions, we continue to look at acquisitions. But again, they have to be totally critical and consistent with our overall strategy. Digital acquisitions, you'll continue to see -- we continue to look at that. I wouldn't be surprised if you see some digital acquisitions for us, particularly in some of the growth regions like Latin America and potentially China and in Europe. And those are the growth areas, and that's where we're going to put our dollars. We have the financial wherewithal. We have it built into our model for 2010. I think we said -- historically, on acquisitions, we've been around $150 million and we've been less than that in the past, and we'll be careful in how we spend those dollars. But we'll continue to be opportunistic in that."

I guess, we're similar to our credo of our good client, U.S. Post Office. I will review the results for the quarter and the full year 2009, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance and how we see the year ahead. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail. After his remarks, I'll return with some agency-specific observations and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A.As you can see, the very tough economic environment resulted in an organic revenue decrease for the year of 10.8%. Notwithstanding, we were able to deliver operating income of $340 million and operating margin, excluding incremental severance with 6.9%. It bears mention that the high level of severance in the fourth quarter reflects softer-than-anticipated revenue in Europe and Japan. And the fact we weren't satisfied with 2010 run rates in those regions, as we move through our planning process late last year. Earnings per diluted share were $0.19. Looking at the quarter, the organic revenue decline of 8.2% represented a sequential improvement from the previous six months. This result is in keeping with our public comments since the October conference call, in which we've consistently been clear that we think the worst of the recession's impact on our business has passed. Economic conditions appear to have stabilized, and we believe that we should see improvement during the course of 2010. It's likely that progress won't be linear. But it's fair to say that it's a good time for our clients to refocus on building for the future and investing in their brands. Overall, I would characterize the tone of the business as one of tempered optimism, especially for the second half of 2010. But we have begun to see clients reengage with many of our project-driven marketing service companies and there's also a greater willingness on the part of our clients to commit to annual spending plans. That wasn't the case at the end of last year. As you remember, we indicated to you that even in a flat organic environment this year, we would be in a strong position to recoup much of the margin progress made from 2006 to 2008, and then continue building on that momentum in the years to come. Those are goals we continue to believe are readily achievable.Another item of note, as we review last year's performance is the degree to which our long-standing conservative approach to the balance sheet, again proved to be our target. We've been building a sound financial foundation for the business for a number of years. And in 2009, we made further strides in expanding our debt maturity profile and enhancing the company's cash position. Furthermore, we continued to demonstrate our ability to effectively manage costs. For the full year, expenses were down significantly, as we took over $500 million of cost out of our business. I've mentioned previously that it's not possible in such a steep downturn to cut costs in line with revenue declines and not damage the quality of the services we deliver. Nonetheless, we're pleased that the way in which our management teams around the world responded to the business conditions that prevailed last year. We acted quickly and decisively to address both fixed and variable cost. We took hard decisions on cost and did so consistently throughout the year. These actions will be critical in allowing us to return to margin improvement trajectory we are on prior to the economic downturn.It bears mention that we were able to accomplish this while continuing to build on the quality of the talent and capabilities at our various agencies. I will have more to say about the performance of our agencies and the competitiveness of our service offering later on the call. But at the macro level, it's gratifying to point out that we are at the table, winning our fair share of all major account reviews and that our agencies are receiving a degree of industry recognition across all marketing disciplines. That clearly positions us for an eventual media and advertising recovery. With that, I'll now hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our results."

As a reminder, I hope we will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our website as available on our website. Before turning to the presentation, I would underscore that during the quarter, we continue to be aggressive in managing our costs, which resulted in more extensive headcount reduction than we anticipated coming out of Q3. As a result of our actions in the quarter and the year, we began 2010 with a reduction in the headcount of approximately 11% compared to a year ago. The amount of severance expense in our operating results therefore, are grouped commensurately. Severance was $71 million in Q4 and $166 million for the year. Excluding year-over-year incremental severance of $77 million, full year operating margins was 6.9%, which is consistent with our expectations coming out of the third quarter. That said, our structural expense improvement goes beyond headcount. While I'll have more detail on Q4 expenses in a few minutes, it's worth highlighting that we move into 2010 with a broadly-disciplined cost base. The investments we have made over the last few years in talent and in tools for business insight and control will provide even greater operating leverage as market conditions improve. I would also add that we concluded the year with strong cash flow from operations, well-managed working capital and in a strong position with respect to our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended with $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities compared with $2.3 billion a year ago, while retiring approximately $200 million net debt during the year.  Diluted EPS in Q4 was $0.24 per share, compared with $0.39 a year ago. For the full year, that comparison is $0.19 per share, compared to $0.52.Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides to follow. Other income was $29 million in the quarter, approximately half of this amount was due to the expiration settlement of certain liabilities that have been recognized in our 2004 restatement, with the remainder related to the sale of an investment held in employee benefit trust.Turning to a closer look at operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, a decrease of 5.3%. Compared to Q4 2008, exchange rates had a positive impact of 2.9%. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures was de minimis. Our organic revenue change was a decrease of 8.2%, primarily the result of client reductions in scope, industry-free pressure and some lost assignments. In terms of client sectors, the top performers were retail, which increased from a year ago; packaged goods, health and personal care and financial services. It's worth noting that while auto  decreased from a year ago, the pace of decline slowed from  Qs two and three. Each of the sector changes I just mentioned also showed improvement sequentially compared to Q3. Tech and telecom continued to weigh on our topline, reflecting lost assignments and generalized spending weakness in the sector. Revenue was somewhat stronger than we anticipated coming into the quarter. The organic change was less negative compared to the first nine months of the year, against softer prior year performance and showed improvement from October to November, November to December. Relative to our expectations among our major agency groups, we have the strongest outperformance in media, our U.S. independent agencies and the Draftfcb. At our Event business, which faced something of a perfect storm during the past year, the decrease moderated against softer results a year ago, and revenue grew outside of the U.S. Regionally, the U.S. performed better than international as a whole, with significant variance by international markets. I'll have more detail in a moment.On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks  the organic change was negative 8%, with domestic performance approximately 2% better than outside of U.S. We were led by Mediabrands, Draftfcb and a strengthening in our U.S. independents.At our CMG segment, Q4 revenue decreased 9.7% organically. Here again, the U.S. decreased less than international. Our PR discipline decreased mid single digits organically as the rate decrease slowed in advance as I mentioned, while branding continued to be a difficult area.Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. As you can see, spending reductions by multinational clients and in local project assignments continue to cross our major markets in the quarter. In the U.S., the organic decrease was 7.3%. The largest driver continue to be decreased spending from existing clients. Auto continue to weigh on domestic results, while lost assignments in the technology sector were also a factor. We are encouraged to see increases at several units in the U.S., including Mediabrands, Lowe and Deutsch, Draftfcb and Hill Holliday. Results included new business revenue due to account wins in digital and media disciplines and in the healthcare sector. Internationally, revenue decreased 3%, which includes a significant lift in currency in the quarter. The organic decrease was 9.2%. In the U.K., Q4 revenue decreased 4.5% organically. Performance was led by growth in Mediabrands and Jack Morton. This was offset by  pressure across other businesses due to decreased client spending, as well as some lost assignments. While our Q4 comparison in the U.K. showed significant improvement from the prior nine months, our outlook here in the near term remains fundamentally cautious.  In Continental Europe, our organic decrease was 14.6%. In Asia-Pac, where we have a large Japan presence, it was 11.5%. And in Latin America, 7.1%. Performance in all three markets was due to factors I've already mentioned. Our other markets and regions decreased 2% organically, which reflects the timing of certain project revenue in the prior year's quarter, which had no impact in the full year-over-year comparison.On Slide 6, we present a longer view of organic revenue growth that tracks our trailing 12-month performance. As you can see, we are pleased to get the 2009 behind us. On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. Throughout the year, our financial priorities have been to align costs with revenue, protect margin to the extent possible and position ourselves to resume strong margin expansion, as marketers' conviction and the strength of the economic recovery takes hold. In Q4, operating expenses before the restructuring line decreased 6.5% organically, excluding incremental severance, decreased 8%. For the full year, operating expenses decreased 8.3% organically and decreased 9.6%, excluding the incremental severance. Q4 salaries and related expense were $1.05 billion compared with $1.08 billion a year ago, a decrease of 2.6% and 6.3% organically. Excluding incremental severance, salaries and related expense decreased 8.4% organically. Importantly, base salaries, benefits and tax decreased 10% organically, as a result of headcount actions taken over the preceding four quarters and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Severance expense was $71 million, compared with $48 million a year ago, or 3.9% of Q4 revenue compared with 2.5% a year ago. These expenses are the upfront cost of aligning headcount with revenue, as well as structural investments and productivity that will pay back in 2010 and beyond. As I mentioned earlier, as the quarter developed, we remained aggressive with headcount actions, focused on markets in Europe, Japan as well as the U.S. Full year severance was $166 million. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, headcount actions have addressed 14% of our workforce. Incentive expense in Q4 was 2.9% of revenue, compared with 2.3% a year ago. The comparison primarily reflects lower equity-related long term incentive expense in Q4 of 2008. For the full year, reflecting overall performance, incentive expense decreased 25%. Temporary labor expense decreased to 3% in Q4 and was 2.8% of revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. For the full year, expense for temporary labor decreased 24%.Turning to office and general expense on the lower half of the slide, O&G was $475 million in Q4, a decrease of 1.9%, while the organic decrease was 7%. O&G expenses were 26.4% of the revenue in the quarter. And for the full year, O&G decreased to 28.5% of revenue from 28.9%. Occupancy expense was 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.9% a year ago due to lower revenue in 2009. We continue to act on opportunities to lower and contain lease expense around the world, including lease restructurings that improve utilization across all our agencies. In 2009, we were able to reduce square footage by approximately 5%, despite softness in real estate markets around the globe. Professional fees were 2.1% of Q4 revenue, the same level as a year ago. We reduced professional fees by $20 million for the full year. Travel, office supplies and telecom expenses were 3.4% of revenue compared with 3.9% in Q4 '08. This was an area of our procurement focus throughout the year, which contribute to a 28% decrease, $85 million for the full year. Our all other category decreased 5.5% organically in Q4 and was 13.3% of revenue compared with 12.6% a year ago. The comparison includes the timing of certain project expenses in the prior year's quarter that had no effect in the full year-over-year comparisons, as well as currency gains in Q4 '08 that did not repeat. On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. Given the magnitude of the recession, we gave back some of the gains made in '08, but margin expansion to a fully competitive level remains one of our primary financial objectives.On Slide 9, you can see our debt maturity schedule as of the end of the year. Debt totaled $1.9 billion, a reduction of approximately $200 million during 2009. As indicated, the $214 million that remains of our floating rate notes mature in November of this year. We remain confident that we are positioned to again use cash on hand to delever this year. Two related items not shown here but are worth noting. Toward the conclusion of fourth quarter, we're pleased to add a dedicated letter of credit facility. The new facility is sized at 45 million pounds or approximately $72 million allows us to move a portion of the LC supported by our revolving credit facility, which further enhances our total available maturity there back. At year-end, we had a total of $95 million of letters of credit outstanding. And in January, we move $60 million to the new facility. As a reminder, we have never drawn on our current revolving credit facility and we have no plans to do so.Also in January, we received the full support of our bank group for mending two covenants in our revolving credit facility, in light of the 2009 operating environment and severance expense. The leverage covenant was expanded to allow debt to EBITDA of 3.75x through March 31 and subsequently steps down included the year at 3.47. The minimum EBITDA requirement was also adjusted by $30 million to $520 million through March 31, after which it steps up. For 2009, our actual covenant EBITDA was $561 million. The new EBITDA level is conservative and precautionary in our view and there is nothing in our 2010 operating plan that would test that level. Details for the covenants are available in our filings and our related year-end calculations also appear in the presentation appendix.Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the year with $2.5 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities, which despite the very challenging year is an increase of $200 million from a year ago. As I mentioned, we used $200 million net in 2009 retired debt. On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow. This is the full year presentation. The fourth quarter is in the presentation appendix. For the year, cash flow from operations was $541 million, compared with $865 million in 2008, with a change due to mainly a decrease in net income. Cash from working capital changes was $99 million, a strong result for the year and a challenging operating environment. Our performance was due to our focus on working capital management and the growth of certain of our businesses, notably in Q4. The seasonality of our business means we typically see strong cash generation from working capital in the fourth quarter. And related to that build, we typically see seasonal use in working capital that follows in Q1. Investing activities used $128 million compared with $250 million in 2008. CapEx was $67 million, well below our historic levels. Financing activities used $267 million, which mainly reflects our redemption of 2009 and '11 maturities and a portion of our 2010s, offset by the issuance of our new 2017 notes. The net increase in cash and marketable securities for the year was $231 million. In summary, on Slide 12, the quarter continue to reflect marketers' decisions to reign in spending in 2009. Since the broader economic tone is still cautious, we will continue to manage our business conservatively as we move into 2010 with a continued focus on cost containment. Our teams will continue to execute aggressively on expense management in order to support our positioning for the strong profit growth that we believe is achievable as the economy picks up. Our financial resources remain strong. During the year, we reduced debt, extended our maturity profile, added a new letter of credit facility and increased our cash position, which has enhanced our liquidity and our financial flexibility. Now to talk about the state of our agency brands and our outlook for the year, I'd like to turn it back over to Michael."

As you can tell, we've just come through an extremely challenging year. The pressure that the recession placed on our clients had significant effects on the marketing activity and therefore, on our revenue. Our financial performance reflected this, but it also showed a strong focus on cost discipline, brought to bear by our management teams across the organization. We successfully consolidated much of the margin progress made in recent years and continued to hold our conservative approach to the balance sheet. Equally important during 2009, we saw a further confirmation that the strategic decisions we've been taking in recent years are positioning the company for long-term competitive competitiveness and growth. Full year performance of Draftfcb was very strong on both top and bottom line. This further validated the move we made to create a new agency that brings together marketing accountability and creativity in the media neutral model. There was also continued strong improvement in other areas of the business that we've been focusing on, such as Mediabrands, which performed particularly well in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., the combination of Lowe and Deutsch is tracking well and should give that network the ability to participate in more multinational new business opportunities. Our global PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris keep on delivering industry-leading work to their clients, including growing digital capabilities. This is what allows them to consistently gain share and outperform their peers. Our U.S. independents, particularly the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday also posted strong results, in spite of the economic challenges. as did our outstanding digital specialist, R/GA and HUGE. We saw ample recognition of this progress and the important year-end rankings released by the leading trade publications. The Martin Agency, R/GA and UM swept the Adweek Agency of the Year Awards in the U.S. Creative, U.S. Media and Digital categories. Martin and UM also appeared in the Ad Age A-List, along with Draftfcb and Weber Shandwick, one of the very few times a PR agency has ever made this list. Since it doesn't seem fair to put in a year's work for all these honors and not get acknowledged on our call, I have to mention that Deutsch, R/GA, Gotham and HUGE also appeared in Ad Age's list of up-and-coming agencies. You remember that last year initiative was a big winner in these awards, which coupled with UM's honors this year explains why media post named Mediabrands unit as the Media Holding Company of the Year for 2009. This performance was outstanding among our peers and particularly notable, because it included companies from across the full range of our portfolio. It shows that we're very much in the game when it comes to the competitors of our offerings that we can build on the recent momentum in new business arena and that we're well-positioned to grow once an economic recovery begins to take hold. It's also important to mention news that our largest unit, the McCann Worldgroup. Though it felt much of the impact of our issues in the tech and auto sectors last year, Worldgroup continues to have a very powerful global network and a full range of leading-edge services that include advertising, events promotion and activation, as well as CRM and digital, where they posted a significant recent win at GM that speaks of the depth and scope of their expertise. As announced, as of April 1, Nick Brien will assume the CEO role of Worldgroup from John Dooner, who remains Chairman at the balance of the year to ensure a seamless transaction. John was a major force in growing the Worldgroup into a global powerhouse, and we're indebted to him for his dedication and contributions. At Mediabrands, Nick led the introduction of many innovative digital offerings that are driving the business forward. Working closely with us at IPG and drawing on his multidisciplinary experience, Nick has also created a culture of collaboration at Mediabrands that helped us win a number of major integrated pitches. The senior leadership team that remains in place at Mediabrands is well-positioned to continue the success we've been seeing of late.This focus on an innovation, digital solutions and integrated marketing are all qualities that we believe will help us unlock greater value, from the McCann franchise. In sum, we have the talent and the tools to return to growth in line with the broader recovery. While there's still uncertainty at the world, we can expect in 2010 and we will manage the business accordingly, the economy has stabilized and begun to see signs of improvement. Clients are taking note and should increasingly move forward with their marketing and branding programs. Therefore, our goal of achieving 8% percent or greater operating margin this year in a flat revenue environment is within our reach. As is the opportunity to more aggressively expand margins if the back half of the 2010 shows marked improvement. Ultimately, our goal continues to remain to be fully competitive margin performance in the years to come. In terms of our professional offerings, we'll stay focused on the horizon by investing in digital talent across all our agencies, continue to develop tools that demonstrate the work we do as moving the needle for our clients business, adding to our strength in emerging market growth areas, such as the BRICs and MENA, this combination of contemporary forward-looking agencies and highly-disciplined financial management will be the key driver of long term value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to thank you for being with us, and open up the floor for questions."

We saw some softening in Europe, in particular with respect to McCann. But overall, I believe, as indicated by the win at MRM with General Motors and other potential new client opportunities and expansion of opportunities within their existing clients, I'm comfortable that the McCann Worldgroup continues to be, and will continue to be, a major factor in our overall performance. I think it was a difficult year for everyone in 2009, and what they showed at the Worldgroup is their ability to take cost out of their business, reposition themselves in the marketplace. If you take a look at some of that severance expenses, for example, in particular, in Japan and in Europe, these just weren't headcount reductions. These were structural changes at the Worldgroup to be more efficient in the marketplace, we're adding new talent and management there that I believe will go a long way to returning McCann Worldgroup to the high levels of margin that they're used to accomplishing. That said, they still delivered margin for us and overall profitability, and their competitiveness in the marketplace is first rate."

Obviously, the key for that is as we grow revenue, the leverage effect of that, and not adding to our cost basis, will be critical to us delivering those types of margins. And given the cost disciplines that we've already indicated we have and you've seen, the only time we're going to be increasing cost is associated with revenue. And the fact that we were making structural changes, not just headcount reductions for the sake of headcount, puts together the efficiencies, as well as the cost disciplines, and that leads us to conclude that we should be able to do that. Certainly, if you back out the excess severance, we have a good head start in terms of recovering that."

And the sectors that we're in, there's no question that we were hurt dramatically by auto and tech and telecom. And it's going to take us at least the first quarter, and some of the second quarter and actually, some of the rest of the year to really roll on through that and see some of the loss consignments, particularly in tech and telecom roll through us. So that said, so the first quarter, I think we'll continue to see a negative impact. And thereafter, we should start seeing positive improvements in terms of the revenue streams. So I would say, back half of the second quarter, on to the rest of the year, should be how this unfolds. But again, I think this recovery is somewhat tenuous and it's not going to take a lot for everyone to get spooked again, in terms of spending those dollars.

Second question is, in terms of kind of what you're seeing on client fee negotiations right now, how is the environment different than it was a month or two or three or even four months ago? What is the tone of those conversations look like in terms of the delta? And the last question, I don't think you mentioned a whole lot about acquisitions. Any sort of change in terms of priority there and things you might be looking at?"

What we mean by structural is take the Worldgroup for example, eliminating layers in terms of efficiency is critical to structural changes, okay? And we've put a new man, Mike McLaren, we've put in -- to Japan, for example, and he took some actions with respect to removing layers of management, so we're more efficient and closer to the marketplace. Brett Gosper has additional responsibilities in Europe, and he, too, took a strong actions in terms of structural changes. So when we talk about structural, we're talking about efficiencies, eliminating various layers of people and really putting client-facing people where they belong. And that is in front of the clients and delivering on the value of the products and services that we have. In terms of pricing, obviously 2009 was a very difficult year from pricing. Most evident in the media pictures that are going on and the demands by our clients and in the media arena. And that sort of feeds on itself, which is why you start seeing clients looking at putting their media business up for review, because they think they can capture savings and efficiencies. And I think that's going to continue into this year. Until we have a real robust recovery, we're going to see a lot of emphasis on pricing and certainly, procurement is sitting at the table at all our negotiations. It's nice to point out, as Frank pointed out in his -- we're doing the same thing on our procurement side, not quite as much as on the client-side. But clearly, that's what has to go on in this environment. As the recovery takes hold, I think we'll see some lessening on that because the value of our services continue to be critical for the success of our clients. And once there's a recovery, then, not that they're going to go away, but the pressure has become a lot different. And so I think that's what we're going to start to see. Acquisitions, we continue to look at acquisitions. But again, they have to be totally critical and consistent with our overall strategy. Digital acquisitions, you'll continue to see -- we continue to look at that. I wouldn't be surprised if you see some digital acquisitions for us, particularly in some of the growth regions like Latin America and potentially China and in Europe. And those are the growth areas, and that's where we're going to put our dollars. We have the financial wherewithal. We have it built into our model for 2010. I think we said -- historically, on acquisitions, we've been around $150 million and we've been less than that in the past, and we'll be careful in how we spend those dollars. But we'll continue to be opportunistic in that."

As is customary, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail.",1225,"Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us as we review our results for the first quarter of 2010. As is customary, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail. After his remarks, I'll return with some agency-specific observations and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A.
Well, as reported, revenue increased 1.2% in the quarter, and the organic revenue decline moderated to 2.9%. We were pleased to see another quarter of significant sequential improvement in our organic revenue change, which further supports our belief that the broader economic conditions have stabilized and we'll keep seeing progress as we move through 2010. 
Importantly, revenue performance improved as the quarter unfolded. March was significantly stronger year-over-year than January or February. In the U.S., where we had seen over a year of quarterly decreases, our business grew 3% organically in Q1 as clients begin to increase investment in marketing activity. This was evident at a broad cross-section of our agencies.
Turning to our key client sectors, it's also worth noting that looking at our standard client industry breakouts, we saw five of the seven client sectors that we track grow in the first quarter compared to a year ago. So it's fair to say that the improved tone of the business that we shared with you on our last call has begun to translate into revenue improvement in a number of markets and industry sectors. This gives us greater confidence that 2010 will be a year in which we can achieve organic performance that is flat to slightly positive and deliver on our stated goal of operating margins of 8% or better. 
Since there will be so many moving parts to the economic situation, it's worth looking at our client sector results in more detail. In the Auto sector, revenue increased by over 20% during the first quarter, excluding the benefit of currency. This is, of course, significant because of auto size in our mix and the severe decreases our entire industry experienced last year. 
On balance, we like what we are seeing in terms of how our agencies are performing in the category. We've had major wins in media with Chrysler and BMW; at MRM, which is building out the digital marketing infrastructure for GM globally; at Deutsch L.A. which won the very competitive Volkswagen review; and Draftfcb, which won Volkswagen's CRM business. We were sorry to see Chevrolet impact its 91-year relationship with Campbell-Ewald, but change is the name of the game at GM these days, and we have to respect that.  CE will continue to work on Chevy Dealer business and other GM products such as OnStar, and will handle Chevy national assignments for the balance of this year. Of course, all of our agencies, notably McCann Worldgroup, will keep looking for other ways to build on the already existing important GM relationship going forward. It's interesting to note that during the first quarter, CE represented a very small contributor to our more than 20% growth in the sector, and for the full year, 2010 will remain on course to show growth in the Auto sector. 
We also had double-digit increases with our largest Financial Service clients as a group. While a smaller sector, Financial Services also had turned negative early in the recession, but it now appears to be well underway to recovery. 
As we previously indicated would be the case, the Tech and Telecom sector continued to weigh significantly on our top line in Q1 due to lost assignments from some large clients to the first half of 2009, which had a disproportionate effect on certain world regions. This is worth repeating, because the Tech and Telecom sector was responsible for our entire revenue decrease in the first quarter. Without that impact, our overall organic revenue performance would have been up slightly. Revenue from new business wins played an important part in the Q1 results as we won a number of sizable new assignments in the latter part of last year. While it's true that we had a few client losses that made news in recent weeks, our pipeline is strong, and we remain net-new-business positive on a trailing 12-month basis through the end of the first quarter. 
As a direct result of recent wins, we added to our employee base in Q1, following five consecutive quarters of reductions. This is another point that signals the potential for 2010. In all, our headcount grew during the quarter by about 1.4% and was 6.2% below the year-ago levels at March 31. 
Across the business, we continued to demonstrate strong management discipline. Net-net, compared to the overall organic revenue decrease of 2.9%, headcount decreased 6.3% organically from a year ago. As you can see in our results today, the effect of the cost actions we took last year continued to be evident as salaries and related expenses decreased organically by 5.7% compared to the first quarter of 2009. This improvement also reflects the normalization of severance expense this year. As a result, our seasonal Q1 operating loss was $59 million this year, an improvement from the $82 million loss in Q1 '09, and our operating margin was negative 4.4% compared to negative 6.2% last year. 
Even though we see the macro-economic situation improving, we continue to believe that a conservative approach to the balance sheet will serve us well and provide maximum flexibility going forward. That's why I'm pleased to announce two important developments on that front this morning. One is an updated $650 million revolving credit facility, maturing in July of 2013. This amends the $335 million facility that had been scheduled to mature in July of next year. It's great to see that all of our banking partners in the previous facility increased their commitment as part of this updated agreement and to have five new lenders join our team. We thank them for this support. 
The amendment facility has improved flexibility with respect to covenants. While the details are available in our 10-Q filing today, you will see that the updated agreement is also more flexible as it relates to our ability to increase uses of cash if we surpass certain defined credit metrics. This is consistent with our long-standing goal of moving the business forward so as to be able to put some of the cash on the balance sheet to work more directly to enhance shareholder value. 
Consistent with that, this morning we are announcing a tender to purchase up to 370,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock for purchase price of up to $400 million. This transaction will reward our shareholders by reducing overhang and removing from our capital structure a significant source of potential dilution that comes from the convertibility feature of these securities into approximately 27 million common shares as well as reducing the annual amount we spend on dividends on the preferred shares by about $20 million.  We plan to use cash currently on our balance sheet to pay for any preferred shares that are tendered. It's also our intention to use the cash on our balance sheet to meet our November debt maturity as we have stated previously. 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our quarter performance."
108616,100450540,58397,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter that captures many of the points Michael made from our growing confidence in the recovery to improvement in operating performance and the strength of our financial condition.
Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. At this level, I will point out that operating results include approximately $5 million of expenses related to the transition to inflationary accounting for Venezuela. We have flagged the likelihood of this expense in our 10-K filing. 
I would also point to the tax line. Our effective tax benefit rate in the quarter was 18% compared to last year's 25.5% rate. The lower benefit rate this year is mainly due to the establishment of a tax valuation allowance for market in Europe. In addition, the expense for inflationary accounting that I just mentioned, received no tax benefit, also lowering our effective rate. Earnings per share were seasonal loss of $0.15 compared with a loss of $0.16 in Q1 '09. 
Turning to a closer look at operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.34 billion, an increase of 1.2%. Compared to Q1 '09, exchange rates had a positive impact of 4.2%. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures was negative 0.1%.  Our organic revenue change was a decrease of 2.9%, primarily the result of lost assignments in the Technology sector. We also continue to see the impact of scope reductions in certain markets outside the U.S. The biggest story in the quarter for us, as Michael pointed out, is that we returned to growth in the U.S. 
Globally, in terms of client sectors, the top performers were Auto, Retail, Financial Services. Food and Beverages and Packaged Goods increased mid-to-high single digits on a constant-currency basis and were also significant contributors.  At the other end of the spectrum, the Tech and Telecom results continue to weigh materially on consolidated revenue. 
Regionally, we are pleased to see growth in Lat Am as well as the U.S., while other regions continue to show the effects of the recession and certain lost assignments in the Technology sector. I'll have more details in a moment. 
On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic change was negative 3.8%. IAN grew slightly in the U.S. on the strength of Mediabrands, Draftfcb and Hill Holliday. IAN decreased outside the U.S. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 2.1% on an organic basis. Growth in the U.S. was partially offset by decreases internationally. Our PR discipline grew mid-single digits organically, while Sports Marketing had double-digit percentage growth. The Events business, which had a very tough time last year, has stabilized and was slightly negative on a worldwide basis.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. At a high-level, performance in the quarter was bifurcated between growth in the U.S. and Latin Am on the one hand, and the rest of the world, which did not. In the U.S., the organic increase was 3%, and was due to factors we have already touched on: broad participation across client sectors and agency leadership by media; Draftfcb; Hill Holliday; and CMG. The negative impact of the Tech and Telecom sector was significant in this region. 
Internationally, revenue decreased 1%, which includes a significant lift from currency in the quarter. The organic decrease was 11.3%. The U.K. decreased organically by 17.5%. While the market remains fundamentally soft, the decrease was exaggerated by two large event assignments in Q1 '09 which did not repeat this year. Together, they accounted for over half the decrease on a quarterly small Q1 base. 
Continental Europe decreased 15.6% organically. The performance gap widened against the U.S., consistent with the perspective of our operators that the recovery is lagging there. Of our top 10 markets, seven saw double-digit decreases. 
In Asia-Pac, our organic decrease was 6.5%. Here again, a single Tech client accounted for most of the change. We had solid growth in India, while China reflected the impact of lost assignments of certain multinationals. In Japan, we have a significant presence, but the overall economy continued to weigh on performance. Organic growth in Latin Am was 10%, led by growth with existing clients of Lowe and Draftfcb. Our Other Markets regions decreased 13.6% organically with softness in the Middle East, partially offset by growth in Canada.
On Slide 6, we tried a longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The organic change was negative 10.4% at March 31. As you can see, performance by this measure turned up, and we anticipate that it will continue to move this trend in the right direction for the balance of the year.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. In Q1, total operating expenses decreased 4.7% organically. Significant lower severance, payroll and occupancy expenses were the primary drivers. Excluding the change in severance, operating expenses decreased 2.3% organically. 
Q1 salaries and related expenses were $979 million compared with $997 million a year ago, a decrease of 1.7% and 5% organically. Excluding the change in severance expense, salaries and related expense decreased 2.3% organically. There were a number of moving pieces, though, as we invested in a disciplined manner behind agencies and capabilities that experienced growth. Our acquisition of Cubocc, a highly creative Brazilian digital HD, brought on approximately 100 new employees at quarter end. 
Organically, we hired behind wins at Mediabrands, the Martin Agency, Deutsch in Los Angeles, MRM and R/GA. We also added headcount in our major PR firms in step with an unmistakably improved trend in that business. Importantly, base salaries, benefits, and tax decreased 6.6% organically as a result of headcount actions taken over the preceding fourth quarters and decreased 260 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This is a critical parameter for us. Headcount at quarter end was 6.2% lower than a year ago. 
Severance expense was $10 million, in the normal range for Q1, compared with $42 million a year ago or 0.8% of Q1 revenue compared with 3.1% in Q1 '09 and incentive expense in Q1 was 4% of revenue compared with 3% a year ago. The comparison reflects higher equity-related, long-term incentive expense due mainly to a one-time credit in Q1 '09. 
Temporary labor expense was 3.6% in Q1 compared with 2.7% a year ago, with the increase supporting new business wins and an improving business trend in the U.S. All other salaries and related expense was 2.9% of revenues, a seasonally normal level that reflects some performance-based expense. This was unusually low a year ago to 0.1% [ph] when business was slowing due to the recession.
Turning to office and general expenses, on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $421 million in Q1, an increase of 2.5% but decreased organically by 2.4%. O&G expenses were 31.4% of revenue compared with 31% last year. Compared to a year ago, we were able to drive some incremental leverage on occupancy due to the real estate actions we took in 2009, and professional fees also decreased slightly as a percent of revenues. T&E and related expenses and all other O&G increased slightly as a percent of revenue. The latter includes the $5 million expense related to Venezuela.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. This tracks first, the turnaround, then the recession, and now we trust the beginning of significant margin recovery. 
On Slide 9, you can see our debt maturity schedule as of March 31. This picture is substantially unchanged from the beginning of the quarter, with total debt of $1.9 billion. The $214 million that remained of our floating rate notes at quarter end have a scheduled maturity of November this year and are classified as current. In early April, not reflected in this chart, we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase $20 million of the November maturity at slightly below par, so $193 million remains.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.94 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities; a strong cash position which is an increase of $283 million from a level year ago. You'll recall that in the interim, we used $200 million to retire debt in June and July last year. 
In addition to cash on hand, our total liquidity position was enhanced by a $650 million committed revolving facility that Michael described. Also, you will recall that in December last year, we established new specialized letter of credit facility, which was separately supported by $63 million of LCs at quarter end. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow from the quarter.  Cash used in operations was a seasonal use of $556 million, compared approximately equal to last year. Cash used in working capital is $483 million, also approximately the same as Q1 '09. 
As a reminder, we typically use cash and working capital in Q1 due to the seasonality of our business, while typically generating cash and working capital in Q4. In the fourth quarter of '09, for example, we generated $426 million from working capital. 
Investing activities provided $15 million compared with the use of $25 million a year ago. You may recall from our fourth quarter discussion that we sold an investor from an employee benefit trust, and in Q1, we collected on that receivable.  Financing activities used $16 million. Seasonal net increase in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $565 million compared with $616 million in Q1 '09. 
In summary, on Slide 12, we continue to see business trend in this direction of recovery, albeit with important regional variance. We have begun to grow again in the U.S. which gave us the opportunity to leverage some of the structural efficiencies we created last year. 
There is still reason for caution, given the global economic situation, so we will continue to manage our business carefully, with a focus on cost containment and margin expansion, in order to support our positioning for the strong proper growth that we believe is achievable as recovery continues. Our financial resources remain strong. This makes possible value-creating opportunities such as what Michael described earlier with respect to our tender offer for the preferreds. Cash on the balance sheet increased from a year ago, and our committed standby credit is growing. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael."
108616,100450540,58397,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. As you can see, the first quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis on our business.

As you can see, the first quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis on our business. You will remember that in our last conference call, we indicated that we thought organic growth would likely resume in late Q2 of this year. I can tell you that performance this quarter was better than we expected coming into the year, and that we are feeling increasingly confident about the prospects for growth in 2010. 
There remain regional challenges. Some client sectors will take longer to recover than others, and we'll feel the drag of Tech and Telecoms for most of the year, but the potential for growth has clearly returned. 
In recent meetings with our senior operating leaders and their key clients, the conversations are consistently about building brands and investing for the future, which is a marked change from last year. We are being asked to create big ideas that can serve as platforms for multi-channel communication. We are, of course, engaged in discussions about how digital technology fits into every aspect of marketing, which is why we've been embedding digital talent in all of our companies, from advertising agencies and media companies to activation, PR and CRM specialists. 
Clients are particularly eager to participate in and capitalize on dynamic areas such as the social web and word-of-mouth marketing, and our agency leaders are very focused on making a strong, digital capability central to their go-to-market strategy. But above all, an important area of focus that we believe can differentiate IPG is in the delivery of seamless, integrated marketing solutions. As the fragmentation of media and the importance of technology continue to increase the complexity of engaging with consumers, the key is to be truly holistic in our approach to marketing. For every brand and every project, there's a distinct solution that best meets the clients' business objectives. Each of these solutions must incorporate deep consumer insights, both traditional and emerging media, as well as an increased emphasis on accountability and measurement. 
Delivering against this mandate is something that all of our companies have at the top of their list. It's what's fueling Draftfcb's successful, fully-integrated model, which once again delivered very strong results that led the way in Q1. Lowe is partnering with a broad range of IPG agencies. The integrated approach is at the heart of what sets our U.S. independent agencies apart. And, as a group, they posted a strong first quarter. Bringing together best-in-class specialist capabilities above, below and online is also what McCann Worldgroup is all about. 
We have very strong leadership at all of our agencies, terrific brands in every one of the marketing disciplines and the capacity to deliver customized teams that bring the best of IPG to bear on the clients' needs. That is the integrated offering that's required to win in business marketplace today. 
We are fortunate in that we also have outstanding specialist capabilities to include in our multi-disciplined teams. At CMG, we have leading firms in areas such as sports and event marketing, branding and PR. As I said before on our calls, we see our PR assets consistently winning market share. Weber Shandwick is not only the world's leading PR agency, it is that agency's strongest global network. Both Weber and GolinHarris saw good growth and strong results in the quarter. 
Within our Mediabrands offering, we have two highly competitive global networks and strength that all our companies can tap into in communications planning, retail, hyper-local marketing as well as search and new media capabilities. Our digital specialty agencies are off to a strong start this year. MRM has started to see the benefit of new business wins. R/GA and HUGE posted double-digit revenue increases.  We will look to scale R/GA and HUGE on a regional and global basis during the balance of this year. 
Internationally, we have leadership positions in India and the Middle East where we are well positioned to capitalize on economic recovery. We further added to our capabilities in Brazil with the acquisition of Cubocc during the quarter and earlier this week, we announced that Washington Olivetto, a creative icon in Latin America advertising, has joined McCann Brazil. The agency will be renamed WMcCann. 
For the balance of the year, our focus will increasingly turn to China, which currently represents a small percentage of our business than at a number of our competitors, but we will see the potential for growth; and to Russia, where we have a long standing partnership with a powerful local player that we can increasingly seek to leverage. 
We'll continue to be open to opportunities that are good strategic fits for our clients or our networks in terms of capabilities and bolstering geographic strength. As we've said previously, the combination of forward-looking agencies and highly disciplined financial management will be the keys to our long-term success. 
Our financial results in Q1 showed improved revenue performance, which reflects a stronger economic climate and new business wins in the latter part of 2009. Improvements on costs were also evident in our results. As our sector emerges from the recession, however, our expectations going forward are that we feel we are well positioned to deliver on our margin objectives for the full year and beyond. 
Revenue stability and growth are clearly coming back into the picture. The decision to tender for the preferred shares means that we're beginning to put our cash to work to enhance shareholder value and that we believe the positive trajectory of the business is sustainable. 
We have the talent and the tools to benefit from the recovery and achieve no worse than flat organic revenue performance in 2010. This will allow us to deliver on our goal of operating margins of 8% or better and, having reestablished the aggressive course of margin expansion that we were on in 2008 before the recession hit, continue to significantly grow profitability and further increase shareholder value in the years to come. With that, I'd like to thank you for being with us and open the floor to questions."

First, let me address -- as the economy gets stronger, what we're seeing at our clients is they're now taking a very strong and hard look at their marketing capabilities. We're seeing changes in CMOs, we're seeing changes in CEOs, so whenever you see that kind of activity in the marketplace, it's obviously fair game for clients to be looking at their marketing partners on a going-forward basis. Now that's good and that's bad news. Obviously, it's good news when we're participating in new business pitches and we win our fair share. It's bad news when we're the recipient of change. And I think as the economy starts to unfold -- and we're going to see more and more of that activity -- and I view this as an opportunity. It just happens to be that the last couple of them that we participated in, we were on the short end. On the other side, just recently, yesterday, we announced a win at the L'Oreal media pitch in terms of North America, where we were up against a big competitor publicist [ph] which we share that client with and we won. So there are circumstances where we're going to win our fair share, and there are circumstances where, as the clients look at these things, we're unfortunately going to be on the short end of it. 
I think the key here is making sure we're paying attention to our clients and offering up all the best offerings that we have as a company. And I think we're going to see that goal through the entire year. So some clients will be putting us up and our big competitors up for review. We'll be in the pitches. I am highly confident that in the pitches, we will have a seat at the table; and we're going to have to share, in turn, some wins and some losses. And the other part of it is -- other clients share their marketing services among, frankly, the big four holding companies. And some of the wins that we have, we can announce, we pick up additional business from our competitor, whether it be over in Europe or in domestic, and we don't announce those wins. So it goes to the point of the strength of our relationship with our clients, and that continues to be very strong."

And can you address whether the environment for recalling back some of the pricing concessions, if you will, if you view it that way, that you had to make during the downturn -- what's your view on the ability to recover some of that? Will it be in client willingness to accept some cost increases?"

And I do think, although it's anecdotal, that as the business is getting stronger, the business folks are taking a stronger position versus the procurement side. That said, procurement is going to be sitting at that table, and that hasn't gone away. I think the client base has gotten a taste of the fact that procurement is a very important part of the pricing mechanism. But I do believe that we're seeing some semblance of reasoning from a business perspective coming back to the table. And I think that bodes well for us in terms of scope increases. And the answer is yes. In order to see growth from our existing client base, and in order to put forth the organic numbers that we're putting forth that we expect to see for the rest of the year, we're going to see scope increases at our major clients. And that's the key focus of where growth is going to come from, frankly. And I do think that the business aspects of this are taking a broader picture versus just the cost savings in it."

And we know that it's very competitive. R/GA, for example, won a significant amount of new business at the end of 2009 and they had to go out and recruit over 100 people, for example. And so therefore, it was very competitive in the marketplace from a salary point of view. The other side of that is; once you get the talent in there, digital is much more labor-intensive and therefore, we're getting a bigger piece of the pie in terms of the dollars being spent. And what we have to focus on is the efficiencies of how we produce those products. And so you see, for example, R/GA, MRM and HUGE and all of our agencies focusing on retaining as much of that money internally as opposed to going outside in terms of production. So I think you're going to see a focus on the production side, which will enable us to recover some of the increased cost as result of the talent. But, it is very competitive out there. But, I do believe that if we focus on smart ways of doing this -- for example, the Worldgroup has launched EXP, which is a global production capability where we can be much more efficient in terms of meeting the demands of our global clients. It's those kinds of structures and those kinds of things that we're looking at to increase margins."

Yes, and that's why I say; a critical component on our growth is through existing clients and scope increases because, yes, obviously, it's incumbent upon us to be more efficient in utilizing existing talent. So as that scope increase occurs, we don't hopefully have to go out and hire a lot of people behind that. But there's no question that we have taken hard looks at our salary components, evidenced by the actions we took in 2009, which is why you saw the increase in hires in the first quarter; because there is a certain amount of hiring that we had to do to support the new revenue. But what's important here is that the people we're hiring are: A) related to the revenue stream, and that’s an important component; and two, the disciplines of the people we're hiring are much more focused on the new type of projects and revenue that we are seeing, i.e., the digital component. So it's a balancing act in terms of using existing efficiencies as well as hiring into the revenue stream. And that's really what the leverage opportunity for us is. If we can grow the revenue without proportionately increasing our salaries and SRS [ph] costs, then that's the level of the margin expansion. Incidentally, when we tell you that we think flat or slightly up for 2010 will give eight or better margin, that assumes that we're going to be able to leverage those efficiencies in terms of margin expansion."

As is customary, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail.",1225,"Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us as we review our results for the first quarter of 2010. As is customary, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail. After his remarks, I'll return with some agency-specific observations and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A.
Well, as reported, revenue increased 1.2% in the quarter, and the organic revenue decline moderated to 2.9%. We were pleased to see another quarter of significant sequential improvement in our organic revenue change, which further supports our belief that the broader economic conditions have stabilized and we'll keep seeing progress as we move through 2010. 
Importantly, revenue performance improved as the quarter unfolded. March was significantly stronger year-over-year than January or February. In the U.S., where we had seen over a year of quarterly decreases, our business grew 3% organically in Q1 as clients begin to increase investment in marketing activity. This was evident at a broad cross-section of our agencies.
Turning to our key client sectors, it's also worth noting that looking at our standard client industry breakouts, we saw five of the seven client sectors that we track grow in the first quarter compared to a year ago. So it's fair to say that the improved tone of the business that we shared with you on our last call has begun to translate into revenue improvement in a number of markets and industry sectors. This gives us greater confidence that 2010 will be a year in which we can achieve organic performance that is flat to slightly positive and deliver on our stated goal of operating margins of 8% or better. 
Since there will be so many moving parts to the economic situation, it's worth looking at our client sector results in more detail. In the Auto sector, revenue increased by over 20% during the first quarter, excluding the benefit of currency. This is, of course, significant because of auto size in our mix and the severe decreases our entire industry experienced last year. 
On balance, we like what we are seeing in terms of how our agencies are performing in the category. We've had major wins in media with Chrysler and BMW; at MRM, which is building out the digital marketing infrastructure for GM globally; at Deutsch L.A. which won the very competitive Volkswagen review; and Draftfcb, which won Volkswagen's CRM business. We were sorry to see Chevrolet impact its 91-year relationship with Campbell-Ewald, but change is the name of the game at GM these days, and we have to respect that.  CE will continue to work on Chevy Dealer business and other GM products such as OnStar, and will handle Chevy national assignments for the balance of this year. Of course, all of our agencies, notably McCann Worldgroup, will keep looking for other ways to build on the already existing important GM relationship going forward. It's interesting to note that during the first quarter, CE represented a very small contributor to our more than 20% growth in the sector, and for the full year, 2010 will remain on course to show growth in the Auto sector. 
We also had double-digit increases with our largest Financial Service clients as a group. While a smaller sector, Financial Services also had turned negative early in the recession, but it now appears to be well underway to recovery. 
As we previously indicated would be the case, the Tech and Telecom sector continued to weigh significantly on our top line in Q1 due to lost assignments from some large clients to the first half of 2009, which had a disproportionate effect on certain world regions. This is worth repeating, because the Tech and Telecom sector was responsible for our entire revenue decrease in the first quarter. Without that impact, our overall organic revenue performance would have been up slightly. Revenue from new business wins played an important part in the Q1 results as we won a number of sizable new assignments in the latter part of last year. While it's true that we had a few client losses that made news in recent weeks, our pipeline is strong, and we remain net-new-business positive on a trailing 12-month basis through the end of the first quarter. 
As a direct result of recent wins, we added to our employee base in Q1, following five consecutive quarters of reductions. This is another point that signals the potential for 2010. In all, our headcount grew during the quarter by about 1.4% and was 6.2% below the year-ago levels at March 31. 
Across the business, we continued to demonstrate strong management discipline. Net-net, compared to the overall organic revenue decrease of 2.9%, headcount decreased 6.3% organically from a year ago. As you can see in our results today, the effect of the cost actions we took last year continued to be evident as salaries and related expenses decreased organically by 5.7% compared to the first quarter of 2009. This improvement also reflects the normalization of severance expense this year. As a result, our seasonal Q1 operating loss was $59 million this year, an improvement from the $82 million loss in Q1 '09, and our operating margin was negative 4.4% compared to negative 6.2% last year. 
Even though we see the macro-economic situation improving, we continue to believe that a conservative approach to the balance sheet will serve us well and provide maximum flexibility going forward. That's why I'm pleased to announce two important developments on that front this morning. One is an updated $650 million revolving credit facility, maturing in July of 2013. This amends the $335 million facility that had been scheduled to mature in July of next year. It's great to see that all of our banking partners in the previous facility increased their commitment as part of this updated agreement and to have five new lenders join our team. We thank them for this support. 
The amendment facility has improved flexibility with respect to covenants. While the details are available in our 10-Q filing today, you will see that the updated agreement is also more flexible as it relates to our ability to increase uses of cash if we surpass certain defined credit metrics. This is consistent with our long-standing goal of moving the business forward so as to be able to put some of the cash on the balance sheet to work more directly to enhance shareholder value. 
Consistent with that, this morning we are announcing a tender to purchase up to 370,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock for purchase price of up to $400 million. This transaction will reward our shareholders by reducing overhang and removing from our capital structure a significant source of potential dilution that comes from the convertibility feature of these securities into approximately 27 million common shares as well as reducing the annual amount we spend on dividends on the preferred shares by about $20 million.  We plan to use cash currently on our balance sheet to pay for any preferred shares that are tendered. It's also our intention to use the cash on our balance sheet to meet our November debt maturity as we have stated previously. 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our quarter performance.

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter that captures many of the points Michael made from our growing confidence in the recovery to improvement in operating performance and the strength of our financial condition.
Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. At this level, I will point out that operating results include approximately $5 million of expenses related to the transition to inflationary accounting for Venezuela. We have flagged the likelihood of this expense in our 10-K filing. 
I would also point to the tax line. Our effective tax benefit rate in the quarter was 18% compared to last year's 25.5% rate. The lower benefit rate this year is mainly due to the establishment of a tax valuation allowance for market in Europe. In addition, the expense for inflationary accounting that I just mentioned, received no tax benefit, also lowering our effective rate. Earnings per share were seasonal loss of $0.15 compared with a loss of $0.16 in Q1 '09. 
Turning to a closer look at operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.34 billion, an increase of 1.2%. Compared to Q1 '09, exchange rates had a positive impact of 4.2%. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures was negative 0.1%.  Our organic revenue change was a decrease of 2.9%, primarily the result of lost assignments in the Technology sector. We also continue to see the impact of scope reductions in certain markets outside the U.S. The biggest story in the quarter for us, as Michael pointed out, is that we returned to growth in the U.S. 
Globally, in terms of client sectors, the top performers were Auto, Retail, Financial Services. Food and Beverages and Packaged Goods increased mid-to-high single digits on a constant-currency basis and were also significant contributors.  At the other end of the spectrum, the Tech and Telecom results continue to weigh materially on consolidated revenue. 
Regionally, we are pleased to see growth in Lat Am as well as the U.S., while other regions continue to show the effects of the recession and certain lost assignments in the Technology sector. I'll have more details in a moment. 
On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic change was negative 3.8%. IAN grew slightly in the U.S. on the strength of Mediabrands, Draftfcb and Hill Holliday. IAN decreased outside the U.S. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 2.1% on an organic basis. Growth in the U.S. was partially offset by decreases internationally. Our PR discipline grew mid-single digits organically, while Sports Marketing had double-digit percentage growth. The Events business, which had a very tough time last year, has stabilized and was slightly negative on a worldwide basis.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. At a high-level, performance in the quarter was bifurcated between growth in the U.S. and Latin Am on the one hand, and the rest of the world, which did not. In the U.S., the organic increase was 3%, and was due to factors we have already touched on: broad participation across client sectors and agency leadership by media; Draftfcb; Hill Holliday; and CMG. The negative impact of the Tech and Telecom sector was significant in this region. 
Internationally, revenue decreased 1%, which includes a significant lift from currency in the quarter. The organic decrease was 11.3%. The U.K. decreased organically by 17.5%. While the market remains fundamentally soft, the decrease was exaggerated by two large event assignments in Q1 '09 which did not repeat this year. Together, they accounted for over half the decrease on a quarterly small Q1 base. 
Continental Europe decreased 15.6% organically. The performance gap widened against the U.S., consistent with the perspective of our operators that the recovery is lagging there. Of our top 10 markets, seven saw double-digit decreases. 
In Asia-Pac, our organic decrease was 6.5%. Here again, a single Tech client accounted for most of the change. We had solid growth in India, while China reflected the impact of lost assignments of certain multinationals. In Japan, we have a significant presence, but the overall economy continued to weigh on performance. Organic growth in Latin Am was 10%, led by growth with existing clients of Lowe and Draftfcb. Our Other Markets regions decreased 13.6% organically with softness in the Middle East, partially offset by growth in Canada.
On Slide 6, we tried a longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The organic change was negative 10.4% at March 31. As you can see, performance by this measure turned up, and we anticipate that it will continue to move this trend in the right direction for the balance of the year.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. In Q1, total operating expenses decreased 4.7% organically. Significant lower severance, payroll and occupancy expenses were the primary drivers. Excluding the change in severance, operating expenses decreased 2.3% organically. 
Q1 salaries and related expenses were $979 million compared with $997 million a year ago, a decrease of 1.7% and 5% organically. Excluding the change in severance expense, salaries and related expense decreased 2.3% organically. There were a number of moving pieces, though, as we invested in a disciplined manner behind agencies and capabilities that experienced growth. Our acquisition of Cubocc, a highly creative Brazilian digital HD, brought on approximately 100 new employees at quarter end. 
Organically, we hired behind wins at Mediabrands, the Martin Agency, Deutsch in Los Angeles, MRM and R/GA. We also added headcount in our major PR firms in step with an unmistakably improved trend in that business. Importantly, base salaries, benefits, and tax decreased 6.6% organically as a result of headcount actions taken over the preceding fourth quarters and decreased 260 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This is a critical parameter for us. Headcount at quarter end was 6.2% lower than a year ago. 
Severance expense was $10 million, in the normal range for Q1, compared with $42 million a year ago or 0.8% of Q1 revenue compared with 3.1% in Q1 '09 and incentive expense in Q1 was 4% of revenue compared with 3% a year ago. The comparison reflects higher equity-related, long-term incentive expense due mainly to a one-time credit in Q1 '09. 
Temporary labor expense was 3.6% in Q1 compared with 2.7% a year ago, with the increase supporting new business wins and an improving business trend in the U.S. All other salaries and related expense was 2.9% of revenues, a seasonally normal level that reflects some performance-based expense. This was unusually low a year ago to 0.1% [ph] when business was slowing due to the recession.
Turning to office and general expenses, on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $421 million in Q1, an increase of 2.5% but decreased organically by 2.4%. O&G expenses were 31.4% of revenue compared with 31% last year. Compared to a year ago, we were able to drive some incremental leverage on occupancy due to the real estate actions we took in 2009, and professional fees also decreased slightly as a percent of revenues. T&E and related expenses and all other O&G increased slightly as a percent of revenue. The latter includes the $5 million expense related to Venezuela.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. This tracks first, the turnaround, then the recession, and now we trust the beginning of significant margin recovery. 
On Slide 9, you can see our debt maturity schedule as of March 31. This picture is substantially unchanged from the beginning of the quarter, with total debt of $1.9 billion. The $214 million that remained of our floating rate notes at quarter end have a scheduled maturity of November this year and are classified as current. In early April, not reflected in this chart, we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase $20 million of the November maturity at slightly below par, so $193 million remains.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.94 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities; a strong cash position which is an increase of $283 million from a level year ago. You'll recall that in the interim, we used $200 million to retire debt in June and July last year. 
In addition to cash on hand, our total liquidity position was enhanced by a $650 million committed revolving facility that Michael described. Also, you will recall that in December last year, we established new specialized letter of credit facility, which was separately supported by $63 million of LCs at quarter end. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow from the quarter.  Cash used in operations was a seasonal use of $556 million, compared approximately equal to last year. Cash used in working capital is $483 million, also approximately the same as Q1 '09. 
As a reminder, we typically use cash and working capital in Q1 due to the seasonality of our business, while typically generating cash and working capital in Q4. In the fourth quarter of '09, for example, we generated $426 million from working capital. 
Investing activities provided $15 million compared with the use of $25 million a year ago. You may recall from our fourth quarter discussion that we sold an investor from an employee benefit trust, and in Q1, we collected on that receivable.  Financing activities used $16 million. Seasonal net increase in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $565 million compared with $616 million in Q1 '09. 
In summary, on Slide 12, we continue to see business trend in this direction of recovery, albeit with important regional variance. We have begun to grow again in the U.S. which gave us the opportunity to leverage some of the structural efficiencies we created last year. 
There is still reason for caution, given the global economic situation, so we will continue to manage our business carefully, with a focus on cost containment and margin expansion, in order to support our positioning for the strong proper growth that we believe is achievable as recovery continues. Our financial resources remain strong. This makes possible value-creating opportunities such as what Michael described earlier with respect to our tender offer for the preferreds. Cash on the balance sheet increased from a year ago, and our committed standby credit is growing. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael.

As you can see, the first quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis on our business. You will remember that in our last conference call, we indicated that we thought or",1020,"Thank you, Frank. As you can see, the first quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis on our business. You will remember that in our last conference call, we indicated that we thought organic growth would likely resume in late Q2 of this year. I can tell you that performance this quarter was better than we expected coming into the year, and that we are feeling increasingly confident about the prospects for growth in 2010. 
There remain regional challenges. Some client sectors will take longer to recover than others, and we'll feel the drag of Tech and Telecoms for most of the year, but the potential for growth has clearly returned. 
In recent meetings with our senior operating leaders and their key clients, the conversations are consistently about building brands and investing for the future, which is a marked change from last year. We are being asked to create big ideas that can serve as platforms for multi-channel communication. We are, of course, engaged in discussions about how digital technology fits into every aspect of marketing, which is why we've been embedding digital talent in all of our companies, from advertising agencies and media companies to activation, PR and CRM specialists. 
Clients are particularly eager to participate in and capitalize on dynamic areas such as the social web and word-of-mouth marketing, and our agency leaders are very focused on making a strong, digital capability central to their go-to-market strategy. But above all, an important area of focus that we believe can differentiate IPG is in the delivery of seamless, integrated marketing solutions. As the fragmentation of media and the importance of technology continue to increase the complexity of engaging with consumers, the key is to be truly holistic in our approach to marketing. For every brand and every project, there's a distinct solution that best meets the clients' business objectives. Each of these solutions must incorporate deep consumer insights, both traditional and emerging media, as well as an increased emphasis on accountability and measurement. 
Delivering against this mandate is something that all of our companies have at the top of their list. It's what's fueling Draftfcb's successful, fully-integrated model, which once again delivered very strong results that led the way in Q1. Lowe is partnering with a broad range of IPG agencies. The integrated approach is at the heart of what sets our U.S. independent agencies apart. And, as a group, they posted a strong first quarter. Bringing together best-in-class specialist capabilities above, below and online is also what McCann Worldgroup is all about. 
We have very strong leadership at all of our agencies, terrific brands in every one of the marketing disciplines and the capacity to deliver customized teams that bring the best of IPG to bear on the clients' needs. That is the integrated offering that's required to win in business marketplace today. 
We are fortunate in that we also have outstanding specialist capabilities to include in our multi-disciplined teams. At CMG, we have leading firms in areas such as sports and event marketing, branding and PR. As I said before on our calls, we see our PR assets consistently winning market share. Weber Shandwick is not only the world's leading PR agency, it is that agency's strongest global network. Both Weber and GolinHarris saw good growth and strong results in the quarter. 
Within our Mediabrands offering, we have two highly competitive global networks and strength that all our companies can tap into in communications planning, retail, hyper-local marketing as well as search and new media capabilities. Our digital specialty agencies are off to a strong start this year. MRM has started to see the benefit of new business wins. R/GA and HUGE posted double-digit revenue increases.  We will look to scale R/GA and HUGE on a regional and global basis during the balance of this year. 
Internationally, we have leadership positions in India and the Middle East where we are well positioned to capitalize on economic recovery. We further added to our capabilities in Brazil with the acquisition of Cubocc during the quarter and earlier this week, we announced that Washington Olivetto, a creative icon in Latin America advertising, has joined McCann Brazil. The agency will be renamed WMcCann. 
For the balance of the year, our focus will increasingly turn to China, which currently represents a small percentage of our business than at a number of our competitors, but we will see the potential for growth; and to Russia, where we have a long standing partnership with a powerful local player that we can increasingly seek to leverage. 
We'll continue to be open to opportunities that are good strategic fits for our clients or our networks in terms of capabilities and bolstering geographic strength. As we've said previously, the combination of forward-looking agencies and highly disciplined financial management will be the keys to our long-term success. 
Our financial results in Q1 showed improved revenue performance, which reflects a stronger economic climate and new business wins in the latter part of 2009. Improvements on costs were also evident in our results. As our sector emerges from the recession, however, our expectations going forward are that we feel we are well positioned to deliver on our margin objectives for the full year and beyond. 
Revenue stability and growth are clearly coming back into the picture. The decision to tender for the preferred shares means that we're beginning to put our cash to work to enhance shareholder value and that we believe the positive trajectory of the business is sustainable. 
We have the talent and the tools to benefit from the recovery and achieve no worse than flat organic revenue performance in 2010. This will allow us to deliver on our goal of operating margins of 8% or better and, having reestablished the aggressive course of margin expansion that we were on in 2008 before the recession hit, continue to significantly grow profitability and further increase shareholder value in the years to come. With that, I'd like to thank you for being with us and open the floor to questions.

One of the interesting things about McCann is that they have a very strong existing client base. So a number of the improvements that we're seeing in our company are not necessarily from increases in client wins, but increases from existing clients, which is the base of the McCann Worldgroup. Nick is off to a fast start in getting the group together and collaborating in terms of what has to be addressed on a global basis. Most recently, I met with him and the whole team, and I think everyone is excited about the opportunities.

First, let me address -- as the economy gets stronger, what we're seeing at our clients is they're now taking a very strong and hard look at their marketing capabilities. We're seeing changes in CMOs, we're seeing changes in CEOs, so whenever you see that kind of activity in the marketplace, it's obviously fair game for clients to be looking at their marketing partners on a going-forward basis. Now that's good and that's bad news. Obviously, it's good news when we're participating in new business pitches and we win our fair share. It's bad news when we're the recipient of change. And I think as the economy starts to unfold -- and we're going to see more and more of that activity -- and I view this as an opportunity. It just happens to be that the last couple of them that we participated in, we were on the short end. On the other side, just recently, yesterday, we announced a win at the L'Oreal media pitch in terms of North America, where we were up against a big competitor publicist [ph] which we share that client with and we won. So there are circumstances where we're going to win our fair share, and there are circumstances where, as the clients look at these things, we're unfortunately going to be on the short end of it. 
I think the key here is making sure we're paying attention to our clients and offering up all the best offerings that we have as a company. And I think we're going to see that goal through the entire year. So some clients will be putting us up and our big competitors up for review. We'll be in the pitches. I am highly confident that in the pitches, we will have a seat at the table; and we're going to have to share, in turn, some wins and some losses. And the other part of it is -- other clients share their marketing services among, frankly, the big four holding companies. And some of the wins that we have, we can announce, we pick up additional business from our competitor, whether it be over in Europe or in domestic, and we don't announce those wins. So it goes to the point of the strength of our relationship with our clients, and that continues to be very strong.

And we know that it's very competitive. R/GA, for example, won a significant amount of new business at the end of 2009 and they had to go out and recruit over 100 people, for example. And so therefore, it was very competitive in the marketplace from a salary point of view. The other side of that is; once you get the talent in there, digital is much more labor-intensive and therefore, we're getting a bigger piece of the pie in terms of the dollars being spent. And what we have to focus on is the efficiencies of how we produce those products. And so you see, for example, R/GA, MRM and HUGE and all of our agencies focusing on retaining as much of that money internally as opposed to going outside in terms of production. So I think you're going to see a focus on the production side, which will enable us to recover some of the increased cost as result of the talent. But, it is very competitive out there. But, I do believe that if we focus on smart ways of doing this -- for example, the Worldgroup has launched EXP, which is a global production capability where we can be much more efficient in terms of meeting the demands of our global clients. It's those kinds of structures and those kinds of things that we're looking at to increase margins.

Yes, and that's why I say; a critical component on our growth is through existing clients and scope increases because, yes, obviously, it's incumbent upon us to be more efficient in utilizing existing talent. So as that scope increase occurs, we don't hopefully have to go out and hire a lot of people behind that. But there's no question that we have taken hard looks at our salary components, evidenced by the actions we took in 2009, which is why you saw the increase in hires in the first quarter; because there is a certain amount of hiring that we had to do to support the new revenue. But what's important here is that the people we're hiring are: A) related to the revenue stream, and that’s an important component; and two, the disciplines of the people we're hiring are much more focused on the new type of projects and revenue that we are seeing, i.e., the digital component. So it's a balancing act in terms of using existing efficiencies as well as hiring into the revenue stream. And that's really what the leverage opportunity for us is. If we can grow the revenue without proportionately increasing our salaries and SRS [ph] costs, then that's the level of the margin expansion. Incidentally, when we tell you that we think flat or slightly up for 2010 will give eight or better margin, that assumes that we're going to be able to leverage those efficiencies in terms of margin expansion.

As is customary, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail.",1225,"Thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us as we review our results for the first quarter of 2010. As is customary, I'll begin by covering the headlines relating to our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results in detail. After his remarks, I'll return with some agency-specific observations and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A.
Well, as reported, revenue increased 1.2% in the quarter, and the organic revenue decline moderated to 2.9%. We were pleased to see another quarter of significant sequential improvement in our organic revenue change, which further supports our belief that the broader economic conditions have stabilized and we'll keep seeing progress as we move through 2010. 
Importantly, revenue performance improved as the quarter unfolded. March was significantly stronger year-over-year than January or February. In the U.S., where we had seen over a year of quarterly decreases, our business grew 3% organically in Q1 as clients begin to increase investment in marketing activity. This was evident at a broad cross-section of our agencies.
Turning to our key client sectors, it's also worth noting that looking at our standard client industry breakouts, we saw five of the seven client sectors that we track grow in the first quarter compared to a year ago. So it's fair to say that the improved tone of the business that we shared with you on our last call has begun to translate into revenue improvement in a number of markets and industry sectors. This gives us greater confidence that 2010 will be a year in which we can achieve organic performance that is flat to slightly positive and deliver on our stated goal of operating margins of 8% or better. 
Since there will be so many moving parts to the economic situation, it's worth looking at our client sector results in more detail. In the Auto sector, revenue increased by over 20% during the first quarter, excluding the benefit of currency. This is, of course, significant because of auto size in our mix and the severe decreases our entire industry experienced last year. 
On balance, we like what we are seeing in terms of how our agencies are performing in the category. We've had major wins in media with Chrysler and BMW; at MRM, which is building out the digital marketing infrastructure for GM globally; at Deutsch L.A. which won the very competitive Volkswagen review; and Draftfcb, which won Volkswagen's CRM business. We were sorry to see Chevrolet impact its 91-year relationship with Campbell-Ewald, but change is the name of the game at GM these days, and we have to respect that. CE will continue to work on Chevy Dealer business and other GM products such as OnStar, and will handle Chevy national assignments for the balance of this year. Of course, all of our agencies, notably McCann Worldgroup, will keep looking for other ways to build on the already existing important GM relationship going forward. It's interesting to note that during the first quarter, CE represented a very small contributor to our more than 20% growth in the sector, and for the full year, 2010 will remain on course to show growth in the Auto sector. 
We also had double-digit increases with our largest Financial Service clients as a group. While a smaller sector, Financial Services also had turned negative early in the recession, but it now appears to be well underway to recovery. 
As we previously indicated would be the case, the Tech and Telecom sector continued to weigh significantly on our top line in Q1 due to lost assignments from some large clients to the first half of 2009, which had a disproportionate effect on certain world regions. This is worth repeating, because the Tech and Telecom sector was responsible for our entire revenue decrease in the first quarter. Without that impact, our overall organic revenue performance would have been up slightly. Revenue from new business wins played an important part in the Q1 results as we won a number of sizable new assignments in the latter part of last year. While it's true that we had a few client losses that made news in recent weeks, our pipeline is strong, and we remain net-new-business positive on a trailing 12-month basis through the end of the first quarter. 
As a direct result of recent wins, we added to our employee base in Q1, following five consecutive quarters of reductions. This is another point that signals the potential for 2010. In all, our headcount grew during the quarter by about 1.4% and was 6.2% below the year-ago levels at March 31. 
Across the business, we continued to demonstrate strong management discipline. Net-net, compared to the overall organic revenue decrease of 2.9%, headcount decreased 6.3% organically from a year ago. As you can see in our results today, the effect of the cost actions we took last year continued to be evident as salaries and related expenses decreased organically by 5.7% compared to the first quarter of 2009. This improvement also reflects the normalization of severance expense this year. As a result, our seasonal Q1 operating loss was $59 million this year, an improvement from the $82 million loss in Q1 '09, and our operating margin was negative 4.4% compared to negative 6.2% last year. 
Even though we see the macro-economic situation improving, we continue to believe that a conservative approach to the balance sheet will serve us well and provide maximum flexibility going forward. That's why I'm pleased to announce two important developments on that front this morning. One is an updated $650 million revolving credit facility, maturing in July of 2013. This amends the $335 million facility that had been scheduled to mature in July of next year. It's great to see that all of our banking partners in the previous facility increased their commitment as part of this updated agreement and to have five new lenders join our team. We thank them for this support. 
The amendment facility has improved flexibility with respect to covenants. While the details are available in our 10-Q filing today, you will see that the updated agreement is also more flexible as it relates to our ability to increase uses of cash if we surpass certain defined credit metrics. This is consistent with our long-standing goal of moving the business forward so as to be able to put some of the cash on the balance sheet to work more directly to enhance shareholder value. 
Consistent with that, this morning we are announcing a tender to purchase up to 370,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock for purchase price of up to $400 million. This transaction will reward our shareholders by reducing overhang and removing from our capital structure a significant source of potential dilution that comes from the convertibility feature of these securities into approximately 27 million common shares as well as reducing the annual amount we spend on dividends on the preferred shares by about $20 million. We plan to use cash currently on our balance sheet to pay for any preferred shares that are tendered. It's also our intention to use the cash on our balance sheet to meet our November debt maturity as we have stated previously. 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our quarter performance."
108616,100450540,59827,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website.

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter that captures many of the points Michael made from our growing confidence in the recovery to improvement in operating performance and the strength of our financial condition.
Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. At this level, I will point out that operating results include approximately $5 million of expenses related to the transition to inflationary accounting for Venezuela. We have flagged the likelihood of this expense in our 10-K filing. 
I would also point to the tax line. Our effective tax benefit rate in the quarter was 18% compared to last year's 25.5% rate. The lower benefit rate this year is mainly due to the establishment of a tax valuation allowance for market in Europe. In addition, the expense for inflationary accounting that I just mentioned, received no tax benefit, also lowering our effective rate. Earnings per share were seasonal loss of $0.15 compared with a loss of $0.16 in Q1 '09. 
Turning to a closer look at operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.34 billion, an increase of 1.2%. Compared to Q1 '09, exchange rates had a positive impact of 4.2%. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures was negative 0.1%. Our organic revenue change was a decrease of 2.9%, primarily the result of lost assignments in the Technology sector. We also continue to see the impact of scope reductions in certain markets outside the U.S. The biggest story in the quarter for us, as Michael pointed out, is that we returned to growth in the U.S. 
Globally, in terms of client sectors, the top performers were Auto, Retail, Financial Services. Food and Beverages and Packaged Goods increased mid-to-high single digits on a constant-currency basis and were also significant contributors. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tech and Telecom results continue to weigh materially on consolidated revenue. 
Regionally, we are pleased to see growth in Lat Am as well as the U.S., while other regions continue to show the effects of the recession and certain lost assignments in the Technology sector. I'll have more details in a moment. 
On the bottom half of this slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic change was negative 3.8%. IAN grew slightly in the U.S. on the strength of Mediabrands, Draftfcb and Hill Holliday. IAN decreased outside the U.S. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 2.1% on an organic basis. Growth in the U.S. was partially offset by decreases internationally. Our PR discipline grew mid-single digits organically, while Sports Marketing had double-digit percentage growth. The Events business, which had a very tough time last year, has stabilized and was slightly negative on a worldwide basis.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. At a high-level, performance in the quarter was bifurcated between growth in the U.S. and Latin Am on the one hand, and the rest of the world, which did not. In the U.S., the organic increase was 3%, and was due to factors we have already touched on: broad participation across client sectors and agency leadership by media, Draftfcb, Hill Holliday and CMG. The negative impact of the Tech and Telecom sector was significant in this region. 
Internationally, revenue decreased 1%, which includes a significant lift from currency in the quarter. The organic decrease was 11.3%. The U.K. decreased organically by 17.5%. While the market remains fundamentally soft, the decrease was exaggerated by two large event assignments in Q1 '09 which did not repeat this year. Together, they accounted for over half the decrease on a quarterly small Q1 base. 
Continental Europe decreased 15.6% organically. The performance gap widened against the U.S., consistent with the perspective of our operators that the recovery is lagging there. Of our top 10 markets, seven saw double-digit decreases. 
In Asia-Pac, our organic decrease was 6.5%. Here again, a single Tech client accounted for most of the change. We had solid growth in India, while China reflected the impact of lost assignments of certain multinationals. In Japan, we have a significant presence, but the overall economy continued to weigh on performance. Organic growth in Latin Am was 10%, led by growth with existing clients of Lowe and Draftfcb. Our Other Markets regions decreased 13.6% organically with softness in the Middle East, partially offset by growth in Canada.
On Slide 6, we tried a longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The organic change was negative 10.4% at March 31. As you can see, performance by this measure turned up, and we anticipate that it will continue to move this trend in the right direction for the balance of the year.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. In Q1, total operating expenses decreased 4.7% organically. Significant lower severance, payroll and occupancy expenses were the primary drivers. Excluding the change in severance, operating expenses decreased 2.3% organically. 
Q1 salaries and related expenses were $979 million compared with $997 million a year ago, a decrease of 1.7% and 5% organically. Excluding the change in severance expense, salaries and related expense decreased 2.3% organically. There were a number of moving pieces, though, as we invested in a disciplined manner behind agencies and capabilities that experienced growth. Our acquisition of Cubocc, a highly creative Brazilian digital HD, brought on approximately 100 new employees at quarter end. 
Organically, we hired behind wins at Mediabrands, the Martin Agency, Deutsch in Los Angeles, MRM and R/GA. And we also added headcount in our major PR firms in step with an unmistakably improved trend in that business. Importantly, base salaries, benefits and tax decreased 6.6% organically as a result of headcount actions taken over the preceding four quarters and decreased 260 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This is a critical parameter for us. Headcount at quarter end was 6.2% lower than a year ago. 
Severance expense was $10 million, in the normal range for Q1 compared with $42 million a year ago or 0.8% of Q1 revenue compared with 3.1% in Q1 '09. And incentive expense in Q1 was 4% of revenue compared with 3% a year ago. The comparison reflects higher equity-related, long-term incentive expense due mainly to a one-time credit in Q1 '09. 
Temporary labor expense was 3.6% in Q1 compared with 2.7% a year ago, with the increase supporting new business wins and an improving business trend in the U.S. All other salaries and related expense was 2.9% of revenues, a seasonally normal level that reflects some performance-based expense. This was unusually low a year ago at 2.1% when business was slowing due to the recession.
Turning to office and general expenses, on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $421 million in Q1, an increase of 2.5% but decreased organically by 2.4%. O&G expenses were 31.4% of revenue compared with 31% last year. Compared to a year ago, we were able to drive some incremental leverage on occupancy due to the real estate actions we took in 2009, and professional fees also decreased slightly as a percent of revenues. T&E and related expenses and all other O&G increased slightly as a percent of revenue. The latter includes the $5 million expense related to Venezuela.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. This tracks first the turnaround, then the recession, and now we trust the beginning of significant margin recovery. 
On Slide 9, you can see our debt maturity schedule as of March 31. This picture is substantially unchanged from the beginning of the quarter, with total debt of $1.9 billion. The $214 million that remained of our floating rate notes at quarter end have a scheduled maturity of November this year and are classified as current. In early April, not reflected in this chart, we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase $20 million of the November maturity at slightly below par, so $193 million remains.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.94 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities; a strong cash position, which is an increase of $283 million from a level a year ago. You will recall that in the interim, we used $200 million to retire debt in June and July last year. 
In addition to cash on hand, our total liquidity position was enhanced by the $650 million committed revolving facility that Michael described. Also, you will recall that in December last year, we established new specialized letter of credit facility, which was separately supported by $63 million of LCs at quarter end. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow from the quarter. Cash used in operations was a seasonal use of $556 million compared approximately equal to last year. Cash used in working capital is $483 million, also approximately the same as Q1 '09. 
As a reminder, we typically use cash and working capital in Q1 due to the seasonality of our business, while typically generating cash and working capital in Q4. In the fourth quarter of '09, for example, we generated $426 million from working capital. 
Investing activities provided $15 million compared with the use of $25 million a year ago. You may recall from our fourth quarter discussion that we sold an investment from an employee benefit trust, and in Q1, we collected on that receivable. Financing activities used $16 million. Seasonal net increase in cash and marketable securities in the quarter was $565 million compared with $616 million in Q1 '09. 
In summary, on Slide 12, we continue to see business trend in the direction of recovery, albeit with important regional variance. We have begun to grow again in the U.S., which gave us the opportunity to leverage some of the structural efficiencies we created last year. 
There is still reason for caution, given the global economic situation, so we will continue to manage our business carefully, with a focus on cost containment and margin expansion, in order to support our positioning for the strong proper growth that we believe is achievable as the recovery continues. Our financial resources remain strong. This makes possible value-creating opportunities such as what Michael described earlier with respect to our tender offer for the preferreds. Cash on the balance sheet increased from a year ago, and our committed standby credit is growing. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael."
108616,100450540,59827,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. As you can see, the first quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis on our business. You will remember that in our last conference call, we indicated that we thought or",1020,"Thank you, Frank. As you can see, the first quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of the economic crisis on our business. You will remember that in our last conference call, we indicated that we thought organic growth would likely resume in late Q2 of this year. I can tell you that performance this quarter was better than we expected coming into the year, and that we are feeling increasingly confident about the prospects for growth in 2010. 
There remain regional challenges. Some client sectors will take longer to recover than others, and we'll feel the drag of Tech and Telecoms for most of the year, but the potential for growth has clearly returned. 
In recent meetings with our senior operating leaders and their key clients, the conversations are consistently about building brands and investing for the future, which is a marked change from last year. We are being asked to create big ideas that can serve as platforms for multi-channel communication. We are, of course, engaged in discussions about how digital technology fits into every aspect of marketing, which is why we've been embedding digital talent in all of our companies, from advertising agencies and media companies to activation, PR and CRM specialists. 
Clients are particularly eager to participate in and capitalize on dynamic areas such as the social web and word-of-mouth marketing, and our agency leaders are very focused on making a strong, digital capability central to their go-to-market strategy. But above all, an important area of focus that we believe can differentiate IPG is in the delivery of seamless, integrated marketing solutions. As the fragmentation of media and the importance of technology continue to increase the complexity of engaging with consumers, the key is to be truly holistic in our approach to marketing. For every brand and every project, there's a distinct solution that best meets the clients' business objectives. Each of these solutions must incorporate deep consumer insights, both traditional and emerging media, as well as an increased emphasis on accountability and measurement. 
Delivering against this mandate is something that all of our companies have at the top of their list. It's what's fueling Draftfcb's successful, fully integrated model, which once again delivered very strong results that led the way in Q1. Lowe is partnering with a broad range of IPG agencies. The integrated approach is at the heart of what sets our U.S. independent agencies apart. And as a group, they posted a strong first quarter. Bringing together best-in-class specialist capabilities above, below and online is also what McCann Worldgroup is all about. 
We have very strong leadership at all of our agencies, terrific brands in every one of the marketing disciplines and the capacity to deliver customized teams that bring the best of IPG to bear on the clients' needs. That is the integrated offering that's required to win in business marketplace today. 
We are fortunate in that we also have outstanding specialist capabilities to include in our multi-disciplined teams. At CMG, we have leading firms in areas such as sports and event marketing, branding and PR. As I said before on our calls, we see our PR assets consistently winning market share. Weber Shandwick is not only the world's leading PR agency, it is that agency's strongest global network. Both Weber and GolinHarris saw good growth and strong results in the quarter. 
Within our Mediabrands offering, we have two highly competitive global networks and strength that all our companies can tap into in communications planning, retail, hyper-local marketing as well as search and new media capabilities. Our digital specialty agencies are off to a strong start this year. MRM has started to see the benefit of new business wins. R/GA and HUGE posted double-digit revenue increases. We will look to scale R/GA and HUGE on a regional and global basis during the balance of this year. 
Internationally, we have leadership positions in India and the Middle East where we are well positioned to capitalize on economic recovery. We further added to our capabilities in Brazil with the acquisition of Cubocc during the quarter and earlier this week, we announced that Washington Olivetto, a creative icon in Latin America advertising, has joined McCann Brazil. The agency will be renamed WMcCann. 
For the balance of the year, our focus will increasingly turn to China, which currently represents a small percentage of our business than at a number of our competitors, but we will see the potential for growth; and to Russia, where we have a long-standing partnership with a powerful local player that we can increasingly seek to leverage. 
We'll continue to be open to opportunities that are good strategic fits for our clients or our networks in terms of capabilities and bolstering geographic strength. As we've said previously, the combination of forward-looking agencies and highly disciplined financial management will be the keys to our long-term success. 
Our financial results in Q1 showed improved revenue performance, which reflects a stronger economic climate and new business wins in the latter part of 2009. Improvements on costs were also evident in our results. As our sector emerges from the recession, however, our expectations going forward are that we feel we are well positioned to deliver on our margin objectives for the full year and beyond. 
Revenue stability and growth are clearly coming back into the picture. The decision to tender for the preferred shares means that we're beginning to put our cash to work to enhance shareholder value and that we believe the positive trajectory of the business is sustainable. 
We have the talent and the tools to benefit from the recovery and achieve no worse than flat organic revenue performance in 2010. This will allow us to deliver on our goal of operating margins of 8% or better and, having reestablished the aggressive course of margin expansion that we were on in 2008 before the recession hit, continue to significantly grow profitability and further increase shareholder value in the years to come. With that, I'd like to thank you for being with us and open the floor to questions."

First, let me address -- as the economy gets stronger, what we're seeing at our clients is they're now taking a very strong and hard look at their marketing capabilities. We're seeing changes in CMOs, we're seeing changes in CEOs, so whenever you see that kind of activity in the marketplace, it's obviously fair game for clients to be looking at their marketing partners on a going-forward basis. Now that's good and that's bad news. Obviously, it's good news when we're participating in new business pitches and we win our fair share. It's bad news when we're the recipient of change. And I think as the economy starts to unfold -- and we're going to see more and more of that activity -- and I view this as an opportunity. It just happens to be that the last couple of them that we participated in, we were on the short end. On the other side, just recently, yesterday, we announced a win at the L'Oreal media pitch in terms of North America, where we were up against a big competitor Publicis which we share that client with and we won. So there are circumstances where we're going to win our fair share, and there are circumstances where, as the clients look at these things, we're unfortunately going to be on the short end of it. 
I think the key here is making sure we're paying attention to our clients and offering up all the best offerings that we have as a company. And I think we're going to see that goal through the entire year. So some clients will be putting us up and our big competitors up for review. We'll be in the pitches. I'm highly confident that in the pitches, we will have a seat at the table; and we're going to have to share, in turn, some wins and some losses. And the other part of it is that our clients share their marketing services among, frankly, the big four holding companies. And some of the wins that we have, we can announce; we pick up additional business from our competitor, whether it be over in Europe or in domestic; and we don't announce those wins. So it goes to the point of the strength of our relationship with our clients, and that continues to be very strong."

But I do believe that we're seeing some semblance of reasoning from a business perspective coming back to the table. And I think that bodes well for us in terms of scope increases. And the answer is yes. In order to see growth from our existing client base, and in order to put forth the organic numbers that we're putting forth that we expect to see for the rest of the year, we're going to see scope increases at our major clients.

And we know that it's very competitive. R/GA, for example, won a significant amount of new business at the end of 2009 and they had to go out and recruit over 100 people, for example. And so therefore, it was very competitive in the marketplace from a salary point of view. The other side of that is once you get the talent in there, digital is much more labor-intensive and therefore, we're getting a bigger piece of the pie in terms of the dollars being spent. And what we have to focus on is the efficiencies of how we produce those products. And so you see, for example, R/GA, MRM and HUGE and all of our agencies focusing on retaining as much of that money internally as opposed to going outside in terms of production. So I think you're going to see a focus on the production side, which will enable us to recover some of the increased cost as result of the talent. But, it is very competitive out there. But, I do believe that if we focus on smart ways of doing this -- for example, the Worldgroup has launched EXP, which is a global production capability where we can be much more efficient in terms of meeting the demands of our global clients. It's those kinds of structures and those kinds of things that we're looking at to increase margins."

Yes, and that's why I say; a critical component on our growth is through existing clients and scope increases because, yes, obviously, it's incumbent upon us to be more efficient in utilizing existing talent. So as that scope increase occurs, we don't hopefully have to go out and hire a lot of people behind that. But there's no question that we have taken hard looks at our salary components, evidenced by the actions we took in 2009, which is why you saw the increase in hires in the first quarter; because there is a certain amount of hiring that we have to do to support the new revenue. But what's important here is that the people we're hiring are: A) related to the revenue stream, and that’s an important component; and two, the disciplines of the people we're hiring are much more focused on the new type of projects and revenue that we are seeing, i.e., the digital component. So it's a balancing act in terms of using existing efficiencies as well as hiring into the revenue stream. And that's really what the leverage opportunity for us is. If we can grow the revenue without proportionately increasing our salaries and SRS costs, then that's the level of the margin expansion. Incidentally, when we tell you that we think flat or slightly up for 2010 will give eight or better margin, that assumes that we're going to be able to leverage those efficiencies in terms of margin expansion."

I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results. After his remarks,",805,"Thank you, Jerry, and thank you, all, for joining us as we review our results for the second quarter and first half of 2010. I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results. After his remarks, I'll return with specific observations relating to the agencies and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A. 
Overall, it's fair to say that we're quite pleased with second quarter performance that was strong on both the top and bottom line. As reported, revenue increased 9.7% in the quarter, and revenue was up 8.5% organically. The improvement relative to last year is significant, as is the sequential change from the first quarter. As was the case in the first quarter, we saw results strengthen month-to-month during Q2. We also saw contributions pretty much across the board in terms of geography, client sectors and across our portfolio of agencies. Of course, it should be noted that the severity of the downturn last year means we had the benefit of favorable comps this quarter. Nonetheless, organic revenue increase of 13.6% in the U.S. clearly shows that the signs of economic recovery are giving clients greater opportunities to engage in marketing spend. 
Activity in developing regions are continue to pick up, and we experienced double-digit organic growth in Brazil, China and India during the second quarter. While Europe showed sequential improvement, we remain cautious about the situation in that region, and the European recovery is not factored into our budgets or operating plans for 2010. 
In terms of client sectors, growth in the quarter and year-to-date has been very strong in the Auto, Retail and Financial Services sector. With the major challenges that we all faced in 2009 seemingly behind us, companies in every industry are increasingly looking forward. They are asking our agencies for innovative new programs and integrated, multi-agency solutions that can help them win market share by fully engaging consumers in today's complex media landscape. In fact, all of the major client sectors we track are up for both the quarter and the first half, except for the Tech and Telecom sector, in which, as we previously mentioned, lost assignments with some large clients in 2009 will weigh on our results for the balance of the year by approximately 1%. 
Our pipeline is solid at the regional and local level and at all our major agencies. On a trailing 12-month basis, we remained net new business positive through the end of the second quarter. All told, our top line performance is ahead of where we had experienced it to be at this point in time. That's a reflection of the strength of our offerings and our people, as well as the broader-economic stabilization and recovery in a number of major world markets. 
And speaking to clients and our operating unit leadership, we're consistently hearing that the tone of the business is improving. But there is still a high degree of macro uncertainty as well as concerns domestically about jobs and consumer confidence. So we remain very conservative in how we manage the business and highly focused on our cost discipline. 
The work we've already done in that regard was evident in the second quarter's very strong profitability. Our operating income of $177 million was significantly improved from $97 million a year ago. Q2 operating margin of 11% was well above last year's 6.6% in the comparable period. Earnings per share were $0.15 compared to $0.04 in the second quarter of 2009. From 2006 to 2008 we put into public on a path of dramatically improved margin performance. During the first half of this year, as we emerge from the recession and return to a more normal business environment, we are demonstrating the capacity to get back on that positive margin trajectory. 
Another area in which our focus and hard work is bearing fruit is our long-standing commitment to conservative balance sheet management. Financial strength and flexibility have been key to our success, initially, as we retooled our company and more recently, as we moved through last year's severe economic problems. This approach has once again been validated, as we've seen upgrades from major credit rating agencies during the past few months. 
We also successfully negotiated an amended revolving credit facility that provides greater latitude for us to put cash on the balance sheet to work directly in the service of our shareholders. We recently completed the buyback of a majority of our convertible preferreds. As we continue to see improvements in the broader economy and in our operating performance, we will remain focused on opportunities that allow us to use the strength of our balance sheet to enhance shareholder value. At this point, let me hand over things to Frank for an in-depth look at our first half performance."
108616,109085143,70444,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. Results exceeded our expectations from both revenue and operating",1566,"Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. Results exceeded our expectations from both revenue and operating profit. We maintained effective discipline over expenses and attained significant year-over-year leverage on base payroll and occupancy expense. We also experienced significantly lower severance. 
Michael mentioned the significant improvement in our operating margin compared to last year's second quarter. But looking back a bit further, our 11% margin this quarter is comparable to Q2 of 2008, even though revenue was $200 million lower this year due to the intervening recession. 
It's also worth noting that we concluded the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, and completed a successful buyback of the convertible preferred shares in May. 
Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in more detail on the slides that follow. It's worth noting that our diluted EPS of $0.15 treats the benefit of $26 million related to our convertible shares transaction as dilutive to earnings, which is to say, the calculation of diluted earnings per share backs out that benefit. Buying back the preferreds eliminates $16 million of annual dividends or approximately $0.03 per share and reduces dilution overhang by $22 million common share equivalents. 
Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.62 billion, an increase of 9.7%. Compared to Q2 '09, exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.1%, and the net impact of acquisitions was minimal. 
Our organic revenue change was an increase of 8.5%, attributable to spend from existing clients as well as net new business. Among the primary drivers were 13.6% organic growth in the U.S. as well as double-digit growth globally in the Auto, Retail and Financial Services sectors. 
The Food, Beverage, Packaged Goods and Health and Personal Care verticals also enjoyed solid growth. Tech and Telecom results continued to weigh on our consolidated growth, but we did see the impact of lost assignments in 2009 begin to diminish compared to recent quarters. 
In Continental Europe, we saw substantially better sequential performance, that is, much less negative compared to Q1. We were pleased to see continued growth in Lat Am which looking back a year ago, also grew in Q2. We have solid results in Asia Pac. The U.K. decreased due to certain event assignments a year ago that did not repeat in the quarter. I’ll have more on the region in a moment. 
For the first six most of the year, organic growth was 3.1%. On the bottom half of this the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. 
At our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic change was 8.8%. Growth in the U.S. was significantly stronger than in international markets as a whole, with leadership by Mediabrands, Draftfcb and Lowe & Partners, including Deutsch. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 6.7% on an organic basis. Double-digit growth in the U.S. included strong increases in Events and Public Relations. 
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. In the U.S, the organic increase of 13.6% was due to broad participation across client sectors, with a notable rebound in the sectors that had decreased most dramatically a year ago, such as Auto and Financial Services. Domestically, we had growth at all our major integrated agencies and marketing service specialists. 
Internationally, revenue increased 1.6%, which is a very different picture from Q1. The U.K. decreased organically by 7.6%. The decrease is attributable to assignments in our Event business a year ago that did not repeat. Excluding Events, the U.K. increased by 5%, led by Mediabrands and Draftfcb. In Continental Europe, the organic decrease was 1%. Amongst our largest markets, revenue increased in France, was essentially flat in Spain but down in Germany and Italy. 
In Asia Pac, organic growth was 4.7%, with double-digit percentage increases in China and India, partially offset by continued softness in Japan. Organic growth in Lat Am was 6%, led by growth from existing clients. Our Other Markets region grew 10% organically with growth in Canada, South Africa and the Middle East. 
On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. While still negative, the most recent data points show a dramatic move in the right direction, in light of Q2 performance and the roll-off of a very challenging Q2 '09. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. Q2 operating margin was 11% compared with 6.6% a year ago. Salaries and related expense decreased to 61.3% of revenue from 65.7% in Q2 '09. 
Total SRS was $991 million compared with $968 million, an increase of 1.6% organically compared with our 8.5% organic revenue increase. Underneath that strong result, there were a number of moving pieces. Base payroll, benefits and tax was 50.8% of revenue compared with 55.6% a year ago. So with the revenue growth, we were able to leverage base pay by nearly 500 basis points. 
At the same time, we continue to invest, buying [ph] (22:41) areas of growth in the portfolio, such as Digital, at R/GA, HUGE and MRM, Mediabrands, Draftfcb in North America and Public Relations. 
Headcount at quarter end was 40,700 compared with 41,200 year ago. Severance expense was $17 million, which is a normal range for Q2, compared with $30 million a year ago or 1.1% of revenue this year compared with 2% in the prior year. Incentive expense in Q2 was 3.4% of revenue compared with 3.0% last year. The comparison reflects a higher accrual for our annual incentive program as a result of the above-plan performance year-to-date as well as below-plan results in the year-ago period. 
Temporary labor expense was 3.4% compared with 2.6% a year ago to support growth. All other salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenues compared with 2.5% a year ago. 
Trade-offs and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $449 million, an increase of 9.8% and 8.4% organically. The increase was mainly due to higher pass-through expenses, which were offset in revenue, due to the growth of the Project businesses, such as Events in the U.S. O&G expenses were 27.8% of revenue compared with 27.7% last year. 
Within O&G, we had significant leverage on occupancy expense, which was 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.5% last year. This was a result of both revenue growth and decreased rent expense, as a result of real estate efficiencies achieved over the past 12 months. Professional fees were unchanged as a percentage of revenue. Expenses due to travel, entertainment, office supplies and telecom increased slightly as a percentage of revenue, resulting from the general pickup in business. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. This tracks our progress between '06 and '08, the recession in 2009 and now our upward trend in the first half of this year. As we have said previously, our objective this year is better than 8% with organic top line growth, which will put us back on the track of aggressive margin expansion towards our ultimate goal of fully competitive profitability. 
On Slide 9, you see our debt maturities schedules as of June 30. This picture is substantially unchanged from the beginning of the quarter, with total debt of $1.9 billion. In April, we repurchased $21 million of our November 10 floating rate notes, as we mentioned on our last call. That transaction means $193 million of the November maturity remains outstanding. Our plan is to pay those notes from cash on hand. And as a reminder, we repurchased approximately $200 million in debt in both 2008 and 2009. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.9 in billion cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet compared with $1.8 billion a year ago. Included in the activity in Q2 that I just reviewed, over the past 12 months, we have used a total of approximately $370 million to repurchase debt and convertible-preferred stock. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow from the quarter. Cash from operations was $354 million, compared with $234 million in Q2 '09. With the improvement due to the increase in net income and a stronger working capital result. Investing activity used $22 million compared with the use of $36 million a year ago. DLKW [Delaney Lund Knox Warren] closed in July so is a Q3 event. Financing activities used $300 million, reflecting a convertible preferred transaction. 
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance year-to-date. In terms of organic growth, Q2 was our strongest quarter in many years, though admittedly against a forgiving comp. The growth we've begun to see has enabled us to leverage structural efficiencies that we put in place over the past few years. Of course, as economic conditions improve, there will be higher-level investment to support growth. As a result, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, with a focus on delivering our services efficiently. This will allow us to continue delivering on the margin expansion and increased profitability that we believe is achievable going forward. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Michael."

On our last call, we said that we were feeling increasingly confident about the revenue prospects for the business. As you can see, the second quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of economic crisis. 
We now expect to see positive organic growth for the year in 2010. Of course, there are always macro-effect factors that are beyond anyone's ability to control, and this remains very much the case at this time in the world economy. However, we believe that we're well positioned to achieve our objectives going forward. 
We continue to demonstrate that we have a firm hand on the business. This was evident in 2009, when we consolidated much of the margin progress made in recent years, despite significant challenges created by the recession. And we have demonstrated it thus far this year, as we begin to once again build momentum behind increased margins and profitability. We're also encouraged because the state of our professional offerings is, on the whole, very strong. Across our agencies we continue to invest in capabilities that help us meet the evolving needs of clients in an increasingly fragmented and technology-driven marketing world. 
Talent remains a strategic priority and an area in which we are seeing success in terms of both our recruitment efforts and our development programs. Our performance, when it comes to the majority -- major industry honors and agency of the year awards that were announced earlier this year, was terrific, with exceptional showings from our media and digital agencies, our PR firms, as well as Draftfcb. 
Once again, Mediabrands and Draftfcb were the leading drivers of our success during the quarter. We're seeing Mediabrands roll out leading-edge specialty and digital capabilities around the world, notably in growth markets such as Brazil and India. 
Initiative is strengthening its international operations and its management bench. The string of wins at UM continues with L'Oreal and Burberry during quarter, followed by Wells Fargo in July. Draftfcb's integrated channel-neutral model is now fully operational in the key world markets. 
1. The State Farm win in April was significant for them, as are new international assignments from Yum! Brands and the recent arrival of a new leader for its China operations. The agency's global management is fully aligned and focused on the strategic plan that will take the merger to a new phase of global growth. 
The performance of Health Care also continues to be a standout. At McCann Worldgroup, new leadership is in place, and we’re working to harness the power of the industry's premier global network and its full range of allied marketing service agencies. There have already been some changes and additions in the senior ranks, and the management team is focused on continuing to evolve their offering to create leading-edge marketing solutions for their clients. Wins such as IHOP, hire for the Shanghai Expo as well as continued expansion of the General Motors relationship at MRM were also positive signs during the quarter. 
Lowe’s turnaround keeps showing real progress. The agency’s relationships with major multinational clients are strong, and profitability continues to improve. The merger with Deutsche in North America will create a strong hub from which to pitch global opportunities as the recovery takes hold. 
Equally important, the acquisition of DAKW (sic) [DLKW] will provide Lowe with a top-five U.K. presence, a strong client list and a seasoned and cohesive management team that is eager to participate in international opportunities. At CMG, we're fortunate to have exceptional agencies, such as Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris in the PR space, that consistently deliver great thinking and programs to our clients. 
Our results demonstrate that we’re winning share in the space. We’re also seeing a great deal of digital activity in PR, and all of the marketing service agencies within CMG, such as Jack Morton and Octagon, and are building best-in-class social media and word-of-mouth practices. 
Our digital agencies, from specialists like MRM, R/GA and HUGE, to capabilities within our media agencies and fully integrated agencies and specialty agencies, such as our Healthcare, continued to perform very strongly. Within our group of leading-integrated U.S. independents, the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday continue to win and deliver great results. 
We've also seen a number of good wins at Mullen and Gotham, including JetBlue and some work for Chrysler. This combination of forward-looking agencies and highly disciplined financial management will always be the key to our long-term success. With revenue stability and growth solidly back in the picture, we feel we're very well positioned to deliver on our operating margin objective of better than 8% for the full year. 
We have the talent and the tools to benefit from a broader recovery and we're proving that we have the ability to convert revenue growth into bottom line results. But we've always been clear that it's not advisable to extrapolate the future from a single quarter or performance. 
In recent weeks, we've seen key economic indicators in flux, and there's still uncertainty due to the situation in Europe, to consumer sentiment and job outlook and continued volatility in the financial markets. That is why we believe it's responsible to continue to be conservative in how we manage expenses and in our outlook for the business for the remainder of 2010. 
In sum, we're very encouraged by our company's strong performance for the quarter and for the half year, and we are pleased by the improvement in the tone of the business. This will be a year in which we return to growth and to a trajectory of strong margin expansion. We'll continue to look for ways to put our cash to work to enhance shareholder value. And as the recovery fully takes root and becomes more widespread, we will ideally be positioned to significantly grow profitability and further increase shareholder value in 2011 and beyond. And with that, I thank you all for being with us, and open the floor for questions."

Do you have the ability to really focus on our marketing dollars in terms of the objectives we're looking at with respect to audiences, which is why on the technology side, we've made the kind of investments we made in Mediabrands, Cadreon. All these new media, ad server, ad exchanges, if you will, will enable us to target those marketing dollars and give our clients comfort in terms of the ROI with respect to the dollar. So even if there is a pullback in the economic environment, we can show our clients that spending these dollars is going to provide an ROI. That's where this business has come to, and that's why we're investing as much as we are in the technology side of our business. And it's just not on Mediabrands, it's in all our agencies.

I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance. Frank will then take us through the financial results. After his remarks, I'll return with specific observations relating to the agencies and closing comments before we move on to the Q&A. 
Overall, it's fair to say that we're quite pleased with second quarter performance that was strong on both the top and bottom line. As reported, revenue increased 9.7% in the quarter, and revenue was up 8.5% organically. The improvement relative to last year is significant, as is the sequential change from the first quarter. As was the case in the first quarter, we saw results strengthen month-to-month during Q2. We also saw contributions pretty much across the board in terms of geography, client sectors and across our portfolio of agencies. Of course, it should be noted that the severity of the downturn last year means we had the benefit of favorable comps this quarter. Nonetheless, organic revenue increase of 13.6% in the U.S. clearly shows that the signs of economic recovery are giving clients greater opportunities to engage in marketing spend. 
Activity in developing regions are continue to pick up, and we experienced double-digit organic growth in Brazil, China and India during the second quarter. While Europe showed sequential improvement, we remain cautious about the situation in that region, and the European recovery is not factored into our budgets or operating plans for 2010. 
In terms of client sectors, growth in the quarter and year-to-date has been very strong in the Auto, Retail and Financial Services sector. With the major challenges that we all faced in 2009 seemingly behind us, companies in every industry are increasingly looking forward. They are asking our agencies for innovative new programs and integrated, multi-agency solutions that can help them win market share by fully engaging consumers in today's complex media landscape. In fact, all of the major client sectors we track are up for both the quarter and the first half, except for the Tech and Telecom sector, in which, as we previously mentioned, lost assignments with some large clients in 2009 will weigh on our results for the balance of the year by approximately 1%. 
Our pipeline is solid at the regional and local level and at all our major agencies. On a trailing 12-month basis, we remained net new business positive through the end of the second quarter. All told, our top line performance is ahead of where we had experienced it to be at this point in time. That's a reflection of the strength of our offerings and our people, as well as the broader-economic stabilization and recovery in a number of major world markets. 
And speaking to clients and our operating unit leadership, we're consistently hearing that the tone of the business is improving. But there is still a high degree of macro uncertainty as well as concerns domestically about jobs and consumer confidence. So we remain very conservative in how we manage the business and highly focused on our cost discipline. 
The work we've already done in that regard was evident in the second quarter's very strong profitability. Our operating income of $177 million was significantly improved from $97 million a year ago. Q2 operating margin of 11% was well above last year's 6.6% in the comparable period. Earnings per share were $0.15 compared to $0.04 in the second quarter of 2009. From 2006 to 2008 we put into public on a path of dramatically improved margin performance. During the first half of this year, as we emerge from the recession and return to a more normal business environment, we are demonstrating the capacity to get back on that positive margin trajectory. 
Another area in which our focus and hard work is bearing fruit is our long-standing commitment to conservative balance sheet management. Financial strength and flexibility have been key to our success, initially, as we retooled our company and more recently, as we moved through last year's severe economic problems. This approach has once again been validated, as we've seen upgrades from major credit rating agencies during the past few months. 
We also successfully negotiated an amended revolving credit facility that provides greater latitude for us to put cash on the balance sheet to work directly in the service of our shareholders. We recently completed the buyback of a majority of our convertible preferreds. As we continue to see improvements in the broader economy and in our operating performance, we will remain focused on opportunities that allow us to use the strength of our balance sheet to enhance shareholder value. 
At this point, let me hand over things to Frank for an in-depth look at our first half performance."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. Results exceeded our expectations from both revenue and operating",1566,"Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast and is available on our website. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. Results exceeded our expectations from both revenue and operating profit. We maintained effective discipline over expenses and attained significant year-over-year leverage on base payroll and occupancy expense. We also experienced significantly lower severance. 
Michael mentioned the significant improvement in our operating margin compared to last year's second quarter. Looking back a bit further, our 11% margin this quarter is comparable to Q2 of 2008, even though revenue was $200 million lower this year due to the intervening recession.  It's also worth noting that we concluded the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and completed a successful buyback of the convertible preferred shares in May. 
Turning to Slide 3, you can see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in more detail on the slides that follow. It's worth noting that our diluted EPS of $0.15 treats the benefit of $26 million related to our convertible shares transaction as dilutive to earnings, which is to say, the calculation of diluted earnings per share backs out that benefit. Buying back the preferreds eliminates $16 million of annual dividends or approximately $0.03 per share and reduces dilution overhang by 22 million common share equivalents. 
Turning to operations on Slide 4, beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.62 billion, an increase of 9.7%. Compared to Q2 '09, exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.1%, and the net impact of acquisitions was minimal. 
Our organic revenue change was an increase of 8.5%, attributable to spend from existing clients as well as net new business. Among the primary drivers were 13.6% organic growth in the U.S. as well as double-digit growth globally in the Auto, Retail and Financial Services sectors. 
The Food, Beverage, Packaged Goods and Health and Personal Care verticals also enjoyed solid growth. Tech and Telecom results continued to weigh on our consolidated growth, but we did see the impact of lost assignments in 2009 begin to diminish compared to recent quarters. 
In Continental Europe, we saw substantially better sequential performance, that is, much less negative compared to Q1. We were pleased to see continued growth in Lat Am which looking back a year ago, also grew in Q2. We have solid results in Asia Pac. The U.K. decreased due to certain event assignments a year ago that did not repeat in the quarter. I’ll have more on the region in a moment. 
For the first six most of the year, organic growth was 3.1%. On the bottom half of the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. 
At our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic change was 8.8%. Growth in the U.S. was significantly stronger than in international markets as a whole, with leadership by Mediabrands, Draftfcb and Lowe & Partners, including Deutsch. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 6.7% on an organic basis. Double-digit growth in the U.S. included strong increases in Events and Public Relations. 
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region. In the U.S, the organic increase of 13.6% was due to broad participation across client sectors, with a notable rebound in the sectors that had decreased most dramatically a year ago, such as Auto and Financial Services. Domestically, we had growth at all our major integrated agencies and marketing service specialists. 
Internationally, revenue increased 1.6%, which is a very different picture from Q1. The U.K. decreased organically by 7.6%. The decrease is attributable to assignments in our Event business a year ago that did not repeat. Excluding Events, the U.K. increased by 5%, led by Mediabrands and Draftfcb. In Continental Europe, the organic decrease was 1%. Amongst our largest markets, revenue increased in France, was essentially flat in Spain but down in Germany and Italy. 
In Asia Pac, organic growth was 4.7%, with double-digit percentage increases in China and India, partially offset by continued softness in Japan. Organic growth in Lat Am was 6%, led by growth from existing clients. Our Other Markets region grew 10% organically with growth in Canada, South Africa and the Middle East. 
On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. While still negative, the most recent data points show a dramatic move in the right direction, in light of Q2 performance and the roll-off of a very challenging Q2 '09. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. Q2 operating margin was 11% compared with 6.6% a year ago. Salaries and related expense decreased to 61.3% of revenue from 65.7% in Q2 '09. 
Total SRS was $991 million compared with $968 million, an increase of 1.6% organically compared with our 8.5% organic revenue increase. Underneath that strong result, there were a number of moving pieces. Base payroll, benefits and tax was 50.8% of revenue compared with 55.6% a year ago. So with the revenue growth, we were able to leverage base pay by nearly 500 basis points. 
At the same time, we continue to invest, buying [ph] areas of growth in the portfolio, such as Digital at R/GA, HUGE and MRM, Mediabrands, Draftfcb in North America and Public Relations. 
Headcount at quarter end was 40,700 compared with 41,200 a year ago. Severance expense was $17 million, which is a normal range for Q2, compared with $30 million a year ago or 1.1% of revenue this year compared with 2% in the prior year. Incentive expense in Q2 was 3.4% of revenue compared with 3.0% last year. The comparison reflects a higher accrual for our annual incentive program as a result of the above plan performance year-to-date as well as below plan results in the year-ago period. 
Temporary labor expense was 3.4% compared with 2.6% a year ago to support growth. All other salaries and related expense was 2.6% of revenues compared with 2.5% a year ago. 
Trade-offs and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $449 million, an increase of 9.8% and 8.4% organically. The increase was mainly due to higher pass-through expenses, which were offset in revenue, due to the growth of the Project businesses, such as Events in the U.S. O&G expenses were 27.8% of revenue compared with 27.7% last year. 
Within O&G, we had significant leverage on occupancy expense, which was 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.5% last year. This was a result of both revenue growth and decreased rent expense, as a result of real estate efficiencies achieved over the past 12 months. Professional fees were unchanged as a percentage of revenue. Expenses due to travel, entertainment, office supplies and telecom increased slightly as a percentage of revenue, resulting from the general pickup in business. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. This tracks our progress between '06 and '08, the recession in 2009 and now our upward trend in the first half of this year. As we have said previously, our objective this year is better than 8% with organic top line growth, which will put us back on the track of aggressive margin expansion towards our ultimate goal of fully competitive profitability. 
On Slide 9, you see our debt maturities schedules as of June 30. This picture is substantially unchanged from the beginning of the quarter, with total debt of $1.9 billion. In April, we repurchased $21 million of our November 10 floating rate notes, as we mentioned on our last call. That transaction means $193 million of the November maturity remains outstanding. Our plan is to pay those notes from cash on hand. And as a reminder, we repurchased approximately $200 million in debt in both 2008 and 2009. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.9 in billion cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet compared with $1.8 billion a year ago. Included in the activity in Q2 that I just reviewed, over the past 12 months, we have used a total of approximately $370 million to repurchase debt and convertible-preferred stock. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow from the quarter. Cash from operations was $354 million, compared with $234 million in Q2 '09. With the improvement due to the increase in net income and a stronger working capital result. Investing activity used $22 million compared with the use of $36 million a year ago. DLKW [Delaney Lund Knox Warren] closed in July so is a Q3 event. Financing activities used $300 million, reflecting a convertible preferred transaction. 
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance year-to-date. In terms of organic growth, Q2 was our strongest quarter in many years, though admittedly against a forgiving comp. The growth we've begun to see has enabled us to leverage structural efficiencies that we put in place over the past few years. Of course, as economic conditions improve, there will be higher-level investment to support growth. As a result, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, with a focus on delivering our services efficiently. This will allow us to continue delivering on the margin expansion and increased profitability that we believe is achievable going forward. 
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Michael."

On our last call, we said that we were feeling increasingly confident about the revenue prospects for the business. As you can see, the second quarter provided additional indications that we've come through the worst of the impact of economic crisis. 
We now expect to see positive organic growth for the year in 2010. Of course, there are always macro-effect factors that are beyond anyone's ability to control, and this remains very much the case at this time in the world economy. However, we believe that we're well positioned to achieve our objectives going forward. 
We continue to demonstrate that we have a firm hand on the business. This was evident in 2009, when we consolidated much of the margin progress made in recent years, despite significant challenges created by the recession. And we have demonstrated it thus far this year, as we begin to once again build momentum behind increased margins and profitability. We're also encouraged because the state of our professional offerings is, on the whole, very strong. Across our agencies we continue to invest in capabilities that help us meet the evolving needs of clients in an increasingly fragmented and technology-driven marketing world. 
Talent remains a strategic priority and an area in which we are seeing success in terms of both our recruitment efforts and our development programs. Our performance, when it comes to the majority -- major industry honors and agency of the year awards that were announced earlier this year, was terrific, with exceptional showings from our media and digital agencies, our PR firms, as well as Draftfcb. 
Once again, Mediabrands and Draftfcb were the leading drivers of our success during the quarter. We're seeing Mediabrands roll out leading-edge specialty and digital capabilities around the world, notably in growth markets such as Brazil and India. 
Initiative is strengthening its international operations and its management bench. The string of wins at UM continues with L'Oreal and Burberry during quarter, followed by Wells Fargo in July. Draftfcb's integrated channel-neutral model is now fully operational in the key world markets. 
1. The State Farm win in April was significant for them, as are new international assignments from Yum! Brands and the recent arrival of a new leader for its China operations. The agency's global management is fully aligned and focused on the strategic plan that will take the merger to a new phase of global growth. 
The performance of Health Care also continues to be a standout. At McCann Worldgroup, new leadership is in place, and we’re working to harness the power of the industry's premier global network and its full range of allied marketing service agencies. There have already been some changes and additions in the senior ranks, and the management team is focused on continuing to evolve their offering to create leading-edge marketing solutions for their clients. Wins such as IHOP, hire for the Shanghai Expo as well as continued expansion of the General Motors relationship at MRM were also positive signs during the quarter. 
Lowe’s turnaround keeps showing real progress. The agency’s relationships with major multinational clients are strong, and profitability continues to improve. The merger with Deutsche in North America will create a strong hub from which to pitch global opportunities as the recovery takes hold. 
Equally important, the acquisition of DAKW (sic) [DLKW] will provide Lowe with a top-five U.K. presence, a strong client list and a seasoned and cohesive management team that is eager to participate in international opportunities. At CMG, we're fortunate to have exceptional agencies, such as Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris in the PR space, that consistently deliver great thinking and programs to our clients. 
Our results demonstrate that we’re winning share in the space. We’re also seeing a great deal of digital activity in PR, and all of the marketing service agencies within CMG, such as Jack Morton and Octagon, and are building best-in-class social media and word-of-mouth practices. 
Our digital agencies, from specialists like MRM, R/GA and HUGE, to capabilities within our media agencies and fully integrated agencies and specialty agencies, such as our Healthcare, continued to perform very strongly. Within our group of leading-integrated U.S. independents, the Martin Agency and Hill Holliday continue to win and deliver great results. 
We've also seen a number of good wins at Mullen and Gotham, including JetBlue and some work for Chrysler. This combination of forward-looking agencies and highly disciplined financial management will always be the key to our long-term success. With revenue stability and growth solidly back in the picture, we feel we're very well positioned to deliver on our operating margin objective of better than 8% for the full year. 
We have the talent and the tools to benefit from a broader recovery and we're proving that we have the ability to convert revenue growth into bottom line results. But we've always been clear that it's not advisable to extrapolate the future from a single quarter or performance. 
In recent weeks, we've seen key economic indicators in flux, and there's still uncertainty due to the situation in Europe, to consumer sentiment and job outlook and continued volatility in the financial markets. That is why we believe it's responsible to continue to be conservative in how we manage expenses and in our outlook for the business for the remainder of 2010. 
In sum, we're very encouraged by our company's strong performance for the quarter and for the half year, and we are pleased by the improvement in the tone of the business. This will be a year in which we return to growth and to a trajectory of strong margin expansion. We'll continue to look for ways to put our cash to work to enhance shareholder value. And as the recovery fully takes root and becomes more widespread, we will ideally be positioned to significantly grow profitability and further increase shareholder value in 2011 and beyond. 
And with that, I thank you, all, for being with us, and open the floor for questions."

And while you're going to have to invest behind that growth, and you will see the salary line move to track that growth, we do believe a lot of the progress we made in reducing that cost base, we'll see it in greater conversion when the revenue comes back on stream.

Then, I think a less difficult question would be, also what kind of pricing environment are you seeing, did you see in the second quarter and in the third quarter?

Now your next question, was it going to be about what time frame? And obviously, that will be subject to the overall macroeconomic environment. But that has been our goal, it will continue to be our goal and we’re comforted by the results that we’re showing both from a leverage point of view on the cost side as well as the competitiveness of our offerings. As far as pricing goes, we haven't seen a huge release in terms of the activity of procurement or of clients focusing on getting more for less. That will continue. It's continued and will continue. But the other side of it is we've managed to be much more efficient in how we deliver our results. Clients are demanding the efficiencies. And frankly, clients are looking for performance, and I think that's part of what you're seeing. If we can prove performance relating to our offerings, then, I think we'll see not a total relaxing of pricing but certainly a value-oriented competitive offering."

So we're seeing -- did it make sense for that to be a lagging sort of cost line as it takes time to renegotiate leases and get out of leases that you don't need. So I guess that's a question. Is that the right way to think about it? And if it is, how many more quarters or how much longer do continue to benefit from sort of year-on-year declines there? And then that sort of a similar question on base, I think, Michael, you said you were up 500 heads year-on-year.

As a side note, we're calling you from Richmond, Virginia, home of your of our Agency of the Year, the Martin Agency, and we're pleased to be here. And in fact, we had our board meeting here yesterday as well.
I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance, thereafter, which Frank will then take us through the financial results. I'll then return with additional detail about what's taking place at our key agencies and some closing comments. As always, we'll always leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
In looking at our performance, we're pleased with the third quarter that saw a strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 9.4% in the quarter, both as reported and in terms of organic revenue growth. It's gratifying that contributions came from such a broad range of our portfolio. Our U.S. organic revenue growth was 10%.
Key emerging markets, such as India, South Africa, Brazil, and the whole of Latin America, posted strong double-digit organic growth rates. Europe, however, continued to lag.
In terms of client sectors, automotive, packaged goods and financial services all posted strong double-digit growth. Health and personal care was up in the mid-single digits, as was technology and telecom, including the fact that we are cycling out at some significant assignment lost last year in the category.
At the agency level, there was a strong organic growth at many of our companies. Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Weber Shandwick, Hill Holliday, Mullen, Jack Morton and Octagon. Digital was also a material contributor to our growth in the quarter, with very strong performance at the McCann's MRM unit, R/GA, HUGE, as well as the digital capabilities within our PR firms and the U.S. independent agencies.
Overall, we are seeing a fair bit of activity on the new business front, and the pipeline is solid at most of our agencies across all disciplines. On a trailing 12-month basis, we remained net new business positive to the end of the third quarter.
The top line performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects the economic recovery. More important, our growth is the direct results of the investments we made during the past few years in talent and in developing markets and emerging media, as well as the strategic actions we've taken to strengthen and reposition a number of our key agency brands. While the first nine months of the year had been encouraging, and the tone of client conversations has improved, there is still a degree of uncertainty. 
Now turning to the bottom line, operating income was $100 million, an increase of 72% compared to a year ago. Operating margin was 6.4% compared to 4.1% for Q3 2009, which speaks to our continued operating discipline. The people, systems and tools we put in place to ensure that we can effectively manage the business are clearly working. Earnings per diluted share were $0.08, up from $0.03 in the comparable period last year. 
This performance further confirms that we are confident that we will deliver on our margin objective of greater than 8% for 2010. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have ample financial resources at our disposal. It's encouraging to see our strength recognized by the rating agencies again, as this morning, Fitch upgraded us to BBB from BB+, a rise of two notches. 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our first half performance."

Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S.",1312,"Thanks, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S. and international. We continue to maintain effective discipline over expenses.
In producing a strong profit growth Michael mentioned, we realized over 200 basis points of operating leverage on combined base payroll and temporary labor expenses. We also leveraged occupancy expense by 100 basis points and experienced lower severance expense.
Going the other way, in light of strong year-to-date performance at a number of our agencies, we have higher expenses for incentive compensation with contrast to a year ago when we decreased the incentive accrual.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.9 billion on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from the year ago level, while having used $287 million to purchase both the majority of our convertible preferred stock and a smaller amount of debt earlier this year.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.
It's worth noting here that our effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, which is below our current run rate, due in part to the reversal of valuation allowances in Europe.
Turning to operations on Slide 4 beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.56 billion, an increase of 9.4%. Compared to Q3 '09, exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% and net acquisitions contribute 0.6%.
Our organic revenue change was an increase of 9.4% due to growth with existing clients and net new business across all of our disciplines. Regionally, we are very strong in North America, LATAM, South Africa and the Middle East. We had double-digit growth in auto, financial services and packaged goods, as well as a rebound in tech and telecom. For the first nine months, organic revenue was 5.2%.
On the bottom half of the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, organic growth was 8.8%. Growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, with leadership by Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, and Mediabrands. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 12.3% at an organic basis, reflecting double-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally. We had growth across the board at all our principal operating units and disciplines, PR, events and sports marketing.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region.  In the U.S., the organic increase of 10% was driven by broad participation across client sectors and disciplines. We were led by Draftfcb, Mediabrands and Lowe & Partners, as well as Hill Holliday, Campbell-Ewald, Weber Shandwick, Jack Morton and Octagon. International organic growth was 8.6%. In the U.K., revenue increased 3.9% organically, led by our marketing services specialist agencies.
In Continental Europe, the organic decrease was 1%, a level consistent with the second quarter and our expectations. Spending by our multinational clients held up better than that of regional and local clients. Among our largest markets, revenue increased in France with decreases in Germany, Spain and Italy.
In Asia-Pac, organic growth was 3.5%. Growth in India, Australia and China was partially offset by a notable decrease in Japan. Asia-Pac x Japan grew 10% organically. Organic growth in LATAM strengthened to 28.8%, an outstanding performance led by our agencies in Brazil, where we saw significant increases by multinational clients across several sectors. Our other markets group grew 27.1% organically, primarily reflecting strong performance in South Africa and the Middle East.
On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is a positive 1.1%, which the trajectory this year indicative of the recovery we're seeing many markets around the world.
On Slide 7, we'll take a closer look at operating expenses. Q3 operating margin was 6.4% compared with 4.1% a year ago. Salaries and related expenses decreased to 64.5% of revenue from 66.1% in Q3 '09. Total SRS is $1.01 billion compared with $944 million, an increase of 6.7%.
Underneath that result, there were a number of moving pieces. Base payroll, benefits in taxes, was 53.1% of revenue compared with 56.3% of revenue a year ago, an improvement of 320 basis points. At the same time, we continue to invest prime areas of growth in the portfolio, such as at Mediabrands, Draftfcb, R/GA, MRM and HUGE, as well as public relations. Across our agencies, we are adding digital talent. Headcount at quarter end was 41,200 including the consolidation of DLKW. This is an increase of 2.3% from a year ago.
Severance expense was $16 million, which is in a normal range for Q3 compared with $23 million a year ago or 1% of revenue for this year compared with 1.6% a year ago.
Incentive expense was 4.2% of revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the comparison reflects higher expense for annual and long-term incentive programs due to strong performance against budget, as well as a decrease in net expense a year ago due to the recession.
Temporary labor expense was 3.8% compared with 2.9% a year ago to support growth. All other salaries and related expense was 2.4% of revenue compared with 2.6% last year.
Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $452 million or 29% of revenue compared with 29.8% a year ago. Expenses increased 6.3%, largely due to higher pass-through expenses, which were offset in revenue.
Within O&G, we had significant leverage on occupancy expense, which was 8% of revenue compared with 9%. This was a result of revenue growth and decreased rent expense as a result of real estate efficiencies achieved over the past 12 months. Professional fees were 1.6% of revenue compared with 1.9%. Expenses due to travel and entertainment, office supplies and telecom increased slightly as a percent of revenue due to the higher level of business activity. All other O&G was 15.7% of revenue, 30 basis points above last year, primarily reflecting increased pass-through expenses.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history in a trailing 12-month basis, which was 7.8% at the end of the third quarter. 
On Slide 9, you see our debt maturity schedule, as of September 30, with total debt of $1.9 billion. We have a senior note maturing of $192 million, maturing in a couple of weeks, which we plan to pay from cash on hand. As a reminder, we also repurchased approximately $200 million in debt in both 2008 and 2009. Our August 2011 maturity is now classified as current and is only $36 million.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from a year ago. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Operations generated $40 million compared with $125 million in Q3 '09. Working capital used $60 million in the quarter, which is a seasonally normal level for the third quarter. Investing activities used $76 million, which includes our purchase of DLKW, compared with the use of $50 million a year ago. Financing activities used $12 million.
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. Alongside strong growth driven by the competitiveness of our brands, we continue to manage expenses carefully. Importantly, we are also continuing to invest in growth and efficiency. This will allow us to continue to deliver on the margin expansion and increase profitability that we believe are achievable going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael."

As you can see, our third quarter showed further evidence of the broader economic recovery in a degree to which we have competitive offering, including growth areas, such as market services, digital, as well as a number of the emerging economy.
We are pleased with our performance year-to-date. Our agencies that are seeing growth are investing in talent but we are also keeping close control on our costs. That is why we're confident in our ability to deliver our stated operating margin objective of greater than 8% for this year.
This level of performance would represent significant step-up from 2009 margin and would put us back on track to meet our ultimate goal of tier level margins within the next few years. Our momentum in terms of profitability demonstrates that we've put in place the right systems and people to effectively manage our business.
The high quality of our professional offering has also allowed us to achieve our goal of competitive organic revenue growth in 2010. Developments at the agencies are key in ensuring that we'll build on that momentum, so what I'd like to do now is cover those areas in greater detail.
For the quarter and year-to-date, as was the case in 2009, performance at Draftfcb was outstanding. The leadership of CEO Laurence Boschetto and his team, along with the agencies integrated model, is driving strong results for clients around the world. During the quarter, they've posted wins with electronic arts and a number of existing clients, including new assignments in Asia with Sony and India's Tata group. The appointments of Michael Fassnacht as President in Chicago and Damon Neiman [ph] as CEO in York was two of the network's stronger talents in more prominent roles for which they can add even more value to the organization.
Mediabrands was also very strong performer in the quarter. UM won MasterCard in the U.S. It flows through our unit in India with named agency of record for Coke throughout Asia and ECHO shows UM as its global AOR, with regional hubs in the U.S., U.K. and China. Initiative continues to grow its business in step with major clients such as Hyundai Kia and Home Depot, as well as posting key regional wins in Europe with Bang & Olufsen and Unilever Search Assignment in Latin America.
Mediabrand ventures to rollout a price globally and to launch business models such as Velociter, which will partner with the early-stage new media companies and startups. The acquisition of CUBOCC is integrating quickly, and we are excited about the JV in India to an Interactive Avenues, a leading local digital agency.
The recently launched Mediabrands Shopper Science practice, won business from Home Depot, Boston Market and Coke during this quarter. Lowe's results continue to improve, and the agency will be profitable in 2010. Headline news included the celebration of our 50-year relationship with Unilever and strong performance in that client's business.
Our combined Deutsche low global team won a major B2B assignment for Microsoft's cloud computing platform, validating the strategy to combine these agencies. Work on that launch will start shortly. 
We're also pleased with the integration of DLKW as the agencies are coming together in our Sloane Avenue space. Lowe was also launched open, its retail activation unit, in China and Brazil during the third quarter. 
At CMG, the work of Weber Shandwick and GollinHarris keeps winning awards and more important, taking market share from our competitors. We PR as an important growth area for the business in an age of social media and believe we have some of the strongest agencies in the industry.
Sports marketing performed well, and the events continue to pick up in Q3. Notable wins included new work with Nestlé, Unilever and Verizon. Collaboration is a hallmark of the CMG unit and an credit goes to Harry Simon and his team for creating collegial and successful culture.
Our domestic integrated independents are capitalizing on the strength of the U.S. recovery, and we're seeing terrific wins and talent joint agencies, such as the Martin Agency where we are today, Hill Holliday, Mullen and increasingly Gotham. 
Turning to the McCann Worldgroup. I recently attended the agency's meeting to launch its new global strategic positioning. The work MRM is doing to GM in the digital CRM space globally is growing strongly. The McCann Healthcare offering is also powerful globally, and the addition of W [ph and its creative firepower in Brazil is already leading to new business momentum. Nick Brien and his team are energized and committed to making McCann Worldgroup the world's best marketing solutions network. 
There have already been notable additions to senior management. A new CFO for the organization from the Mediabrands leadership team, a new global CEO is named for MRM and another promoted into that role at McCann Healthcare. Both will take these units to new levels. A new head of global accounts and a new President for the Midwest have also been brought on recently. Additional strategic and personal moves will doubtlessly be required at the Worldgroup. But we feel confident that we have the right leadership and offerings in place.
Before turning to questions, I wanted to close with some remarks about our outlook for the fourth quarter and to reiterate our commitment to putting the balance sheet to work on behalf of our shareholders. Q4 is important to our overall results. The quarter has always had a significant level of variable project spend. This ability to that project business carries with it a degree of uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are very confident in the quality of our offerings. The tone of the business is fundamentally solid, and client's liquidity is strong.
However, with comps becoming more challenging and some sectors and client wins cycling stronger Q4 2009 results, we see solid but moderating growth for the balance of the year. IPG's performance in 2008 was its best in nearly a decade. 
Last year, despite the worst recession any of us have experienced, our strong professional offerings and conservative financial management allowed us to hold on to much of the margin progress we had made and positioned us for the recovery. The first nine months of 2010 had demonstrated our ability to achieve competitive organic revenue and get back on track to score the margin expansion. The tone of the business as we look to 2011 remain solid. Media and marketing continue to grow more fragmented and technology plays, and increasingly large role in consumers' lives. Emerging economies such as LATAM, India, China, Russia and Africa are also proving they're here to stay and represent long-term growth opportunities.
All of these factors will work in our favor because the diversified, integrated provider of marketing services like IPG is vital for clients to navigate and to succeed in this complex environment. We will share with you in much greater detail the state of our key offerings and our revenue and profitability goals going forward at an Investor Day to be held in New York in late March of next year. This fundamental belief that our company's long-term future, coupled with all of the work we've done to bolster our financial as infrastructure in recent years have put us in a strong position. 
Recent performance including the impressive results announced thus far this year, gives us confidence that the strength of our cash flow will allow us to meet the needs for disciplined reinvestment in the business, including talent acquisition, targeted M&A in high-growth competencies and geographies. And furthermore, we will continue to explore additional options for the return of capital for shareholders owners, including share buyback and dividends. We are in a position to consider these actions because we believe and we see results in recent years as part of a sustainable, long-term path to achieving our growth of competitive top and bottom line performance.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and open the call to questions."

We don't see any big major setback, which is why is said our fourth quarter should be solid. But we don't expect 10% organic growth, okay? In terms of margins, we've indicated we expect -- our goal is to get the competitive margins, which are 12%, 13%. Now we're not going to have to occur all at once. So we think that will be over in some period of time, shorter rather long, but that remains to be seen on the full year results. And that's really what we're going to lay out on our Investor Day in March. But certainly, we're positioned to achieve competitive margins as we stated."

I guess, what my thought process is, where are we in that transition process? And as we look to next year, where your comps for the company will be tougher as for the whole industry, does McCann, if the strategy is working, become a nice sort of lift to overall growth rate next year. And then for Frank, just on the balance sheet, I know it's complex, but you just spent a minute talking about the revolver test and how much cash you have available, liquidity available to buy backs stocks as you move into 2011?

We had 350 people from all over the world jointly focusing on the go-to-market strategies, where our strengths are, where we have to build and how we're going to collaborate in this challenging environment and putting together into greater offerings. So I was very excited about what was happening at McCann. And certainly, we look to 2010 as a transition year for McCann, as you would expect, if you look at just changes that have already occurred. And we would expect to start seeing improvement in 2011. And that's certainly a key component of our objective of achieving competitive margins because frankly, McCann is a significant factor in that growth. And I'm feeling real good about our offering. Let's face it, McCann is a global force, okay? And as client base and the opportunities, just for the existing client base, is significant to us.

As a side note, we're calling you from Richmond, Virginia, home of your of our Agency of the Year, the Martin Agency, and we're pleased to be here. And in fact, we had our board meeting here yesterday as well.
I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance, thereafter, which Frank will then take us through the financial results. I'll then return with additional detail about what's taking place at our key agencies and some closing comments. As always, we'll always leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
In looking at our performance, we're pleased with the third quarter that saw a strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 9.4% in the quarter, both as reported and in terms of organic revenue growth. It's gratifying that contributions came from such a broad range of our portfolio. Our U.S. organic revenue growth was 10%.
Key emerging markets, such as India, South Africa, Brazil, and the whole of Latin America, posted strong double-digit organic growth rates. Europe, however, continued to lag.
In terms of client sectors, automotive, packaged goods and financial services all posted strong double-digit growth. Health and personal care was up in the mid-single digits, as was technology and telecom, including the fact that we are cycling out at some significant assignment lost last year in the category.
At the agency level, there was a strong organic growth at many of our companies. Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Weber Shandwick, Hill Holliday, Mullen, Jack Morton and Octagon. Digital was also a material contributor to our growth in the quarter, with very strong performance at the McCann's MRM unit, R/GA, HUGE, as well as the digital capabilities within our PR firms and the U.S. independent agencies.
Overall, we are seeing a fair bit of activity on the new business front, and the pipeline is solid at most of our agencies across all disciplines. On a trailing 12-month basis, we remained net new business positive to the end of the third quarter.
The top line performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects the economic recovery. More important, our growth is the direct results of the investments we made during the past few years in talent and in developing markets and emerging media, as well as the strategic actions we've taken to strengthen and reposition a number of our key agency brands. While the first nine months of the year had been encouraging, and the tone of client conversations has improved, there is still a degree of uncertainty. 
Now turning to the bottom line, operating income was $100 million, an increase of 72% compared to a year ago. Operating margin was 6.4% compared to 4.1% for Q3 2009, which speaks to our continued operating discipline. The people, systems and tools we put in place to ensure that we can effectively manage the business are clearly working. Earnings per diluted share were $0.08, up from $0.03 in the comparable period last year. 
This performance further confirms that we are confident that we will deliver on our margin objective of greater than 8% for 2010. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have ample financial resources at our disposal. It's encouraging to see our strength recognized by the rating agencies again, as this morning, Fitch upgraded us to BBB from BB+, a rise of two notches. 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our first half performance.

Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S.",1312,"Thanks, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S. and international. We continue to maintain effective discipline over expenses.
In producing a strong profit growth Michael mentioned, we realized over 200 basis points of operating leverage on combined base payroll and temporary labor expenses. We also leveraged occupancy expense by 100 basis points and experienced lower severance expense.
Going the other way, in light of strong year-to-date performance at a number of our agencies, we have higher expenses for incentive compensation with contrast to a year ago when we decreased the incentive accrual.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.9 billion on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from the year ago level, while having used $287 million to purchase both the majority of our convertible preferred stock and a smaller amount of debt earlier this year.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.
It's worth noting here that our effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, which is below our current run rate, due in part to the reversal of valuation allowances in Europe.
Turning to operations on Slide 4 beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.56 billion, an increase of 9.4%. Compared to Q3 '09, exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% and net acquisitions contribute 0.6%.
Our organic revenue change was an increase of 9.4% due to growth with existing clients and net new business across all of our disciplines. Regionally, we are very strong in North America, LATAM, South Africa and the Middle East. We had double-digit growth in auto, financial services and packaged goods, as well as a rebound in tech and telecom. For the first nine months, organic revenue was 5.2%.
On the bottom half of the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, organic growth was 8.8%. Growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, with leadership by Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, and Mediabrands. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 12.3% at an organic basis, reflecting double-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally. We had growth across the board at all our principal operating units and disciplines, PR, events and sports marketing.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region.  In the U.S., the organic increase of 10% was driven by broad participation across client sectors and disciplines. We were led by Draftfcb, Mediabrands and Lowe & Partners, as well as Hill Holliday, Campbell-Ewald, Weber Shandwick, Jack Morton and Octagon. International organic growth was 8.6%. In the U.K., revenue increased 3.9% organically, led by our marketing services specialist agencies.
In Continental Europe, the organic decrease was 1%, a level consistent with the second quarter and our expectations. Spending by our multinational clients held up better than that of regional and local clients. Among our largest markets, revenue increased in France with decreases in Germany, Spain and Italy.
In Asia-Pac, organic growth was 3.5%. Growth in India, Australia and China was partially offset by a notable decrease in Japan. Asia-Pac x Japan grew 10% organically. Organic growth in LATAM strengthened to 28.8%, an outstanding performance led by our agencies in Brazil, where we saw significant increases by multinational clients across several sectors. Our other markets group grew 27.1% organically, primarily reflecting strong performance in South Africa and the Middle East.
On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is a positive 1.1%, which the trajectory this year indicative of the recovery we're seeing many markets around the world.
On Slide 7, we'll take a closer look at operating expenses. Q3 operating margin was 6.4% compared with 4.1% a year ago. Salaries and related expenses decreased to 64.5% of revenue from 66.1% in Q3 '09. Total SRS is $1.01 billion compared with $944 million, an increase of 6.7%.
Underneath that result, there were a number of moving pieces. Base payroll, benefits in taxes, was 53.1% of revenue compared with 56.3% of revenue a year ago, an improvement of 320 basis points. At the same time, we continue to invest prime areas of growth in the portfolio, such as at Mediabrands, Draftfcb, R/GA, MRM and HUGE, as well as public relations. Across our agencies, we are adding digital talent. Headcount at quarter end was 41,200 including the consolidation of DLKW. This is an increase of 2.3% from a year ago.
Severance expense was $16 million, which is in a normal range for Q3 compared with $23 million a year ago or 1% of revenue for this year compared with 1.6% a year ago.
Incentive expense was 4.2% of revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the comparison reflects higher expense for annual and long-term incentive programs due to strong performance against budget, as well as a decrease in net expense a year ago due to the recession.
Temporary labor expense was 3.8% compared with 2.9% a year ago to support growth. All other salaries and related expense was 2.4% of revenue compared with 2.6% last year.
Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $452 million or 29% of revenue compared with 29.8% a year ago. Expenses increased 6.3%, largely due to higher pass-through expenses, which were offset in revenue.
Within O&G, we had significant leverage on occupancy expense, which was 8% of revenue compared with 9%. This was a result of revenue growth and decreased rent expense as a result of real estate efficiencies achieved over the past 12 months. Professional fees were 1.6% of revenue compared with 1.9%. Expenses due to travel and entertainment, office supplies and telecom increased slightly as a percent of revenue due to the higher level of business activity. All other O&G was 15.7% of revenue, 30 basis points above last year, primarily reflecting increased pass-through expenses.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history in a trailing 12-month basis, which was 7.8% at the end of the third quarter. 
On Slide 9, you see our debt maturity schedule, as of September 30, with total debt of $1.9 billion. We have a senior note maturing of $192 million, maturing in a couple of weeks, which we plan to pay from cash on hand. As a reminder, we also repurchased approximately $200 million in debt in both 2008 and 2009. Our August 2011 maturity is now classified as current and is only $36 million.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from a year ago. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Operations generated $40 million compared with $125 million in Q3 '09. Working capital used $60 million in the quarter, which is a seasonally normal level for the third quarter. Investing activities used $76 million, which includes our purchase of DLKW, compared with the use of $50 million a year ago. Financing activities used $12 million.
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. Alongside strong growth driven by the competitiveness of our brands, we continue to manage expenses carefully. Importantly, we are also continuing to invest in growth and efficiency. This will allow us to continue to deliver on the margin expansion and increase profitability that we believe are achievable going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael.

As you can see, our third quarter showed further evidence of the broader economic recovery in a degree to which we have competitive offering, including growth areas, such as market services, digital, as well as a number of the emerging economy.
We are pleased with our performance year-to-date. Our agencies that are seeing growth are investing in talent but we are also keeping close control on our costs. That is why we're confident in our ability to deliver our stated operating margin objective of greater than 8% for this year.
This level of performance would represent significant step-up from 2009 margin and would put us back on track to meet our ultimate goal of tier level margins within the next few years. Our momentum in terms of profitability demonstrates that we've put in place the right systems and people to effectively manage our business.
The high quality of our professional offering has also allowed us to achieve our goal of competitive organic revenue growth in 2010. Developments at the agencies are key in ensuring that we'll build on that momentum, so what I'd like to do now is cover those areas in greater detail.
For the quarter and year-to-date, as was the case in 2009, performance at Draftfcb was outstanding. The leadership of CEO Laurence Boschetto and his team, along with the agencies integrated model, is driving strong results for clients around the world. During the quarter, they've posted wins with electronic arts and a number of existing clients, including new assignments in Asia with Sony and India's Tata group. The appointments of Michael Fassnacht as President in Chicago and Damon Neiman [ph] as CEO in York was two of the network's stronger talents in more prominent roles for which they can add even more value to the organization.
Mediabrands was also very strong performer in the quarter. UM won MasterCard in the U.S. It flows through our unit in India with named agency of record for Coke throughout Asia and ECHO shows UM as its global AOR, with regional hubs in the U.S., U.K. and China. Initiative continues to grow its business in step with major clients such as Hyundai Kia and Home Depot, as well as posting key regional wins in Europe with Bang & Olufsen and Unilever Search Assignment in Latin America.
Mediabrand ventures to rollout a price globally and to launch business models such as Velociter, which will partner with the early-stage new media companies and startups. The acquisition of CUBOCC is integrating quickly, and we are excited about the JV in India to an Interactive Avenues, a leading local digital agency.
The recently launched Mediabrands Shopper Science practice, won business from Home Depot, Boston Market and Coke during this quarter. Lowe's results continue to improve, and the agency will be profitable in 2010. Headline news included the celebration of our 50-year relationship with Unilever and strong performance in that client's business.
Our combined Deutsche low global team won a major B2B assignment for Microsoft's cloud computing platform, validating the strategy to combine these agencies. Work on that launch will start shortly. 
We're also pleased with the integration of DLKW as the agencies are coming together in our Sloane Avenue space. Lowe was also launched open, its retail activation unit, in China and Brazil during the third quarter. 
At CMG, the work of Weber Shandwick and GollinHarris keeps winning awards and more important, taking market share from our competitors. We PR as an important growth area for the business in an age of social media and believe we have some of the strongest agencies in the industry.
Sports marketing performed well, and the events continue to pick up in Q3. Notable wins included new work with Nestlé, Unilever and Verizon. Collaboration is a hallmark of the CMG unit and an credit goes to Harry Simon and his team for creating collegial and successful culture.
Our domestic integrated independents are capitalizing on the strength of the U.S. recovery, and we're seeing terrific wins and talent joint agencies, such as the Martin Agency where we are today, Hill Holliday, Mullen and increasingly Gotham. 
Turning to the McCann Worldgroup. I recently attended the agency's meeting to launch its new global strategic positioning. The work MRM is doing to GM in the digital CRM space globally is growing strongly. The McCann Healthcare offering is also powerful globally, and the addition of W [ph and its creative firepower in Brazil is already leading to new business momentum. Nick Brien and his team are energized and committed to making McCann Worldgroup the world's best marketing solutions network. 
There have already been notable additions to senior management. A new CFO for the organization from the Mediabrands leadership team, a new global CEO is named for MRM and another promoted into that role at McCann Healthcare. Both will take these units to new levels. A new head of global accounts and a new President for the Midwest have also been brought on recently. Additional strategic and personal moves will doubtlessly be required at the Worldgroup. But we feel confident that we have the right leadership and offerings in place.
Before turning to questions, I wanted to close with some remarks about our outlook for the fourth quarter and to reiterate our commitment to putting the balance sheet to work on behalf of our shareholders. Q4 is important to our overall results. The quarter has always had a significant level of variable project spend. This ability to that project business carries with it a degree of uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are very confident in the quality of our offerings. The tone of the business is fundamentally solid, and client's liquidity is strong.
However, with comps becoming more challenging and some sectors and client wins cycling stronger Q4 2009 results, we see solid but moderating growth for the balance of the year. IPG's performance in 2008 was its best in nearly a decade. 
Last year, despite the worst recession any of us have experienced, our strong professional offerings and conservative financial management allowed us to hold on to much of the margin progress we had made and positioned us for the recovery. The first nine months of 2010 had demonstrated our ability to achieve competitive organic revenue and get back on track to score the margin expansion. The tone of the business as we look to 2011 remain solid. Media and marketing continue to grow more fragmented and technology plays, and increasingly large role in consumers' lives. Emerging economies such as LATAM, India, China, Russia and Africa are also proving they're here to stay and represent long-term growth opportunities.
All of these factors will work in our favor because the diversified, integrated provider of marketing services like IPG is vital for clients to navigate and to succeed in this complex environment. We will share with you in much greater detail the state of our key offerings and our revenue and profitability goals going forward at an Investor Day to be held in New York in late March of next year. This fundamental belief that our company's long-term future, coupled with all of the work we've done to bolster our financial as infrastructure in recent years have put us in a strong position. 
Recent performance including the impressive results announced thus far this year, gives us confidence that the strength of our cash flow will allow us to meet the needs for disciplined reinvestment in the business, including talent acquisition, targeted M&A in high-growth competencies and geographies. And furthermore, we will continue to explore additional options for the return of capital for shareholders owners, including share buyback and dividends. We are in a position to consider these actions because we believe and we see results in recent years as part of a sustainable, long-term path to achieving our growth of competitive top and bottom line performance.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and open the call to questions.

This quarter was a little bit lower because we were able to do some structural things in Europe that allowed us to reverse the valuation reserve against net operating losses. So in other words, in asset, we now believe will be fully utilized. With respect to the timing I think it's back to the kind of Michael made about Europe and the profitability since that's the key driver of our NOLs. So as we continue to see improvement in our European operations and some of the management changes we've made start to take hold, we'll see greater cash coverage by NOL utilization profitability coming out of Europe. But that's going to be the key driver in ability that rises NOLs in Europe.

As a side note, we're calling you from Richmond, Virginia, home of our Agency of the Year, the Martin Agency, and we're pleased to be here. And in fact, we had our board meeting here yesterday as well.
I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance, after which Frank will then take us through the financial results. I'll then return with additional detail about what's taking place at our key agencies and some closing comments. As always, we'll always leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
In looking at our performance, we're pleased with the third quarter that saw strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 9.4% in the quarter, both as reported and in terms of organic revenue growth. It's gratifying that contributions came from such a broad range of our portfolio. Our U.S. organic revenue growth was 10%.
Key emerging markets, such as India, South Africa, Brazil, and the whole of Latin America, posted strong double-digit organic growth rates. Europe, however, continued to lag.
In terms of client sectors, automotive, packaged goods and financial services all posted strong double-digit growth. Health and personal care was up in the mid-single digits, as was technology and telecom, including the fact that we are cycling out of some significant assignment lost last year in the category.
At the agency level, there was strong organic growth at many of our companies: Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Weber Shandwick, Hill Holliday, Mullen, Jack Morton and Octagon. Digital was also a material contributor to our growth in the quarter, with very strong performance at the McCann's MRM unit, R/GA, HUGE, as well as the digital capabilities within our PR firms and the U.S. independent agencies.
Overall, we are seeing a fair bit of activity on the new business front, and the pipeline is solid at most of our agencies across all disciplines. On a trailing 12-month basis, we remained net new business positive through the end of the third quarter.
The top line performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects the economic recovery. More important, our growth is the direct result of the investments we made during the past few years in talent and in developing markets and emerging media, as well as the strategic actions we've taken to strengthen and reposition a number of our key agency brands. While the first nine months of the year have been encouraging, and the tone of client conversations has improved, there is still a degree of uncertainty. 
Now turning to the bottom line, operating income was $100 million, an increase of 72% compared to a year ago. Operating margin was 6.4% compared to 4.1% for Q3 2009, which speaks to our continued operating discipline. The people, systems and tools we put in place to ensure that we can effectively manage the business are clearly working. Earnings per diluted share were $0.08, up from $0.03 in the comparable period last year. 
This performance further confirms that we are confident that we will deliver on our margin objective of greater than 8% for 2010. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have ample financial resources at our disposal. It's encouraging to see our strength recognized by the rating agencies again, as this morning, Fitch upgraded us to BBB from BB+, a rise of two notches. 
At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our first half performance."
108616,114113860,83382,"Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S.",1313,"Thanks, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S. and international. We continue to maintain effective discipline over expenses.
In producing the strong profit growth Michael mentioned, we realized over 200 basis points of operating leverage on combined base payroll and temporary labor expenses. We also leveraged occupancy expense by 100 basis points and experienced lower severance expense.
Going the other way, in light of strong year-to-date performance at a number of our agencies, we have higher expenses for incentive compensation with contrast to a year ago when we decreased the incentive accrual.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.9 billion on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from the year ago level, while having used $287 million to purchase both the majority of our convertible preferred stock and a smaller amount of debt earlier this year.
Turning to Slide 3, you see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.
It's worth noting here that our effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, which is below our current run rate, due in part to the reversal of valuation allowances in Europe.
Turning to operations on Slide 4 beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.56 billion, an increase of 9.4%. Compared to Q3 '09, exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% and net acquisitions contributed 0.6%.
Our organic revenue change was an increase of 9.4% due to growth with existing clients and net new business across all of our disciplines. Regionally, we were very strong in North America, LATAM, South Africa and the Middle East. We had double-digit growth in auto, financial services and packaged goods, as well as a rebound in tech and telecom. For the first nine months, organic revenue was 5.2%.
On the bottom half of the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, organic growth was 8.8%. Growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, with leadership by Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners and Mediabrands. 
At our CMG segment, revenue increased 12.3% on an organic basis, reflecting double-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally. We had growth across the board at all our principal operating units and disciplines, PR, events and sports marketing.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region.  In the U.S., the organic increase of 10% was driven by broad participation across client sectors and disciplines. We were led by Draftfcb, Mediabrands and Lowe & Partners, as well as Hill Holliday, Campbell-Ewald, Weber Shandwick, Jack Morton and Octagon. International organic growth was 8.6%. In the U.K., revenue increased 3.9% organically, led by our marketing services specialist agencies.
In Continental Europe, the organic decrease was 1%, a level consistent with the second quarter and our expectations. Spending by our multinational clients held up better than that of regional and local clients. Among our largest markets, revenue increased in France but decreased in Germany, Spain and Italy.
In Asia-Pac, organic growth was 3.5%. Growth in India, Australia and China was partially offset by a notable decrease in Japan. Asia-Pac x Japan grew 10% organically. Organic growth in LATAM strengthened to 28.8%, an outstanding performance led by our agencies in Brazil, where we saw significant increases by multinational clients across several sectors. Our other markets group grew 27.1% organically, primarily reflecting strong performance in South Africa and the Middle East.
On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is a positive 1.1%, with the trajectory this year indicative of the recovery we're seeing many markets around the world.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at operating expenses. Q3 operating margin was 6.4% compared with 4.1% a year ago. Salaries and related expenses decreased to 64.5% of revenue from 66.1% in Q3 '09. Total SRS is $1.01 billion compared with $944 million, an increase of 6.7%.
Underneath that result, there were a number of moving pieces. Base payroll, benefits and taxes, was 53.1% of revenue compared with 56.3% of revenue a year ago, an improvement of 320 basis points. At the same time, we've continued to invest prime areas of growth in the portfolio, such as at Mediabrands, Draftfcb, R/GA, MRM and HUGE, as well as public relations. Across our agencies, we are adding digital talent. Headcount at quarter end was 41,200 including the consolidation of DLKW. This is an increase of 2.3% from a year ago.
Severance expense was $16 million, which is in the normal range for Q3 compared with $23 million a year ago or 1% of revenue for this year compared with 1.6% a year ago.
Incentive expense was 4.2% of revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the comparison reflects higher expense for our annual and long-term incentive programs due to strong performance against budget, as well as a decrease in that expense a year ago due to the recession.
Temporary labor expense was 3.8% compared with 2.9% a year ago to support growth. All other salaries and related expense was 2.4% of revenue compared with 2.6% last year.
Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $452 million or 29% of revenue compared with 29.8% a year ago. Expenses increased 6.3%, largely due to higher pass-through expenses, which were offset in revenue.
Within O&G, we had significant leverage on occupancy expense, which was 8% of revenue compared with 9%. This was a result of revenue growth and decreased rent expense as a result of real estate efficiencies achieved over the past 12 months. Professional fees were 1.6% of revenue compared with 1.9%. Expenses due to travel and entertainment, office supplies and telecom increased slightly as a percent of revenue due to the higher level of business activity. All other O&G was 15.7% of revenue, 30 basis points above last year, primarily reflecting increased pass-through expenses.
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 7.8% at the end of the third quarter. 
On Slide 9, you see our debt maturity schedule, as of September 30, with total debt of $1.9 billion. We have a senior note maturing of $192 million, maturing in a couple of weeks, which we plan to pay from cash on hand. As a reminder, we also repurchased approximately $200 million in debt in both 2008 and 2009. Our August 2011 maturity is now classified as current and is only $36 million.
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from a year ago. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Operations generated $40 million compared with $125 million in Q3 '09. Working capital used $60 million in the quarter, which is a seasonally normal level for the third quarter. Investing activities used $76 million, which includes our purchase of DLKW, compared with the use of $50 million a year ago. Financing activities used $12 million.
In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. Alongside strong growth driven by the competitiveness of our brands, we continue to manage expenses carefully. Importantly, we are also continuing to invest in growth and efficiency. This will allow us to continue to deliver on the margin expansion and increased profitability that we believe are achievable going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael."

As you can see, our third quarter showed further evidence of the broader economic recovery and the degree to which we have competitive offering, including growth areas, such as marketing services, digital, as well as a number of the emerging economies.
We are pleased with our performance year-to-date. Our agencies that are seeing growth are investing in talent but we are also keeping close control on our costs. That is why we're confident in our ability to deliver our stated operating margin objective of greater than 8% for this year.
This level of performance would represent significant step-up from 2009 margin and would put us back on track to meet our ultimate goal of tier level margins within the next few years. Our momentum in terms of profitability demonstrates that we've put in place the right systems and people to effectively manage our business.
The high quality of our professional offerings have allowed us to achieve our goal of competitive organic revenue growth in 2010. Developments at the agencies are key in ensuring that we'll build on that momentum, so what I'd like to do now is cover those areas in greater detail.
For the quarter and year-to-date, as was the case in 2009, performance at Draftfcb was outstanding. The leadership of CEO Laurence Boschetto and his team, along with the agency's integrated model, is driving strong results for clients around the world. During the quarter, they've posted wins with Electronic Arts and a number of existing clients, including new assignments in Asia with Sony and India's Tata group. The appointments of Michael Fassnach as President in Chicago and Dana Maiman as CEO in York was two of the network's stronger talents in more prominent roles from which they can add even more value to the organization.
Mediabrands was also a very strong performer in the quarter. UM won MasterCard in the U.S., its Lodestar unit in India was named agency of record for Coke throughout Asia and ECHO chose UM as its global AOR, with regional hubs in the U.S., U.K. and China. Initiative continues to grow its business in step with major clients such as Hyundai Kia and Home Depot, as well as posting key regional wins in Europe with Bang & Olufsen and Unilever Search Assignment in Latin America.
Mediabrands Ventures continues to roll out Reprise globally and to launch new business models such as Velociter, which will partner with the early-stage new media companies and startups. The acquisition of CUBOCC is integrating quickly, and we are excited about the JV in India to an Interactive Avenues, a leading local digital agency.
The recently launched Mediabrands Shopper Science practice won business from Home Depot, Boston Market and Coke during this quarter. Lowe's results continue to improve, and the agency will be profitable in 2010. Headline news included the celebration of our 50-year relationship with Unilever and strong performance in that client's business.
Our combined Deutsche Lowe global team won a major B2B assignment for Microsoft's cloud computing platform, validating the strategy to combine these agencies. Work on that launch will start shortly. 
We're also pleased with the integration of DLKW as the agencies are coming together in our Sloane Avenue space. Lowe has also launched Open [ph], its retail activation unit, in China and Brazil during the third quarter. 
At CMG, the work of Weber Shandwick and GollinHarris keeps winning awards and more important, taking market share from our competitors. We see PR as an important growth area for the business in an age of social media and believe we have some of the strongest agencies in the industry.
Sports marketing performed well, and the events continue to pick up in Q3. Notable wins included new work with Nestlé, Unilever and Verizon. Collaboration is a hallmark of the CMG unit and credit goes to Harris Diamond and his team for creating collegial and successful cultures.
Our domestic integrated independents are capitalizing on the strength of the U.S. recovery, and we're seeing terrific wins and talent joint agencies, such as the Martin Agency where we are today, Hill Holliday, Mullen and increasingly, Gotham. 
Turning to the McCann Worldgroup. I recently attended the agency's meeting to launch its new global strategic positioning. The work MRM is doing for GM in the digital CRM space globally is growing strongly. The McCann Healthcare offering is also powerful globally, and the addition of W and its creative firepower in Brazil is already leading to new business momentum. Nick Brien and his team are energized and committed to making McCann Worldgroup the world's best marketing solutions network. 
There have already been notable additions to senior management. A new CFO for the organization from the Mediabrands leadership team, a new global CEO was named for MRM and another promoted into that role at McCann Healthcare. Both will take these units to new levels. A new head of global accounts and a new President for the Midwest have also been brought on recently. Additional strategic and personal moves will doubtlessly be required at the Worldgroup. But we feel confident that we have the right leadership and offerings in place.
Before turning to questions, I wanted to close with some remarks about our outlook for the fourth quarter and to reiterate our commitment to putting the balance sheet to work on behalf of our shareholders. Q4 is important to our overall results. The quarter has always had a significant level of variable project spend. This ability to that project business carries with it a degree of uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are very confident in the quality of our offerings. The tone of the business is fundamentally solid, and clients' liquidity is strong.
However, with comps becoming more challenging and some sectors and client wins cycling stronger Q4 2009 results, we see solid but moderating growth for the balance of the year. IPG's performance in 2008 was its best in nearly a decade. 
Last year, despite the worst recession any of us have experienced, our strong professional offerings and conservative financial management allowed us to hold on to much of the margin progress we had made and positioned us for the recovery. The first nine months of 2010 have demonstrated our ability to achieve competitive organic revenue and get back on track to strong margin expansion. The tone of the business as we look to 2011 remains solid. Media and marketing continues to grow more fragmented and technology plays, an increasingly large role in consumers' lives. Emerging economies such as LATAM, India, China, Russia and Africa are also proving they're here to stay and represent long-term growth opportunities.
All of these factors will work in our favor because the diversified, integrated provider of marketing services like IPG is vital for clients to navigate and succeed in this complex environment. We will share with you in much greater detail the state of our key offerings and our revenue and profitability goals going forward at an Investor Day to be held in New York in late March of next year. This fundamental belief in our company's long-term future, coupled with all of the work we've done to bolster our financial infrastructure in recent years have put us in a strong position. 
Recent performance including the impressive results announced thus far this year, gives us confidence that the strength of our cash flow will allow us to meet the needs for disciplined reinvestment in the business, including talent acquisition, targeted M&A in high-growth competencies and geographies and furthermore, we will continue to explore additional options for the return of capital to our owners, including share buyback and dividends. We are in a position to consider these actions because we believe and we see results in recent years as part of a sustainable, long-term path to achieving our growth of competitive top and bottom line performance.
With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and open the call to questions."

So just take a look at two transactions that we did in Brazil, I mean with the acquisition of CUBOCC on the digital media side and the addition of W to McCann in Brazil, that certainly was in anticipation of a very strong economic environment there. So we did expect it. Did we expect it to be as high as it is? No, it's hard to say. We are seeing an increase in media, okay? And the media spend, obviously, is driving that as well. So everything is all pointing in the right direction in those markets. And therefore, we will continue to invest. Same thing in India. We certainly expected India to be a growth market for us. If you remember, two years ago, we topped off our ownership in our two major units there to 100%. That was all in anticipation of those being key growth markets for us. So we now have the investment in Draftfcb at 100% and Lowe Lintas at 100%. So those markets were expected to recover and grow, certainly, strong. And to be candid with you, we didn't expect it to grow 30%, but we certainly were expecting it to drive a large growth."

And we would expect to start seeing improvement in 2011. And that's certainly a key component of our objective of achieving competitive margins because frankly, McCann is a significant factor in that growth. And I'm feeling real good about our offering. Let's face it, McCann is a global force, okay? And its client base and the opportunities, just for the existing client base, is significant to us.

As a side note, we're calling you from Richmond, Virginia, home of your of our Agency of the Year, the Martin Agency, and we're pleased to be here. And in fact, we had our board meeting here yesterday as well.
 I'll begin by covering the headlines of our performance, thereafter, which Frank will then take us through the financial results. I'll then return with additional detail about what's taking place at our key agencies and some closing comments. As always, we'll always leave plenty of time for Q&A.
 In looking at our performance, we're pleased with the third quarter that saw a strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 9.4% in the quarter, both as reported and in terms of organic revenue growth. It's gratifying that contributions came from such a broad range of our portfolio. Our U.S. organic revenue growth was 10%.
 Key emerging markets, such as India, South Africa, Brazil, and the whole of Latin America, posted strong double-digit organic growth rates. Europe, however, continued to lag.
 In terms of client sectors, automotive, packaged goods and financial services all posted strong double-digit growth. Health and personal care was up in the mid-single digits, as was technology and telecom, including the fact that we are cycling out at some significant assignment lost last year in the category.
 At the agency level, there was a strong organic growth at many of our companies. Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, Mediabrands, Weber Shandwick, Hill Holliday, Mullen, Jack Morton and Octagon. Digital was also a material contributor to our growth in the quarter, with very strong performance at the McCann's MRM unit, R/GA, HUGE, as well as the digital capabilities within our PR firms and the U.S. independent agencies.
 Overall, we are seeing a fair bit of activity on the new business front, and the pipeline is solid at most of our agencies across all disciplines. On a trailing 12-month basis, we remained net new business positive to the end of the third quarter.
 The top line performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects the economic recovery. More important, our growth is the direct results of the investments we made during the past few years in talent and in developing markets and emerging media, as well as the strategic actions we've taken to strengthen and reposition a number of our key agency brands. While the first nine months of the year had been encouraging, and the tone of client conversations has improved, there is still a degree of uncertainty.
 Now turning to the bottom line, operating income was $100 million, an increase of 72% compared to a year ago. Operating margin was 6.4% compared to 4.1% for Q3 2009, which speaks to our continued operating discipline. The people, systems and tools we put in place to ensure that we can effectively manage the business are clearly working. Earnings per diluted share were $0.08, up from $0.03 in the comparable period last year.
 This performance further confirms that we are confident that we will deliver on our margin objective of greater than 8% for 2010. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we have ample financial resources at our disposal. It's encouraging to see our strength recognized by the rating agencies again, as this morning, Fitch upgraded us to BBB from BB+, a rise of two notches.
 At this point, let me hand things over to Frank for an in-depth look at our first half performance.

Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S.",1312," Thanks, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast.
 On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of the quarter. We are pleased with operating results. Q3 revenue was balanced between the U.S. and international. We continue to maintain effective discipline over expenses.
 In producing a strong profit growth Michael mentioned, we realized over 200 basis points of operating leverage on combined base payroll and temporary labor expenses. We also leveraged occupancy expense by 100 basis points and experienced lower severance expense.
 Going the other way, in light of strong year-to-date performance at a number of our agencies, we have higher expenses for incentive compensation with contrast to a year ago when we decreased the incentive accrual.
 We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.9 billion on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from the year ago level, while having used $287 million to purchase both the majority of our convertible preferred stock and a smaller amount of debt earlier this year.
 Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail on the slides that follow.
 It's worth noting here that our effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, which is below our current run rate, due in part to the reversal of valuation allowances in Europe.
 Turning to operations on Slide 4 beginning with revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $1.56 billion, an increase of 9.4%. Compared to Q3 '09, exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% and net acquisitions contribute 0.6%.
 Our organic revenue change was an increase of 9.4% due to growth with existing clients and net new business across all of our disciplines. Regionally, we are very strong in North America, LATAM, South Africa and the Middle East. We had double-digit growth in auto, financial services and packaged goods, as well as a rebound in tech and telecom. For the first nine months, organic revenue was 5.2%.
 On the bottom half of the slide, you can see the revenue performance of our operating segments. At our Integrated Agency Networks, organic growth was 8.8%. Growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, with leadership by Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, and Mediabrands.
 At our CMG segment, revenue increased 12.3% at an organic basis, reflecting double-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally. We had growth across the board at all our principal operating units and disciplines, PR, events and sports marketing.
 Slide 5 provides a breakdown of revenue by region.  In the U.S., the organic increase of 10% was driven by broad participation across client sectors and disciplines. We were led by Draftfcb, Mediabrands and Lowe & Partners, as well as Hill Holliday, Campbell-Ewald, Weber Shandwick, Jack Morton and Octagon. International organic growth was 8.6%. In the U.K., revenue increased 3.9% organically, led by our marketing services specialist agencies.
 In Continental Europe, the organic decrease was 1%, a level consistent with the second quarter and our expectations. Spending by our multinational clients held up better than that of regional and local clients. Among our largest markets, revenue increased in France with decreases in Germany, Spain and Italy.
 In Asia-Pac, organic growth was 3.5%. Growth in India, Australia and China was partially offset by a notable decrease in Japan. Asia-Pac x Japan grew 10% organically. Organic growth in LATAM strengthened to 28.8%, an outstanding performance led by our agencies in Brazil, where we saw significant increases by multinational clients across several sectors. Our other markets group grew 27.1% organically, primarily reflecting strong performance in South Africa and the Middle East.
 On Slide 6, we chart a longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is a positive 1.1%, which the trajectory this year indicative of the recovery we're seeing many markets around the world.
 On Slide 7, we'll take a closer look at operating expenses. Q3 operating margin was 6.4% compared with 4.1% a year ago. Salaries and related expenses decreased to 64.5% of revenue from 66.1% in Q3 '09. Total SRS is $1.01 billion compared with $944 million, an increase of 6.7%.
 Underneath that result, there were a number of moving pieces. Base payroll, benefits in taxes, was 53.1% of revenue compared with 56.3% of revenue a year ago, an improvement of 320 basis points. At the same time, we continue to invest prime areas of growth in the portfolio, such as at Mediabrands, Draftfcb, R/GA, MRM and HUGE, as well as public relations. Across our agencies, we are adding digital talent. Headcount at quarter end was 41,200 including the consolidation of DLKW. This is an increase of 2.3% from a year ago.
 Severance expense was $16 million, which is in a normal range for Q3 compared with $23 million a year ago or 1% of revenue for this year compared with 1.6% a year ago.
 Incentive expense was 4.2% of revenue compared with 2.7% a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the comparison reflects higher expense for annual and long-term incentive programs due to strong performance against budget, as well as a decrease in net expense a year ago due to the recession.
 Temporary labor expense was 3.8% compared with 2.9% a year ago to support growth. All other salaries and related expense was 2.4% of revenue compared with 2.6% last year.
 Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G was $452 million or 29% of revenue compared with 29.8% a year ago. Expenses increased 6.3%, largely due to higher pass-through expenses, which were offset in revenue.
 Within O&G, we had significant leverage on occupancy expense, which was 8% of revenue compared with 9%. This was a result of revenue growth and decreased rent expense as a result of real estate efficiencies achieved over the past 12 months. Professional fees were 1.6% of revenue compared with 1.9%. Expenses due to travel and entertainment, office supplies and telecom increased slightly as a percent of revenue due to the higher level of business activity. All other O&G was 15.7% of revenue, 30 basis points above last year, primarily reflecting increased pass-through expenses.
 On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history in a trailing 12-month basis, which was 7.8% at the end of the third quarter.
 On Slide 9, you see our debt maturity schedule, as of September 30, with total debt of $1.9 billion. We have a senior note maturing of $192 million, maturing in a couple of weeks, which we plan to pay from cash on hand. As a reminder, we also repurchased approximately $200 million in debt in both 2008 and 2009. Our August 2011 maturity is now classified as current and is only $36 million.
 Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on the balance sheet, an increase of $167 million from a year ago.
 On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the quarter. Operations generated $40 million compared with $125 million in Q3 '09. Working capital used $60 million in the quarter, which is a seasonally normal level for the third quarter. Investing activities used $76 million, which includes our purchase of DLKW, compared with the use of $50 million a year ago. Financing activities used $12 million.
 In summary, on Slide 12, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. Alongside strong growth driven by the competitiveness of our brands, we continue to manage expenses carefully. Importantly, we are also continuing to invest in growth and efficiency. This will allow us to continue to deliver on the margin expansion and increase profitability that we believe are achievable going forward.
 Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael.

As you can see, our third quarter showed further evidence of the broader economic recovery in a degree to which we have competitive offering, including growth areas, such as market services, digital, as well as a number of the emerging economy.
 We are pleased with our performance year-to-date. Our agencies that are seeing growth are investing in talent but we are also keeping close control on our costs. That is why we're confident in our ability to deliver our stated operating margin objective of greater than 8% for this year.
 This level of performance would represent significant step-up from 2009 margin and would put us back on track to meet our ultimate goal of tier level margins within the next few years. Our momentum in terms of profitability demonstrates that we've put in place the right systems and people to effectively manage our business.
 The high quality of our professional offering has also allowed us to achieve our goal of competitive organic revenue growth in 2010. Developments at the agencies are key in ensuring that we'll build on that momentum, so what I'd like to do now is cover those areas in greater detail.
 For the quarter and year-to-date, as was the case in 2009, performance at Draftfcb was outstanding. The leadership of CEO Laurence Boschetto and his team, along with the agencies integrated model, is driving strong results for clients around the world. During the quarter, they've posted wins with electronic arts and a number of existing clients, including new assignments in Asia with Sony and India's Tata group. The appointments of Michael Fassnacht as President in Chicago and Damon Neiman [ph] as CEO in York was two of the network's stronger talents in more prominent roles for which they can add even more value to the organization.
 Mediabrands was also very strong performer in the quarter. UM won MasterCard in the U.S. It flows through our unit in India with named agency of record for Coke throughout Asia and ECHO shows UM as its global AOR, with regional hubs in the U.S., U.K. and China. Initiative continues to grow its business in step with major clients such as Hyundai Kia and Home Depot, as well as posting key regional wins in Europe with Bang & Olufsen and Unilever Search Assignment in Latin America.
 Mediabrand ventures to rollout a price globally and to launch business models such as Velociter, which will partner with the early-stage new media companies and startups. The acquisition of CUBOCC is integrating quickly, and we are excited about the JV in India to an Interactive Avenues, a leading local digital agency.
 The recently launched Mediabrands Shopper Science practice, won business from Home Depot, Boston Market and Coke during this quarter. Lowe's results continue to improve, and the agency will be profitable in 2010. Headline news included the celebration of our 50-year relationship with Unilever and strong performance in that client's business.
 Our combined Deutsche low global team won a major B2B assignment for Microsoft's cloud computing platform, validating the strategy to combine these agencies. Work on that launch will start shortly.
 We're also pleased with the integration of DLKW as the agencies are coming together in our Sloane Avenue space. Lowe was also launched open, its retail activation unit, in China and Brazil during the third quarter.
 At CMG, the work of Weber Shandwick and GollinHarris keeps winning awards and more important, taking market share from our competitors. We PR as an important growth area for the business in an age of social media and believe we have some of the strongest agencies in the industry.
 Sports marketing performed well, and the events continue to pick up in Q3. Notable wins included new work with Nestlé, Unilever and Verizon. Collaboration is a hallmark of the CMG unit and an credit goes to Harry Simon and his team for creating collegial and successful culture.
 Our domestic integrated independents are capitalizing on the strength of the U.S. recovery, and we're seeing terrific wins and talent joint agencies, such as the Martin Agency where we are today, Hill Holliday, Mullen and increasingly Gotham.
 Turning to the McCann Worldgroup. I recently attended the agency's meeting to launch its new global strategic positioning. The work MRM is doing to GM in the digital CRM space globally is growing strongly. The McCann Healthcare offering is also powerful globally, and the addition of W [ph and its creative firepower in Brazil is already leading to new business momentum. Nick Brien and his team are energized and committed to making McCann Worldgroup the world's best marketing solutions network.
 There have already been notable additions to senior management. A new CFO for the organization from the Mediabrands leadership team, a new global CEO is named for MRM and another promoted into that role at McCann Healthcare. Both will take these units to new levels. A new head of global accounts and a new President for the Midwest have also been brought on recently. Additional strategic and personal moves will doubtlessly be required at the Worldgroup. But we feel confident that we have the right leadership and offerings in place.
 Before turning to questions, I wanted to close with some remarks about our outlook for the fourth quarter and to reiterate our commitment to putting the balance sheet to work on behalf of our shareholders. Q4 is important to our overall results. The quarter has always had a significant level of variable project spend. This ability to that project business carries with it a degree of uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are very confident in the quality of our offerings. The tone of the business is fundamentally solid, and client's liquidity is strong.
 However, with comps becoming more challenging and some sectors and client wins cycling stronger Q4 2009 results, we see solid but moderating growth for the balance of the year. IPG's performance in 2008 was its best in nearly a decade.
 Last year, despite the worst recession any of us have experienced, our strong professional offerings and conservative financial management allowed us to hold on to much of the margin progress we had made and positioned us for the recovery. The first nine months of 2010 had demonstrated our ability to achieve competitive organic revenue and get back on track to score the margin expansion. The tone of the business as we look to 2011 remain solid. Media and marketing continue to grow more fragmented and technology plays, and increasingly large role in consumers' lives. Emerging economies such as LATAM, India, China, Russia and Africa are also proving they're here to stay and represent long-term growth opportunities.
 All of these factors will work in our favor because the diversified, integrated provider of marketing services like IPG is vital for clients to navigate and to succeed in this complex environment. We will share with you in much greater detail the state of our key offerings and our revenue and profitability goals going forward at an Investor Day to be held in New York in late March of next year. This fundamental belief that our company's long-term future, coupled with all of the work we've done to bolster our financial as infrastructure in recent years have put us in a strong position.
 Recent performance including the impressive results announced thus far this year, gives us confidence that the strength of our cash flow will allow us to meet the needs for disciplined reinvestment in the business, including talent acquisition, targeted M&A in high-growth competencies and geographies. And furthermore, we will continue to explore additional options for the return of capital for shareholders owners, including share buyback and dividends. We are in a position to consider these actions because we believe and we see results in recent years as part of a sustainable, long-term path to achieving our growth of competitive top and bottom line performance.
 With that, I'd like to thank you for your time and open the call to questions.

Sure. They're holding off for the same reason that everyone is concerned about the uncertainty that's out there. They want to see if there is a double dip and is there a change in the business momentum, if you will. But once we start seeing the consistency and the sustainability, I don't believe there's any reason why we shouldn't be upgraded. That's my personal belief.

And what you saw this quarter was on the incentive side, that's tracking as little north of 4% of revenues, higher than our normal facing, but that's primarily just because we feel more comfortable on the performance of our business for the year, especially against a couple of key agencies that are well in excess of their budgets. So the challenge for us to get to competitive margins is to continue to generate that operating leverage off our base salaries and that's the area of focus for us and we're confident that we can do it.

With respect to the timing I think it's back to the kind of Michael made about Europe and the profitability since that's the key driver of our NOLs.
