During the year, we generated cash, same-property performance growth of 3.2%, raised $881 million in equity proceeds, strengthened our balance sheet and ended the year with our strongest credit metrics a",816,"Thank you, Jay. 2009 was an excellent year for HCP. During the year, we generated cash, same-property performance growth of 3.2%, raised $881 million in equity proceeds, strengthened our balance sheet and ended the year with our strongest credit metrics and liquidity in five years, accretively acquired a $720 million participation in HCR Manor Care's first mortgage debt and terminated and transitioned 14 Sunrise-managed assets to new operators and sold one asset bringing the total number of Sunrise properties transitioned to 26 during the last 14 months, representing approximately a quarter of our total Sunrise exposure.
There are several topics that I will discuss. First, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. Second, our 2009 investment and disposition transactions. Third, our balance sheet and financing activities. Fourth, our 2010 guidance and finally, our 2010 dividend.
First, fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. In Q4, we generated 2.3% year-over-year cash same-property performance. Full year SPP grew by 3.2% which was above your guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. Reported FFO of $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter before $54 million or $0.19 per share of impairments.
As previously disclosed during the quarter, we recognized $48 million of impairments in connection with the bankruptcy of Erickson Retirement Communities and $4 million related to the anticipated restructuring of the Cirrus loan. The remaining $2 million was due to the early termination of a lease in our Life Science segment.
For 2009, FFO was $2.14 per share before approximately $177 million or $0.64 per share of impairments and litigation provision which was in line with the midpoint of our guidance of $2.13 per share. Full year FFO was impacted by several items not anticipated in our original guidance including $0.03 of gains on sale of HCA bonds, a $0.02 purchase price adjustment recorded in Q2 and $0.01 of lease termination fees partially offset by $0.03 of higher legal expenses and $0.02 of lower interest and DFL income related to the HCA bond sales and the bankruptcy of Erickson.
Second, 2009 investment and disposition activities. We acquired a $720 million participation in HCR Manor Cares first mortgage debt at a discount of $130 million for an acquisition price of $590 million. We also funded $120 million in develop and other capital projects primarily in our Life Science segment.
During the year, we disposed of 14 real estate assets for $72 million with gains of $37 million. We also sold a portion of our HCA bonds for $157 million realizing gains of $9 million. At year end, we held $140 million face value of HCA bonds which are currently trading at a 4% premium to par.
Third, balance sheet and financing activities. During 2009, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet. We completed two equity offerings generating $881 million in gross proceeds, a portion of which was used to repay our bridge loan and revolver. We also prepaid $113 million of mortgage debt that was due in 2010. As a result, our financial leverage during 2009 was reduced from 48% to 43%.
We also improved our fixed charge coverage from 2.3 times to 2.6 times. Our 2010 debt maturities of $300 million are modest and include $200 million of senior unsecured notes and $100 million of mortgage debt. We ended the year with $1.4 billion available on our revolver and $290 million of unrestricted cash and marketable securities.
Fourth, 2010 guidance. FFO was projected to range from $2.11 to $2.17 per share and at the midpoint is flat to 2009. Our 2010 guidance reflects a $0.08 reduction of FFO from 2009 deleveraging, net of investment activities. This amount is completely offset by organic NOI growth in our portfolio of $0.08.
Our guidance which assumes no significant acquisitions or dispositions of real estate or debt investments includes the following
cash SPP growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, G&A expense of $70 million, inclusive of stock-based compensation of $15 million, net floating rate asset exposure remains around $300 million and average LIBOR of 60 basis points, development, redevelopment and first generation capital funding of approximately $100 million including capitalized interest of $20 million, second-generation lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements of $55 million.
Guidance includes non-cash NOI of $59 million consisting of straight-line rents of $45 million, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles of $7 million and DFL accretion of $7 million. We're also assuming amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs of $7 million. Amortization of previously deferred rent of $4 million with no deferred rent from space pending completion of PI build-out and cash flow adjustments related to unconsolidated joint ventures of minus $10 million on a net basis.
Finally, our dividend. In the first quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.46 to $0.465 per share which represents an annual increase of $0.02 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul?

Let me go straight to the details of the performance of the portfolio. Senior housing, occupancy for the current quarter in our same-store senior housing platform is 85.5% representing 30 basis point sequential decline over the prior quart",1489,"Thank you, Tom. Let me go straight to the details of the performance of the portfolio. Senior housing, occupancy for the current quarter in our same-store senior housing platform is 85.5% representing 30 basis point sequential decline over the prior quarter and a 260 basis decline over the prior year.
Occupancy stabilization in our non-Sunrise portfolio appeared to be gaining traction. With this quarter's reporting our non-Sunrise portfolio had occupancy declines of less than 10 basis points sequentially. However, our Sunrise portfolio continues to underperform with this quarter's occupancy dropping 78 basis points from the last quarter.
Occupancy stabilization along with continued expense management and modest rate increases are holding coverages steady. As a result, we saw sequential same property cash flow coverage decline by only two basis points from 1.15 times to 1.13 times.
Current quarter same property cash NOI for the entire senior housing platform declined 6.1% with our Sunrise portfolio continuing to drag results. Our non-Sunrise portfolio had an improvement of 2% driven by normal rent steps. Our Sunrise portfolio declined by 19.6% driven by 2008 insurance credits and reduced LIBOR-based rents.
As a most recent example of our active asset management capabilities, we terminated nearly a quarter of our Sunrise assets and transitioned them to four new operators over the last 14 months. These operators assigned new long-term leases, significantly increasing the cash flow to HCP. The repositioning of these assets to new operators will drive strong 2010 same-property annual cash NOI growth for the entire senior housing sector we expect to range between 4.5% and 6.5%.
Our near-term leasing risk in senior housing consists of four leases set to expire in 2010 with annual rent of $664,000. Three are with the same operator where we are currently in negotiations to renew and we are exploring the options with the fourth. We also have one small loan to an operator that is expected to pay off.
Hospitals. Same-property cash flow coverage was down two basis points to 4.44 times. Same-property cash NOI for the fourth quarter remained down 10.4% driven by short-term rent relief at our Hogue Irvine Hospital. As we noted in our last call, Hogue began paying partial rent in August and is scheduled to pay full rent beginning in June 2010. As a result, we forecast a strong pickup in 2010 for hospital same property annual cash NOI growth of 10.5% to 11%.
Our near-term lease exposure consists of North Shore Regional Medical Center in Slidell, Louisiana, currently leased to tenant expiring May 31. We have executed a definitive agreement to sell the hospital to the private, not-for-profit Ochsner Health System with a projected close date of April 1st. Simultaneously, Ochsner will acquire the operations of the hospital from tenant. With this acquisition, Ochsner will operate eight hospitals in Southeast Louisiana.
As Tom previously discussed, HCP recognized a $4 million impairment related to our Cirrus loan in the fourth quarter. Cirrus is pro rata share of facility level EBITDA covers HCP's interest well at 1.5 times. However, due to the state of the credit markets, our borrower and its physician partners have made the decision not to distribute the cash flow, but rather delever the subsidiary partnerships and invest in operations.
In evaluating the underlying collateral, we believe facility level EBITDA will grow more than 10% in 2010 and that we are well collateralized. We are currently renegotiating the loan terms to allow for an orderly sale of the collateral.
Skilled Nursing. Our Skilled Nursing portfolio continues to perform nicely. Cash NOI for the fourth quarter increased 4.7%, driven by contractual rent increases, with solid cash flow coverage of 1.56 times.
HCR Manor Care reported improved third quarter trailing 12-month debt service coverage for the entire debt stack of 3.68 times, an increase of 65 basis points over the prior quarter. Their performance continues to benefit from stable occupancy, increased revenues from higher acuity residents and a favorable interest rate environment.
We are forecasting continued stability in our Skilled Nursing portfolio in 2010, with same-property annual cash NOI growth ranging from 1% to 2%. No lease rollovers occurring in 2010. However, two loans with the same operate are set to mature in 2010 with annual interest income of $1.4 million.
Medical Office Buildings. For the current quarter, same property cash NOI was up 5.8%. This growth was driven by continued success in our expense control initiatives and ongoing impact of the previously discussed operating support revenues.
Our expense reduction initiatives resulted in a decrease in quarterly controllable operating expenses of $1.2 million and an annual decrease of $3.6 million when compared to the prior year. We are targeting 2.25% to 2.75% same-store cash NOI growth in 2010 driven by modest increase in occupancy and contractual rent growth.
MOB occupancy for the fourth quarter was up 20 basis points to 90.9% as a result of new tenants taking occupancy in Nashville, Minneapolis and Las Vegas. This was offset slightly due to the expiration of two master leases in Utah where in place sub-tenants became direct tenants.
During the fourth quarter, tenants representing 473,000 square feet took occupancy of which 303,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Renewals for the quarter resulted in 1.6% higher mark to market rents and our retention rate for the year finished at 77.4%.
Looking forward to 2010, we have 2.325 million square feet of scheduled expirations, including 323,000 square feet of month-to month leases. Our pipeline remains strong with 428,000 square feet of executed leases that have yet to commence and 552,000 square feet in active negotiations.
Life Science. The fourth quarter same-store cash NOI was up 19.5%. These gains were principally driven by leasing activity that produced mark to market rent increases in previous quarters, the accelerated payback of deferred rent by a single tenant, recognition of revenue due completion of tenant improvements and contractual rent increases.
Looking forward to 2010, we expect our same-store annual cash NOI to decline by 2% primarily due to the previously mentioned accelerated payment of deferred rent in 2009. Excluding the accelerated repayment of annual cash NOI would increase 1%.
Occupancy for the entire Life Science portfolio fell 1.3% during the quarter to end the year at 89.8%. The decrease in occupancy was driven by a 58,000 square foot tenant that ceased operations in the Bay Area in November. For the quarter, we completed 94,000 square feet of leasing of which 61,500 square feet related to previously occupied space that was renewed at an average renting increase of approximately 50%.
Including leases from new tenants, we were able to address 100% of the expirations that occurred during the quarter with favorable tenant retention totaling 89% for all of 2009. Our focus on retaining tenants has allowed us to maximize cash flow with no downtime and minimal TI investment as our average tenant improvement costs on renewals totaled just $1.58 per square foot for the year. Our Life Science portfolio has limited lease expiration profile over the next two years.
Lease expirations for 2010 total 306,000 square feet and represent only 0 .8% of HCP's 2009 annualized revenue. Looking to 2011, we have 417,000 square feet of expirations which represent only 1.5% of HCP's annual revenue.
HCP continues to pursue a pipeline of leasing prospects in excess of 550,000 square feet for existing space. We continue to monitor larger institutional clients, who have begun to seek space to accommodate expansion needs, or locate functions.
Our development and redevelopment activities resulted in the completion of three Life Science buildings at the end of 2009. The three buildings in South San Francisco totaled 329,000 square feet and were placed into service beginning January 2010.
Two of the buildings representing 251,000 square feet or 76% of the space are leased to Amgen under long-term leases. The remaining building is currently being marketed to perspective tenants, with no commitment to date. As a result of these completions, the remaining development pipeline now consists of only three redevelopment projects totaling only 239,000 square feet.
HCP's Life Science portfolio performance remains strong despite deteriorating real estate fundamentals experienced in 2009. The performance was in large part due to the quality of our tenant base. The performance of our larger public Life Science tenants remains strong with continued earnings growth being reported for tenants like Roche-Genentech, Amgen, Dakota, Murigenetics and NuVasive.
In addition, our private venture-backed tenants raised $915 million in financing in 2009 with additional milestone payments totaling $2.9 billion from multiple sources including partnerships, public equity and venture capital.
Overall, the health of the financing environment supporting the Biotech industry rebounded strongly in 2009 as U.S. Biotechs set new fund-raising record by completing nearly $56 billion of deals during the year. From a liquidity standpoint, our Life Science tenants with less than 12 months of cash represented only 1.3% of HCP's 2009 annualized revenue.
With that review, I would like to turn it back to Jay.

In addition to being Valentine's Day, this Sunday begins the Chinese New Year of the Tiger. In Chinese astrology, the tiger is a dynamic and powerful sign.

In Chinese astrology, the tiger is a dynamic and powerful sign. Its nature is unpredictable, courageous and volatile. Therefore, the Year of the Tiger is usually associated with big change and social turmoil making 2010 likely to be a volatile year. While we are not yet 45 days into 2010, I think it's fair to say that Scott Brown's victory in Massachusetts and the resultant impact upon the prospects for health care reform, now being less likely to become law, qualify as big change and social turmoil.
From a 2009 perspective, HCP's Management and its board of directors are quite pleased with the overall performance of our investment portfolio which finished the year with a same property performance result of plus 3.2%, nicely above the 2.5% to 3% guidance we had provided. In addition, it was especially gratifying and lucrative to have had $1.7 billion or 15% of HCP's entire portfolio invested in high-yield debt investments which was among the best-performing asset class for all of 2009.
We begin 2010 with terrific credit metrics for HCP. In fact, the best financial position since the inception of the company back in 1985. The absolute amount of liquidity we currently enjoy is without equal in the Health Care Real Estate sector and we have a number of opportunities that we are currently pursuing.
On the last several earnings calls, you have consistently heard me highlight the company's best-in-class and investment portfolio and HCP's unique five-by-five diversified business model. From those of you that come from the trust but verified perspective of earnings call rhetoric, as we at HCP do, grab your pencil and listen up.
Measuring the recession as beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 and ending in the third quarter of 2009 and using HCP's investment portfolio's same-property performance as the best metric of a best-in-class health care investment portfolio, produces the following performance. Fourth quarter 2007, positive 0.7%; 2008, positive 1.6%; 2009, positive 3.2%; 2010 forecast, positive 2.5% to positive 3.5%. In other words, HCP's portfolio performance not only remained positive throughout the entire recession, but experienced accelerated improvement during the recession.
Furthermore, these numbers exclude $277 million in realized gains on assets we disposed of during the same period. By any measure, these investment results, given the magnitude of the economic downdraft during which these results were achieved, are extraordinary.
Now, let me take one more minute and peel the onion or your secret sauce. HCP's diversified five-by-five business model. Nothing goes up forever. Meaningful and I emphasize the world meaningful, diversification across five sub-sectors of Health Care Real Estate provides HCP shareholders with a stable recurring source of growing cash flows. We understand and expect that last year's outperformances are likely to be this year's more challenged sectors. This diversification insulates and sustains HCP's shareholders from concentrated downturns. This diversification also creates a superior universe of investment opportunities for the company.
Let me update you on HCR Manor Care's fourth quarter 2009 performance. Paul has just taken you through their third quarter results which are again summarized in our supplemental disclosure. For the healthcare analysts that are on today's call, you are no doubt aware of the fourth quarter weakness recently reported by one or more of the publicly traded skilled nursing operators. This was somewhat expected as the fourth quarter of 2009 was the first period in which the 1.1% Medicare reimbursement reduction occurred.
Now, here's an interesting fact. For the fourth quarter, HCR Manor Care reported a double-digit increase in their year-over-year EBITDA notwithstanding the reimbursement cut. Said differently, HCR Manor Care was able to completely offset and then some, the fourth quarter Medicare rate reduction through acuity shift.
Before closing, I want you to remind you that in Chinese astrology, the tiger is a dynamic and powerful sign. Two tigers will be celebrating significant milestones this year. In November of 2010, we will honor NAREIT, as we celebrate the 50th birthday of President Eisenhower's brain child, Real Estate Investment Trusts.
And on May 18th, 2010, HCP will ring the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, in recognition of its 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company. Earlier that day, HCP will conduct its first-ever Investor Day in lower Manhattan and we hope to see each of you there.
Happy Valentine's Day to you all and we will now take your questions. Shaynel?

I think on the last call, I indicated that the expected near term passage of health care reform, coupled with the reopening of the capital markets, had set in motion an unprecedented volume of strategic and capital market activity that will likely result in unprecedented health care deal volumes.
I think it's fair to say and it's still early days in the aftermath of the to-ings and fro-ings in Washington that obviously the health care reform catalyst is certainly, if not removed, been delayed and with the markets turning somewhat choppy for a variety of reasons, we're in a position, I think, that we're sensing that a lot of people are reevaluating how they want to do and when they want to do the transactions that they have got lined up and in the queue.
So, I think with that, I think we continue to see that this year will be and expect, will be a very active year for the space and for HCP. I think as I've handicapped our deal activity by the sub-sectors previously, in terms of most active to least active, I would probably put the Skilled Nursing space at the top of the likely to be most active sub-sector. I would probably put Life Sciences, towards the bottom of that list and then kind of aligning the other three spaces after skilled nursing in terms of most active - I would probably put senior housing and then Medical Office and then Hospital. So that's basically and that really hasn't changed in the last quarter or two in terms of the deals that we are reviewing and working, so I think there's really no change in terms of our perspective on that.

We just, we tend to like the portfolios that are heavily populated with higher credit tenant, sorts of opportunities and we like to have them be in the top three or four major markets. When you put the one set of criteria on top of the other set of criteria, there's not a real long list of opportunities to be reviewing.
And I think hospitals, again, consistent with what I have said previously, that increasingly that's a very complicated, lot more, certainly the most operating-intensive business of our five sectors, certainly the least real estate-intensive sector of our five sectors. So absent more of a debt investment, I think it would be unlikely for you to see us growing our hospital portfolio.

We have about $300 million of 2010 maturities, two thirds of that being unsecured, one third being secured, so we feel really good.
We have got a free and clear revolver, so, I think through to what is going to take place over the next year, probably sometime in the fourth quarter we officially launched looking at our revolver that doesn't expire until August of 2011. We're looking at taking out the unsecured that isn't due until September of 2010, possibly with additional unsecured debt. So we feel very comfortable with the leverage liquidity and maturities that we have in place, so no great concerns from that standpoint.
As I look at the overall leverage at 43%, I'm very comfortable. Not looking to lever up on any long-term basis, so if we were leaning in any direction, maybe slightly delever over time, but very comfortable at the 43% level.

I think from our standpoint, the TRSs, we always thought if you go back to 18 months, when it first became likely that the passage would be effective and then in fact did become effective last year, we always thought kind of the hype was a little overblown, but certainly, so we view it as another arrow in our quiver.
The classic example would be, if we could migrate some of our high-quality real estate that might be under managed and migrate that to a more efficient operator, particularly at the bottom of a cycle. Obviously, you could kind of have a two-fer in terms of upside, you would be getting normal cash flow growth and then if we were in the bottom of a cycle in one of our sub-sectors, you could kind of have that turbo charged with disequilibrium between supply and demand.
So, we think about that and we watch that, but the driver isn't to kind of have x amount of assets in our TRSs or take advantage of it. The driver is to buy good, quality real estate or make investments that may have a pathway to ownership of good, quality real estate and most importantly, create the majority of the value for HCP shareholders on the buy.
I think that's really, really important. In this business, you really got to make your money on the buy and if you think back where we have made our moves, it has largely been in choppy capital markets or markets that were very down and it's oftentimes been where we saw mispriced or inefficient pricing precedence for the sectors, most notably, our MedCap acquisition in '03.

That still could change. I suspect it probably will. I think that probably the driver there will be, prospects for the company, particularly, them hitting on maybe some new drugs or things like that.
With respect to Life Science more generally, the first part of your question, we just placed in service a couple of buildings and we have got some additional redevelopment that will be coming back on line probably 12 months out. I point out, Jerry, that in terms of the absolute level of that, it's very, very small relative to our overall Life Science portfolio, which really goes to what are the prospects for leasing?
As you can see from Paul's report, we continue to have a good success rate in terms of quarter leasing activity, there's not a lot of vacancy we have to start with. And I think we're probably in a mode here, where people are still trying to figure out what kind of economic environment they are going to be dealing with, but we certainly have more foot traffic through our available vacancies and we seem to be having more substantive discussion with those folks in terms of what their near-term business needs are and what their process would be to move forward and create some additional leases. Certainly, it's far better than what it was say, 12, 15 months ago.

Again, that comment would exclude the Sunrise component. And going forward, I think you have almost got to make a decision on what the economic environment is. As you know we have consistently been more on the bearish side. I probably shouldn't have listened to, but I did listen to this morning Mr. Roubini and Mr. Larian and they were increasing their probability of a double dip recession for the second half of this year.
So I think absent something like that, where things are just fine and they are going to slowly but steadily get better from year but, who knows. You have to make kind of a macroeconomic call in terms of economy, the prospects for real and sustainable job growth, which we obviously haven't seen yet and what if any of the impacts will be on the housing markets. I think those are really more the issues that will decide where we go from here as opposed to anything unique in our portfolio.

It's not all return. Recall, I think I put it towards the bottom was hospitals, just because our view on that is that's of our five subsectors, that's the least real estate intensive and the most operational intensive of our five sectors, which is - something that we don't think necessarily plays to our strengths. But clearly, what plays to our strengths is our ability to partner with either high-quality tenants or high-quality operators and kind of fill vacuums that are there in the markets.
So in an environment where things get quite frothy, as was the case most recently for an extended period of time in the first half of '07 and then most recently for a very short period of time December and early January, that probably reduces our competitive advantage. I think we're advantaged most when markets get a little choppy and people have got things to do and they have to get them done. And capital market execution that they had hoped for or had planned on might not be there.
So we just have a sense that those opportunities for 2010 are most likely to be in the skilled space and the Senior Housing space in that order and then moving down from that MOBs and then kind of hospitals and Life Science. So I think it's really more where we think we can - because it's so important in this investing, particularly in this subsector to create your value on the buy.
We just think that's going to be where our relative advantage is maximized. There is a lot of things that have to happen there, there's a lot of very large skilled nursing operate that are owned by private equity firms. I think in fact, of the five largest, I think four of them are private and private equity firms with the time horizons they have are going to be looking for exits. Some of those investments are two, three, four years on and it's time for some exits to occur there, so that is something that intrigues us.
And then Senior Housing, we love the current supply demand. I think it's fascinating to take a look at a sector that has got the underlying growth in the baby boomer that it's still today at high 80s sort of occupancy, with next to nothing in the way of new supply coming on. So I mean it's not just a return, it's really more kind of projecting out where we think there could be some opportunities to really make investments that have been - consistent with the way we have made, MedCap, CNL, Slough and Manor Care.

So we feel that we've - but we're very pleased with what we have done in terms of managing our Medicaid exposure, which becomes very important when you take a look at the deficits that are ripping through the various states right now.
So I think that's one thing we take a look at. If you think back about the strategic decision we made to divest down to a very modest exposure in this space, a lot of that was driven by the fact that we had all of these one off operators that, again, didn't play to our strengths, I think you heard me refer to the Costco, SKU concept as opposed to the Albertson's or things like that.
So there are a lot of different things that go in to that calculus, but in general nursing home bed, you well know are steadily going away. It's kind of the different, it's the same supply demand dynamic that you see in Senior Housing but it's occurring for different reasons. And the more efficient operators of the higher quality real estate that have a quality mix that's much more of a post acute discharge sort of setting in our view are most attractive to us.

I would just say they are very slow moving, unlike the - for profits. But I thought it was interesting that within days of the health care reform doing whatever it did, being delayed or postponed or eliminated. You saw HCA move very quickly and reduce the equity holder's investment in that company by a substantial amount via a dividend, as opposed to an IPO.
So I think that's a good example of I think people, they have got a lot of plans, they're looking at a lot of different opportunities. They are going to play the cards that are dealt to them and I think on the last call, at that time, I think everybody felt that the passage of the health care reform legislation was certainly likely and in fact eminent. And I think that's no longer the case, so people are reevaluating the cards that they are holding and trying to sort that out.
I think what you have indicated is entirely plausible, that some of these for profit or nonprofits may now be more motivated to part with MOB assets, which from our standpoint would be great. But again that's going to take a little bit of time to manifest itself in actual decisions.

When we acquired CNL, obviously there was a lot of duplication there and I think we went about that in a very deliberate way. We were able to, a very pleasant surprise take a substantial amount of costs out of the Slough platform. In fact, we had assumed, in terms of the recommendation we made to our board that we'd actually have a negative synergy there to build that platform out. And in fact, there was a substantial recovery on an annual going-forward run rate basis with costs.
And I think - Sorry, we've continue to focused that, we obviously had the benefit of Mr. Herzog joining us in the middle part of last year and he has taken the efficiency of his department, which is substantial, through a variety of new initiatives. And we have taken some additional costs out there. And I think quite frankly migrating - 2009 was the first year that we experienced a complete year with our new organizational structure with the line of business, that I think, Rob, when you had a number of your investor clients out last September, you had a chance to visit directly with the three line of business heads and there was just some additional synergies that came out of that.
So I don't think there's a lot more low hanging fruit. I think we have got all of that, but I think it's fair to say, we have consistently become more efficient and mindful on the cost side.

We ended up with, if you can believe this, 19 different property managers. We don't have that function internally, we outsource it, so Tom Klaritch and his team in Nashville, to their credit, have slowly but surely been consolidating that 19.
I think we're down to about seven now, three of which we have where the property managers at the time we made the acquisitions, so we are contractually obligated to those for some additional period of time, one of which rolls off at the end of this year. But I think the big driver there has been some of the costs we have been able to take out of just a very significant amount of consolidation and I think we have also made some good progress on energy.

But then going forward I don't think - I mean those numbers we have got in there for the positive same-store growth for 2010, I don't think there's any significant initiative, it just - It's going to be more a modest occupancy gain and slight revenue gain driving 2010.

I would say if I had to handicap things, I think the driver as to why I might point the likely exit towards one of those ends versus the other is probably most important thing well, I guess the most important thing would be, the variability in the company's performance but if we were to assume that this awesome operating platform continues to hum along, I think you can kind of take that out of the equation.
So I quite frankly think the biggest driver is what is going on in the capital markets at a given point in time and I would say that the frothier the capital markets are in terms of credit availability and access to the capital markets and valuations for property stocks, I would say that would tilt me to handicap a likely execution as being a part payoff and to the extent that markets got choppier from here and/or there was some sort of change in the reimbursement that might point me more towards some exit involving ownership of the real estate.

First, our first quarter results and investment activities; second, our balance sheet and financing activities and third, our full year 2010 guidance, which remains unchanged. Let me start with our f",532,"Thanks, Jay. There are three topics I will cover today. First, our first quarter results and investment activities; second, our balance sheet and financing activities and third, our full year 2010 guidance, which remains unchanged. Let me start with our first quarter results and investment activities. We reported FFO of $0.50 per share for the first quarter before $12 million or $0.04 per share of an impairment recovery. We have several highlights for the quarter, which include the following; first, our same property performance generated a strong 3.7% cash NOI growth during the quarter versus the first quarter of 2009.
Paul will review our performance by segment in a few minutes. Second, we placed into service three Life Science assets located in South San Francisco, representing 329,000 square feet and an investment to date of $245 million. Third, largely as a result of an acceleration with our Sunrise litigation activity, which Jay will elaborate on in his remarks, we incurred higher than anticipated litigation expense during the quarter and expect higher full year 2010 litigation costs. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year G&A forecast by $7 million.
Fourth, we recognized a $12 million partial recovery of impairment charges recorded in 2009 in connection with the bankruptcy of Erickson Retirement Communities. During the first quarter, we reached a settlement with the debtor and the other creditors, resulting in this recovery. Lastly, we made investments of $36 million through the acquisition of a senior housing facility for $9 million in February and funding of $27 million for construction and other capital projects primarily in our Life Science segment.
Turning now to our balance sheet and financing activities. In March, we prepaid a $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in August 2011. We funded the pre-payment primarily with our revolver. We continue to have strong credit metrics with our financial leverage at 43.5% and fixed charge coverage at 2.6 times. We are comfortably within all covenants of our credit agreements.
Our 2010 debt maturities of $300 million remain modest with $200 million of senior unsecured notes due in September and $100 million of mortgage debt maturing primarily in the second half of 2010. We ended the quarter with around $220 million of marketable securities and unrestricted cash and $1.2 billion available on our revolver.
Finally, full year 2010 guidance. Our guidance remains unchanged and we continue to expect FFO to range from $2.11 to $2.17 per share before the impairment recovery. We are increasing our G&A guidance from $70 million to $77 million, due to higher litigation costs. This increase of approximately $0.02 per share is expected to be offset by $0.01 from higher NOI and $0.01 from lower net financing costs, resulting from the prepayment of our term loan.
We are increasing our full year projected cash same property performance growth to a range of 3% to 4% versus previous guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, due to a $4 million deferred rent payment received in April from a Life Science tenant. This will have no impact on FFO because we recognize rent from this tenant on a straight line basis. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul?

277966,100193247,57959,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Let me break down the 2010 first quarter performance of our portfolio. Senior housing. Occupancy for the current quarter in our same store senior housing platform is 85%, representing a 50 basis point sequential decline over the prior quar",1381,"Thank you, Tom. Let me break down the 2010 first quarter performance of our portfolio. Senior housing. Occupancy for the current quarter in our same store senior housing platform is 85%, representing a 50 basis point sequential decline over the prior quarter and a 270 basis point decline over the prior year.
Current quarter occupancy declines were driven by the anticipated drop in occupancy in our recently transitioned 15 property Sunrise portfolio and the continued softening in our Sunrise non-mansion portfolio. Rate increases, higher ancillary revenue and margin improvement led to an increase in sequential same property cash flow coverage for 1.13 times to 1.15 times.
Current quarter same property cash NOI for the entire senior housing platform was 10.4%. While our Sunrise portfolio generated 26.1%, current quarter same property increase, virtually all of the increase was attributable to, one, rents payable but withheld by Sunrise in the first and fourth quarters of 2009, that were collected in subsequent quarters, and two, the April 2009 expiration of 25% of the LIBOR based rents and subsequent conversion to fixed rents. Net of this, Sunrise same property cash NOI growth was up 0.9%.
This compares with the improvement in our non-Sunrise portfolio of 5.7%, which was driven by normal rent steps and fixed rent increases from two former Sunrise portfolios that we've transitioned to replacement operators. Our overall senior housing same property performance net of the Sunrise adjustments is 4.6%.
On April 15th, the U.S. bankruptcy court confirmed Erickson Retirement Communities plan of reorganization, which includes the sale of the company to Redwood Capital. Under a settlement agreement reached with Erickson and the other creditors, HCP will recover $12 million of the impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2009. Subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, the sale is expected to close this Friday, April 30th.
Hospitals. Same property cash flow coverage increased 12 basis points to 4.88 times. Same property cash NOI for the first quarter declined 3%. We anticipate same property cash NOI to turn positive in the second quarter as the operator of our Plano [ph] rehab hospital progresses with its turnaround strategy including the successful completion of a physician’s syndication.
Our hospital portfolio remains on track to deliver same property annual cash NOI growth of approximately 9% to 10% in 2010. During the quarter, we also reached a non-binding agreement with Cirrus Health for the restructure of its $80 million loan maturing December 31st, 2010.
The agreement is consistent with the terms used in determining a $4 million impairment that we took in the last quarter. Closing of the restructure is subject to final documentation and receipt of an updated appraisal of the pledged collateral. And the borrower has made interest payments consistent with the restructured terms since the first of the year.
Subsequent to quarter end on April 1st, 2010, HCP sold North Shore Regional Medical Center, formerly operated by tenant for $17.9 million to Ochsner Health System, realizing a small gain. HCP provided 85% seller financing for the real estate and an $8 million loan to purchase the equipment from tenant.  
The five year financing is guaranteed by Ochsner. Ochsner Health System is the largest health care system in southeast Louisiana, owning and operating eight hospitals and over 38 health centers. The system is rated BAA1 by Moody’s and BBB plus by Fitch.
Skilled nursing. Our owned skilled nursing portfolio continues to perform well. Cash NOI for the first quarter in our same store portfolio increased by 3.9%, driven by contractual rent increases and fair market value rent resets on a master lease portfolio. Cash flow coverage remains solid at 1.54 times.
HCR Manor Care reported improved fourth quarter trailing 12 month debt service coverage for the entire debt stack to 4.42 times, an increase of 74 basis points over the prior quarter. This performance reflects an increase in total Medicare and managed care days, a strong year-over-year increase in Medicare and managed care rates and solid cost controls.
Medical office buildings. Same property adjusted NOI for the quarter was up 0.7% over the first quarter 2009. Growth was impacted by several large one-time positive adjustments in the year-ago quarter related to operating support revenue, tenant recoveries and expenses.
Absent these, NOI growth would be 2% for the quarter. Our expense reduction initiatives and ongoing impact of renegotiated natural gas contracts in Texas continue to provide positive results. Our quarterly controllable operating expenses declined $400,000 for the quarter, when compared to 2009.
HCP's active asset management platform includes several green initiatives, many of which have a positive economic benefit to HCP. In addition to being awarded NAREIT's leader in the light silver award in the fourth quarter of 2009, 12 of our buildings recently received the Energy Star designation.
This represents 25% of the 47 medical office buildings nationwide that have been awarded the Energy Star certification. We anticipate the certification of an additional nine buildings in 2010. HCP has been an Energy Star partner for five years. Through that period, we have benchmarked 319 of our properties in Energy Star's portfolio manager system, allowing us to identify outliers and reduce costs.
Our MOV portfolio occupancy has continued to outperform national trends. National vacancy rates according to Marcus and (inaudible) Costar have increased from 9.6% in June of 2007, to 12% in September of 2009. HCP's vacancy compares favorably, going from 9% to just 9.3% during that same time period.
Occupancy for the first quarter was flat sequentially, at 90.7%. During the first quarter, tenants representing 397,000 square feet took occupancy, of which 332,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Our retention rate was 79%.
Renewals for the quarter occurred at 1.1% higher mark-to-market rents and included four leases representing 24,000 square feet that were previously above market. Absent these above market leases, the mark-to-market rent increase was 2%. Our pipeline remains strong with 452,000 square feet of executed leases that have yet to commence and 850,000 square feet in active negotiation.
Life Science. The first quarter same store adjusted NOI for Life Science was up 0.1% over first quarter 2009 levels. Increases from contractual rent steps and the recognition of revenue on buildings with completed tenant improvements were offset by increased vacancy, two large blend and extend leases completed last year and one time recoveries in the first quarter of 2009.
HCP's operating portfolio consisted - increased by 329,000 as three development assets were added to the portfolio. Two of these properties were 100% leased to Amgen. As a result of adding new space from the third unoccupied building to the portfolio, occupancy for the entire Life Science portfolio fell 1% to 88.8%.
For the quarter, we completed 162,000 square feet of leasing, all of which is related to previously occupied space that was re-leased at an average rent decrease of 21% and resulted in a retention rate of 83%. The decrease was driven by the renewal and expansion of a pure office tenant in the Bay area.
Our Life Science leasing exposure for the remainder of 2010 remains small at only 230,000 square feet and represents only 0.5% of HCP's annualized revenue. Looking to 2011, we have 425,000 square feet of remaining expirations which represent only 1.5% of HCP's annualized revenue.
HCP continues to pursue a pipeline of leasing prospects in excess of 650,000 square feet for existing space. Tenant demand for space has increased over prior year levels and we continue to monitor large institutional clients who have begun to seek space to accommodate expansion needs or relocate functions. HCP's remaining Life Science development pipeline now consists of just three redevelopment projects totaling 252,000 square feet, with projected funding requirements of $47 million.
Finally, the biotech industry financing environment remains strong, attracting over $9 billion of capital in the first quarter of 2010. HCP's tenants also continue to successfully raise capital as evidenced by our 147,000 square foot tenant, Rigel's recent announcement of its $1.2 billion partnership for its arthritis drug with AstraZeneca.
In addition the liquidity profile of our tenants remain strong with the Life Science companies in our portfolio with less than 12 months of cash representing less than 1% of HCP's annualized revenue. With that review of HCP's portfolio, I'd like to turn it back over to Jay.

Clearly, the key take-away for our first quarter is the continued outstanding performance of HCP's real estate and debt investments. Tom has indicated to you, the increased guidance that we have for same property performance expectations of our real estate portfolio in 2010.
Our debt portfolio has also improved during the first quarter, even from its outstanding results of last year. Of greater significance are the increased levels of tenant inquiry, foot traffic and leasing pipelines in our Life Science and medical office building sectors.
Through the recession, we have benefited from the defensive nature of HCP's portfolio, while continuing to create value from its attractive growth characteristics. Stepping back from property level trends, dialogue around portfolio and entity level opportunities is also quite active.
You may recall that we anticipated this increase in activity on our third quarter earnings call of last November, assuming healthcare reform was enacted between Thanksgiving and Christmas. While the January Massachusetts miracle and the subsequent political machinations in Washington, D.C. delayed final passage of health care legislation until just last month, our fundamental thesis that this bill and the continued unfreezing of the capital markets will be catalysts for substantial deal activity involving healthcare real estate remains in place.
Let me provide an update on our dispute with Sunrise. The Sunrise litigation is proceeding in two courts, The Delaware Chancery Court and the Federal District Court in Virginia. In both cases, HCP is seeking judicious confirmation that Sunrise has materially breached the management agreements and that HCP, therefore, may terminate the contracts and collect damages from Sunrise.
The Delaware trial has not yet been set, but we expect it to be accelerated from early next year into later this year. The Virginia case is on a much faster schedule, with discovery now completed and a judge trial set to begin five weeks from today on June 1st, 2010. We expect a decision by August. The Virginia case concerns a four property portfolio that two weeks ago on April 13th, Sunrise was notified that it had failed to meet the minimum return threshold requirements for two consecutive years. This failure was driven largely by the January 2008 revocation of Sunrise's Medicare certification for the skilled nursing beds that at one of the facilities and Sunrise's inability to backfill the resulting loss of Medicare residents with private pay residents.
To date, Sunrise has not been able to achieve Medicare recertification at this facility. The facility's occupancy is currently 58%. Sunrise has the right to cure this termination by paying the economic shortfall between actual property performance and the contractual performance threshold. If Sunrise does cure the termination, HCP will seek a declaration that the management agreements can be terminated and for damages. If Sunrise allows the contracts to terminate, then HCP will continue to seek damages for breach of the management agreements.
Last week, HCP's board of directors elected J. Alberto Gonzalez-Pita as Executive Vice President, General Counsel. Al has excelled in the General Counsel function with several large cap organizations and is especially well-practiced in the areas of mergers and acquisitions. We are delighted to welcome Al to HCP and look forward to working with him in what promises to be an exciting period ahead for our company.
I want to acknowledge publicly the outstanding effort by Executive Vice President, Tom Klaritch and Vice President Mike McKee in positioning us as the leader for sustainability issues in the medical office building sector. For those of you that have not done so, please review HCP's new Annual Report for a summary of the recognition that our company has achieved on this important topic.
Finally, we look forward to visiting with many of you and HCP's first ever Investor Day in three weeks on May 18th in Lower Manhattan. We would now be pleased to take your questions. In so doing, please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Cheynelle?

I think the - you referenced last year as being a somewhat slower year. Obviously had the first half of the year, the capital markets were probably a partial cause of that. But as you got into the second half of the year and you started to see some improvement in the capital markets, you still had this at least for healthcare real estate transactions, you had the specter of this healthcare legislation that did not have certainty around it. And we made the comments back in November that when and if that certainty were to be - that uncertainty were to be removed and you actually had a bill that was passed, in our view you would see that be a real catalyst. That obviously got delayed from the kind of Thanksgiving to Christmas sort of time frame. It's now behind us.
I think people have spent a fair amount of time reading and more importantly understanding not just the impact on their business, but the timing of the impact on their businesses. And given that a substantial amount of the organizations, the healthcare operator organizations that are involved with this are either exclusively or largely owned by private equity firms who by definition look to exits over a three to five year sort of time frame. Where I think you're just about at the front end of that window, so you've got a couple things coming together. You've got certainty over healthcare reform. You've got capital markets stabilized. And you've got the concentration of ownership of a lot of these platforms with the private equity terms. You put all that together and I expect the second half of this year to be quite active.

We look at I think the environment and the environment right now is I think getting quite interesting. Part of this relates to the answer I had to the previous to Adam's question. But clearly with the uncertainty over healthcare legislation behind us, clearly with more liquid, albeit even capital markets and clearly with a number of the private equity owned healthcare operations looking to monetize some or all of their investment, those were facts that are just kind of - they're pretty straightforward. So you obviously can't predict what if anything is going to happen.
With respect to where we sit, our balance sheet has never been stronger than it is on this very day, today. We've never been more liquid. And I think perhaps more importantly, we've got existing relationships across the five sectors of our portfolio with leading players that are apt to become involved in this transaction flow. I think if you go back for the last year and-a-half or so, gotten the question kind of repeatedly, what do you see as the impact of healthcare reform. And I think rather consistently I've said that the winners putting aside individual sectors or subsectors, the winners will have three criteria. They'll have critical mass and you should interpret that to mean market share, doesn't have to be national but clearly regional or local. They'll have to be efficient and you should interpret that to be appropriate margins. And they'll have quality outcomes.
And I think those will be - I think a good analogy to think about here with what's likely to happen is if you're to go back and look at what happened at the - in the kind of ‘88, ‘89 sort of timeframe after President Regan had prevailed in the Cold War, Berlin Wall came down, there was a substantial - what was described as being a Peace Dividend which was a material slowing of defense expenditures. That slowing of defense expenditures set in motion an unprecedented several year time frame of consolidation. I think that's very relevant for people to understand what happened there and I think it's directly applicable to what could happen over the next couple of years with respect to the healthcare sector.

We had a working capital funding with one of our hospitals that we incurred in the first quarter, so that was like a $1.5 million dollars, don't expect that to recur in the second quarter.
You mentioned the litigation expense being abnormally high in the first quarter due to the acceleration of litigation. And then we also had in connection with that term loan payoff that I had mentioned, that is accretive for about $3 million for the year based on the differential between the interest rate on the term loan and our revolver. That also came with a $1.3 million first quarter write-off of the unamortized debt fees. So all those things come - take all those into account when you look at the $0.50.

So I think that's how I would answer the second of your two questions, Jay.
With respect to the first one, which I guess goes to our - I mean, our capacity's obviously quite substantial. As we sit here today we're somewhere around a $16 billion market cap company with substantial immediate liquidity in the form of our cash balances, marketable security balances and available on the line, but also at this point we really have all of our markets open to us unsecured debt, secured debt, the equity markets and the potential for some further joint ventures. So that's nice. I guess we don't look at - we don't do big deals or small deals for that matter, do big deals or small deals, we do whatever the deal size is because they're good deals. You need to create in this business in our view the majority of the value creation's got to be created on the buy.
So I think our track record speaks to that, where we moved in, we moved into situations where there wasn't a lot of competition and/or we had some unique dynamic at work that tilted the playing field our way.

There have been instances where because of some strategic opportunities, we moved above our internal and publicly stated guidelines but we committed to the various constituencies, the unsecured - our unsecured debt holders, our commercial banking group and our rating agencies that we would move those back down on a very specific timeframe and in all three instances after CNL, after Slough, after ManorCare, not only did we exceed the ratios that we committed to achieve, but we also exceeded those ratios, i.e. , did better in a shorter period of time than we had previously communicated. So I think we have a fair amount of credibility when it comes to that.
In terms of - I would tell you that in terms of our balance sheet management, I would say in the last year or so, we probably moved our kind of intermediate to longer term balance sheet guidelines from one of 50/50 debt to equity which is historically where the company has been, to a target today of more - closer to say, 40/60, 40 parts debt, 60% equity so I think that's evolved over the last 12 months.

One of the - it's interesting, perhaps the more significant impacts from healthcare legislation, not to be confused with healthcare reform legislation, is the likely increase on the part of physician, physician groups becoming actual employees of the hospitals and once that happens, a couple things are going to occur. They'll probably gravitate towards the better hospitals and they'll become employees. One of the things that that's going to do is particularly as some of these hospital systems, both the larger for profit and the larger nonprofit use this as a strategic weapon by turning these people into employees and we all know the rational from the doctors who have seen their income potential decline materially from their expectation when they started medical school. And which is also reflected in the fact that you've got medical school graduation numbers and applicants plunging nationwide.
In any event, this phenomenon where you're going to have more of these physicians not unaffiliated or more of an entrepreneur situation and gravitate towards being employees of hospitals, that is likely to provide some upward lift in terms of the demand for the MOBs and it's also likely to provide some additional upward lift with respect to the credit quality of the MOB tenancy, i.e., rather than have small, one-off physician groups. The majority of which are quite good at keeping the rents current, by the way, they'll actually become employees of nonprofit or for profit health systems that have significant either investment grade or significant credit ratings. I think those are all - those are some other dynamics that are out there that we anticipate our medical office building platform benefiting from.

One is - and just to correct the record here, we have been prolific sellers of Medicaid skilled nursing exposure, so really it's apples and oranges to say that we sold a lot of Medicaid skilled nursing, which we did, at the same time we were adding HCR Manor Care skilled nursing because those are really two very different businesses. And on the previous calls we pointed out the differential in terms of the length of stay in those two subsectors and the difference in the source of the revenues, particularly the Medicaid exposure. It's really - it's really a different business, in our view. Just want to make sure that that stands on its own.
I think with respect to the other changed, I mean, you're only going to have deal volume when you've got willing sellers and willing buyers and I think one of the things that's changed in the skilled sector, I mean, if you take a look at the five or six largest either for profit - well, take a look at like the first, the top half dozen in terms of size for profit operators to skilled nursing, I think five of them, Rich, are controlled either majority controlled or 100% controlled by private equity terms firms now who obviously exist with a business model that is to make leveraged acquisitions and then take exits, be it in the form of complete sales of those investments or the subsequent going public.
You've got a somewhat similar - not as dramatic as you have in skilled nursing but you've got a somewhat similar dynamic going on in hospitals. I think the fact that you've got a lot of this ownership concentrated with groups that by definition are going to look to be taking either complete or partial exits, I think that is a change.

That is probably a component of why we've seen our leasing - our prospective leasing pipeline MOBs for example, move up a reasonable amount, just the uncertainty has been resolved.
So I think beyond that in terms of lease rates, I think that's a function of the local markets and as you know, the vast majority of all of our medical office building real estate is located on campus of number one and number two market shares. So that's - that really becomes more of a local market dynamic and is not heavily impacted by the healthcare legislation with the exception of the comment I made I think a couple questions ago that may well be over the next year or two you see a greater percentage of the tenancy that we have in our medical office building portfolios be directly aligned as employees with some of these large hospital systems, which we would take to be a good thing. So that's medical office.
If you move to skilled, there those are - our own skilled portfolio which is only about 2% of our overall portfolio, are at this point all - it's kind of four separate portfolios. So they're all unencumbered by any debt obligations and they're all master leased. And I think Paul took you through the coverage's there. They're 1.55 or 1.56, I forget which. So we certainly have done some kind of scenarios where we anticipated cataclysmic sort of reimbursement cuts there and given the fact that we're starting with 1.55 or 1.56 coverage ratios after recognition of the management fee. We've got an enormous amount of room there and I further add that again, they're master leased.
So I don't expect much in the way of an issue there, which then leaves us with the hospital sector and in the hospital sector we really reduced our exposure there. In fact, a substantial portion of our hospital sector is really in the form of some debt investments. So if you pull the debt investments away and take a look at the owned hospital real estate, there I'd take you to the coverage's in the aggregate of - I think they're 4.88 times, which those are - I'd be surprised if there are coverage ratios out there for the hospital, acute care hospital sector not LPAC, be very clear to differentiate between acute care hospitals and LPACs.
But with respect to the acute care hospital sector to have coverage ratios anywhere near those metrics. So I think again that the good news, if I take a look at the other side of the coin, I think those - I said this before that hospital portfolio, while it's very solid and covers at these unprecedented sort of coverage ratios is probably going forward more bond like in its potential to create incremental shareholder value for our shareholders as opposed to some of the exposures we have in our other sectors.

We look at everything. I think if you go back - you're familiar with our five-by-five model, I think it's instructive to think about our five-by-five model not just as being static at one point in time, but being a potential source of deal pipeline in and of itself and I'll point out two transactions that I think are relevant here. If you recall, when we made the first - so we've got our five-by-five model, the five columns or the sectors, the five rows of the products.
If you go back and look at when we made our first meaningful mezzanine loan investment it was at the end of '02 in a company called American Retirement Corp. the predecessor company to Brookdale. I think it's very instructive to a look at that transaction and note that over the course of the next couple years after we made that investment, driven largely by the amazing improvement in the profitability of that company. We voluntarily converted that mezzanine loan position into an equity ownership position, which today is a gorgeous portfolio of sale leaseback investments in some very high quality senior housing assets with very substantial coverage.
I think if you go and look at another row in our five-by-five model, you'll recall that when we first acquired the wonderful medical office building portfolio from HCA, the MedCap Division, their medical office building division. We unusually put that in a joint venture, Karin and over the course of a couple years, the investment criteria of that joint venture partner changed to the point where approximately three years later. We did something similar to what I just took you through on mezzanine loan investment. We converted that to 100% owned portfolio.
So we look at the five-by-five model principally as a way to source - to play in a bigger sand box. Our view is that with more opportunities, we are to be able to make better investment decisions as opposed to being just kind of a one trick pony, if you will. But I think what's more subtle behind the scenes, I think we've got a track record which I've just shared with you, is that we can sometimes move investments within that five-by-five model to a higher and better use for HCP shareholders. So that's probably a more indirect way of answering the question that you just asked.

If in fact, mezz loan income went away, it would go away presumably with the repayment in full of the obligations that are generating the income, which if you add all those obligations up. That's a very substantial amount of proceeds.

There are three topics that I will cover today; first, our second quarter results and investment activities; second, our recent equity offering and financing activities; and third, our full year 2010 guidance.Let me start with our second",504,"Thank you, Jay. There are three topics that I will cover today; first, our second quarter results and investment activities; second, our recent equity offering and financing activities; and third, our full year 2010 guidance.
Let me start with our second quarter results and investment activities. For the second quarter we reported FFO of $0.55 per share compared to $0.57 per share before impairments for the second quarter of 2009. Note that the prior period included a $0.02 favorable one-time adjustment related to the cost allocation of certain assets acquired in 2006.
We have several highlights for the quarter. First, we generated strong second quarter year-over-year cash same property performance of 5.9% which included a $4 million deferred rent payment received in April 2000 from a life science tenant. The receipt of this payment did not impact FFO. Paul will review for performance by segment in a few minutes.
Second, we made investments of $136 million during the quarter and an additional $48 million in July. On June 1, we acquired four senior housing facilities for $102 million. These facilities are master leased to Emeritus Corporation for an initial term of 10 years with two 10-year renewal options. On July 26, we acquired a life science asset and two medical office buildings for $48 million, which included DownREIT units valued at $9 million and assumed debt of $5 million.
Lastly, we funded $34 million for construction and other capital projects during the second quarter, primarily related to our life science segment.
Turning now to our recent equity offering and financing activities. We completed an equity offering of 15.5 million shares at a price of $33 per share generating gross proceeds of $512 million.
The offering included 12 million shares originally announced, which due to strong investor demand was upsized to 13.5 million shares that were issued in June. And an additional 2 million shares issued in July resulting from an exercise of the underwriters over allotment option.
Net proceeds totaled $492 million, which were used to repay all borrowings under our revolver. Prepay mortgage debt and fund acquisitions with the remainder held in cash to be used for generate corporate purposes. As a result of the offering our financial leverage was reduced from 43.5% at the end of the first quarter to 40.9% at the end of the second quarter.
Our remaining 2010, unsecured debt maturities totaled $206 million with an average interest rate of 5.17%. Our remaining 2010, mortgage debt maturities and amortization totaled $20 million. We ended the quarter with $270 million of marketable securities and unrestricted cash and $1.4 billion available on our revolver.
Lastly, full year 2010 guidance; we continue to expect our 2010 FFO to range from $2.10 per share to $2.16 per share before impairment recoveries which is unchanged from our previous guidance that we provided in connection with our June equity offering. Additionally, our projected full year cash same property performance growth remains at 3% to 4%.
I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul?

Senior Housing; occupancy for the current quarter in our same store senior housing platform is 84.9%, representing a 10 basis points sequential decline over the prior quar",1127,"Thanks, Tom. Let me breakdown the 2010 second quarter performance of our portfolio. Senior Housing; occupancy for the current quarter in our same store senior housing platform is 84.9%, representing a 10 basis points sequential decline over the prior quarter and 180 basis point decline over the prior year.
Tower non-Sunrise same portfolio occupancy increased 10 basis points to 84.8% over the prior quarter, while our Sunrise same store portfolio declined 70 basis points to 85.1%. Sunrise’s average monthly revenue per occupied room was up 4.5% over the same period prior year.
Facility margins across the entire senior housing portfolio held steady, and cash flow coverage was stable at 1.15 times.
Current quarter year-over-year same property cash NOI growth for the entire senior housing platform was 4.9%. Our non-Sunrise portfolio increased by 9.8% driven in part by normal rent steps and the 25 Sunrise assets transitioned to new operators.
On June 1, HCP acquired in an off-market transaction four senior housing assets formally managed by Sunrise Senior Living. The purchase price was a $102 million. The properties were unencumbered by management contracts or secured debt.
HCP entered into a 10-year lease with two 10-year renewal options with Emeritus at an initial lease yield of 8.3%. Fixed rent steps for the first five years provide HCP with a compounded annual growth rate of 5.7%.
Hospitals; same property cash flow coverage increased 5% basis points to 4.93 times. Year-over-year same property cash NOI for the second quarter increased 14% as Hoag began paying full rent in June. Hoag’s $84 million renovation of our asset is nearing completion and the state-of-the-art Orange County Facility is expected to reopen in September.
In addition, at Medical City Dallas, HCA completed a $212 million investment in our asset with the delivery of new its children’s tower and a renovation of the remainder of their space. The new 109,000 square foot tower adds 61 pediatric beds to the hospitals existing 129 beds.
HCP will receive minimum base rent on the new tower and will participate in revenue generated by the new children’s tower without any incremental investment from HCP.
Skilled nursing. Our owned skill nursing portfolio continues to perform well. Year-over-year cash NOI for the second quarter in our same-store portfolio increased 1.2%, with cash flow coverage declining by 5 basis points with coverage remaining strong at 1.49 times.
HCR ManorCare reported improved first quarter trailing 12-month debt service coverage for the entire debt stack of 4.5 times, an increase of 8 basis points over the prior quarter. This performance reflects the slower revenue growth over prior periods as a result of Medicare’s 1.1% rate decrease last October, which was more than offset by strong cost controls. A 1.7% Medicare rate increase for skilled nursing facilities will become effective October 2010.
HCR ManorCare’s PropCo debt stack is scheduled to mature in 17 months, although our performance-based one-year extension is expected to push the ultimate maturing out 2.5 years from now.
Medical office buildings. Same property cash NOI for the second quarter was up 2.4% over the same period 2009. The growth was due to normal rent steps, tenant recoveries and improvement in parking revenues on our Seattle and Houston campuses. Quarterly same-store operating expenses were up $356,000 or 1.2% when compared to 2009 due to unusually high temperatures in several of our markets.
Our MOB occupancy for the second quarter increased slightly to 90.8%. During the second quarter, tenants representing 1.031 million square feet million took occupancy of which 900,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Our year-to-date retention rate was 86.4%.
Renewal through the quarter occurred at 5.9% higher mark-to-market rents and included 300,000 square feet of HCA-affiliated hospital space that are renewed for 10 years. Our pipeline remains strong with 515,000 square feet of executed leases that have yet to commence and 620,000 square feet in active negotiations.
On July 26, HCP acquired through a DownREIT two MOBs in an off-market transaction. The purchase price was $19 million at a cap rate of 8.8%. The acquisition adds to our existing campuses, a Southwest General Hospital in San Antonio and Lake View Hospital in Bountiful, Utah.
Last quarter we discussed our sector leading green initiatives and our five-year partnership with EPA’s ENERGY STAR Program. In May, a representative from the EPA joined us at our Annual HCP Third-Party Managers Meeting in Las Vegas, attended by 200 property managers of our MOB and life science assets, to present us with four additional ENERGY STAR awards for a total of 14 ENERGY STAR assets.
Life science. The second quarter same-store cash NOI for life science was up 8.5% over same period in 2009. The increase in same-store performance was primarily driven by the early repayment of previously deferred rent and contractual rent steps. Absent the deferred rent payment, current quarter same-store growth would be flat. Occupancy for the entire life science portfolio remains stable at 88.7% at the end of the second quarter.
For the quarter, we completed 94,000 square feet of leasing and year-to-date we’ve completed 256,000 square feet of leasing that has resulted in a retention rate of 76%. In addition, we’ve completed an additional 87,000 square feet of leasing that will commence in subsequent quarters. Our life science leasing exposure for the remainder of 2010 remains quite small at only 194,000 square feet and represents 0.5% of HCP’s annualized revenue.
Looking to 2011, we have 385,000 square feet of remaining expirations, which represent 1.3% of HCP’s annualized revenue. HCP is actively negotiating nearly 100,000 square feet of leases, and our leasing pipeline is tracking tenant demand exceeding 700,000 square feet in our markets. HCP’s life science development pipeline continues to consist of just three redevelopment projects totaling 252,000 square feet with projected remaining funding requirements of $37 million.
On July 26, HCP acquired a life science asset for a purchase price of $29 million at a cap rate of 8.5%. The property is located within our University of Utah, Life Science Cluster and is leased to an existing tenant, Myriad Genetics. Finally, the biotech industry financing environment remains strong with over $14 billion of capital activity in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $23 billion.
HCP’s tenants continue to attract capital, including Sequenom, which has raised $52 million in a private placement, and OncoMed’s announced partnership with Bayer HealthCare to develop anticancer stem cell therapies that included an upfront payment of $40 million and up to $388 million for each successfully developed therapy.
In addition, the liquidity profile of our tenants remains strong, with life science companies in our portfolio with less than 12 months of cash, representing approximately 0.5% of HCP’s annualized revenue. With that review of HCP’s portfolio I would like to turn it back to Jay.

HCP had a very strong quarter, headlined by a positive 5.9% same property cash performance. For the first half of 2010 our same property cash performance is now 4.8% versus guidance for the year at the midpoint of 3.5%.
These results were achieved across HCP’s real estate portfolio ranging from positive 1.2% in skilled nursing to positive 14% in hospitals. Not only was our portfolio performance broad based in its contribution to NOI growth, but equally important, each of our three lines of business closed on accretive off-market acquisitions in the most recent period.
At HCP’s May 18, Investor Day in New York City, many of you had your first opportunity to learn more of HCP’s unique combination of safety and growth directly from our line of business leadership.
The breadth and depth of these teams are evident in the attractive add-on portfolio acquisitions which as Paul mentioned include $102 million, 8.3% going in cash yield in senior housing, a $29 million, 8.5% going in cash yield in life science and a $19 million, 8.8% going in cash yield in medical office. The senior housing investment is expected to produce a 12% unlevered IRR. The medical office and life science investments are 97% occupied and are expected to generate an 11% unlevered IRR.
In addition to the strong results of our real estate portfolio, HCP’s debt investments are valued nicely above their investment cost and underlying businesses of HCA and HCR ManorCare continue to perform exceptionally well. HCP’s balance sheet is currently tracking at strong BBB credit metrics and we’ve accumulated almost $300 million in cash and marketable securities as of quarter end.
Before opening up the call to questions, I did want to update our audience to what we believe is noteworthy insight into our non-Sunrise senior housing metrics. From an asset management perspective, Executive Vice President, Susan Tate and her team constantly review and analyze data from each of our senior housing operators and then aggregate these results on a monthly basis to formulate a proprietary outlook.
The most recent quarter was the first quarter in almost 2.5 years since early 2008 that each of the key senior housing performance metrics that we monitor; occupancy, rate growth, operating margin and cash flow coverage, all turned green or positive. The performance was measured on trailing three months and was positive not only on a sequential quarter basis but on a year-over-year basis as well.
While one quarter does not make a trend and we continue to anticipate a challenging outlook for unemployment and residential housing in the United States. These results have moved our internal senior housing outlook from cautious to cautiously optimistic.
With that we are delighted to take your questions at this time. Chenille as you are ordering the questions, I did want to acknowledge David Banks and Doug Pasquale and the entire team at Nationwide Health Properties on the occasion today of their 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company.
As someone who was around at the time of that IPO, the company back then was known as Beverly Investment Properties. It’s very special for me to see such class acts as David Banks and Doug Pasquale do so well and have the opportunity this afternoon to enjoy the recognition for their accomplishments.
Chenille, we’ll take questions now.

It’s broad based. That outlier would be hospitals. We only saw one particular situation in the past quarter that we had dug into, and ultimately, elected not to pursue, but the other sectors, medical office, life science, skilled nursing, senior housing are all very, very active. I think our thesis of substantial second half 2010 activity remains in place. A lot of that’s going to be driven by the private equity firms that own a lot of these businesses, and I would imagine perhaps there could be some motivation for getting some things done by year-end owing to the potential for tax increases taking effect in 2011.

In fact, what we call the PC 70 [ph] of the four properties we closed down on June 1, which represent the third portfolio now that we’ve transitioned from Sunrise Senior Living to replacement operators, we haven’t added to our senior housing portfolio at all. So I think we’ve shared with you in past calls our view as to how favorable the supply, the demand, the demographics look there with the baby boomer continuing age and very, very little supply coming on this year and even less next year, and quite frankly, even less being financed given the constraint we have in this country today for construction financing. So that against the backdrop where occupancies are mid to mid high 80s, we just think that’s a terrific spot to be looking to put out our shareholders’ capital over the next couple of years.

You have got the normal rent growth and as James mentioned with the portfolios we have had at Sunrise, we’re going to get some outsized growth from those portfolios, as they have been transitioned.

It would be unusual for a transaction that is in one of our five property types, hospitals, skilled, private-pay senior housing, medical office or life science, to be in the market or to be contemplated without us looking at it. So I think that’s a general comment.
Separately, I think what I said at NAREIT I suspected that what you could see play out in that particular market, the Asian market, I think you could see what took basically two decades here in the states where you had initially hospital management companies and skilled nursing operators morph themselves into PropCo/OpCo structures and create very efficient markets, but very different markets for the management side of the business versus the real estate ownership side of the business.
You’ve seen a similar sort of movie play out in the hospitality space here in the states, and I think I believe what I said at NAREIT was that it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see what took two decades to unfold here in the healthcare space occur in a sooner period of time, let’s say, five years. There is obviously one bifurcation that exists down there today. My suspicion is that the transaction you referenced will eventually morph itself into a PropCo/OpCo structure and I think there will be other opportunities as well.

That’s where those money went to and obviously those stimulus dollars are now coming to an end.
It would appear as though there’s not unanimity in Washington, D.C. to continue to provide that. There may be some interest in providing stimulus. It’s fair to say, I think there’s certainly not unanimity in Washington to continue to have it be just kind of a funding operating deficit. So in that case, I think the outlook for Medicaid gets even bleaker. But it will be interesting to see what happens.
When you get to the election, there will be probably some messages sent, and then I think a very important perspective will probably come from that bipartisan debt panel that the President organized that I think is due to make its report on what to do about the three major entitlement programs of Security, Medicare and Medicaid, they are round about December 1.

There are several topics I will cover today; first, our third quarter results, second our investment and disposition transactions, third our financing activities and finally, our full year 2010 guidance.Let me start with our third quarter",705,"Thank you Jay. There are several topics I will cover today; first, our third quarter results, second our investment and disposition transactions, third our financing activities and finally, our full year 2010 guidance.
Let me start with our third quarter results. For the third quarter, we reported FFO of $0.54 per share before giving effect to an impairment charge of $0.23 per share compared to $0.52 per share before impairments and litigation provision for the third quarter of 2009.
There are several items I would like to point out. First, our same property portfolio continued to perform well, producing a strong 4.8% year over year, quarterly cash analogue growth. Paul will review our performance by segment in a few minutes.
Our third quarter results included the impact of two offsetting items that were not contemplated in our guidance. $0.02 per share related to gain on sales of HCA bonds and charge of $0.02 per share related to acquisition pursuit costs.
During the third quarter we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $72 million related to our 35% interest in HCP Ventures II an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 25 senior housing properties leased by Horizon Bay.
Turning now to our investment and disposition transactions, first, on August 31, we entered into agreements with Sunrise that allowed us to terminate management contracts on 27 of 75 senior housing communities. We transitioned these 27 communities to Emeritus effective yesterday.
In exchange, we paid Sunrise $50 million, which after certain closing and working capital adjustments resulted in $41 million that was capitalized and will be amortized as deferred leasing costs in accordance with GAAP. As part of this arrangement, HCP and Sunrise agreed to dismiss all litigation proceedings between them. Paul will describe the terms of the new Emeritus leases shortly.
Second, during September and October, we purchased a $278 million participation in Genesis Health Care’s senior loan at a discount for $250 million, and a $50 million participation in a Mezzanine note at a discount for $40 million.
Third, during the quarter, we made real estate acquisitions of $63 million and capital investments of $36 million for construction and other capital projects. Year to date, this brings us to $640 million in real estate and debt investments.
Turning to dispositions, in September, we sold $73 million of debt investments including $65 million of HCA bonds and recognized gains of $6 million. We also sold three skilled nursing facilities for $10 million and recognized a gain of $4 million.
Subsequent to quarter end, we sold our remaining bond investments in HCA and one other issuer for $102 million, resulting in fourth quarter gains of $8 million. We also sold nine senior housing facilities for $27 million and recognized a gain of $15 million.
Next, our financing activities, in September, we prepaid without penalties $68 million of 6% mortgage debt, which was scheduled to mature in February 2011. Also, we repaid $200 million of senior unsecured notes at 4 7/8 that matured in September.
We ended the quarter with $320 million drawn on our revolver and had $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver, cash and marketable securities.
Finally, full year 2010 guidance; based on stronger than forecasted performance to date, primarily in our senior housing and life science segments, we are raising our full year cash same property performance guidance to a range of 4% to 5%, up from 3% to 4% previously.
In addition, we are increasing our 2010 FFO guidance to a range of $2.18 to $2.24 per share before impairments and recoveries, which is $0.08 higher than our previous range of $2.10 to $2.16. This increase is driven by several items.
$0.02 from the increase in same property performance, $0.02 from accretive debt investments in Genesis, $0.03 from gains realized upon monetizing our HCA bond investments net of lost interest income, and $0.04 from a prepayment penalty related to the early payoff of a $34.5 million debt investment in our hospital segment that Paul will provide more color on shortly.
These increases were partially offset by reduced earnings from HCP Ventures II, acquisition pursuit costs that were not previously forecasted and several other small items.
I will now turn the call over to Paul.

Senior Housing; occupancy for the current quarter in our same store Senior Housing platform is 85.6%, representing a 30 basis point sequential increase over the prior quart",1492,"Thanks Tom. Let me break down the 2010 third quarter performance of our portfolio. Senior Housing; occupancy for the current quarter in our same store Senior Housing platform is 85.6%, representing a 30 basis point sequential increase over the prior quarter and a 60 basis point decline over the prior year. Facility margins across the entire Senior Housing portfolio are improving with cash flow coverage remaining t 1.6 times.
Current quarter, year over year same property cash NOI for the entire Senior Housing platform was 9.8% driven by rent steps and improved performance for 25 Sunrise assets transitioned to new operators in prior years.
During the quarter, HCP acquired another senior housing facility formerly managed by Sunrise for $14.75 million. HCP entered into a ten year lease with Emeritus with two ten year renewal options at an initial lease yield of 8.3% with 3.5% annual escalators over the initial term. In addition, subsequent to quarter end HCP entered into two master leases with Emeritus for 27 newly terminated Sunrise facilities. The leases have an initial term of 15 years with two 10-year extension options.
First year rent on the portfolio is $30.3 million, representing $1.5 million increase from current rents. Fixed rent steps over the first five years result in a compounded annual growth rate of 13.9%. After year five, rent escalates and the greater of CPI or 3%.
The unlevered IRR on the transaction including the $50 million termination fee paid to Sunrise and $9.5 million in CapEx, HCP has committed to fund is 42%. Also subsequent to quarter end, HCP sold a portfolio of nine senior housing facilities to the tenant Assisted Living Concepts for $27.5 million for a gain of $15 million. The sale represents a 7% cap rate.
Hospitals, same property cash flow coverage decreased 23 basis points to 4.7 times driven by expenses related to the opening of Medical City Dallas’s new children’s tower of last quarter. HCA began paying base rent on their new tower in June and will pay add rent on incremental revenue. Year-over-year same property cash NOI for the third quarter increased 16.9% and was driven by our new hold lease, which began paying full rent in June.
During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, HCP divested of its remaining $140.8 million holdings of HCA 9 and 5As toggle notes at a price of a 109% of par. HCP recognized a gain of $12.7 million, which provided a 13% return over the four-year hold.
Yesterday HCAs St. David’s hospital acquired MedCap’s Austin Heart Hospital. HCP received a payoff of the $34.5 million mortgage loan on the MedCap hospital and received an $11.3 million prepayment premium.
Skilled nursing, our owned skilled nursing portfolio year-over-year cash NOI for the third quarter in our same-store portfolio decreased 1.3% as a result of a lump sum payment received with a lease extension in the third quarter of 2009. Cash flow coverage remains strong at 1.48 times.
HCR ManorCare reported improved second quarter trialing 12-month in debt service coverage for the entire debt stack of 4.63 times, an increase of 13 basis points over the prior quarter. During the quarter HCP sold three skilled nursing facilities to the tenant for $10 million and recognized a gain of $4 million. HCP provided short-term 85% solid financing to the buyer at an interest rate of 11.5% as a bridge to a HUD debt execution.
HCP purchased participations in both of the senior term loan and mezzanine debt of Genesis HealthCare, one of the largest skilled nursing providers in the U.S. Genesis operates 137 owned, 43 leased and 42 managed facilities in the U.S. HCP purchased a $277.6 million participation and the $1.3 billion senior term loan at a 10% discount and $50 million participation in the $375 million mezzanine loan at a 20% discount.
The senior loan was priced at LIBOR plus 475 with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% stepping up to LIBOR plus 575 with the floor of 2.5% in 2012. The mezzanine loan was priced at LIBOR plus 7.5 with no floor and contains an exit fee. Both debt facilities mature in September 2014.
Inclusive of the discounts the senior loans scheduled interest rate steps and the exit fee on the mezzanine debt. HCP projects the unlevered IRR to the state of maturities for the senior debt will be 10.5% and 18% on the mezz debt. For the trailing 12 months ended June 2010, Genesis generated cash flow for a year-to-date debt service coverage of 2.66 times on a senior debt tranche and 2.02 times on the entire debt stack.
Medical office buildings. Same property cash NOI for the third quarter was up 1.4% over the same period 2009. The growth was due to normal rent steps and improvement in parking revenue on our Seattle and Houston campuses and a reduction in recoverable operating expenses. Quarterly same-store operating expenses were down $179,000 or 0.6% when compared to 2009. We were able to achieve these savings despite a spike in utility expense.
Our MOB occupancy for the third quarter remained stable at 90.8%. During the third quarter, tenants representing 803,000 square feet occupancy, of which 665,000 square feet related to previously occupied space. Our year-to-date retention rate was 85.3%, the highest average retention in over four years.
Renewals for the quarter occurred at 2.9% higher mark-to-market rents and included five major leases, totaling 282,000 square feet at an average term of over five years. Average term for new and renewal leases executing year-to-date is 55 months, an increase in term of 12 months over the same period in 2009. Our pipeline includes 329,000 square feet of executed leases that have yet to commence and 669,000 square feet in active negotiations, well in excess of the 736,000 remaining rollover for 2010.
We continue to advance our green initiatives. In October, we confirmed we received confirmation that our 1101 Madison Building in Seattle on our Swedish campus was awarded LEED Silver Certification. This brings our total LEED certifications to four throughout the portfolio. This property was also recertified as an ENERGY STAR building. In addition, we’ve received a new ENERGY STAR Award for MOB in Littleton, Colorado, bringing the total ENERGY STAR labeled properties to 15, five of which have received the award in multiple years.
As previously discussed, two MOBs were acquired on July 26 in an off-market DownREIT transaction. The properties are located in San Antonio, Texas and Bountiful, Utah and were purchased for $19 million at a cap rate of 8.8%.
Life science. The third quarter same store cash NOI for life science was down 1.5% over same period in 2009, but remains positive at 2.4% year-to-date. The decrease in same store performance for the quarter was primarily driven by an increasing vacancy, rent reductions experiences result of lease renewals in our Bay area portfolio. Occupancy for the entire life science portfolio increased slightly to 88.9% at the end of the third quarter.
For the quarter, we completed a 180,000 square feet of leasing and year-to-date, we’ve completed 436,000 square feet of leasing that has resulted in a retention rate of 68%. In addition, we’ve completed an additional 62,000 square feet of leasing that will commence in subsequent quarters. Our life science exposure for the fourth quarter of 2010 is only 48,000 square feet.
Looking to 2011, we have 408,000 square feet of expirations with nearly 60% in active negotiations. HCP’s life science development pipeline continues to consist of just three redevelopment projects and was reduced during the quarter from 252,000 to 227,000 square feet, as approximately half of are sold at redevelopment project in San Diego was completed and is now 100% occupied.
As a result of the completion of this project, our overall projected redevelopment funding requirements totaled $27 million. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we completed a $29 million acquisition in the third quarter of a building that was 100% leased and located within our University of Utah Life Science Cluster at a cap rate of 8.5%.
Finally, the biotech industry financing environment remains strong with over $19 billion in capital activity in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date total to $42 billion. The capital flowing into the sector continues to be led by the $25 billion in partnership deals as Big Pharma continues its interest in the sector.
HCP’s tenants continue to attract capital including Exelixis which raised $60 million in upfront payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb and $500 million in potential milestone payments in connection with two collaborations and Portola Pharmaceuticals announced collaboration with Merck on their drug candidate for stroke preventions that included a $50 million upfront payment and up to $420 million at milestone payments.
In addition, the liquidity profile of our tenants remain strong with the life science companies in our portfolio with less than 12 months of cash representing under 0.5% of HCP’s annualized revenue.
With that review, I’d like to turn the call back over to Jay.

We enjoyed a strong quarter across the entire Company. Our real estate portfolio continues to exceed expectations, allowing us to raise our same property performance guidance for this year for the second time in the last three quarters.
The formidable rally in the high yield market driven by a reach for yield provided an attractive exit opportunity for HCP’s entire marketable securities portfolio, most notably our HCA toggle note investment.
HCP’s HCR ManorCare debt investment continues to benefit from strong cash flow generation at this leading post-acute provider. Yesterday, we completed the transition of 27 senior housing communities formally managed by Sunrise to Emeritus.
The economics of the new master leases with Emeritus validated HCP’s long held view of the incremental value potential of this portfolio. In addition to an immediate bump in year one rents of $1.5 million, the compound annual growth rate in rents for the first five years will be 13.9%.
HCP unlevered IRR on this transition is expected in excess of 40%. These events have contributed to HCP raising a low and high end of its full year FFO guidance by $0.08 per share to $2.18 to $2.24 per share.
I want to comment on our investment activity starting with our HCA toggle note investment and more broadly HCP’s sector leading debt investment platform. HCP initially funded a $300 million commitment as part of the HCA LBO exactly 40 years ago this month.
We subsequently added to our position in the post Lehman downdraft of late 2008 at discounted prices. We’ve now completely disposed of this position at a 5.5% yield to call valuation realizing an unlevered return of 13% for the four-year hold period.
What is particularly interesting about the performance of this investment is that this was a pre-crash mezzanine investment versus our investment in HCR ManorCare. While we are confident there will be a time in the future to celebrate the successful fruition of our HCR ManorCare investment. The 13% realized performance on our HCA bonds achieved through the teeth of the great recession is especially rewarding for HCP shareholders.
Let me turn to our most recent investments in Genesis HealthCare. We became quite familiar with the post-acute sector by virtue of our successful investment in HCR ManorCare. Similarly Genesis has performed nicely since its LBO in 2007.
HCP’s ability to underwrite the Genesis opportunity and close promptly to affect a quarter end execution has distinguished HCP as an investor for this type of paper. With expected IRR’s of 10.5% on the senior secured position and 18% on the Mezzanine tranche, we will achieve equity like returns with fixed income risk exposure.
The Genesis buy highlights an additional element of HCPs investment philosophy. Recall at our May Investor Day in New York City, I characterized HCP’s ‘‘5 x 5’’ business model as a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. I want to say that a key feature of our ‘‘5 x 5’’ model was it a created optionality for HCP to achieve our ultimate end, outright ownership of healthcare real estate.
HCP’s previous conversions of mezzanine debt positions and buyouts of joint venture partnership interests into 100% fee simple ownership of real estate are examples of this optionality being successfully realized. In this circumstance Genesis is presently organized as a C Corp with the potential to elect the PropCo/OpCo separation. If and when this process plays itself out, HCP maybe in the fortunate position of enhancing its already attractive return expectations on our Genesis investment.
Finally, we’re pleased to have Kendall Young joined HCP as Executive Vice President focusing on new growth initiatives for the Company in the senior housing sector. Kendall has broad experience in creating value for significant real estate platforms. Kendall is currently evaluating the merits of converting our independent living joint venture portfolio from a lease arrangement to a RIDEA structure.
Our preliminary view speaking of optionality is that the senior housing portfolio unlike the four Sunrise portfolios we’ve previously transitioned as leases maybe especially well-suited for a RIDEA structure.
With that, we’ll open the call to your questions.

We’ve obviously got ourselves quite familiar with the economic fundamentals of the post-acute space. We had been knowledgeable of the management team there and very similar to the way the two investments we made in the HCR ManorCare debt went down. There was some motivation on the part of the major commercial banks, be it for Basel III purposes or other purposes to affect monetization of those investments, and they had rather short timeframe. We were up to speed on the space, we knew the management team and we are able to get our arms around at an entry point from a valuation standpoint that made sense to us and make sense to us on a hold to maturity basis. So let me just stop there. Now with respect to a PropCo/OpCo separation, it may well be if that’s what got ends up happening that we are positioned to as part of that process realize an even greater return by stepping into, you are different, you are modifying that investment either becoming morphing to it like a different form of the debt investment and/or outright ownership of the real estate. I would stop short however of contemplating that this would go to a RIDEA structure, that’s generally in the skilled nursing post-acute space, that’s generally a space that we would probably not have as a priority for our RIDEA structure, we’d probably have that prioritize more over in the private-based senior housing space.

So the economics that there’s been validated with these transitions is not just a kind of 2010, 2011 dynamic that’s going to continue to drive what I suspect will be outsized and senior housing sector leading industry growth metrics for the next several years, you just start compounding at ‘11, ‘12 and in this case on this transition 13.9% those numbers get quite substantial.

We’ve been able to realize what we think, what we believe are market based cost structures and those were relatively straight forward for not only Paul and his team to underwrite, but also to convey the perspective replacement operators. That there wasn’t a lot of, you don’t have to make a big leap of faith as to what was going to happen with the occupancy or what the incremental ancillary revenue benefit was going to be, it was largely a cost reduction.
So as we got into that and we started transitioning these portfolio’s we determined that, since it was a pretty straight forward mathematical exercise both from our standpoint from the replacement operators standpoint, that really lent itself to more of a lease contractual, lease obligation and that in fact is what we’ve not put in place with all these transitions. 
I would distinguish what we’ve done there with respect to, in my formal comments what might be in the offering with respect to our joint venture independent living platform, because there the cost side is, they are in reasonably good shape on the cost side there. That is really more of potential revenue play and that in our view lends itself much more to a more of a RIDEA structure as opposed to a contractual lease structure, I hope that’s some additional perspective for you.

And if you take a look at the substantial dispositions we’ve made in the skilled space, and just as a quick reference point. If you take a look at the equity exposure that sits today in HCP’s portfolio in the skilled space. Its 2% of the entire portfolios. It’s represented by equity exposure in skilled nursing.
So it’s been a conscious decision to move away from state based Medicaid exposures and if you were to go back and look at the metrics of each of those portfolios that we divested ourselves, you would see a heavy, heavy preponderance of state based Medicaid and then a very, very low quality mix. So that contrasts sharply with those very same metrics for HCR ManorCare, and Genesis. So that’s probably the most important answer to your question.
On top of that, we also look at the opportunity to make money for our shareholders and when we can as we’ve seen with the other $640 million of investments that we’ve made this year, when we’ve got the opportunity to take down off market acquisition opportunities that result in equity like returns with fixed income risk exposure, we just think that’s a wonderful result for our shareholder, and it goes directly to the franchise values that’s been created within this company over the past 25 years that we benefit from with each passing day.

The year that we acquired that portfolio that was about four years ago today. That portfolio did $66 million Rob in NOI for 2006. As we sit here today with two months of the year to go, there is pretty high degree of certainty that that number for this year is going to be $64 million.
So now remember this is much more independent living, I think this is about 70% independent living. So that is not calculated with the needs based assisted living resident profile and a good chunk of it, I want to say as much as 40% of its in Costal Florida. So if you think about a portfolio that potentially got exposed to some rough stuff if you will, the independent living as opposed to assisted living or skilled and then Walton, Florida, our view is that the portfolio four years later at 64 versus 66 has actually held in there reasonably well.
The lease bumps in that lease that were put in place at the end of ‘06. I want to say they are averaged about 3.33%. So there is the math for you, I think what’s much more interesting is going forward given that if you drill into the P&L on that portfolio and the costs are for the most part in line is the opportunity for here to be some substantial top line growth over the next couple of years and that’s really what we are interested and making sure that we are in a position to capture that. There will be some execution involved with that for example some additional CapEx will be required and then there will some other things that we have to do, but that to us versus the four that we have transitioned from Sunrise suggest to us a very nice opportunity for a RIDEA structure.

If you go back and pull the, I can’t remember if it was August, I think it was August 31st press release, Ross. We profiled the metrics for the portfolio that was being transitioned versus the portfolio that was remaining. And a couple of key things that you all know, the NOI margin, let’s start with your question around the nose here. The NOI margin for the remaining portfolio of Sunrise assets we had is about 29%. The NOI margin for the portfolio that’s in question here, the 27 properties is 18.7%.
The occupancy of that portfolio is 81%. Okay, that’s 700 basis points lower than the occupancy for the remaining portfolio. So before we get into acuity and things like that, if you just look at the margin in the occupancy, this portfolio is an out-wired to the remaining Sunrise assets we have. And then when you go to the profile of the previous portfolios we’ve transitioned and take a look at where the metrics were at the time we transitioned, the opportunity here kind of jumps out, but from a standpoint of the landlord us, as well as the various replacement operators that we spoke with in terms of their interest level in taking this on.
So it’s a very, very attractive opportunity. And I think the results from our standpoint that demonstrate that and I suspect the results from Emeritus’s standpoint over the next couple of years if they do as well or better than they’ve done on the portfolios, they’ve already transitioned and I suspect they will, we’ll also bear that out Ross.
