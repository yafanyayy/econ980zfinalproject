Without a doubt, 2009 was a momentous year for Scripps Networks Interactive and its shareholders. We ended the year on a high note, achieving solid growth in both advertising and affiliate fee revenue during the fourth quarter. For the full year, ad sales were even with last year on an apples-to-apples basis which is especially good news, given that we were managing through the worst recession in the generation. Importantly, we also executed on our top strategic priority for 2009, achieving what we set out to accomplish with our affiliate agreement renewals for both Food Network and HGTV. We couldn't be more pleased with the momentum that we're creating. So let me give you a quick rundown of the headlines.During the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of Travel Channel, giving us our third fully-distributed basic cable television network and a promising new lifestyle category on which to build. We achieved a significant reset of our affiliate rates, effectively monetizing the value and the ever-growing popularity of Food Network and HGTV. The new and improved rates took effect January 1. We've put into action our plans to expand internationally. We've created promising joint ventures that enable us to leverage our expertise as creators of lifestyle content around the globe. We're exporting the Food Network to Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia and we're about to enter the growing Indian marketplace. We made clear progress toward our debut later this year of the newly branded Cooking Channel, and we expect Cooking to fit comfortably within the 55 million household footprint we created with its predecessor network. The goal of Cooking is to further capitalize on the exploding consumer interest in food as a television programming genre. And perhaps the best news of all, Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel reached new heights in 2009 with each brand ending the year with record growth in viewership. Now those are some pretty impressive headlines. All in all, an excellent quarter and a good year, especially considering where the economy was at this time last year.As we begin 2010 with our new affiliate rate structure in place, the company is poised for sustainable growth. As for advertising, the marketplace continues to show improvement which puts us in an enviable position when you factor in the audience growth at our flagship brands.At Food Network, we started the new year pretty much where we left off in 2009. Looking at total households in January, the primetime audience grew a very strong 25% over the same period last year. In fact, Food Network was the highest-rated, most-watched network of all of cable in primetime on Sunday, January 3. Two shows led the way that night. The first was the Super Chef Battle: An American Event (sic) [Super Chef Battle: An Iron Chef America Event] from the White House, which drew a whopping 7.6 million viewers and posted a 2.0 rating among adults 25-54. That by far, is a record audience for Food Network. The second show that night was the premiere of a new competition-based show called the Worst Cooks in America. About 4 million people stuck around to watch the premiere episode of Worst Cooks, making it the highest-rated, most-watched premiere in Food Network's history. The show had a 1.3 rating among adults 25-54 that night.Let me pause for just a minute to emphasize a point. Those are absolutely astounding numbers. And don't forget, Food Network was actually dark in many New York area households that night and for three weeks in January. As one of our advertisers told us recently, Food Network has become a power brand. I couldn't agree more. Looking ahead at Food Network, we have some very promising new shows in the pipeline including one called Private Chefs of Beverly Hills which will premiere in April, by the way. We've also responded to viewer demand for a show dedicated to Mexican cuisine, with the premiere last month of Mexican Made Easy. The show airs Saturday mornings during our in-the-kitchen programming block. Lots of really, really good things happening at the Food Network.Over at HGTV, the audience growth that we enjoyed throughout the second half of 2009 has also continued into the new year. Total household viewership in January grew a very healthy 16%, with the average primetime audience topping 1 million viewers a night. HGTV ended 2009 with its highest ever annual primetime ratings, achieving a solid 1.0 rating among total U.S. households. Again, those are incredibly strong numbers.Our programming team at HGTV has done an outstanding job repositioning the network to keep in sync with the times. Our first-time home buyers programming block including great shows like Property Virgins and My First Place have resonated with viewers and provided the network with the lift it needed. Another hit is a relatively new script called Holmes on Homes. Plus, we're getting plenty of mileage out of perennial favorites House Hunters, House Hunters International and in January, the annual HGTV Dream Home Giveaway special. This year, we'll be adding 14 new series at HGTV, including a show called Selling New York that I suspect will be of interest to a lot of folks in the call this morning.We also announced in December that Mark Burnett will be producing season five of HGTV Design Star which will air this summer. Now we're expecting Mark to do for Design Star what he's already done for Survivor and The Apprentice. HGTV is blazing ahead in 2010 and we're expecting big things at the network. At Travel Channel, the news is every bit as good. Travel finished 2009 with its best year ever in primetime and total day ratings and even more important, the median age of the network's audience dropped from 49 to 44.  Hit shows like Man v. Food with Adam Richman, No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain and Ghost Adventures have found true cult followings with younger viewers. The ratings success of Travel is a great story for Scripps Networks Interactive, as we begin to build out our presence in the promising travel programming category.Of course, it's important to remember, we're not just all about television. We're also making great headway, building related content services in the home, food and travel categories across an array of media platforms, and that includes the highly successful Food Network Magazine, which continues to outpace our initial expectations. Accounting subscriptions and single-copy sales, the magazine is reaching a very impressive 1.3 million readers. We've said it before but it bears repeating, our partners at Hearst tell us that this is the biggest new title launch for them since Oprah Magazine. Also in the food category, we continued to lead on the Internet. Foodnetwork.com and Recipezaar continue to be among the top food websites in the country in terms of total unique visitors, page views and time spent on our websites.In the home category, HGTV just announced a new partnership with Serta to create a collection of eco-friendly mattresses, appropriately labeled as the HGTV Green Home Collection by Serta. hgtv.com and diynetwork.com also maintained their leadership positions as valued online destinations for designers, for do-it-yourselfers and more. So, there you have it: Three powerful, fully-distributed lifestyle television networks; three powerful lifestyle content categories; and great content across a full range of media platforms, including the Internet and mobile devices.Scripps Networks Interactive is extraordinarily positioned to deliver value to our viewers, our advertisers, our distribution partners, and importantly, to our shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joe who's going to talk how we finished 2009 and then provide a new outlook for 2010, that will include Travel. Joe?"

Good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter turned out to be very good for us. Thanks to the improving advertising environment, strong ratings of our flagship networks and continued growth in affiliate revenue. Excluding the Travel Channel, ad",1200,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter turned out to be very good for us. Thanks to the improving advertising environment, strong ratings of our flagship networks and continued growth in affiliate revenue. Excluding the Travel Channel, advertising revenue grew a very solid 7% during the three-month period, which pushed full-year ad revenue even with 2008 on an apples-to-apples basis.Strong growth in the fourth quarter was due to the healthier ad market and the success we've had in monetizing the audience growth of both Food Network and HGTV. As for affiliate fee revenue, again, x Travel, we were up about 16% in the fourth quarter and finished the year, up about 16%. That was a tad better than the 15% growth we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. It's also worth noting that ad sales from our Lifestyle Media websites grew 10% during the fourth quarter and that positive trend has continued into the New Year. If you'll remember, Internet ad sales were a leading indicator as we entered the recession, so we see this growth as a very good sign for us.Now looking at other full-year results relative to the guidance we've provided. Programming expenses were up about 9%, not including the write-down and excluding Travel. That was in line with our forecast. All other expenses at our Lifestyle Media segment were down slightly from the prior year, as we had predicted. Again, that's on an apples-to-apples basis minus Travel and any one-time items.Capital expenditures finished the year at $91 million, as we continue to work on the expansion of our Knoxville operations facility. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was about 29% for the full year, which was lower than we had anticipated. A number of one-time discreet items, including some favorable adjustments to previously filed tax returns, contributed to the lower rate. Going forward, when you factor in the non-controlling interest for Food Network and Travel Channel, our effective tax rate should be in the 31% to 33% range.And finally in Shopzilla, we ended up at about $31 million in segment profit which was right about where we had guided.Looking at earnings per share, as we noted in the press release, we finished the quarter at $0.52, after you strip out a number of one-time items related to our affiliate renewals, the Travel acquisition, Cooking Channel rebranding and the uSwitch divestiture. To make sure we're all clear, let me quickly run through and size the items that affected net income and EPS. They're also outlined in the press release for you.First, $21 million write-off of Fine Living programming accounted for about $0.07 per share. This was prompted by our announcement during the fourth quarter that we'd be rebranding Fine Living to the Cooking Channel. The write-off includes existing Fine Living programming and commitments that we determined couldn't be used at Cooking or in our other networks. The write-offs show up as an expense on the income statement which is why programming costs were up 25% during the period.Next, about $18 million or $0.08 per share is tied to the Travel Channel acquisition, including both professional fees and financing costs. Our international investments, primarily  the Chello Zone jv accounted for about $0.01.And finally, to support our affiliate renewals, we had about $4 million in one-time marketing and legal expenses that accounted for another $0.02 or so. And if you live in the New York area, you'd probably know that another tranche of these costs will hit in the first quarter as well.The combination of all the one-time items reduced fourth quarter net income by $0.17 a share which was offset by the $0.17 gain we realized on the sale of uSwitch and the $0.05 added back for the tax adjustments. That should get you to the $0.52.So that was 2009. Let's move on to the forecast we provided this morning. I'm sure you noticed that since we're including Travel Channel in our forecast, we've decided to give you a range of actual dollars on Lifestyle Media revenue and expense items, rather than try to relate apples to oranges using a growth rate. We thought this would be a better way to present our guidance for this year.Let's start with affiliate fee revenue for 2010. With the majority of our carriage rights agreements renewed at more attractive rates, total affiliate fee revenue is expected to be in the $530 million to $540 million range with about $100 million of that coming from Travel.As Ken said, we accomplished substantially all that we've set out to accomplish in this very important round of renewals, achieving parity and rate structures between Food Network and HGTV. Rates of both networks also are now more in line with our competitive set. The new rate structure, we believe, more accurately represents the value of these brands for both us and for our distribution partners.Moving to Lifestyle Media expenses including Travel, we expect programming amortization costs to be between $380 million and $400 million and non-programming costs to be within the range of $550 million to $570 million. You'll remember, please, that we cut back dramatically on marketing expenses in 2009.At Shopzilla, we're forecasting segment profit to be $33 million to $35 million which would be a modest improvement from 2009. The performance you saw in 2009 will likely continue through the first half of 2010 with a much, much stronger finish in the back half. One other operating item for 2010. While it's too early to quantify with any precision, we do expect to report losses on our international startups in the year ahead.And finally, we expect capital spending to be in the $95 million to $100 million change. We're on track to finish our Knoxville expansion this year, so starting in 2011, I'd look for a normalized CapEx run rate of about $50 million  to $60 million per year.Before I finish, let me quickly bring you up-to-date on where we are with Travel Channel's integration. At this point, I'd say, we're proceeding very close to plan. We anticipate fully assuming ad sales responsibilities by the end of the first quarter which will tee us up to market the brand in this year's upfront. We also expect to assume technical responsibilities from Discovery in about the same time frame. We lastly expect to assume affiliate sales during the second quarter.A couple more housekeeping notes related to Travel. You'll notice that we did not include the quarterly balance sheet or cash flow statement with this morning's release. That's because we're still working through some of the acquisition accounting. Naturally, we'll have everything ready in time for our 10-K filing in a couple of weeks. Let me highlight a couple of balance sheet items though. First, we ended the year with a cash balance of about $254 million. That includes $181 million we contributed to the Travel Channel joint venture. And our debt balance at year end is $884 million, again all related to the Travel acquisition.Lastly, when we report the first quarter, we intend to provide a quarter-by-quarter pro forma look at Travel to help you with your models and comparisons going forward. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

And the terms are, they're multi-year, they're varying terms and not all are going to terminate at the same time. The escalators are a little bit different shape than what we've told you in the past about the HGTV renewals. We did achieve a much larger slug of the growth early on, in the Food renewals. So by and large, we're very, very pleased with how those renewals came out.

And then secondly, can you talk about your over-indexing in the HD homes which is presumably providing some of the thrust for your ratings improvement and maybe that applies particularly to Travel? And then lastly, you've shown us the magazines, that you're able to do some things in media that a lot of other guys can't do right now on the older categories of media. Can you talk about some things like the tabloid and all that, and how you'd be on as-is Internet strategy right now, how that overlays and whether you would expect to perform disproportionately well with some adaptations in the ad areas as well? I know it's a little bit fuzzy, but it seems like you just have so many venues for extending your brand right now."

I think, we're at a very early stages of thinking about Travel. If we sort of put in priority order the categories that we like for international, I'd say Food is number one, a generalized lifestyle channel, probably branded under Fine Living is number two. Travel, while it has great international appeal, you correctly point out, has established competitors and other choices in many, many markets. Not the least of which is owned by our good friends at Discovery. So we're proceeding cautiously. One thing we do like is that we do think the programming has great appeal. We are not so concerned that the brand name is taken in large parts of the world. The fact that these two companies did have the same set of parents way back when, and split off at that point, international went one way and domestic one another. We had conversations with the owner there. There are things we might be able to do to get it down the road, but we're not married to that brand globally, partly because we think the programming is more important than the brand and we may actually create other brands, if we think that there's a room for another stand-alone Travel network, globally. But, like I said, we like the programming appeal. It's sort of third on our list of most important priorities globally. But we're going to do our best there and as I said, we're still early days thinking about what we can do with Travel."

And so to the extent we over-index upscale, I think, that translates into the high-definition viewing and its evidence of the fact that we do well with those audiences. Regarding your question about platforms, when you think about, particularly HGTV and Food, or maybe think more in terms of our two biggest categories, Food and Home, we really have brands and now adding Travel to the mix -- brands that transcend television per se and resonate with audiences on a variety of platforms. And the way we think about it is that we're agnostic as to the platform per se. Rather, we just think about accessing as many consumer touch-points as we possibly can, that resonate with our media content. So we're seeing that happening with the Food Network Magazine. We're seeing it certainly through our Digital businesses. Travel Channel, by the way, has also done a great job in this regard. Their website is up 20% in traffic after their recent redesign. And we just see lot of opportunity going forward to create new revenue streams on top of these relationships we build by way of these massive cable television properties that continue the growth into the future."

In fact, it's pretty early on the Travel Channel. We're not really even fully through our integration process. So to provide specific guidance on expense line items, is premature. I will say this, we absolutely expect that, that the network has the full potential to achieve every bit of margin that the other two fully-distributed networks do, and we're working towards that objective. So I think, I'm going to have to ask you to stay tuned on that one while we work through the transition.

So I think, it won't be an insignificant number for the year. But I'm afraid it's a little early to give you a range on that. On the question of Cooking Channel and the transition there, the only transition expense that would sort of not have been covered by the existing Fine Living budget that we had, would've been, call them launch fees or conversion fees that we paid in incentives to the operators to launch the new network for us, so worked with us to launch the new network. And relatively modest fee it will be an increase in expenses there, but it's not going to be significant. You can think in terms of $1 or so that we converted over a very long period of time it will be amortized. So overall, those carriage agreements. So it's not going to be a meaningful change in this year's budget for what we had in place for Fine Living."

We don't have a cash flow statements, I'm not sure what your cash investment in programming was in '09 versus '08. But when I strip out what I think Travel is plus your impairment in the fourth quarter, it seems like your programming cost amortization guidance is sort of 10%, 11% growth in '10 versus '09 on the kind of core networks. And my understanding is it's four-year amortization accelerated depreciation of your cash investments is the way the accounting works. And correct me if I'm wrong, so I was curious if you could just help sync up your cash investment in programming over the last year or two and this growth rate, which I think is sort of flat with '09. I would've expected it to moderate in '10 versus '09, but maybe I'm doing the math wrong or my Travel estimate may be wrong? And then along those lines, Ken, when you think about down the road, if in fact, the broadcasters start to receive retransmissions fees the way they think they will, you can make an argument that the sort of cost of audience growth goes up in general because you've been with competing with broadcasters in many ways instead of had a broken model. And if, in fact, that model gets fixed and there's an influx of billion of dollars of retrends, how does that change, if at all, your investment strategy and content and how you think about spending on your core networks?"

And Benjamin, I think what's not being factored into the equation, as much right now, is kind of shifting of some revenue, which you know historically, since retransmission consent launched in the mid-90s and we were pretty much at the front end of that because we cooked the retransmission consent of our 10 television stations and then we coupled that with some other television station groups. So we used that leverage to get HGTV launched and as you know, that was really also a mechanism for getting Food launched. Some of those dollars that went from retransmission to cable networks like ours are now maybe going to be shifting back to the network model. But that comes with NBC, ABC, CBS to a certain degree and Fox's as well, maybe having to shift some revenue internally. So it's not going to be that all this new revenue is going to be created, as much as we're going to see some more chips, some resetting the breaks, which is going to have some upheaval over the coming negotiations. Having said all of that and having just gone through a massive renewal with about 75% of our new Food Network base, it's still going to come down to, in my opinion, quality content that has passionate viewership, passionate engagement from the audience, that has high-quality for the advertising community. So you'll continue to see us invest. I think it's going to be a more competitive environment. I think looking forward, you can actually expect to see some, as I said, not only dollar shifting, but some smaller and less popular cable networks really put under to rest. From our standpoint, there's going to be a lot of movement but I've never felt stronger about our brands. And as John was alluding to earlier, as we see technology and some of the things that are probably going to be happening in the future with TV everywhere, interactivity being enhanced with these set-top boxes, our brands are actually, I think in for great runs and that's why we were thrilled to pick up one more category, the Travel category, if you go to the [ph] the Home category and the Food category. And to paraphrase what John said, our brands really transcend television. So it's great to have those TV brands as popular as they are, but we've never been about just cable networks, we've been about categories."

Any reason why you shouldn't just kind of continue, not necessarily with bare bones, but why you're going full open with the marketing spend this year when you seem to do pretty well without that? I'm know you're trying to get some new viewers in, but there's two ways to think about it. I guess, one is that if you had spent more, you would've had that many more viewers. The other is perhaps maybe where you're spending on marketing, wasn't the greatest place. How do you reassess your marketing mix, I guess, for next year? And then the other question is on the programming side, any idea kind of on the number of hours of new original programming in '09, '08 and then what you're planning for '10?"

But for the long haul, there's no possible way that you can grow your audience without attracting new viewers along the way. And there's really no way to do that without marketing off your channels on other media platforms. And so, yes, it may seem like a question mark in your mind. I suppose that if you can raise ratings in a year without marketing, why not just quit marketing all together?

Our first quarter was an exceptionally good one for the company and the shareholders. Allow me to share a few headlines with you. 
Industry-leading growth in advertising sales, dramatically higher affiliate fee revenue, audience growth at all our flagship networks, the successful integration of the Travel Channel and lots of progress towards the upcoming debut of our brand-new Cooking Channel. Put it all together, and you have one of America's top-performing media companies and the clear leader in lifestyle television programming. 
The resounding popularity of our networks is evident in our exceptionally strong financial results. On a consolidated basis, total revenue for the company was up 32% during the quarter, driven by the addition of Travel, the steadily improving marketplace for advertising and substantially higher affiliate fees for our core brands, particularly Food Network and HGTV.
On an apples-to-apples basis, back in our Travel Channel results, total revenue for the quarter was up 20%. Now we're effectively monetizing the audience gains that we've achieved at Food Network and HGTV, benefiting from both the healthy rebound in advertising and the success we have last year negotiating new and improved affiliate fee agreements with our distribution partners.
Viewership growth continued at all three of our fully distributed networks, despite some serious competition from the Olympics, the NCAA basketball tournament and seasonally strong network programming. At Food Network, entertaining series and new specials like Worst Cooks in America help drive total household viewership, up 10% during primetime and 9% total day. And that was on top of strong total double-digit audience growth in the prior-year period. At HGTV, Holmes on Homes has been our breakout hit of the year as a growing number of viewers identify what home improvement perfectionist Mike Holmes with his very gritty disdain for shoddy workmanship. The result, the primetime audience at HGTV grew 9% during the quarter, and total day viewership jumped 11%. And many of these new viewers, by the way -- these are new viewers, by the way, thanks to some creative and effective marketing that we've done to promote the Holmes on Homes franchise.
Audience trends at Travel Channel are all moving in the right direction as well. Travel marked its sixth consecutive quarter of viewership growth, both in primetime and total day. In fact, the first quarter of 2010 was the best three month of ratings period in the network's history. Hit shows like Adam Richman's Man v. Food are gaining new and younger fans every day. Our integration of Travel, by the way, is nearly complete. We named the industry veteran, Laureen Ong, as the network's new President. And Laureen's probably best known for guiding the launch and development of Nat Geo. She is a true pro. And she'll be helping us build on Travel's strength as the go-to lifestyle brand.
We also assumed the advertising sales responsibilities March 29, and we're fully marketing the brand in the broadcast upfront, which is doing very well. And there's more to come. 
We're also on track for the Memorial Day debut of the brand-new Cooking Channel. We'll be launching the network with a good mix of new and familiar personalities who will take food enthusiasts deeper into the genre. Rachael Ray, Emeril Lagasse and Bobby Flay, all with original new series produced just for the Cooking Channel, will be joined by promising new personalities hosting shows like Chinese Food Made Easy, Everyday Exotic and French Food at Home.
Our plan at Cooking is to hit the ground running with a very strong 24/7 network that can take full advantage of the growing television food genre. Now based on the favorable response that we're getting from advertisers ahead of the launch, I'd say we're definitely headed in the right direction with the Cooking Channel. 
And don't forget about the DIY Network, our growing flanker brand in the Home category. First quarter viewership at DIY was up 13% total day, 8% in primetime and 10% on weekends, which is really the real primetime for do-it-yourself enthusiasts. The size of DIY's audience surged forward in 2009, given this more inventory for sale in last year's upfront. That, combined with the strength of the current scatter market, is why total revenue at DIY was up a very solid 22% during the quarter. We also added 2 million subs [subscribers] since the first quarter last year, making DIY one of America's fastest growing networks. We also launched the high-definition feed of DIY Network on May 1. 
Moving on to our branded websites. The improving ad trends are definitely evident. Revenue at our Digital businesses, led by www.foodnetwork.com and www.hgtv.com, was up 15% during the first quarter. Collectively, Scripps' websites are the clear leaders in their respective categories based on the amount of user traffic that they generate.
Internationally, we continue to build momentum with new launches and expanding distribution of our networks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Food Network's viewership in the U.K. continue to grow during the quarter, and we launched an international version of Fine Living Network across 60 countries in the EMEA region. As you probably saw earlier this week, we ended discussions with a potential partner in India, after we were unable to work out specifics of the transaction that we announced back in November. Our interest in entering the India market is by no means diminished, and we'll be exploring other alternatives as part of our overall international expansion strategy.
And finally, at our Online Comparison Shopping businesses, we're delivering a better user experience for our consumers and customers in a more effective marketing platform for our merchant partners. Direct leads to online merchants from our websites grew 11% during the quarter, a sure indication that shoppers and retailers are getting more value by turning to BizRate, Shopzilla and Beso. We look for Shopzilla's financial performance to start turning more positive in the back half of the year. 
As 2010 progresses, we'll remain focused on our strategic priorities, which include fully integrating the Travel Channel and building on the network's strength as a destination brand. We capitalize in on the growing interest in Food as a popular television genre with the launch, May 31, of the Cooking Channel. Internationally, we're looking for opportunities to explore our lifestyle networks and programming expertise throughout the EMEA, Asia, India and Latin America. And last but not least, we'll focus on building brand awareness and growing audiences at all of our networks. All in all, given the strength of our first quarter results, I'd say we're off to a very good start for this year. 
With that, now let me turn it over to Joe. Joe?"

I'm sure most of you have had time to review the press release we issued this morning, so I won't repeat it here. Other than to note, as Ken did, that we had an exceptionally strong start to the year. Underlying our positive results are the improving ad market and the success we had last year, renewing distribution agreements at considerably more attractive rates, particularly for Food Network. 
A strong audience growth at most of our networks in 2009 also gave us more impressions to sell in last year's upfront and put us in an excellent position to benefit from the strengthening scatter marketplace. Remember, given the weaker upfront pricing environment a year ago, we held some inventory back for scatter. Sequential improvement in scatter pricing continue through the first three months of the year. And for the second quarter, it's trending up about 20% to 25% above last year's upfront. Scatter versus scatter pricing is up mid-teens compared with last year.
Given the health of the marketplace, we expect double-digit advertising growth to continue in the second quarter. And as you'd expect, the current strength in scatter bodes well for this year's upfront, which will have its most immediate impact during the fourth quarter of the year. It's important to remember though that ad revenue comparisons get increasingly more difficult for us in the back half of the year.
As for affiliate revenues, the first quarter came in pretty much as we had anticipated, with an organic growth rate of about 40%, thanks largely to our new rate card. We're holding firm on our expectations for affiliate revenue growth for the full year as we noted in the press release.
On the cost side, we've called out one-time expenses that were incurred during the quarter to support our affiliate renewals and our integration of the Travel Channel. The affiliate marketing and legal expenses of $11 million are all now behind us, since those activities occurred largely in January. And a large percentage of the Travel transition costs were also incurred during the first quarter.
We're now expecting Travel transition costs for the full year to end up near the lower end of the $30 million to $40 million range that we've provided in March. Much of the remaining Travel transition costs will be incurred in the second quarter. And as a result, we've lowered the full year range for non-programming expenses from our previous guidance.
Total operating expenses at our Lifestyle Media segment were up 47% during the quarter, and much of this increase is due to the addition of the Travel Channel and these one-time items. But as planned, we've also taken advantage of our very strong ad and affiliate revenue growth to restore some of our marketing budgets. You'll remember that we spent considerably less money on marketing during the first quarter last year because of the recession, which, of course, makes the increase in spending this year appear a bit outsized. 
Some timing issues also had an impact. We launched targeted marketing campaigns during the first quarter to promote the Worst Cooks special event at Food Network and the popular Holmes on Homes series at HGTV. The results were right on target. Worst Cooks in America performed superbly for us, averaging 1.0 rating among adults 25 to 54. We also improved the audience delivery for its timeslot by 51% over the prior year.
Holmes on Homes, meanwhile, has become one of HGTV's breakout hit for the year. During the height of the marketing campaign, which ended in March, the show's audience was up about 30% compared with the prior four-week period. This marketing money was well spent, we believe.
Turning to other items, let me add a little color on our capital spending. We're putting the finishing touches on a facility expansion in Knoxville. And we included the CapEx related to the Travel integration in our full year guidance. Our apologies, by the way. There was a typo in the release. The non-recurring cost for our operating facility expansion for the year will be about $35 million, not $9 million as it's stated in the release. Once these items go away, we're expecting a normalized CapEx run rate of $50 million to $60 million starting in 2011.
And finally, one balance sheet item. We finished the first quarter with about $320 million in cash. Our plan for now is to maintain a strong cash position and the flexibility that it will afford us to act on opportunities in the marketplace and to meet our future obligations. 
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

House Hunters has been a perennial success story, breakout hit for HGTV. It has for over 10 years and continues to do so. Of course, we've expanded the genre now to include House Hunters International. And the positioning of it on the schedule allows us to put new series on the back end of it to introduce the audience to those series. And so what we're seeing is the success of new series such as Holmes on Homes and Selling New York. And even our First-Time Home Buyers' block have all benefited from the boost of audience that House Hunters creates. So think of House Hunters as really a catalyst on our schedule, creating an opportunity for us to create and grow new franchises. And the team at HGTV has done a terrific job over the last years and making that really pay off for them, particularly with Holmes on Homes, which saw a 30% growth year-over-year in the time period in the first quarter with the introduction of the new season. In terms of Travel, we took over the ad sales, as we said earlier, at the end of March. And I guess the way we think about it is in our portfolio, Travel Channel is one of our three crown jewels. It will get all of the attention, if not even a little more attention, since it's a bit of a start-up for us as a Food Network or an HGTV. It's not anything short of a top priority for us. We promoted one of our young stars in the Ad Sales department, Greg Regis, to manage the Ad Sales group. We made some terrific hires for the Ad Sales team. We've effectively created an entire Ad Sales team dedicated to the success of Travel Channel. And I can tell you this, in the first quarter, prior to us taking it over, the DR [depositary receipt] component of Travel Channel was upwards of 30% and the DR component of Travel under this, our Ad Sales team will be something closer to the mid-single digits as we're pushing much, much more aggressively in the scatter.

And that is continuing to improve week-to-week. So barring something unforeseen, we anticipate there being a significant improvement in the upfront marketplace, simply because the advertisers are paying such a premium right now to get into the scatter marketplace. And we believe that will translate into volume growth for the cable industry in the upfront upwards of 20%. And in terms of Scripps Networks, I would anticipate our CPM growth in the upcoming upfront would be in the mid- to high singles, leaning towards the high singles."

We're certainly very proud of our Ad Sales team to deliver 14% growth. And you make a very good point. For many, many years now, we've been talking about the method that Scripps Networks approaches the ad marketplace, which is really selling the engagement that our audiences have with our programming and how commercials that run within our programming tend to work very, very well for advertisers. Because in many cases, our audiences look at the advertising as part of the programming. It helps complete the cycle, if you will, of the inspiration the programming creates. And then the advertising provides a place for an audience to make good on that inspiration. But also going along with that, we invested somewhat in programming and marketing this year as was noted in our earlier prepared remarks. And we also pushed forward our advertising guarantees, our ratings guarantees. We bet on the upside based on that investment in programming and marketing. And thankfully, the ratings came in and met those higher and more aggressive ratings guarantees. And as a result, higher ratings meeting a stronger marketplace and then being able to monetize the engagement of our audience really served us well in this quarter."

Good morning, everyone, and as always, thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. Our first quarter was an exceptionally good one for the company and the shareholders. Allow me to share a few headlines with you.",1128,"Okay. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and as always, thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. Our first quarter was an exceptionally good one for the company and the shareholders. Allow me to share a few headlines with you. 
Industry-leading growth in advertising sales, dramatically higher affiliate fee revenue, audience growth at all our flagship networks, the successful integration of the Travel Channel and lots of progress towards the upcoming debut of our brand-new Cooking Channel. Put it all together, and you have one of America's top-performing media companies and the clear leader in lifestyle television programming. 
The resounding popularity of our networks is evident in our exceptionally strong financial results. On a consolidated basis, total revenue for the company was up 32% during the quarter, driven by the addition of Travel, the steadily improving marketplace for advertising and substantially higher affiliate fees for our core brands, particularly Food Network and HGTV.
On an apples-to-apples basis, back in our Travel Channel results, total revenue for the quarter was up 20%. Now we're effectively monetizing the audience gains that we've achieved at Food Network and HGTV, benefiting from both the healthy rebound in advertising and the success we have last year negotiating new and improved affiliate fee agreements with our distribution partners.
Viewership growth continued at all three of our fully distributed networks, despite some serious competition from the Olympics, the NCAA basketball tournament and seasonally strong network programming. At Food Network, entertaining series and new specials like Worst Cooks in America help drive total household viewership, up 10% during primetime and 9% total day. And that was on top of strong total double-digit audience growth in the prior-year period. At HGTV, Holmes on Homes has been our breakout hit of the year as a growing number of viewers identify what home improvement perfectionist Mike Holmes with his very gritty disdain for shoddy workmanship. The result, the primetime audience at HGTV grew 9% during the quarter, and total day viewership jumped 11%. And many of these new viewers, by the way -- these are new viewers, by the way, thanks to some creative and effective marketing that we've done to promote the Holmes on Homes franchise.
Audience trends at Travel Channel are all moving in the right direction as well. Travel marked its sixth consecutive quarter of viewership growth, both in primetime and total day. In fact, the first quarter of 2010 was the best three month of ratings period in the network's history. Hit shows like Adam Richman's Man v. Food are gaining new and younger fans every day. Our integration of Travel, by the way, is nearly complete. We named the industry veteran, Laureen Ong, as the network's new President. And Laureen's probably best known for guiding the launch and development of Nat Geo. She is a true pro. And she'll be helping us build on Travel's strength as the go-to lifestyle brand.
We also assumed the advertising sales responsibilities March 29, and we're fully marketing the brand in the broadcast upfront, which is doing very well. And there's more to come. 
We're also on track for the Memorial Day debut of the brand-new Cooking Channel. We'll be launching the network with a good mix of new and familiar personalities who will take food enthusiasts deeper into the genre. Rachael Ray, Emeril Lagasse and Bobby Flay, all with original new series produced just for the Cooking Channel, will be joined by promising new personalities hosting shows like Chinese Food Made Easy, Everyday Exotic and French Food at Home.
Our plan at Cooking is to hit the ground running with a very strong 24/7 network that can take full advantage of the growing television food genre. Now based on the favorable response that we're getting from advertisers ahead of the launch, I'd say we're definitely headed in the right direction with the Cooking Channel. 
And don't forget about the DIY Network, our growing flanker brand in the Home category. First quarter viewership at DIY was up 13% total day, 8% in primetime and 10% on weekends, which is really the real primetime for do-it-yourself enthusiasts. The size of DIY's audience surged forward in 2009, given this more inventory for sale in last year's upfront. That, combined with the strength of the current scatter market, is why total revenue at DIY was up a very solid 22% during the quarter. We also added 2 million subs [subscribers] since the first quarter last year, making DIY one of America's fastest growing networks. We also launched the high-definition feed of DIY Network on May 1. 
Moving on to our branded websites. The improving ad trends are definitely evident. Revenue at our Digital businesses, led by www.foodnetwork.com and www.hgtv.com, was up 15% during the first quarter. Collectively, Scripps' websites are the clear leaders in their respective categories based on the amount of user traffic that they generate.
Internationally, we continue to build momentum with new launches and expanding distribution of our networks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Food Network's viewership in the U.K. continue to grow during the quarter, and we launched an international version of Fine Living Network across 60 countries in the EMEA region. As you probably saw earlier this week, we ended discussions with a potential partner in India, after we were unable to work out specifics of the transaction that we announced back in November. Our interest in entering the India market is by no means diminished, and we'll be exploring other alternatives as part of our overall international expansion strategy.
And finally, at our Online Comparison Shopping businesses, we're delivering a better user experience for our consumers and customers in a more effective marketing platform for our merchant partners. Direct leads to online merchants from our websites grew 11% during the quarter, a sure indication that shoppers and retailers are getting more value by turning to BizRate, Shopzilla and Beso. We look for Shopzilla's financial performance to start turning more positive in the back half of the year. 
As 2010 progresses, we'll remain focused on our strategic priorities, which include fully integrating the Travel Channel and building on the network's strength as a destination brand. We capitalize in on the growing interest in Food as a popular television genre with the launch, May 31, of the Cooking Channel. Internationally, we're looking for opportunities to explore our lifestyle networks and programming expertise throughout the EMEA, Asia, India and Latin America. And last but not least, we'll focus on building brand awareness and growing audiences at all of our networks. All in all, given the strength of our first quarter results, I'd say we're off to a very good start for this year. 
With that, now let me turn it over to Joe. Joe?

I'm sure most of you have had time to review the press release we issued this morning, so I won't repeat it here. Other than to note, as Ken did, that we had an exceptionally strong start to the year. Underlying our positive results are the improving ad market and the success we had last year, renewing distribution agreements at considerably more attractive rates, particularly for Food Network. 
A strong audience growth at most of our networks in 2009 also gave us more impressions to sell in last year's upfront and put us in an excellent position to benefit from the strengthening scatter marketplace. Remember, given the weaker upfront pricing environment a year ago, we held some inventory back for scatter. Sequential improvement in scatter pricing continue through the first three months of the year. And for the second quarter, it's trending up about 20% to 25% above last year's upfront. Scatter versus scatter pricing is up mid-teens compared with last year.
Given the health of the marketplace, we expect double-digit advertising growth to continue in the second quarter. And as you'd expect, the current strength in scatter bodes well for this year's upfront, which will have its most immediate impact during the fourth quarter of the year. It's important to remember though that ad revenue comparisons get increasingly more difficult for us in the back half of the year.
As for affiliate revenues, the first quarter came in pretty much as we had anticipated, with an organic growth rate of about 40%, thanks largely to our new rate card. We're holding firm on our expectations for affiliate revenue growth for the full year as we noted in the press release.
On the cost side, we've called out one-time expenses that were incurred during the quarter to support our affiliate renewals and our integration of the Travel Channel. The affiliate marketing and legal expenses of $11 million are all now behind us, since those activities occurred largely in January. And a large percentage of the Travel transition costs were also incurred during the first quarter.
We're now expecting Travel transition costs for the full year to end up near the lower end of the $30 million to $40 million range that we've provided in March. Much of the remaining Travel transition costs will be incurred in the second quarter. And as a result, we've lowered the full year range for non-programming expenses from our previous guidance.
Total operating expenses at our Lifestyle Media segment were up 47% during the quarter, and much of this increase is due to the addition of the Travel Channel and these one-time items. But as planned, we've also taken advantage of our very strong ad and affiliate revenue growth to restore some of our marketing budgets. You'll remember that we spent considerably less money on marketing during the first quarter last year because of the recession, which, of course, makes the increase in spending this year appear a bit outsized. 
Some timing issues also had an impact. We launched targeted marketing campaigns during the first quarter to promote the Worst Cooks special event at Food Network and the popular Holmes on Homes series at HGTV. The results were right on target. Worst Cooks in America performed superbly for us, averaging 1.0 rating among adults 25 to 54. We also improved the audience delivery for its timeslot by 51% over the prior year.
Holmes on Homes, meanwhile, has become one of HGTV's breakout hit for the year. During the height of the marketing campaign, which ended in March, the show's audience was up about 30% compared with the prior four-week period. This marketing money was well spent, we believe.
Turning to other items, let me add a little color on our capital spending. We're putting the finishing touches on a facility expansion in Knoxville. And we included the CapEx related to the Travel integration in our full year guidance. Our apologies, by the way. There was a typo in the release. The non-recurring cost for our operating facility expansion for the year will be about $35 million, not $9 million as it's stated in the release. Once these items go away, we're expecting a normalized CapEx run rate of $50 million to $60 million starting in 2011.
And finally, one balance sheet item. We finished the first quarter with about $320 million in cash. Our plan for now is to maintain a strong cash position and the flexibility that it will afford us to act on opportunities in the marketplace and to meet our future obligations. 
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.

House Hunters has been a perennial success story, breakout hit for HGTV. It has for over 10 years and continues to do so. Of course, we've expanded the genre now to include House Hunters International. And the positioning of it on the schedule allows us to put new series on the back end of it to introduce the audience to those series. And so what we're seeing is the success of new series such as Holmes on Homes and Selling New York. And even our First-Time Home Buyers' block have all benefited from the boost of audience that House Hunters creates. So think of House Hunters as really a catalyst on our schedule, creating an opportunity for us to create and grow new franchises. And the team at HGTV has done a terrific job over the last years and making that really pay off for them, particularly with Holmes on Homes, which saw a 30% growth year-over-year in the time period in the first quarter with the introduction of the new season. In terms of Travel, we took over the ad sales, as we said earlier, at the end of March. And I guess the way we think about it is in our portfolio, Travel Channel is one of our three crown jewels. It will get all of the attention, if not even a little more attention, since it's a bit of a start-up for us as a Food Network or an HGTV. It's not anything short of a top priority for us. We promoted one of our young stars in the Ad Sales department, Greg Regis, to manage the Ad Sales group. We made some terrific hires for the Ad Sales team. We've effectively created an entire Ad Sales team dedicated to the success of Travel Channel. And I can tell you this, in the first quarter, prior to us taking it over, the DR [depositary receipt] component of Travel Channel was upwards of 30% and the DR component of Travel under this, our Ad Sales team will be something closer to the mid-single digits as we're pushing much, much more aggressively in the scatter. And we'll be pushing more aggressively in the upfront marketplace.

And that is continuing to improve week-to-week. So barring something unforeseen, we anticipate there being a significant improvement in the upfront marketplace, simply because the advertisers are paying such a premium right now to get into the scatter marketplace. And we believe that will translate into volume growth for the cable industry in the upfront upwards of 20%. And in terms of Scripps Networks, I would anticipate our CPM growth in the upcoming upfront would be in the mid- to high singles, leaning towards the high singles.

We're certainly very proud of our Ad Sales team to deliver 14% growth. And you make a very good point.

Because in many cases, our audiences look at the advertising as part of the programming. It helps complete the cycle, if you will, of the inspiration the programming creates. And then the advertising provides a place for an audience to make good on that inspiration. But also going along with that, we invested somewhat in programming and marketing this year as was noted in our earlier prepared remarks. And we also pushed forward our advertising guarantees, our ratings guarantees. We bet on the upside based on that investment in programming and marketing. And thankfully, the ratings came in and met those higher and more aggressive ratings guarantees.

So the most recent series, including Food Wars is now -- those are now the last of the 2010 slate coming out of '09.

As always, we clearly appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
The second quarter and first half of the year were outstanding for the company and its shareholders by just about every measure. Here are the headlines: Industry-leading ad revenue growth; exceptionally strong growth in affiliate fee revenues; solid viewership at all our networks, including the new Cooking Channel; and very encouraging performance at Travel Channel, which is now pretty much integrated and I'm happy to report exceeding our expectations. All these factors contributed to the positive operating results that we reported this morning. We're right on track for an excellent 2010 and prospects for 2011 are looking very good as well.
With the tremendous popularity of the Food Network, steady viewership at HGTV and growing appeal of the Travel Channel, we've been able to take full advantage of the current ad recovery. The strength of the current scatter marketplace drove ad sales higher during the quarter and contributed to the decisive success that we've had in this year's upfront. We finished the upfront at or near the top of cable and pricing, and we grew total volumes sold well beyond last year's level. Provided the economy holds, this strong upfront bodes well for ad sales in the coming year. 
As for our affiliate fee revenues, the strong growth in the second quarter and first half of the year is directly attributable to the improved carriage agreements that we negotiated for Food Network and HGTV at the end of 2009. Our new distribution contracts reflect the value that we've created at our networks, and importantly, layer in a dependable source of revenue growth for years to come. So all in all, very positive operating results for the second quarter and first half.
There were other highlights during the quarter as well, not the least of which was the launch and initial success of the Cooking Channel. Our newest brand really surged out of the box with its debut Memorial Day weekend and has continued to gain momentum, both  in terms of viewership and its acceptance as a variable advertising platform. Compared with Fine Living, Cooking Channel viewership among adults 25 to 54 is up anywhere from 30% to 100% depending on the daypart. Cooking resonated with their advertisers from the day we started selling it. And as for programming, well, we've succeeded in differentiating the Cooking Channel from its sister network by filling out its schedule with a healthy mix of new and archived shows. And we're featuring fresh, new talent and we're giving the network a unique look and feel. I hope you've had a chance to see it.
We've also succeeded in converting all of Fine Living's 58 million households to the Cooking Channel brand, which makes Cooking the most widely distributed launch of a new network in the history of cable and satellite television. No small accomplishment there, I should say. And we're very encouraged by Cooking Channel's performance in the early going, especially considering the modest investment we made to bring this brand quickly to market.
Now the news is equally as good at the Travel Channel. For the most part, the network has been fully integrated, which puts us in an excellent position to market the brand in the upfront. We quickly and successfully expanded Travel's advertising base by really putting together a top-notch ad sales team, by leveraging our relationships and actively cross promoting the brand across all of our networks. Now that's resulted in a higher percentage of top-tier advertisers in a broader range of categories. So our success is evident both onscreen and in our operating results.
On the programming front, viewership at Travel Channel grew solidly during the second quarter, thanks to the standouts like Man v. Food with Adam Richman and Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. Speaking of Anthony, we have some very good news about him during the quarter. We signed a new talent agreement, which means you'll be seeing Anthony on the Travel Channel for some time to come. We think that's very good news for us, for Anthony and certainly for his many, many fans. And there's more. Laureen Ong has been busy building her team and molding a programming and marketing strategy, that's destined to transform the Travel Channel brand and build audiences. Now you'll start seeing some of their handiwork in the months to come. So stay tuned there. 
Food Network, meanwhile, continues on a roll. Food now ranks consistently among the top 10 most watched networks in cable among adults 25 to 54. For example, during one week in June, the Food Network made it in the top five on the strength of the season's premiere of Next Food Network Star. It was the highest rated premiere of a new series in the network's history. And it helped us successfully launch a couple of news shows like Cupcake Wars and Food Feuds both of which have been doing very, very well.
Making good on our promise to be a leading source of entertaining and informative content for food fanatics everywhere. Food Network, Cooking Channel, the Food Network Magazine and our growing portfolio of interactive businesses gives us a stable of desirable content platforms in the Food category. Internationally, Food Network is proving to be a hit in the U.K., where we reached about 10 million viewers via Sky. And since its launch last November, Food Network has rapidly become a formidable competitor to food channels that have been established in the U.K. market for a number of years. We're really creating a whole new cadre of Food Network fans.
A word about the Food Network Magazine. Circulation has reached about 1.3 million. And perhaps more importantly, it's now profitable. That's a full two years ahead of when we expected it to be in the black. It's truly a testament of the power of the Food Network brand and the intense consumer interest in food as a content category. Well, we hats off to our partners at Hearst, who have done a fantastic job of establishing Food Network Magazine as a newsstand staple. 
At HGTV, second quarter viewership among adults 25 to 54 moved up three notches in the ranking from 16th to 13th. The improvement came on the strength of Design Star, which proved its worth once again by lifting overall viewership of the network and serving really as a great lead-in to new store shows. Color Splash Miami, which we schedule to follow Design Star on Sunday nights has also done very well. Holmes on Homes, House Hunters and House Hunters International also continued to deliver solid audiences. 
Also in the Home category, weekend ratings at DIY Network grew solidly during the second quarter, especially among men who tune in to watch shows like Cool Tools, Man Caves and Garage Mahal. For DIY, weekends are primetime. And adult men 25 to 54 is the demographic advertisers value during those dayparts.
Online, our Lifestyle Media websites continue to be leaders in their respective content categories, aggregating large and growing communities of users. Our websites and growing list of interactive mobile applications deliver useful information and solution-based content that makes them desirable destinations. At hgtv.com, we've been focusing on creating innovative online tools and applications using designer portfolio and Rate My Space. As a result, we've seen substantial growth in some user metrics. For all of our Home category sites combined for example, page views in June were up 38% compared with the prior year.
In addition, the free HGTV To Go application we created for the iPad and iPhone generated 14,000 downloads on each device in the first two weeks after it was launched in June. Our objective is to deliver our brand of lifestyle content via whatever interactive platform consumers choose. 
And finally at Shopzilla, our efforts to competitively reposition the business are really beginning to bear some fruit. The all-important metric of direct leads to merchants continued to grow during the second quarter, which tells us that we've made some progress differentiating the brand from other online comparison shopping businesses and improving the online shopping experience for consumers. 
Put it all together, and you have a media company that's really hitting on all cylinders, led by industry-leading ad and affiliate revenue growth, solid viewership at all our brands, which actively engaged upscale audiences in the lucrative Home, Food and Travel content categories, our growing international presence and positive signs that we're turning the corner at our Online Comparison Shopping businesses. Scripps Networks Interactive is well positioned for growth and is committed to continuing to create value for our shareholders. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Joe."

I'm sure you've all seen the press release by now this morning. So I won't go over the second quarter results in detail. Instead, I'll hit on some of the highlights and provide a little more color on some of the dynamics that drove the quarter. 
First on advertising. The continuing recovery in advertising has had its obvious positive effect. The scatter marketplace continued to be very strong during the three-month period, as it has been for most of the year so far. Scatter versus scatter pricing continues to be up in the mid to high teens over 2009, and scatter versus last year's upfront was up as much as 25% to 30%. As I'm sure you know, the strength in scatter found its way into this year's upfront for both broadcast and cable. 
For Scripps Networks, that translated into solid growth in CPM pricing and a 30% increase in volume compared to last year. Given the strength of the market, we committed a bit more inventory than last year, which puts our upfront sell-out rate at just north of 50% across all our brands. We went into the upfront with lots of momentum including growth in viewership at all our networks, high expectations and considerable buzz around the launch of the Cooking Channel, and a clear opportunity to expand the advertising base at the Travel Channel. 
As far as we can determine, once all is said and done, we came out of the upfront at or near the top of our competitive set once again. As a result, the outlook for advertising for the balance of the year and for most of 2011 looks positive, provided the economy continues to improve. The only negative for advertising in the second quarter has since turned positive. The growth rate for digital advertisings slowed to about 3%, which we take to be a continuing effect of the housing downturn at our home-related websites. The good news is that we've seen a marked improvement in digital ad sales during the past six weeks.
Turning to our affiliate revenues. The exceptionally strong growth is largely a function of the new contracts we negotiated for Food Network and for HGTV. Growth in distribution at all of our networks also contributed however. Remember that our new contracts provided for a significant step up in rates in the first year for a significant portion of our distribution base, particularly for Food Network. Growth in affiliate revenues, while meaningful for the balance of the contracts will moderate from current year's outsized increases starting in 2011. 
One other highlight from the income statement worth noting is the strong performance and strong improvement in equity earnings from affiliates. The 43% growth rate reflects the improved advertising market in Canada and the growing contribution from Food Network Magazine, which as Ken noted, is profitable two years ahead of schedule. 
Excluding the effects of the Travel Channel acquisition, our consolidated margins expanded by about 170 basis points during the quarter. The margin improved despite our need to restore our marketing budget this year to support all our brands. Our programming costs have also been higher, due to some seasonally heavy write-downs relative to last year and accelerated amortization costs that were related to our Cooking Channel rebranding and launch.
We expect programming expenses to moderate for the balance of the year, now that the rebranding is complete. Programming costs are still expected to fall within the range we've provided previously. Non-programming costs, including the restored marketing budgets, were higher during the second quarter and first half of the year. But we expect those expenses to moderate during the back half as well. As a result, we now expect full year non-programming cost to fall closer to the lower end of our guidance. 
As for the Travel Channel integration, we're pretty much complete. Through the first half of the year, we've incurred about $24 million in onetime transition cost, most of which were related to the termination of operating agreements that the network had with Discovery. We still have a little more work to do, so some additional transition costs will fall in the back half of the year. We still expect the onetime integration cost to finish the year toward the lower end of our $30 million to $40 million guidance range.
The good news is that Travel Channel results year-to-date are exceeding our expectations. And the acquisition will be decisively accretive this year, both to segment profit and earnings per share. 
Finally, as we noted in the press release, our net income of $0.63 included a tax benefit in discontinued operations and the onetime transition cost for Travel. Our adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, after backing up both of those items. 
Our balance sheet continues to be strong. We finished the quarter with $331 million in cash and the $884 million in long-term debt we incurred last year to complete the acquisition of our controlling interest in the Travel Channel. That debt has a five-year term, so we won't have any obligations other than interest payments for the next four-plus years. 
In the near term, we'll be using our cash for the continued development of our network brands and related businesses and to support our international expansion efforts. Our preference is to create value for shareholders by strengthening our competitive position as a leader in lifestyle programming and content. 
With that, operator, we're ready to take any questions."

But as long as HGTV and Food Network, Travel, DIY, Cooking Channel and GAC are delivering, the audience are delivering, I think we stand in good stead to continue to grow our share of the pie."

Well, for instance, the rebranding of Fine Living to Cooking Channel was a great opportunity in the upfront to bring in some significant new dollars. In fact, our sales teams were successful in bringing nine advertisers in at $1 million or more for the new network, Cooking Channel, and that was only 30 days after its launch. So that was part of the success story. And the volume growth on Cooking in the upfront over Fine Living is nearly 90%. Of course, Travel Channel, I discussed it earlier. But it allowed us to bring in a number of really solid advertisers that otherwise were not represented on Travel Channel. The CPG category particularly was underrepresented on Travel Channel, and we were able to bring a significant amount of that to bear. And then the strength overall of DIY and HGTV and the Home category and what we perceive to be the slowly improving Home category overall, albeit somewhat bumpy, we still see advertisers, the major advertisers betting on the future there again, and we're benefiting from that as well. So all in all, our growth, I think Joe mentioned in his commentary, in volume in this year's upfront was 30%. The cable marketplace overall grew 18%. And we're able to create that volume growth almost entirely on new business, new advertisers and rating points. We took a very slightly bit more of inventory into the marketplace, 2% to 3%. But mostly the volume growth is tied to ratings and the expansion of advertisers into some of our newer products like Travel and Cooking."

Start with the advertising question, great question, one we think about a lot here. Of course, when you think about our digital assets hgtv.com, foodnetwork.com, those are two of the leading websites in the world in the home and food categories. In our approach in advertising in upwards of 20% to 30% of our businesses is a complete full circle of linear transforming to non-linear digital advertising that completes the circle, completes the loop if you will for the advertiser to bring in audience from the point of inspiration on TV, to the point of action online or to take action online. Including, in some cases, right down to the transaction in terms of the marketplace section of hgtv.com. But it's an evolving puzzle. It gets more interesting every day. We're introducing some interesting iPad and iPhone apps. And we'll be, in the fall, be introducing a page subscription app for iPad on Food Network and experimenting in driving revenue through the subscription side of the business as well. But we think we have a distinctive advantage with these categories. The way we think about it is that the degree to which we focus, and focus on our consumers within these categories and understand where our consumers are headed and how they're using various devices and how they're using our information for the betterment in the Home and Food category. Then we can stay a step ahead of them by focusing intently on consumer behavior within our categories. To us, that's actually our core competency as a business. We pay a lot of attention to it. In terms of travel over-indexing on hi-def, it's something that we came to understand after acquiring the network. I think, obviously, it's such a well-produced network in so many ways and the visual effects of series like No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain as an example. I think this helps drive the HD usage. And we've seen an expansion of HD for us on DirectTV recently to improve our overall percentage of HD as a result."

Similarly, we do that with Food and HGTV, and our ad sales teams are developing specific advertising products that fit well in the Travel category that are attractive to the vertical advertisers that we have. The reputation for really delivering for them.

Ass always, we truly appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. The second quarter and first half of the year were outstanding for the company and its shareholders by just about every measure.
Here are the headlines: Industry-leading ad revenue growth; exceptionally strong growth in affiliate fee revenues; solid viewership at all our networks, including the new Cooking Channel, and very encouraging performance at Travel Channel, which is now pretty much integrated, and I'm happy to report, exceeding our expectations.
All these factors contributed to the positive operating results that we reported this morning. We're right on track for an excellent 2010, and prospects for 2011 are looking very good as well. With the tremendous popularity of the Food Network, steady viewership at HGTV and growing appeal of the Travel Channel, we've been able to take full advantage of the current ad recovery.
The strength of the current scatter marketplace drove ad sales higher during the quarter and contributed to the decisive success that we had in this year's upfront. We finished the upfront at or near the top of cable and pricing, and we grew total volume sold well beyond last year's level. Provided the economy holds, the strong upfront bodes well for ad sales in the coming year.
As for our affiliate fee revenues, the strong growth in the second quarter and first half of the year is directly attributable to the improved carriage agreements that we negotiated for Food Network and HGTV at the end of 2009. Our new distribution contracts reflect the value that we've created at our networks, and importantly, layer in a dependable source of revenue growth for years to come. So all-in-all, very positive operating results for the second quarter and first half.
There were other highlights during the quarter as well, not the least of which was the large and initial success of the Cooking Channel. Our newest brand really surged out of the box with its debut, Memorial Day weekend, and has continued to gain momentum, both in terms of viewership and it's acceptance as a valuable advertising platform.
Compared with Fine Living, Cooking Channel viewership among adults 25-54 is up anywhere from 30% to 100% depending on the day-part. Cooking resonated with our advertisers from the day we started selling it. And as for programming, well, we've succeeded in differentiating the Cooking Channel from its sister network by filling out the schedule with a healthy mix of new and archive shows. And we're featuring fresh new talent and we're giving the network a unique look and feel. I hope you've had a chance to see it.
We've also succeeded in converting all of Fine Living's 58 million households to the Cooking Channel brand, which makes Cooking, the most widely distributed launch of a new network in the history of cable and satellite television. No small accomplishment there I should say. And we're very encouraged by Cooking Channel's performance in the early going, especially considering the modest investment we made to bring this brand quickly to market.
Now the news is equally as good at the Travel Channel. For the most part, the network has been fully integrated, which puts us in an excellent position to market the brand in the upfront. We quickly and successfully expanded Travel's advertising base by really putting together a top notch ad sales team by leveraging our relationships and actively cross-promoting the brand across all of our networks. Now that's resulted in a higher percentage of top tier advertisers in a broader range of categories. So our success is evident both on screen and in our operating results.
On the programming front, viewership of Travel Channel grew solidly during the second quarter, thanks to the standouts like Man v. Food with Adam Richman, and Anthony Bourdain's, No Reservations. Speaking of Anthony, we have some very good news about him during the quarter. We signed a new talent agreement, which means you'll be seeing Anthony on the Travel Channel for some time to come. We think that's very good news for us, for Anthony, and certainly for his many, many fans. And there's more; Laureen Ong's been busy building her team and molding a programming and marketing strategy that's destined to transform the Travel Channel brand and build audiences. You'll start seeing some of their handiwork in the months to come, so stay tuned there.
Food Network meanwhile continue on a roll. Food now ranks consistently among the top-ten most watched networks in cable among adults 25-54. For example, during one week in June, Food Network made it into the top five on the strength of the season premiere of The Next Food Network Star. It was the highest rated premiere of a new series in the network's history, and it helped to successfully launch a couple of new shows like Cupcake Wars and (inaudible), both of which have been doing very, very well, making good on our promise to be a leading source of entertaining and informative content for food fanatics everywhere.
Food Network Cooking Channel, the Food Network Magazine and our growing portfolio of interactive businesses, give us a stable of desirable content platforms in the food category. Internationally, Food Network is proving to be a hit in the U.K. where we reach about 10 million viewers via Sky. And since its launch last November, Food Network has rapidly become a formidable competitor to food channels that have been established in the U.K. market for a number of years. We're really creating a whole new cadre of Food Network fans.
A word about the Food Network Magazine. Circulation has reached about 1.3 million. And perhaps more importantly, it's now profitable. Now that's a full two years ahead of when we expected it to be in the black. That's really a testament to the power of the Food Network brand and the intense consumer interest in food as a content category.
We have software partners at Hurst who have done a fantastic job of establishing Food Network Magazine as a new staple. At HGTV second quarter viewership among adults 25-54 moved up three notches in the ranking from 16th to 13th. The improvement came on the strength of Design Star which proved its worth once again by lifting overall viewership of the network and serving really as a great lead-in to new shows.
Color Splash: Miami, which we scheduled to follow Design Star on Sunday nights, has also done very well. Holmes on Homes, House Hunters and House Hunters International also continued to deliver solid audiences. Also in the home category, weekend ratings at DIY Network grew solidly during the second quarter, especially among men who tune in to watch shows like Cool Tools, Man Caves and Garage Mahal.
For DIY, weekends are prime time, and adult men 25-54 is the demographic advertiser's value during those day-parts. Online, our Lifestyle Media websites continue to be leaders in their respective content categories, aggregating large and growing communities of users. Our websites and growing list of interactive mobile applications deliver useful information and solution-based content that makes them desirable destinations.
At HGTV.com we've been focusing on creating innovative online tools and applications using designer portfolio and Rate My Space. As a result, we've seen substantial growth in some user metrics. For all our home category sites combined for example, page views in June were up 38% compared with the prior year.
In addition the free HGTV to-go application we created for the iPad and iPhone generated 14,000 downloads on each device in the first two weeks after it was launched in June. Our objective is to deliver our brand of lifestyle content via whatever interactive platform consumers choose.
And finally at Shopzilla our efforts to competitively reposition the business are really beginning to bear some fruit. The all-important metric of direct leads to merchants continue to grow during the second quarter, which tells us that we've made some progress differentiating the brand from other online comparison shopping businesses and improving the online shopping experience for consumers.
Put it all together, and you have a media company that's really hitting on all cylinders led by industry-leading ad and affiliate revenue growth, solid viewership at all our brands which actively engage upscale audiences in the lucrative home, food and travel content categories, our growing international presence, and positive signs that we're turning the corner at our online comparison shopping businesses.
Scripps Networks Interactive is well positioned for growth and is committed for continuing to create value for our shareholders.
With that, let me now turn it over to Joe.

I'm sure you've all seen the press release by now this morning, so I won't go over the second quarter results in detail. Instead, I'll hit on some of the highlights and provide a little more color on some of the dyn",909,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning everyone. I'm sure you've all seen the press release by now this morning, so I won't go over the second quarter results in detail. Instead, I'll hit on some of the highlights and provide a little more color on some of the dynamics that drove the quarter.
First, on advertising. The continuing recovery in advertising has had its obvious positive effect. The scatter marketplace continued to be very strong during the three-month period as it has been for most of the year so far. Scatter versus scatter pricing continues to be up in the mid to high teens over 2009, and scatter versus last year is up as much as 25% to 30%.
As I'm sure you know, the strength in scatter found its way into this year's upfront for both broadcast and cable. For Scripps Networks, that translated into solid growth in CPM pricing, and had 30% increase in volume compared to last year.
Given the strength of the market, we committed a bit more inventory than last year, which puts up upfront sell-out rate at just north of 50% across all our brands. We went into the upfront with lots of momentum including growth in viewership at all our networks, high expectations and considerable buzz around the launch of the Cooking Channel and a clear opportunity to expand the advertising base at the Travel Channel.
As far as we can determine, once all is said and done, we came out of the upfront at or near the top of our competitive set once again. As a result, the outlook for advertising for the balance of the year and for most of 2011 looks positive provided the economy continues to improve.
The only negative for advertising in the second quarter has since turned positive, the growth rate for digital advertising slowed to about 3%, which we take to be a continuing effect of the housing downturn on our home related websites. The good news is that we've seen a marked improvement in digital ad sales during the past six weeks.
Turning to our full year revenues, the exceptionally strong growth is largely a function of the new contract negotiated for Food Network and HGTV. Growth and distribution in all of our networks also contributed however. Remembering that our new contracts provided for a significant step up in rates in the first year for a significant portion of our distribution base, particularly for Food Network. Growth and affiliate revenues while meaningful for the balance of the contracts will moderate from current year's outsized increases starting in 2011.
One other highlight from the income statement worth noting is the strong improvement in equity earnings from affiliates. 43% growth rate reflects the improved advertising market in Canada and a growing contribution from Food Network Magazine, which as Ken noted as profitable ahead of schedule.
Excluding the impact of the Travel Channel acquisition, our consolidated margins expanded by about 170 basis points during the quarter. The margin improved despite our need to restore marketing budget this year to support all of brands. Our programming costs have also been higher due to some seasonally heavy write downs relative to last year. And accelerated amortization costs that were related to our Cooking Channel re-branding and launch.
We expect programming expenses to moderate for the balance of the year, now that the re-branding is complete. Programming costs are still expected to fall within the range we provided previously. Non-programming costs including the restoring marketing budgets were higher during the second quarter and first half of the year, but we expect those expenses to moderate during the back half as well. As a result, we now expect full-year non-programming costs to fall closer to the lower end of our guidance.
As for the Travel Channel integration, we're pretty much complete. Through the first half of the year, we've incurred about $24 million in one-time transition costs, mostly which were related to the termination of operating agreements that the network had with Discovery.
We still have a little more work to do, so some additional transition costs will fall in the back half of the year. We still expect the one-time integration cost to finish the year to the lower end of our $30 million to $40 million guidance range.
The good news is that Travel Channel's results year-to-date are exceeding our expectations and the acquisition will be decidedly accretive this year; both the segment profit and earning per share.
Finally, as we noted in the press release, our net income of $0.63 included a tax benefit in discontinued operations and the one-time transition cost for Travel. Our adjusted net-income was $0.59 per share after backing on both of those items.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong, we finished the quarter with $331 million in cash and the $844 million in long term debt we incurred last year to complete the acquisition of our controlling interest in the travel channel; that debt has a five year term so we won't have any obligations other than interest payments for the next four plus year.
In the near term, we will be using our cash for the continued development of our network brands and related businesses and to support our international expansion efforts. Our preference is to create value for shareholders by strengthening our competitive position as a leader in lifestyle programming and content.
With that operator, we're ready to take any questions.

Well, re-branding of Fine Living to Cooking Channel was a great opportunity in the upfront to bring in some significant new dollars. In fact, our sales teams were successful in bringing nine advertisers in at $1 million or more for the new network Cooking Channel, and that was only 30 days after its launch. So that was part of the success story. And the volume growth on Cooking in the upfront over Fine Living is nearly 90%.
Of course, Travel Channel I discussed earlier, but it allowed us to bring in a number of really solid advertisers that otherwise were not representing on Travel Channel. The CPG category particularly was under-represented on Travel Channel. And we were able to bring a significant amount of that to bear.
And then the strength overall of DIY and HGTV in the home category, we perceive to be a slowly improving home category overall, albeit somewhat bumpy is, we still see the major advertisers betting on the future there again, and we're benefiting from that as well. So all-in-all, our growth, I think Joe mentioned in his commentary, in volume in this year's upfront was 30%. The cable marketplace overall grew 18%.
And we were able to create that volume growth, almost entirely new business, new advertisers and rating points. We took a very slightly bit more of inventory into the marketplace of 2% to 3%, but mostly the volume growth is tied to ratings and the expansion of advertisers into some of our newer products like Travel and Cooking.

Let's start with the advertising question. Great question, and which we think about a lot here. Of course, when you think about our digital assets, HGTV.com, foodnetwork.com, those are two of the leading websites in the world in the home and food categories.
And our approach, in advertising in upwards of 20% to 30% of our business is a complete full circle of linear transforming to non-linear digital advertising that completes the circle, completes the loop if you will for the advertiser to bring an audience from the point of inspiration on TV to the point of action online or to take action online, including in some cases, right down to the transaction in terms of the marketplace section of HGTV.com.
But it's an evolving puzzle, it gets more interesting everyday. We're introducing some interesting iPad and iPhone apps, and will be in the fall be introducing a paid subscription app for iPad through network, and experimenting and driving revenue through the subscription side of the business as well.
But we think we have a distinctive advantage with these categories. The way we think about it is that the degree to which we focus and focus on our consumers within these categories and understand where our consumers are headed and how they're using various devices and how they're using our information for the betterment in the home and food categories, then we can stay a step ahead of them by focusing intently on consumer behavior within our categories. To us, that's actually our core competency as a business, and we pay a lot of attention to it.
In terms of Travel over-indexing on high-def, it's something that we came to understand after acquiring the network. I think obviously, it's such a well-produced network in so many ways, and the visual effects of series like No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain as an example I think just helps drive the HD usage. And we've seen an expansion of HD for us on DIRECTV recently to improve our overall percentage of HD as a result.

To Ken's point of driving rating today, we saw 26% growth in primetime 25, 54 adult impressions coming out of July. So it's one of the fastest growing networks today based on our ability to cross-promote the network and Laureen Ong and her team driving success there everyday.
And then our ad sales team is doing what they do with HGTV and Food and we're selling something beyond just the access to commercial pods. But rather we're selling a relationship with the category. Similarly, we do that with Food and HGTV and our ad sales teams are developing specific advertising products that fit well in the Travel category that are attractive to the vertical advertises that we have the reputation for really delivering for them.
And then Travel also is working on developing its website so that we can complete that 360 experience as we do in the Home and Food category to really help support our CPMs. And create, in essence, at the end of the day create a much more highly qualified audience, more up scale, younger and more intentional about buying products within the network itself.

I think the most important thing for us to do is to get our programming there get the brand known there and get the distribution as soon as possible.

Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
The third quarter was outstanding, outstanding for the company and shareholders by just about every measure. Suffice it to say, the company was truly hitting on all cylinders during the three-month period. Let me give you some of the headlines. Industry-leading ad revenue growth; strong double-digit growth in affiliate fees tied, of course, to the new contracts we negotiated last year; leading competitive edge performance by our flagship networks, HGTV and Food Network; outstanding results at our two newest networks, Travel and Cooking, which are rapidly building larger audiences and expanding their base of advertisers; and importantly, a solid contribution from our online comparison shopping businesses, which reached an inflection point during the quarter and are once again beating prior-year numbers. So all in all, an excellent quarter for the company and the shareholders, and I'm happy to report that strong performance has continued right into the current quarter.
On the fundamental level, the basis of our strong growth is our focus in ownership of the Home, Food and Travel Lifestyle categories, and our expertise in engaging audiences that our advertisers absolutely desire. These are truly powerful, powerful brands. In fact, Nielsen recently ranked HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel and DIY Network among the top 10 for aggregating upscale viewers. Now in my mind, that goes a long way in explaining our success. At Travel Channel, the audience continues to grow by leaps and bounds and our ad sales team has truly hit the ground running, significantly expanding our growing list of national advertisers at Travel.
Inventory sold as direct response advertising, which started out at about 30% of total sales when we acquired the network, is now down in the mid to high teens. Now there was a lot of low-hanging fruit to be had, and we picked it. We think Travel Channel is right on track. We're leveraging the popularity of our key talent, including Adam Richman, Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern or the three As as we've come to call them, to new heights. And I can tell you that the outstanding management team at Travel is working on some very promising concepts that are currently on the pipeline we've got a lot of hope for. You'll start to see their handy work in the months to come, so stay tuned to the Travel Channel.
Turning over to the Cooking Channel, our decision to re-brand Fine Living was clearly the right thing to do. Viewership among adults 25 to 54 at Cooking has surged forward, up as much as 100% at some day parts compared with Fine Living a year ago. As we said last quarter, advertisers responded positively to the new network as well, a fact that's evident in Cooking's third quarter performance. Cooking gives us added exposure to the tremendously popular food genre in television, which as you know, we defined really by transforming the Food Network. Now we've taken great care to differentiate Cooking from Food, using the platform as an opportunity to really take a deeper dive into the genre and super serve those avid foodies out there. Cooking also gives us more flexibility in serving advertisers who want to capitalize on the popularity of food programming on TV. So far, I'd to have say that Cooking Channel has been a big win for us and our shareholders, and I hope you've had a chance to check it out.
Meanwhile, the Food Network continues to charge ahead. Despite daunting year-over-year comparisons, total household viewership held firm in the prime time during third quarter. In September, prime time viewership among all adults 25 to 54 was up 4%. Prime time viewership among women in the same age group was up 3%. The solid viewership at Food Network is attributable in no small part to the enduring popularity of shows like Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and great theatrical[ph] events like The Next Food Network Star. Speaking of which, this year's winner, Aarti Sequeira, and her new show, Aarti Party, by the way, had been instant daytime hit, proving once again our ability to identify and nurture great talent at the Food Network. The power of Food Network is also evident to the growing list of ancillary businesses that we're creating around this powerful brand. The Food Network Magazine, already profitable two years ahead of schedule, was designated as the best-selling newsstand culinary title during the quarter, and while incidentally, Bobby Flay and Alton Brown both have books on the New York Times Best-Seller List as we speak. We've had the sports concessions at high-profile locations like the premium Gridiron and Touchdown Clubs at the Meadowlands.
Plus we've introduced Food Network-branded menus that are being used in the suites of the new Meadowlands Stadium as well as other NFL venues, including Cleveland, Buffalo and Chicago. And if that isn't enough, our partnership with Coles continues to reap rewards with sales of Food Network-branded kitchenware outpacing our expectations for the year. It's no wonder women in cable chose this year to make Food Network President Brooke Johnson Woman of the Year. Congratulations, Brooke. It's a well-deserved honor and all of us is so very, very proud of you.
Food Network is truly on fire, and we're finding creative and profitable opportunities to expand the brand. Of course, our success story all began with HGTV, Home and Garden Television. The original Scripps Network, HGTV, dominates the home category on television and is regularly ranked as the number one network among high-income women viewers. Total day viewership at HGTV grew 5% during the third quarter, and on weekends, our audience was up a healthy 6%.
In prime time, HGTV maintained the sloppy status as a 1.0-rated network, aggregating an average of nearly 1 million television households a night during the period. September, by the way, was the network's best month ever for total day viewership. Let there be no doubt, HGTV is a power brand on television, and along with the DIY Network, we own this lucrative home category. We're building on that competitive edge with great new specials like the HGTV Urban Oasis Giveaway and Secrets From a Stylist, featuring Emily Henderson, winner of this year's HGTV Design Star.
Now are our first-ever Urban Oasis winner is going to be announced during the special on November 20, and that lucky person will walk away with $1.5 million in prices, including a brand-new Acura and a luxury high-rise apartment in downtown Manhattan, which is designed by our very own Vern Yip, by the way. A lot of good things in the pipeline for HGTV, and like I said, this is our category. We defined it, we own it and we intend to keep it growing.
And finally, a word about Shopzilla, and this is really a great story. We've been working on building a sustainable business model at Shopzilla for sometime now, and I'm happy to report that we've reached that important point where quarterly results have begun to improve over the prior year periods. Now this is no small feat, and a lot of credit is due to our creative and very hard-working team out in Santa Monica. We successfully repositioned the business, and we set the table for future growth through both differentiation and diversification.
The U.S. business is on course to return to double-digit revenue growth in Q4 as a result of increased consumer visitation and increased revenue yield as the company continues to strengthen its relationship with both consumers and advertisers. And in Europe, Shopzilla's presence continues to grow at a very, very healthy pace. In fact, we are now the number one comparison shopping network in both the U.K. and in France, and that's according to comScore. Our brands, BizRate, Shopzilla, Beso and the new, just last month, Tada, collectively are among the world's leading online comparison shopping destinations, competing effectively with the likes of Google and Yahoo! Again, no small feat.
So there you have it. Scripps Networks Interactive, one of America's leading media companies, and we're hitting our stride, delivering on our commitment to create value for our shareholders. Quite a quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Joe to drill down into the numbers. Joe?"

I'm sure you've seen our press release by now, so as is our custom, I won't got over the numbers in detail. I'm going to focus my remarks on third quarter highlights and provide some color on what drove these very positive results. 
Starting with the consolidated view, here are the deadlines: Revenues was up 40% and up 22% excluding Travel. Total segment profit was up 55%, and as a result, net income attributable to the company and the shareholders grew 56% to $0.61 per share or $0.59 on a normalized basis. EPS for the quarter includes a favorable tax adjustment that added $0.03 per share, and it includes a $0.01 reduction for Travel Channel transition costs that fell into that period. The transition costs year-to-date stand at about $28 million. For the full year, we still expect this to be at the low end of the $30 million to $40 million range we forecasted. 
Key revenue drivers for the quarter were strong advertising sales, up 34% as reported and up 19% excluding the Travel Channel, a robust 72% growth in affiliate fee revenues, which was up 40% ex-Travel, and 7% growth in referral fees and other revenues from our online comparison shopping businesses. Advertising sales during the period benefited from the healthy scatter advertising market combined with the success we've had monetizing the audience growth at all of our networks. Scatter pricing during the quarter was up mid to high teens over the prior-year period and up 25% to 30% above 2009, upfront pricing.
Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, scatter pricing continues to be strong, up mid teens over the prior year and up low to mid-20s over the most recent upfront. We're seeing strength in nearly every advertising category with food, consumer packaged goods and retail leading the charge. The recovery in automotive and financials is also contributing to our improved ad sales.
The growth in affiliate revenues reflects the success we had late last year in negotiating new carriage agreements for HGTV and Food. Expanded distribution at all of our networks also contributed, the Food Network topping 100 million U.S. households for the first time and HGTV very close to the same. Distribution of our premium tier channels also grew during the period, with the new Cooking Channel leading the way, up 4.3% from Fine Living's footprint of a year ago. Cooking now passes a very respectable 58 million households. GAC, by the way, is quickly approaching the 60 million household mark.
Now drilling a little deeper in the Lifestyle Media results. Food Network and HGTV benefited during the quarter from their dominant competitive positions in their respective content categories and from their sizable audiences. Our premium tier networks, likewise, are capitalizing on growing distribution, increasing viewership and a strong scatter advertising market place. Advertising growth return to our Lifestyle Media websites with revenue up 23% in the quarter. Lifestyle Media segment profit was up a very hefty 55%, and the margin expanded from 46% to 50%, a very solid performance by our networks, indeed.
And Travel Channel is proving to be a definite win for the company and for shareholders, just about every indicator is moving in the right direction. We've quickly broaden the base of national advertisers. The amount of inventory committed to lower-priced direct response advertising is declining significantly. We had a very successful upfront, which you'll see reflected on our fourth quarter results. And viewership is growing at a steady, healthy pace. Travel Channel is on track to be decidedly accretive to both segment profit and EPS in 2010. Acquiring this great asset last year was clearly the right decision for the company.
Similarly, Cooking Channel's performance during the third quarter affirmed our decision to re-brand Fine Living. Total revenues for the network were up 36%, excluding the amortization of incentives that we negotiated with our distribution partners. Net of this launch fee amortization, reported revenues for the brand were up 9%. The launch incentives for Cooking totaled around $40 million and will continue to be amortized over the next few years. Also during the quarter, we contributed Cooking Channel for the Food Network partnership as expected.
At Shopzilla, as Ken mentioned, we've turned an important corner. Our suite of comparison shopping websites contributed to a consolidated revenue and profit growth during the third quarter. The improvements we've made to make our sites more valuable to both consumers and online retailers have taken root and are having the desired positive effect on operating results. Shopzilla's websites had become a real force in Europe, where the business is up 50% year-to-date over 2009. And in the U.S., we're seeing a return to growth as we improve our yields after undergoing a massive increase in product offers last year. We've also optimized our position with an upstream search, which has led to more inbound sessions. And lastly, we've launched new products, Beso and Tada, that have expanded diversified our proposition with consumers and also provided incremental opportunities for advertising partners to find qualified leads.
We talked about Beso before since it officially launched a year ago, but it's worth noting that in September,  it already eclipsed 2 million monthly unique visitors.
Tada.com, which launched less than a month ago, capitalizes on the power of group-buying to help consumers get big discounts on retail products and gift cards from well-known retailers. We're presently running one deal per week every Tuesday, but initial response has been very strong from both retailers and consumers, and we have plans to ramp up to daily deals in 2011. I think everyone on this call should sign up and check it out right now.
Turning to international development. Food Network U.K. continue to gain viewership momentum during the third quarter. Less than a year after its launch, the network was Sky's most-watched lifestyle channel in a competitive 8 p.m. time slot during one week in September, and it was the third most-watched lifestyle channel for the week, beating our primary competitor in the Food category. During the quarter, we contributed about $8 million to our EMEA partnership to continue funding the operations as we get the business up and running. The cash contribution increases our equity stake from 80% to 89%.
Also since the end of the third quarter, we launched Food Network on DTH platforms in Malaysia and the Philippines and are continuing to explore a possible joint venture in India. As for the balance sheet, we're maintaining our strong cash position preferring, at present, to maintain the flexibility to consider growth opportunities. As we've said on numerous occasions, our capital structure is on a continuous review, especially as cash is starting to accumulate.
Finally, as 2010 draws to a close, we fine-tune a limited guidance we provided for the full year. You could see the compete updated guidance in the press release and the presentation deck that we provided. But let me quickly touch on the changes we've made. First, affiliate fee revenue will end up around $550 million for the year, with the rate of growth decelerating a bit because of more difficult comps. Remember, we completed one affiliate deal in September last year, and there were two weeks of Travel Channel included in the Q4 2009 results.
As for non-programming expenses, we narrowed the range toward the higher end of the previous guidance. We decided to take advantage of the strong scatter advertising market, and we initiated some additional marketing around Cooking and Travel to increase brand awareness and to build on the momentum we're creating. We're now expecting non-programming expenses to be between $550 million and $560 million. And lastly, we now expect the startup losses from our international development efforts to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million.
Looking at other items, capital spending will end up being about $80 million to $85 million this year, and the effective tax rate will be unusually low at 30%, reflecting the favorable tax adjustments we've called out during the last couple of quarters. And finally, we're expecting noncontrolling interest share of net income to be in the $135 million to $140 million range, reflecting the strong advertising market and the outstanding performance of the Food Network this year. 
That's it for our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. Operator, we're ready to take any questions."

And all of that is happening at a time while Laureen Ong and her team have been successful in the short time, I should say, that they've had control in managing the product and improving the ratings as well. So there's really three positive dynamics happening with travel with the improved audience growth. It's the upfront, reason upfront where we were able to put low double-digit improvement in pricing into next year.

And so the results were positive. We still have some work to do in terms of getting HDTV into more aggressive growth mode in terms of ratings and audience.

And the Cooking Channel offers that opportunity to develop new business due to its new entry into the market and its ratings relative to Food being a little bit lower, allowing a pricing opportunity for some people in the Food category to get involved with the networks that perhaps weren't able to do on the Food Channel."

And do you think that over a period of time, and you're certainly not going to get to U.S. type split, but do you think that there's going to be a big disproportion there relative to the U.S.? And then secondly, a bit of a fuzzy question, I guess, on the broadband linear TV integration, the interactive advertising and all that, it feels like Travel Channel probably has some tremendous opportunities even relative to Food or HGTV. Can you talk a little bit about that? I mean, it feels like that could be a pretty large ticket, directly the quantifiable component when you go out, say, three to five years."

On the international front, I guess to answer the specific question there, I don't feel like we're closed out of anything as a result of the deal we have in place. We did reserve several markets that we excluded from the deal. And we are analyzing entry opportunities in several of those at the same time. We do think that ultimately, the structure of those markets are all individual. That's one of the great challenges of the international marketplace is that, with a few notable exceptions, the market's going to be much smaller than the one we're used to addressing. And every market is unique in terms of its structure and its players and its regulation, frankly. So it does take time. But we're happy with our development so far, sort of narrowed the range of losses for this year as we sort of sharpen our pencils and try to figure out what to do next year without spending as much as we anticipated. So we're still optimistic about opportunities in Europe and in Latin America and even in Asia. But it will take us some time to figure out the right steps."

Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
The third quarter was outstanding, outstanding for the company and shareholders by just about every measure. Suffice it to say, the company was truly hitting on all cylinders during the three-month period. Let me give you some of the headlines. Industry-leading ad revenue growth; strong double-digit growth in affiliate fees tied, of course, to the new contracts we negotiated last year; leading competitive edge performance by our flagship networks, HGTV and Food Network; outstanding results at our two newest networks, Travel and Cooking, which are rapidly building larger audiences and expanding their base of advertisers; and importantly, a solid contribution from our online comparison shopping businesses, which reached an inflection point during the quarter and are once again beating prior-year numbers. So all in all, an excellent quarter for the company and the shareholders, and I'm happy to report that strong performance has continued right into the current quarter.
On the fundamental level, the basis of our strong growth is our focus in ownership of the Home, Food and Travel Lifestyle categories, and our expertise in engaging audiences that our advertisers absolutely desire. These are truly powerful, powerful brands. In fact, Nielsen recently ranked HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel and DIY Network among the top 10 for aggregating upscale viewers. Now in my mind, that goes a long way in explaining our success. At Travel Channel, the audience continues to grow by leaps and bounds and our ad sales team has truly hit the ground running, significantly expanding our growing list of national advertisers at Travel.
Inventory sold as direct response advertising, which started out at about 30% of total sales when we acquired the network, is now down in the mid to high teens. Now there was a lot of low-hanging fruit to be had, and we picked it. We think Travel Channel is right on track. We're leveraging the popularity of our key talent, including Adam Richman, Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern or the three As we've come to call them, to new heights. And I can tell you that the outstanding management team at Travel is working on some very promising concepts that are currently on the pipeline we've got a lot of hope for. You'll start to see their handy work in the months to come, so stay tuned to the Travel Channel.
Turning over to the Cooking Channel, our decision to re-brand Fine Living was clearly the right thing to do. Viewership among adults 25 to 54 at Cooking has surged forward, up as much as 100% at some day parts compared with Fine Living a year ago. As we said last quarter, advertisers responded positively to the new network as well, a fact that's evident in Cooking's third quarter performance. Cooking gives us added exposure to the tremendously popular food genre in television, which as you know, we defined really by transforming the Food Network. Now we've taken great care to differentiate Cooking from Food, using the platform as an opportunity to really take a deeper dive into the genre and super serve those avid foodies out there. Cooking also gives us more flexibility in serving advertisers who want to capitalize on the popularity of food programming on TV. So far, I'd to have say that Cooking Channel has been a big win for us and our shareholders, and I hope you've had a chance to check it out.
Meanwhile, the Food Network continues to charge ahead. Despite daunting year-over-year comparisons, total household viewership held firm in the prime time during third quarter. In September, prime time viewership among all adults 25 to 54 was up 4%. Prime time viewership among women in the same age group was up 3%. The solid viewership at Food Network is attributable in no small part to the enduring popularity of shows like Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and great theatrical[ph] events like The Next Food Network Star. Speaking of which, this year's winner, Aarti Sequeira, and her new show, Aarti Party, by the way, had been instant daytime hit, proving once again our ability to identify and nurture great talent at the Food Network. The power of Food Network is also evident to the growing list of ancillary businesses that we're creating around this powerful brand. The Food Network Magazine, already profitable two years ahead of schedule, was designated as the best-selling newsstand culinary title during the quarter, and while incidentally, Bobby Flay and Alton Brown both have books on the New York Times Best-Seller List as we speak. We've had the sports concessions at high-profile locations like the premium Gridiron and Touchdown Clubs at the Meadowlands.
Plus we've introduced Food Network-branded menus that are being used in the suites of the new Meadowlands Stadium as well as other NFL venues, including Cleveland, Buffalo and Chicago. And if that isn't enough, our partnership with Coles continues to reap rewards with sales of Food Network-branded kitchenware outpacing our expectations for the year. It's no wonder women in cable chose this year to make Food Network President Brooke Johnson Woman of the Year. Congratulations, Brooke. It's a well-deserved honor and all of us is so very, very proud of you.
Food Network is truly on fire, and we're finding creative and profitable opportunities to expand the brand. Of course, our success story all began with HGTV, Home and Garden Television. The original Scripps Network, HGTV, dominates the home category on television and is regularly ranked as the number one network among high-income women viewers. Total day viewership at HGTV grew 5% during the third quarter, and on weekends, our audience was up a healthy 6%.
In prime time, HGTV maintained the lofty status as a 1.0-rated network, aggregating an average of nearly 1 million television households a night during the period. September, by the way, was the network's best month ever for total day viewership. Let there be no doubt, HGTV is a power brand on television, and along with the DIY Network, we own this lucrative home category. We're building on that competitive edge with great new specials like the HGTV Urban Oasis Giveaway and Secrets From a Stylist, featuring Emily Henderson, winner of this year's HGTV Design Star.
Now are our first-ever Urban Oasis winner is going to be announced during the special on November 20, and that lucky person will walk away with $1.5 million in prizes, including a brand-new Acura and a luxury high-rise apartment in downtown Manhattan, which is designed by our very own Vern Yip, by the way. A lot of good things in the pipeline for HGTV, and like I said, this is our category. We defined it, we own it and we intend to keep it growing.
And finally, a word about Shopzilla, and this is really a great story. We've been working on building a sustainable business model at Shopzilla for sometime now, and I'm happy to report that we've reached that important point where quarterly results have begun to improve over the prior year periods. Now this is no small feat, and a lot of credit is due to our creative and very hard-working team out in Santa Monica. We successfully repositioned the business, and we set the table for future growth through both differentiation and diversification.
The U.S. business is on course to return to double-digit revenue growth in Q4 as a result of increased consumer visitation and increased revenue yield as the company continues to strengthen its relationship with both consumers and advertisers. And in Europe, Shopzilla's presence continues to grow at a very, very healthy pace. In fact, we are now the number one comparison shopping network in both the U.K. and in France, and that's according to comScore. Our brands, BizRate, Shopzilla, Beso and the new, just last month, Tada, collectively are among the world's leading online comparison shopping destinations, competing effectively with the likes of Google and Yahoo! Again, no small feat.
So there you have it. Scripps Networks Interactive, one of America's leading media companies, and we're hitting our stride, delivering on our commitment to create value for our shareholders. Quite a quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Joe to drill down into the numbers. Joe?"

I'm sure you've seen our press release by now, so as is our custom, I won't got over the numbers in detail. I'm going to focus my remarks on third quarter highlights and provide some color on what drove these very positive results. 
Starting with the consolidated view, here are the headlines: Revenues was up 40% and up 22% excluding Travel. Total segment profit was up 55%, and as a result, net income attributable to the company and the shareholders grew 56% to $0.61 per share or $0.59 on a normalized basis. EPS for the quarter includes a favorable tax adjustment that added $0.03 per share, and it includes a $0.01 reduction for Travel Channel transition costs that fell into that period. The transition costs year-to-date stand at about $28 million. For the full year, we still expect this to be at the low end of the $30 million to $40 million range we forecasted. 
Key revenue drivers for the quarter were strong advertising sales, up 34% as reported and up 19% excluding the Travel Channel, a robust 72% growth in affiliate fee revenues, which was up 40% ex-Travel, and 7% growth in referral fees and other revenues from our online comparison shopping businesses. Advertising sales during the period benefited from the healthy scatter advertising market combined with the success we've had monetizing the audience growth at all of our networks. Scatter pricing during the quarter was up mid to high teens over the prior-year period and up 25% to 30% above 2009, upfront pricing.
Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, scatter pricing continues to be strong, up mid teens over the prior year and up low to mid-20s over the most recent upfront. We're seeing strength in nearly every advertising category with food, consumer packaged goods and retail leading the charge. The recovery in automotive and financials is also contributing to our improved ad sales.
The growth in affiliate revenues reflects the success we had late last year in negotiating new carriage agreements for HGTV and Food. Expanded distribution at all of our networks also contributed, with Food Network topping 100 million U.S. households for the first time and HGTV very close to the same. Distribution of our premium tier channels also grew during the period, with the new Cooking Channel leading the way, up 4.3% from Fine Living's footprint of a year ago. Cooking now passes a very respectable 58 million households. GAC, by the way, is quickly approaching the 60 million household mark.
Now drilling a little deeper in the Lifestyle Media results. Food Network and HGTV benefited during the quarter from their dominant competitive positions in their respective content categories and from their sizable audiences. Our premium tier networks, likewise, are capitalizing on growing distribution, increasing viewership and a strong scatter advertising market place. Advertising growth return to our Lifestyle Media websites with revenue up 23% in the quarter. Lifestyle Media segment profit was up a very hefty 55%, and the margin expanded from 46% to 50%, a very solid performance by our networks, indeed.
And Travel Channel is proving to be a definite win for the company and for shareholders, just about every indicator is moving in the right direction. We've quickly broaden the base of national advertisers. The amount of inventory committed to lower-priced direct-response advertising is declining significantly. We had a very successful upfront, which you'll see reflected on our fourth quarter results. And viewership is growing at a steady, healthy pace. Travel Channel is on track to be decidedly accretive to both segment profit and EPS in 2010. Acquiring this great asset last year was clearly the right decision for the company.
Similarly, Cooking Channel's performance during the third quarter affirmed our decision to re-brand Fine Living. Total revenues for the network were up 36%, excluding the amortization of incentives that we negotiated with our distribution partners. Net of this launch fee amortization, reported revenues for the brand were up 9%. The launch incentives for Cooking totaled around $40 million and will continue to be amortized over the next few years. Also during the quarter, we contributed Cooking Channel for the Food Network partnership as expected.
At Shopzilla, as Ken mentioned, we've turned an important corner. Our suite of comparison shopping websites contributed to a consolidated revenue and profit growth during the third quarter. The improvements we've made to make our sites more valuable to both consumers and online retailers have taken root and are having the desired positive effect on operating results. Shopzilla's websites had become a real force in Europe, where the business is up 50% year-to-date over 2009. And in the U.S., we're seeing a return to growth as we improve our yields after undergoing a massive increase in product offers last year. We've also optimized our position with an upstream search, which has led to more inbound sessions. And lastly, we've launched new products, Beso and Tada, that have expanded diversified our proposition with consumers and also provided incremental opportunities for advertising partners to find qualified leads.
We talked about Beso before since it officially launched a year ago, but it's worth noting that in September, it already eclipsed 2 million monthly unique visitors.
Tada.com, which launched less than a month ago, capitalizes on the power of group-buying to help consumers get big discounts on retail products and gift cards from well-known retailers. We presently run one deal per week every Tuesday, but initial response has been very strong from both retailers and consumers, and we have plans to ramp up to daily deals in 2011. I think everyone on this call should sign up and check it out right now.
Turning to international development. Food Network U.K. continued to gain viewership momentum during the third quarter. Less than a year after its launch, the network was Sky's most-watched lifestyle channel in a competitive 8 p.m. time slot during one week in September, and it was the third most-watched lifestyle channel for the week, beating our primary competitor in the Food category. During the quarter, we contributed about $8 million to our EMEA partnership to continue funding the operations as we get the business up and running. The cash contribution increases our equity stake from 80% to 89%.
Also since the end of the third quarter, we launched Food Network on DTH platforms in Malaysia and the Philippines and are continuing to explore a possible joint venture in India. As for the balance sheet, we're maintaining our strong cash position preferring, at present, to maintain the flexibility to consider growth opportunities. As we've said on numerous occasions, our capital structure is on a continuous review, especially as cash is starting to accumulate.
Finally, as 2010 draws to a close, we fine-tune a limited guidance we provided for the full year. You could see the complete updated guidance in the press release and the presentation deck that we provided. But let me quickly touch on the changes we've made. First, affiliate fee revenue will end up around $550 million for the year, with the rate of growth decelerating a bit because of more difficult comps. Remember, we completed one affiliate deal in September last year, and there were two weeks of Travel Channel included in the Q4 2009 results.
As for non-programming expenses, we narrowed the range toward the higher end of the previous guidance. We decided to take advantage of the strong scattered advertising market, and we initiated some additional marketing around Cooking and Travel to increase brand awareness and to build on the momentum we're creating. We're now expecting non-programming expenses to be between $550 million and $560 million. And lastly, we now expect the startup losses from our international development efforts to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million.
Looking at other items, capital spending will end up being about $80 million to $85 million this year, and the effective tax rate will be unusually low at 30%, reflecting the favorable tax adjustments we've called out during the last couple of quarters. And finally, we're expecting noncontrolling interest share of net income to be in the $135 million to $140 million range, reflecting the strong advertising market and the outstanding performance of the Food Network this year. 
That's it for our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. Operator, we're ready to take any questions."

In fact, the ad sales team at Scripps Networks has done a tremendous job of improving the selling proposition for Travel Channel. A year ago, when it wasn't under our sales guidance, it was using upwards of 30% to 35% of its inventory for DR advertising, and we've been steadily improving in that area in adding high-quality spot advertisers, particularly in the CPG category to Travel and improving the pricing proposition for Travel as well. And all of that is happening at a time while Laureen Ong and her team have been successful in the short time, I should say, that they've had control in managing the product and improving the ratings as well. So there's really three positive dynamics happening with travel with the improved audience growth. It's the upfront, reason upfront where we were able to put low double-digit improvement in pricing into next year. And then it's the reduction of the exposure of direct-response advertising in favor of more spot advertising."

And that proved to be a very wide strategy by the Home category and the HGTV people in particular because it allowed the audience to find that show, arguably the most popular show on the network, and for them to also put some of the newer content on the other end of House Hunters to expose that growing audience to the new programming. And so the results were positive. We still have some work to do in terms of getting HGTV into more aggressive growth mode in terms of ratings and audience. But I'm satisfied with the recent improvement in the ratings in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter with what I've seen on the programming slate for 2011. And with the addition of Kathleen Finch, who successfully has been managing our DIY Network over the last four years as the new General Manager of HGTV, she brings a high level of programming expertise into that management team, along with President Jim Samples to really get that network up on its feet going forward."

The most attractive strategy, frankly, is commission your programming because on some level, lifestyle programming has to be market specific, has to resonate locally. So there is a combination of sort of wider interest in U.S. lifestyle that you could obviously either dub or subtitle. But in commissions in new programming, along the same lines of what we do, but also make it relevant to the markets there. And Asian markets, there is a way, certainly with that broader footprint, true in Latin America as well, that you can economize on production and make programming relevant for a pretty wide swathe of territory. The challenge is, of course, a lot of these markets are individually small, so you do have to be careful in your programming strategy. So there are ways and we have people who have specific responsibility for those territories and are working on that precise question."

Without a doubt, 2009 was a momentous year for Scripps Networks Interactive and its shareholders. We ended the year on a high note, achieving solid growth in both advertising and affiliate fee revenue during the fourth quarter. For the full year, ad sales were even with last year on an apples-to-apples basis which is especially good news, given that we were managing through the worst recession in the generation. Importantly, we also executed on our top strategic priority for 2009, achieving what we set out to accomplish with our affiliate agreement renewals for both Food Network and HGTV. We couldn't be more pleased with the momentum that we're creating. So let me give you a quick rundown of the headlines.
During the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of Travel Channel, giving us our third fully-distributed basic cable television network and a promising new lifestyle category on which to build. We achieved a significant reset of our affiliate rates, effectively monetizing the value and the ever-growing popularity of Food Network and HGTV. The new and improved rates took effect January 1. We've put into action our plans to expand internationally. We've created promising joint ventures that enable us to leverage our expertise as creators of lifestyle content around the globe. We're exporting the Food Network to Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia and we're about to enter the growing Indian marketplace.
We made clear progress toward our debut later this year of the newly branded Cooking Channel, and we expect Cooking to fit comfortably within the 55 million household footprint we created with its predecessor network. The goal of Cooking is to further capitalize on the exploding consumer interest in food as a television programming genre. And perhaps the best news of all, Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel reached new heights in 2009 with each brand ending the year with record growth in viewership. Now those are some pretty impressive headlines. All in all, an excellent quarter and a good year, especially considering where the economy was at this time last year.
As we begin 2010 with our new affiliate rate structure in place, the company is poised for sustainable growth. As for advertising, the marketplace continues to show improvement which puts us in an enviable position when you factor in the audience growth at our flagship brands.
At Food Network, we started the new year pretty much where we left off in 2009. Looking at total households in January, the primetime audience grew a very strong 25% over the same period last year. In fact, Food Network was the highest-rated, most-watched network of all of cable in primetime on Sunday, January 3. Two shows led the way that night. The first was the Super Chef Battle: An American Event (sic) [Super Chef Battle: An Iron Chef America Event] from the White House, which drew a whopping 7.6 million viewers and posted a 2.0 rating among adults 25-54. That by far, is a record audience for Food Network. The second show that night was the premiere of a new competition-based show called the Worst Cooks in America. About 4 million people stuck around to watch the premiere episode of Worst Cooks, making it the highest-rated, most-watched premiere in Food Network's history. The show had a 1.3 rating among adults 25-54 that night.
Let me pause for just a minute to emphasize a point. Those are absolutely astounding numbers. And don't forget, Food Network was actually dark in many New York area households that night and for three weeks in January. As one of our advertisers told us recently, Food Network has become a power brand. I couldn't agree more. Looking ahead at Food Network, we have some very promising new shows in the pipeline including one called Private Chefs of Beverly Hills which will premiere in April, by the way. We've also responded to viewer demand for a show dedicated to Mexican cuisine, with the premiere last month of Mexican Made Easy. The show airs Saturday mornings during our in-the-kitchen programming block. Lots of really, really good things happening at the Food Network.
Over at HGTV, the audience growth that we enjoyed throughout the second half of 2009 has also continued into the new year. Total household viewership in January grew a very healthy 16%, with the average primetime audience topping 1 million viewers a night. HGTV ended 2009 with its highest ever annual primetime ratings, achieving a solid 1.0 rating among total U.S. households. Again, those are incredibly strong numbers.
Our programming team at HGTV has done an outstanding job repositioning the network to keep in sync with the times. Our first-time home buyers programming block including great shows like Property Virgins and My First Place have resonated with viewers and provided the network with the lift it needed. Another hit is a relatively new script called Holmes on Homes. Plus, we're getting plenty of mileage out of perennial favorites House Hunters, House Hunters International and in January, the annual HGTV Dream Home Giveaway special. This year, we'll be adding 14 new series at HGTV, including a show called Selling New York that I suspect will be of interest to a lot of folks in the call this morning.
We also announced in December that Mark Burnett will be producing season five of HGTV Design Star which will air this summer. Now we're expecting Mark to do for Design Star what he's already done for Survivor and The Apprentice. HGTV is blazing ahead in 2010 and we're expecting big things at the network.
At Travel Channel, the news is every bit as good. Travel finished 2009 with its best year ever in primetime and total day ratings and even more important, the median age of the network's audience dropped from 49 to 44. Hit shows like Man v. Food with Adam Richman, No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain and Ghost Adventures have found true cult followings with younger viewers. The ratings success of Travel is a great story for Scripps Networks Interactive, as we begin to build out our presence in the promising travel programming category.
Of course, it's important to remember, we're not just all about television. We're also making great headway, building related content services in the home, food and travel categories across an array of media platforms, and that includes the highly successful Food Network Magazine, which continues to outpace our initial expectations. Accounting subscriptions and single-copy sales, the magazine is reaching a very impressive 1.3 million readers.
We've said it before but it bears repeating, our partners at Hearst tell us that this is the biggest new title launch for them since Oprah Magazine. Also in the food category, we continued to lead on the Internet. Foodnetwork.com and Recipezaar continue to be among the top food websites in the country in terms of total unique visitors, page views and time spent on our websites.
In the home category, HGTV just announced a new partnership with Serta to create a collection of eco-friendly mattresses, appropriately labeled as the HGTV Green Home Collection by Serta. hgtv.com and diynetwork.com also maintained their leadership positions as valued online destinations for designers, for do-it-yourselfers and more. So, there you have it: Three powerful, fully-distributed lifestyle television networks; three powerful lifestyle content categories; and great content across a full range of media platforms, including the Internet and mobile devices.
Scripps Networks Interactive is extraordinarily positioned to deliver value to our viewers, our advertisers, our distribution partners, and importantly, to our shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joe who's going to talk how we finished 2009 and then provide a new outlook for 2010, that will include Travel. Joe?"
6469353,84286427,1760270,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-10-2010",2010-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter turned out to be very good for us. Thanks to the improving advertising environment, strong ratings of our flagship networks and continued growth in affiliate revenue. Excluding the Travel Channel, ad",1218,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter turned out to be very good for us. Thanks to the improving advertising environment, strong ratings of our flagship networks and continued growth in affiliate revenue. Excluding the Travel Channel, advertising revenue grew a very solid 7% during the three-month period, which pushed full-year ad revenue even with 2008 on an apples-to-apples basis.
Strong growth in the fourth quarter was due to the healthier ad market and the success we've had in monetizing the audience growth of both Food Network and HGTV. As for affiliate fee revenue, again, x Travel, we were up about 16% in the fourth quarter and finished the year, up about 16%. That was a tad better than the 15% growth we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. It's also worth noting that ad sales from our Lifestyle Media websites grew 10% during the fourth quarter and that positive trend has continued into the New Year. If you'll remember, Internet ad sales were a leading indicator as we entered the recession, so we see this growth as a very good sign for us.
Now looking at other full-year results relative to the guidance we've provided. Programming expenses were up about 9%, not including the write-down and excluding Travel. That was in line with our forecast. All other expenses at our Lifestyle Media segment were down slightly from the prior year, as we had predicted. Again, that's on an apples-to-apples basis minus Travel and any one-time items.
Capital expenditures finished the year at $91 million, as we continue to work on the expansion of our Knoxville operations facility. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was about 29% for the full year, which was lower than we had anticipated. A number of one-time discreet items, including some favorable adjustments to previously filed tax returns, contributed to the lower rate. Going forward, when you factor in the non-controlling interest for Food Network and Travel Channel, our effective tax rate should be in the 31% to 33% range.
And finally in Shopzilla, we ended up at about $31 million in segment profit which was right about where we had guided.
Looking at earnings per share, as we noted in the press release, we finished the quarter at $0.52, after you strip out a number of one-time items related to our affiliate renewals, the Travel acquisition, Cooking Channel rebranding and the uSwitch divestiture. To make sure we're all clear, let me quickly run through and size the items that affected net income and EPS. They're also outlined in the press release for you.
First, $21 million write-off of Fine Living programming accounted for about $0.07 per share. This was prompted by our announcement during the fourth quarter that we'd be rebranding Fine Living to the Cooking Channel. The write-off includes existing Fine Living programming and commitments that we determined couldn't be used at Cooking or in our other networks. The write-offs show up as an expense on the income statement which is why programming costs were up 25% during the period.
Next, about $18 million or $0.08 per share is tied to the Travel Channel acquisition, including both professional fees and financing costs. Our international investments, primarily the Chello Zone jv accounted for about $0.01.
And finally, to support our affiliate renewals, we had about $4 million in one-time marketing and legal expenses that accounted for another $0.02 or so. And if you live in the New York area, you'd probably know that another tranche of these costs will hit in the first quarter as well.
The combination of all the one-time items reduced fourth quarter net income by $0.17 a share which was offset by the $0.17 gain we realized on the sale of uSwitch and the $0.05 added back for the tax adjustments. That should get you to the $0.52.
So that was 2009. Let's move on to the forecast we provided this morning. I'm sure you noticed that since we're including Travel Channel in our forecast, we've decided to give you a range of actual dollars on Lifestyle Media revenue and expense items, rather than try to relate apples to oranges using a growth rate. We thought this would be a better way to present our guidance for this year.
Let's start with affiliate fee revenue for 2010. With the majority of our carriage rights agreements renewed at more attractive rates, total affiliate fee revenue is expected to be in the $530 million to $540 million range with about $100 million of that coming from Travel.
As Ken said, we accomplished substantially all that we've set out to accomplish in this very important round of renewals, achieving parity and rate structures between Food Network and HGTV. Rates of both networks also are now more in line with our competitive set. The new rate structure, we believe, more accurately represents the value of these brands for both us and for our distribution partners.
Moving to Lifestyle Media expenses including Travel, we expect programming amortization costs to be between $380 million and $400 million and non-programming costs to be within the range of $550 million to $570 million. You'll remember, please, that we cut back dramatically on marketing expenses in 2009.
At Shopzilla, we're forecasting segment profit to be $33 million to $35 million which would be a modest improvement from 2009. The performance you saw in 2009 will likely continue through the first half of 2010 with a much, much stronger finish in the back half.
One other operating item for 2010. While it's too early to quantify with any precision, we do expect to report losses on our international startups in the year ahead.
And finally, we expect capital spending to be in the $95 million to $100 million change. We're on track to finish our Knoxville expansion this year, so starting in 2011, I'd look for a normalized CapEx run rate of about $50 million to $60 million per year.
Before I finish, let me quickly bring you up-to-date on where we are with Travel Channel's integration. At this point, I'd say, we're proceeding very close to plan. We anticipate fully assuming ad sales responsibilities by the end of the first quarter which will tee us up to market the brand in this year's upfront. We also expect to assume technical responsibilities from Discovery in about the same time frame. We lastly expect to assume affiliate sales during the second quarter.
A couple more housekeeping notes related to Travel. You'll notice that we did not include the quarterly balance sheet or cash flow statement with this morning's release. That's because we're still working through some of the acquisition accounting. Naturally, we'll have everything ready in time for our 10-K filing in a couple of weeks. Let me highlight a couple of balance sheet items though. First, we ended the year with a cash balance of about $254 million. That includes $181 million we contributed to the Travel Channel joint venture. And our debt balance at year end is $884 million, again all related to the Travel acquisition.
Lastly, when we report the first quarter, we intend to provide a quarter-by-quarter pro forma look at Travel to help you with your models and comparisons going forward. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

The escalators are a little bit different shape than what we've told you in the past about the HGTV renewals. We did achieve a much larger slug of the growth early on, in the Food renewals.

I think, we're at a very early stages of thinking about Travel. If we sort of put in priority order the categories that we like for international, I'd say Food is number one, a generalized lifestyle channel, probably branded under Fine Living is number two. Travel, while it has great international appeal, you correctly point out, has established competitors and other choices in many, many markets. Not the least of which is owned by our good friends at Discovery. So we're proceeding cautiously. One thing we do like is that we do think the programming has great appeal. We are not so concerned that the brand name is taken in large parts of the world. The fact that these two companies did have the same set of parents way back when, and split off at that point, international went one way and domestic one another. We had conversations with the owner there. There are things we might be able to do to get it down the road, but we're not married to that brand globally, partly because we think the programming is more important than the brand and we may actually create other brands, if we think that there's a room for another stand-alone Travel network, globally. But, like I said, we like the programming appeal. It's sort of third on our list of most important priorities globally. But we're going to do our best there and as I said, we're still early days thinking about what we can do with Travel."

Regarding your question about platforms, when you think about, particularly HGTV and Food, or maybe think more in terms of our two biggest categories, Food and Home, we really have brands and now adding Travel to the mix -- brands that transcend television per se and resonate with audiences on a variety of platforms. And the way we think about it is that we're agnostic as to the platform per se. Rather, we just think about accessing as many consumer touch-points as we possibly can, that resonate with our media content. So we're seeing that happening with the Food Network Magazine. We're seeing it certainly through our Digital businesses. Travel Channel, by the way, has also done a great job in this regard. Their website is up 20% in traffic after their recent redesign. And we just see lot of opportunity going forward to create new revenue streams on top of these relationships we build by way of these massive cable television properties that continue the growth into the future."

In fact, it's pretty early on the Travel Channel. We're not really even fully through our integration process. So to provide specific guidance on expense line items, is premature. I will say this, we absolutely expect that, that the network has the full potential to achieve every bit of margin that the other two fully-distributed networks do, and we're working towards that objective. So I think, I'm going to have to ask you to stay tuned on that one while we work through the transition.

So I think, it won't be an insignificant number for the year. But I'm afraid it's a little early to give you a range on that. On the question of Cooking Channel and the transition there, the only transition expense that would sort of not have been covered by the existing Fine Living budget that we had, would've been, call them launch fees or conversion fees that we paid in incentives to the operators to launch the new network for us, so worked with us to launch the new network. And relatively modest fee it will be an increase in expenses there, but it's not going to be significant. You can think in terms of $1 or so that we converted over a very long period of time it will be amortized. So overall, those carriage agreements. So it's not going to be a meaningful change in this year's budget for what we had in place for Fine Living."

It's a start up for us and we're going to be very prudent the way we like to be on everything. So we're going to try to walk before we run.

We don't have a cash flow statements, I'm not sure what your cash investment in programming was in '09 versus '08. But when I strip out what I think Travel is plus your impairment in the fourth quarter, it seems like your programming cost amortization guidance is sort of 10%, 11% growth in '10 versus '09 on the kind of core networks. And my understanding is it's four-year amortization accelerated depreciation of your cash investments is the way the accounting works. And correct me if I'm wrong, so I was curious if you could just help sync up your cash investment in programming over the last year or two and this growth rate, which I think is sort of flat with '09. I would've expected it to moderate in '10 versus '09, but maybe I'm doing the math wrong or my Travel estimate may be wrong? And then along those lines, Ken, when you think about down the road, if in fact, the broadcasters start to receive retransmissions fees the way they think they will, you can make an argument that the sort of cost of audience growth goes up in general because you've been with competing with broadcasters in many ways instead of had a broken model.

And Benjamin, I think what's not being factored into the equation, as much right now, is kind of shifting of some revenue, which you know historically, since retransmission consent launched in the mid-90s and we were pretty much at the front end of that because we cooked the retransmission consent of our 10 television stations and then we coupled that with some other television station groups. So we used that leverage to get HGTV launched and as you know, that was really also a mechanism for getting Food launched. Some of those dollars that went from retransmission to cable networks like ours are now maybe going to be shifting back to the network model. But that comes with NBC, ABC, CBS to a certain degree and Fox's as well, maybe having to shift some revenue internally. So it's not going to be that all this new revenue is going to be created, as much as we're going to see some more chips, some resetting the breaks, which is going to have some upheaval over the coming negotiations. Having said all of that and having just gone through a massive renewal with about 75% of our new Food Network base, it's still going to come down to, in my opinion, quality content that has passionate viewership, passionate engagement from the audience, that has high-quality for the advertising community. So you'll continue to see us invest. I think it's going to be a more competitive environment. I think looking forward, you can actually expect to see some, as I said, not only dollar shifting, but some smaller and less popular cable networks really put under to rest. From our standpoint, there's going to be a lot of movement but I've never felt stronger about our brands. And as John was alluding to earlier, as we see technology and some of the things that are probably going to be happening in the future with TV everywhere, interactivity being enhanced with these set-top boxes, our brands are actually, I think in for great runs and that's why we were thrilled to pick up one more category, the Travel category, if you go to the [ph] the Home category and the Food category. And to paraphrase what John said, our brands really transcend television. So it's great to have those TV brands as popular as they are, but we've never been about just cable networks, we've been about categories."

I'm know you're trying to get some new viewers in, but there's two ways to think about it. I guess, one is that if you had spent more, you would've had that many more viewers. The other is perhaps maybe where you're spending on marketing, wasn't the greatest place. How do you reassess your marketing mix, I guess, for next year?

But for the long haul, there's no possible way that you can grow your audience without attracting new viewers along the way. And there's really no way to do that without marketing off your channels on other media platforms. And so, yes, it may seem like a question mark in your mind. I suppose that if you can raise ratings in a year without marketing, why not just quit marketing all together?

And we do believe that there is headroom to improve the affiliate fees for Travel Channel. The network, prior to us acquiring it, has done a fantastic job in developing a great ratings story. It's our intention to provide the support and resources to help them continue to do that. And as we saw with Food, to the extent that we can deliver a strong audience proposition, then the negotiations become that much easier to complete."

They are pretty healthy going forward. But there, like I said, the bulk of it came in the first. It's not like a inflation escalator, it's real money going forward. But my explanation was sort of relative to HG where we got double-digit increases for three years in a row and then it sort of flatlined to an inflation-adjusted number, essentially. This is a big step up, upfront. But then, still meaningful going forward, higher than the HG."

And so it's really a different model for us. We're not out to attract an audience that is a mile wide and an inch deep. Our audience is richly associated with our brands and as a result, we monetize that relationship on TV and on all other platforms in a way that broadcast television could never dream of."
