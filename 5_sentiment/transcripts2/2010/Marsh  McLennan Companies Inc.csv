Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, I will discuss the progress MMC made in 2009. Then Vanessa will review our results for the fourth quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take your questions. Let me begin by saying that in 2009, we made great strides in strengthening Marsh & McLennan Companies as a preeminent global professional services firm. MMC's performance in 2009 was outstanding, particularly in light of the substantial economic and market challenges presented by the global recession, which affected all of our operating segments. We also faced soft market conditions in the global property and casualty insurance marketplace. And we're confronted with extremely low interest rates in 2009, which reduced interest income including fiduciary and corporate, by nearly $120 million despite higher corporate cash levels. And lastly, the effects of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by more than $50 million, which primarily affected our Consulting segment. When I joined MMC two years ago, one of our major objectives was to improve both the financial performance and the margins in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. As I said at that time, our segment margin needed to be at a level competitive with other large insurance brokers. Over the past two years, adjusted operating income in Risk and Insurance Services more than doubled to nearly $1 billion, and the segment's adjusted operating margin increased 1,000 basis points, rising to 18.6% in 2009 from 8.6% in 2007. This was done despite the worst economic downturns since World War II. Looking just to 2009, earnings growth for Risk and Insurance Services segment was robust. Adjusted operating income increased 35%, and the adjusted operating margin rose by more than 500 basis points over 2008. This was achieved thanks to the determined efforts of thousands of dedicated colleagues around the world, led by Dan and his management team at Marsh, and Peter and his team at Guy Carpenter. The main driver of MMC's strong earnings growth was a significant improvement in profitability at Marsh, a trend that began in early 2008 when management initiated the strategy to improve operational efficiencies, strengthen financial results and deliver superior Risk and Insurance capabilities to clients. These excellent results at Marsh are a credit to everything Dan and his team has done over the past two years. Marsh was able to accomplish all these while continuing to invest in the future, including making strategic hires in client-facing positions, enhancing value-added technology for clients and expanding colleague training programs with an emphasis on sales. Guy Carpenter's results in 2009 reflected the positive themes we've talked about for the past year. Increased new business, improved client retention and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together, these factors resulted in strong growth in adjusted operating income. Over the course of 2009, Carpenter continued to invest in its platform, enhancing its reputation as a preeminent reinsurance intermediary, recruitment of superior broking talent and additional enhancements to their analytical capabilities have further strengthened Guy Carpenter, and contributed to a strong performance in the year. New business generation was outstanding, and retention returned to historically high levels. Combined, this resulted in strong underlying revenue growth of 8%, double-digit growth in profitability and a solid margin improvement in 2009. Management augmented underlying growth with the successful acquisition and integration of Collins and Rattner Mackenzie. Moving on to our Consulting segment. Signs of both Mercer and Oliver Wyman suggest we've seen the worst of the year-over-year comparisons. Both companies felt the effects of the economy in 2009, but the management teams of Mercer and Oliver Wyman responded with thoughtful cost-savings initiatives. At Mercer, the effects of the economic downturn were first felt in the fourth quarter of 2008. Rather than making draconian cuts across the enterprise, Mercer reacted to the weakening environment by taking targeted measures to rightsize individual business lines. As a result, on a year-over-year basis, Mercer was able to reduce expenses in each of the last four quarters and achieved an increase in operating margin for the second half of 2009. Over the past two years, Mercer has made improvements in its operating model to capitalize on the strength of its three pillars: consulting, outsourcing and investments. Recent initiatives included enhancing its sales organization, developing an integrated global infrastructure, streamlining the organization and making selected strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, revenue overall was flat, but grew sequentially from the third quarter. Mercer saw signs of strength in several practices, which Vanessa will cover in more detail. At Oliver Wyman, 2009 was a difficult year. But signs of revenue stabilization and in some cases, growth of revenue. For example, financial services, which is Oliver Wyman's largest practice and saw the earliest declines, continue to be a bright spot among its industry specialties. Leading indicators across Oliver Wyman's businesses suggest that the stabilization and demand we saw in the latter part of 2009 should continue. Expense management actions taken earlier in the year enabled Oliver Wyman to grow sequential operating income and margin for the third consecutive quarter. As Oliver Wyman enters 2010, we expect it will produce favorable comparisons to 2009. Now moving on to Risk Consulting and Technology, Kroll is a much stronger firm that it was a year ago. Kroll Ontrack, its largest business unit, representing slightly less than half of its revenue, drove fourth quarter results with double-digit revenue growth. Kroll's profitability in the second half of 2009 reflected management's aggressive actions to strengthen and refocus the company and to reduce expenses. As a result, Kroll is reestablishing higher levels of profitability. It produced significant growth in operating income in both the third and fourth quarters compared with recent periods. Last week, we announced an agreement to sell Kroll Laboratory Specialists, Kroll Substance Abuse Testing business for $110 million. We expect that transaction to close in the first quarter. Entering 2010, Kroll is positioned for significant growth in operating income.Now I'd like to briefly update you on our acquisition strategy that I've discussed on last quarter's call. Over the last three months, we have announced four transactions: The largest was our agreement in December to acquire HSBC Insurance Brokers based London. This business is a strong complementary fit with Marsh, both operationally and geographically. This transaction, which is expected to close early in the second quarter, will deepen Marsh's presence in the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East. As part of this agreement, we also entered into a strategic partnership with HSBC Bank that gives us preferred access to provide insurance broking and risk management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients. The remaining three announced acquisitions are part of the ramping up of our Marsh & McLennan agency initiative. In November, we acquired Insurance Alliance, one of the largest insurance agencies in Texas. Based in Houston, Insurance Alliance has annual revenue of $15 million. In December, we acquired NIA Group, based in New Jersey. NIA Group has approximately 400 employees and annual revenue exceeding $60 million. And in February of this year, we acquired Haake Companies, based in Kansas. Haake has annual revenue of $11 million. Our strategy is to establish 10 hubs. And as you can see, we're making great progress towards this objective. In summary, let me reiterate that 2009 was an outstanding year for MMC. We feel good about what we've accomplished. As we begin 2010, we believe each of our operating companies is well positioned. Let me briefly outline some of the goals we have for the coming year. As you know, 2009 expense management was a key focus for MMC, and for most companies, as we confronted worldwide recessionary conditions. In 2010, our primary goal is to drive top and bottom-line growth across the enterprise. We plan to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our operating companies also need to the achieve the strategic and financial goals that they set for themselves. We also look to further unlock the value at MMC by better leveraging our infrastructure for additional cost savings, and capitalizing on adjacencies across the operating companies to increase revenue generation and strengthen the corporation as a whole. And we will continue to further reduce the risk profile of MMC through a robust enterprise risk management and compliance program. Finally, another key focus for 2010 is our employees, both current and future. We will continue to focus on attraction, development and retention of professional and leadership talent, with an emphasis on leadership development and diversity inclusion. So with that, let me turn it over to Vanessa."

First, I'll give you an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I'll cover the recent settlements and securities and ERISA class action lawsuits. Then I'll discuss the results of the individual operating companies, with a focus on the fourth quarter. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's future restructuring costs, pensions and capital structure. Let's begin with earnings. Including the settlement of the securities lawsuits, EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.07 compared with $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.38, a 6% increase from $0.36 in the prior year. As usual, in discussing our results, all my references will be the underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. In the fourth quarter, MMC's earnings growth was diversified and strong, with double-digit growth in the operating income of each of our three operating segments. On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 20% compared with last year's fourth quarter. This is a solid performance considering one, our strong fourth quarter of 2008 when operating income rose 28% over the fourth quarter of 2007; and two, the headwinds each of our operating companies faced not only in the fourth quarter but throughout the year. Investment income was $23 million, in line with the guidance we gave you on last quarter's fault. This performance was largely due to mark-to-market increases in our private equity portfolio. Looking ahead to the first quarter, compared with the $15 million investment loss in the first quarter of 2009, there should be an improvement of $10 million to $15 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to a minimal mark-to-market investment loss in the first quarter of 2010. Corporate expenses decreased 6% for 2009 to $159 million. We expect corporate expenses to decline further this year.Now let me discuss the recent resolution of the securities lawsuit. In December, the U.S. District Court approved a settlement regarding the securities class action lawsuit that was filed in 2004 related to the NY AG investigation. 96% of the eligible shares are bounced by this settlement. The related ERISA class action lawsuit was also settled. MMC paid $435 million in the fourth quarter to settle these two lawsuits, of which $230 million was covered by insurance. Of the insurance recoverables, we received $163 million in 2009, which was included in our year-end cash position. The remaining $67 million was received in January. The net settlement paid by MMC of $205 million is tax deductible and will contribute to a sizable refund, which we expect to receive this summer. Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments beginning with Risk and Insurance Services. Fourth quarter revenue, excluding fiduciary interest, decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. Risk and Insurance Services operating income rose 13%, despite a drop in fiduciary interest income from $25 million to $12 million. The operating margin in the fourth quarter increased 110 basis points from 14.8% to 15.9%. More importantly, for the entire year, the segment margin increased 530 basis points from 13.3% to 18.6%. Looking specifically at insurance broking, Marsh's fourth quarter revenue decreased 1% to $1.2 billion, reflecting the economic environment as well as pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. Despite these difficult conditions, Marsh increased revenue in many areas of the world, with more than 20 countries growing at least 5%. Additionally, new business remains strong on a global basis. New business generation had a positive progression throughout the year. The second half of 2009 was stronger than the first half, with the fourth quarter being the highest level of the year. Dan and his team continued to do an excellent job in reducing overall expenses, while at the same time, building a stronger, more efficient organization. The continuing focus on expense control drove Marsh's operating expenses down 6% in the fourth quarter. This increased efficiency allowed Marsh to grow operating income more than 20% in the quarter.Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 4%, a good performance considering the difficult market conditions that include increased primary retentions, as well as downward pressure on rates across many lines. And for the year, Carpenter's revenue growth was 8%, led by excellent new business production which, as Brian mentioned, was exceptionally strong. As we have previously discussed, Carpenter's retention rate has also returned to its historical high level, contributing to the overall positive revenue performance.Let's turn to our Consulting segment. The revenue decline of 2% was a substantial improvement from the 10% decrease in the third quarter. We believe the Consulting segment has weathered the worst of the harsh economic environment. Management actions aligns expenses with revenue, producing a 2% decline in operating expenses in the quarter. These efforts resulted in a 17% increase in operating income from $121 million to $142 million. This represents the segment's highest quarterly growth rate in two years. And the operating margin for the Consulting segment increased 140 basis points, from 10.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. As we said on our last call, we felt the third quarter for Mercer would likely represent its most difficult year-over-year revenue comparison. And this appears to have been the case as revenue in the fourth quarter was flat, representing a substantial improvement from the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the decline in rewards, talent and communications was offset by gains in other practices. The retirement and health and benefits practices grew 2% on a year-over-year basis. Outsourcing rose 3%, and investment consulting and management increased 9%. Michele and her team also did an excellent job of expense management throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses decreased 2%. As a result, Mercer experienced a substantial increase in operating income exceeding 30%. At Oliver Wyman, the rate of revenue decline has moderated over the last two quarters. Although weak economic conditions persist, we saw signs of continued stabilization in the fourth quarter. As Brian mentioned, financial services continued to be a bright spot among Oliver Wyman's industry specialties. Revenue with financial services rose 8% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. And the industry practice serving the retail sector was even stronger, with double-digit revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the year. Other practices continued to experience weakness, though most have improved performance in the fourth quarter. A strict focus on expenses resulted in Oliver Wyman achieving a sequential improvement in operating income and margin for the third consecutive quarter. In the Risk Consulting and Technology segment, Kroll had another solid quarter, particularly as it related to improved profitability. Revenue was flat year-over-year, but adjusted operating income increased threefold. Kroll Ontrack, Kroll's largest business, had revenue growth of 19%. The result of continued strong performance in its litigation support-related services. Additionally, Ben Allen and his team have done an excellent job reducing Kroll's cost base, with a 7% decrease in operating expenses in the fourth quarter. This positive leverage resulted in substantial growth in operating income on a year-over-year basis. Even with the economic sensitivity in many of Kroll's businesses, we expect strong growth and profitability in 2010. Now, I would like to make a few comments about our schedule of non-GAAP measures. MMC has undergone major restructuring actions over the past several years. Marsh implemented widespread initiatives to improve profitability during the past two years. And each of our other operating companies took actions to varying degrees to deal with the recession and to improve their competitive position. Looking forward, we believe future restructuring activities will be focused on the refinement of our support and back-office functions, as well as the integration of acquisitions. Before I discuss our pension plans, let me make a few observations regarding pension plans generally. Defined benefit pension plans can create volatility in a company's P&L, cash flow and balance sheet. A significant driver of this volatility is the movement of long-term corporate bond rates, which companies are required to use to measure pension obligations at the end of each year. With respect to our pension plans, as a result of our preliminary measurement, we are currently projecting that MMC's pension expense will increase in 2010, reducing operating income by approximately $80 million year-over-year.We estimate that declines in long-term corporate bond rates in the U.S. and U.K. account for about two-thirds of our anticipated pension expense increase in 2010. Looking beyond this year, with interest rates and borrowing spreads at relatively low levels today, it seems reasonable to assume that interest rates will increase over the next 12 to 24 months. And looking at only the impact of this one factor, any increase in interest rates will reduce our future pension expense. Regarding the funding of our pension plans, the aggregate level of contributions in 2009 approached $400 million. We currently project that contributions in 2010 should slightly exceed $300 million.Turning to MMC's capital structure, net debt was $1.8 billion at year end, a reduction of $100 million from the end of 2008. The year-end figure includes the impact of funding the settlement of the securities lawsuits. But as I said earlier, does not include all of the insurance recoverables or the tax refund. Shares outstanding at December 31, 2009 were $530 million, an increase of 15.4 million shares through the end of 2008. The use of stock in 2009 included about 11 million shares to fund the acquisitions in Risk and Insurance Services that we discussed, which we expect to be accretive to earnings going forward. The remaining shares were used for employee stock plans. With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

The insurance cycle over my career, over 30 years, most of it's been soft, right? And so I think that Marsh can improve in any sort of insurance cycle. And that has less of an impact. The economic results are very considerable. And you see them in a lot of very different ways. One is the cost consciousness in our client base that we have not experienced before. I think that in a lot of the large accounts based worldwide, you see significant involvement of procurement rather than risk managers determining buying decisions. We see a lot of conservatism and caution around project work. And certainly, project work with regard to areas where we have deep expertise, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, supply chain, those areas, I would say, are viewed as more discretionary in, at least, in the short term. We expect some level of bounce back on them in 2010. The other impact the economy has is exposure units. I mean, I've traveled around the world meeting with clients. And I've met with certain clients who have literally told me that their performance is down 70% and levels like that. And so from that standpoint, while there might be a rate reduction of 5% or 7%, it's being applied against an exposure unit, which might be down 25% or 30% or 40%. And that has significant impact on us."

I feel very good about where we are at Marsh, in terms of how we compensate our people and the clarity around rewards.

A lot has to do with the impact and influence that they have over decision making in the company, etc. And so we're believers and as much decentralized decision making as possible and empowering people to do the jobs and do what's right for the client. And our mantra internally is sort of this -- if it meets our values as a company and if it's good for your client, it's virtually always the right course of action. And so I think, that makes people feel good about working at Marsh.

And I guess I can you interest and others' interest in the matter. And I would refer you to our public filings to start with. But having said that, broadly speaking, it's a civil suit that Mercer, regarding Mercer, first, that Mercer underestimated future health care cost for two of the Alaska pension plans. And two, that Mercer failed to disclose a data entry error to the client back in 2002 and 2003. So on the first point, Mercer believes its estimate of future health care costs were reasonable and in line with the projections made at the time by competitors and other actuaries nationally. And on the second point, Mercer has acknowledged that there was a data entry error that wasn't disclosed to the client in those two years. But Mercer believes the error had no impact on the actual funding of the plans. That's important. In '02 and '03, Mercer advised the plans to substantially increase their contribution rates and the plans did not adopt Mercer's calculations. So Mercer believes it has substantial defenses to these claims. And we'll continue to defend ourselves. The trial's in July. In Juneau. We take it very seriously. And I hope you can understand it. This is a pending litigation matter. And so I really can't comment any more on it."

Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, I will discuss the progress MMC made in 2009. Then Vanessa will review our results for the fourth quarter. Afterwards, we'd be happy to take your questions. Let me begin by saying that in 2009, we made great strides in strengthening Marsh & McLennan Companies as a preeminent global professional services firm. MMC's performance in 2009 was outstanding, particularly in light of the substantial economic and market challenges presented by the global recession, which affected all of our operating segments. We also faced soft market conditions in the global property and casualty insurance marketplace, and were confronted with extremely low interest rates in 2009, which reduced interest income including fiduciary and corporate, by nearly $120 million despite higher corporate cash levels. And lastly, the effects of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by more than $50 million, which primarily affected our Consulting segment. When I joined MMC two years ago, one of our major objectives was to improve both the financial performance and the margins in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. As I said at the time, our segment margin needed to be at a level competitive with other large insurance brokers. Over the past two years, adjusted operating income in Risk and Insurance Services more than doubled to nearly $1 billion, and the segment's adjusted operating margin increased 1,000 basis points, rising to 18.6% in 2009 from 8.6% in 2007. This was done despite the worst economic downturn since World War II. Looking just to 2009, earnings growth for Risk and Insurance Services segment was robust. Adjusted operating income increased 35%, and the adjusted operating margin rose by more than 500 basis points over 2008. This was achieved thanks to the determined efforts of thousands of dedicated colleagues around the world, led by Dan and his management team at Marsh, and Peter and his team at Guy Carpenter. The main driver of MMC's strong earnings growth was a significant improvement in profitability at Marsh, a trend that began in early 2008 when management initiated a strategy to improve operational efficiencies, strengthen financial results and deliver superior Risk and Insurance capabilities to clients. These excellent results at Marsh are a credit to everything Dan and his team has done over the past two years. Marsh was able to accomplish all this while continuing to invest in the future, including making strategic hires in client-facing positions, enhancing value-added technology for clients and expanding colleague training programs with an emphasis on sales. Guy Carpenter's results in 2009 reflected the positive themes we've talked about for the past year. Increase new business, improve client retention and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together, these factors resulted in strong growth in adjusted operating income. Over the course of 2009, Carpenter continued to invest in its platform, enhancing its reputation as a preeminent reinsurance intermediary, recruitment of superior broking talent, and additional enhancements to their analytical capabilities have further strengthened Guy Carpenter and contributed to a strong performance in the year. New business generation was outstanding, and retention returned to historically high levels. Combined, this resulted in strong underlying revenue growth of 8%, double-digit growth in profitability and a solid margin improvement in 2009. Management augmented underlying growth with the successful acquisition and integration of Collins and Rattner Mackenzie. Moving on to our Consulting segment. Signs of both Mercer and Oliver Wyman suggest we've seen the worst of the year-over-year comparisons. Both companies felt the effects of the economy in 2009, but the management teams of Mercer and Oliver Wyman responded with thoughtful cost-savings initiatives. At Mercer, the effects of the economic downturn were first felt in the fourth quarter of 2008. Rather than making draconian cuts across the enterprise, Mercer reacted to the weakening environment by taking targeted measures to right-size individual business lines. As a result, on a year-over-year basis, Mercer was able to reduce expenses in each of the last four quarters and achieved an increase in operating margin for the second half of 2009. Over the past two years, Mercer has made improvements in its operating model to capitalize on the strength of its three pillars: consulting, outsourcing and investments. Recent initiatives included enhancing its sales organization, developing an integrated global infrastructure, streamlining the organization and making selected strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, revenue overall was flat, but grew sequentially from the third quarter. Mercer saw signs of strength in several practices, which Vanessa will cover in more detail. At Oliver Wyman, 2009 was a difficult year. But signs of revenue stabilization and in some cases, growth of revenue. For example, financial services, which is Oliver Wyman's largest practice and saw the earliest declines, continue to be a bright spot among its industry specialties. Leading indicators across Oliver Wyman's businesses suggest that the stabilization and demand we saw in the latter part of 2009 should continue. Expense management actions taken earlier in the year enabled Oliver Wyman to grow sequential operating income and margin for the third consecutive quarter. As Oliver Wyman enters 2010, we expect it will produce favorable comparisons to 2009. Now moving on to Risk Consulting and Technology, Kroll is a much stronger firm that it was a year ago. Kroll Ontrack, its largest business unit, representing slightly less than half of its revenue, drove fourth quarter results with double-digit revenue growth. Kroll's profitability in the second half of 2009 reflected management's aggressive actions to strengthen and refocus the company and to reduce expenses. As a result, Kroll is reestablishing higher levels of profitability. It produced significant growth in operating income in both the third and fourth quarters compared with recent periods. Last week, we announced an agreement to sell Kroll Laboratory Specialists, Kroll Substance Abuse Testing business for $110 million. We expect that transaction to close in the first quarter. Entering 2010, Kroll is positioned for significant growth in operating income.Now I'd like to briefly update you on our acquisition strategy that I've discussed on last quarter's call. Over the last three months, we have announced four transactions: The largest was our agreement in December to acquire HSBC Insurance Brokers based London. This business is a strong complementary fit with Marsh, both operationally and geographically. This transaction, which is expected to close early in the second quarter, will deepen Marsh's presence in the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East. As part of this agreement, we also entered into a strategic partnership with HSBC Bank that gives us preferred access to provide insurance broking and risk management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients. The remaining three announced acquisitions are part of the ramping up of our Marsh & McLennan agency initiative. In November, we acquired Insurance Alliance, one of the largest insurance agencies in Texas. Based in Houston, Insurance Alliance has annual revenue of $15 million. In December, we acquired NIA Group, based in New Jersey. NIA Group has approximately 400 employees and annual revenue exceeding $60 million. And in February of this year, we acquired Haake Companies, based in Kansas. Haake has annual revenue of $11 million. Our strategy is to establish 10 hubs. And as you can see, we're making great progress towards this objective. In summary, let me reiterate that 2009 was an outstanding year for MMC. We feel good about what we've accomplished. As we begin 2010, we believe each of our operating companies is well positioned. Let me briefly outline some of the goals we have for the coming year. As you know, 2009 expense management was a key focus for MMC, and for most companies, as we confronted worldwide recessionary conditions. In 2010, our primary goal is to drive top and bottom-line growth across the enterprise. We plan to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our operating companies also need to achieve the strategic and financial goals that they’ve set for themselves. We also look to further unlock the value at MMC by better leveraging our infrastructure for additional cost savings, and capitalizing on adjacencies across the operating companies to increase revenue generation and strengthen the corporation as a whole. And we will continue to further reduce the risk profile of MMC through a robust enterprise risk management and compliance program. Finally, another key focus for 2010 is our employees, both current and future. We will continue to focus on attraction, development and retention of professional and leadership talent, with an emphasis on leadership development and diversity inclusion. So with that, let me turn it over to Vanessa."

First, I'll give you an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I'll cover the recent settlements and securities and ERISA class action lawsuits. Then I'll discuss the results of the individual operating companies, with a focus on the fourth quarter. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's future restructuring costs, pensions and capital structure. Let's begin with earnings. Including the settlement of the securities lawsuits, EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.07 compared with $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.38, a 6% increase from $0.36 in the prior year. As usual, in discussing our results, all my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. In the fourth quarter, MMC's earnings growth was diversified and strong, with double-digit growth in the operating income of each of our three operating segments. On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 20% compared with last year's fourth quarter. This is a solid performance considering one, our strong fourth quarter of 2008 when operating income rose 28% over the fourth quarter of 2007; and two, the headwinds each of our operating companies faced not only in the fourth quarter but throughout the year. Investment income was $23 million, in line with the guidance we gave you on last quarter's fault. This performance was largely due to mark-to-market increases in our private equity portfolio. Looking ahead to the first quarter, compared with the $15 million investment loss in the first quarter of 2009, there should be an improvement of $10 million to $15 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to a minimal mark-to-market investment loss in the first quarter of 2010. Corporate expenses decreased 6% for 2009 to $159 million. We expect corporate expenses to decline further this year.Now let me discuss the recent resolution of the securities lawsuit. In December, the U.S. District Court approved a settlement regarding the securities class action lawsuit that was filed in 2004 related to the NY AG investigation. 96% of the eligible shares are bounced by this settlement. The related ERISA class action lawsuit was also settled. MMC paid $435 million in the fourth quarter to settle these two lawsuits, of which $230 million was covered by insurance. Of the insurance recoverables, we received $163 million in 2009, which was included in our year-end cash position. The remaining $67 million was received in January. The net settlement paid by MMC of $205 million is tax deductible and will contribute to a sizable refund, which we expect to receive this summer. Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments beginning with Risk and Insurance Services. Fourth quarter revenue, excluding fiduciary interest, decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. Risk and Insurance Services operating income rose 13%, despite a drop in fiduciary interest income from $25 million to $12 million. The operating margin in the fourth quarter increased 110 basis points from 14.8% to 15.9%. More importantly, for the entire year, the segment margin increased 530 basis points from 13.3% to 18.6%. Looking specifically at insurance broking, Marsh's fourth quarter revenue decreased 1% to $1.2 billion, reflecting the economic environment as well as pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. Despite these difficult conditions, Marsh increased revenue in many areas of the world, with more than 20 countries growing at least 5%. Additionally, new business remains strong on a global basis. New business generation had a positive progression throughout the year. The second half of 2009 was stronger than the first half, with the fourth quarter being the highest level of the year. Dan and his team continued to do an excellent job in reducing overall expenses, while at the same time, building a stronger, more efficient organization. The continuing focus on expense control drove Marsh's operating expenses down 6% in the fourth quarter. This increased efficiency allowed Marsh to grow operating income more than 20% in the quarter.Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 4%, a good performance considering the difficult market conditions that include increased primary retentions, as well as downward pressure on rates across many lines. And for the year, Carpenter's revenue growth was 8%, led by excellent new business production which, as Brian mentioned, was exceptionally strong. As we have previously discussed, Carpenter's retention rate has also returned to its historical high level, contributing to the overall positive revenue performance.Let's turn to our Consulting segment. The revenue decline of 2% was a substantial improvement from the 10% decrease in the third quarter. We believe the Consulting segment has weathered the worst of the harsh economic environment. Management actions aligned expenses with revenue, producing a 2% decline in operating expenses in the quarter. These efforts resulted in a 17% increase in operating income from $121 million to $142 million. This represents the segment's highest quarterly growth rate in two years. And the operating margin for the Consulting segment increased 140 basis points, from 10.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. As we said on our last call, we felt the third quarter for Mercer would likely represent its most difficult year-over-year revenue comparison. And this appears to have been the case as revenue in the fourth quarter was flat, representing a substantial improvement from the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the decline in rewards, talent and communications was offset by gains in other practices. The retirement, and health and benefits practices grew 2% on a year-over-year basis. Outsourcing rose 3%, and investment consulting and management increased 9%. Michele and her team also did an excellent job of expense management throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses decreased 2%. As a result, Mercer experienced a substantial increase in operating income exceeding 30%. At Oliver Wyman, the rate of revenue declines has moderated over the last two quarters. Although weak economic conditions persist, we saw signs of continued stabilization in the fourth quarter. As Brian mentioned, financial services continued to be a bright spot among Oliver Wyman's industry specialties. Revenue at financial services rose 8% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. And the industry practice serving the retail sector was even stronger, with double-digit revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the year. Other practices continued to experience weakness, though most have improved performance in the fourth quarter. A strict focus on expenses resulted in Oliver Wyman achieving a sequential improvement in operating income and margin for the third consecutive quarter. In the Risk Consulting and Technology segment, Kroll had another solid quarter, particularly as it related to improved profitability. Revenue was flat year-over-year, but adjusted operating income increased threefold. Kroll Ontrack, Kroll's largest business, had revenue growth of 19%. The result of continued strong performance in its litigation support-related services. Additionally, Ben Allen and his team have done an excellent job reducing Kroll's cost base, with a 7% decrease in operating expenses in the fourth quarter. This positive leverage resulted in substantial growth in operating income on a year-over-year basis. Even with the economic sensitivity in many of Kroll's businesses, we expect strong growth and profitability in 2010. Now, I would like to make a few comments about our schedule of non-GAAP measures. MMC has undergone major restructuring actions over the past several years. Marsh implemented widespread initiatives to improve profitability during the past two years. And each of our other operating companies took actions to varying degrees to deal with the recession and to improve their competitive position. Looking forward, we believe future restructuring activities will be focused on the refinement of our support and back-office functions, as well as the integration of acquisitions. Before I discuss our pension plans, let me make a few observations regarding pension plans generally. Defined benefit pension plans can create volatility in a company's P&L, cash flow and balance sheet. A significant driver of this volatility is the movement of long-term corporate bond rates, which companies are required to use to measure pension obligations at the end of each year. With respect to our pension plans, as a result of our preliminary measurement, we are currently projecting that MMC's pension expense will increase in 2010, reducing operating income by approximately $80 million year-over-year.We estimate that declines in long-term corporate bond rates in the U.S. and U.K. account for about two-thirds of our anticipated pension expense increase in 2010. Looking beyond this year, with interest rates and borrowing spreads at relatively low levels today, it seems reasonable to assume that interest rates will increase over the next 12 to 24 months. And looking at only the impact of this one factor, any increase in interest rates will reduce our future pension expense. Regarding the funding of our pension plans, the aggregate level of contributions in 2009 approached $400 million. We currently project that contributions in 2010 should slightly exceed $300 million.Turning to MMC's capital structure, net debt was $1.8 billion at year end, a reduction of $100 million from the end of 2008. The year-end figure includes the impact of funding the settlement of the securities lawsuits. But as I said earlier, does not include all of the insurance recoverables or the tax refund. Shares outstanding at December 31, 2009 were $530 million, an increase of 15.4 million shares through the end of 2008.

The insurance cycle over my career, over 30 years, most of it's been soft, right? And so I think that Marsh can improve in any sort of insurance cycle. And that has less of an impact. The economic results are very considerable. And you see them in a lot of very different ways. One is the cost consciousness in our client base that we have not experienced before. I think that in a lot of the large accounts based worldwide, you see significant involvement of procurement rather than risk managers determining buying decisions. We see a lot of conservatism and caution around project work. And certainly, project work with regard to areas where we have deep expertise, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, supply chain, those areas, I would say, are viewed as more discretionary in, at least, in the short term. We expect some level of bounce back on them in 2010. The other impact the economy has is exposure units. I mean, I've traveled around the world meeting with clients. And I've met with certain clients who have literally told me that their performance is down 70% and levels like that. And so from that standpoint, while there might be a rate reduction of 5% or 7%, it's being applied against an exposure unit, which might be down 25% or 30% or 40%.

And our mantra internally is sort of this -- if it meets our values as a company and if it's good for your client, it's virtually always the right course of action.

But having said that, broadly speaking, it's a civil suit that Mercer, regarding Mercer, first, that Mercer underestimated future health care cost for two of the Alaska pension plans. And two, that Mercer failed to disclose a data entry error to the client back in 2002 and 2003. So on the first point, Mercer believes its estimate of future health care costs were reasonable and in line with the projections made at the time by competitors and other actuaries nationally. And on the second point, Mercer has acknowledged that there was a data entry error that wasn't disclosed to the client in those two years. But Mercer believes the error had no impact on the actual funding of the plans. That's important. In '02 and '03, Mercer advised the plans to substantially increase their contribution rates and the plans did not adopt Mercer's calculations. So Mercer believes it has substantial defenses to these claims. And we'll continue to defend ourselves. The trial's in July in Juneau. We take it very seriously. And I hope you can understand it.

And if the converts is true and then we acquired an agency in which Marsh's commission structure is higher than the agent, then we would immediately go and negotiate with carriers to lift that agency to Marsh's overall levels. So really, we win either way. But I would say that it varies agent by agent. In the first few that we have done, and bear in mind, we have looked a lot of agencies, we've done three transactions where we have looked at structures of a lot of agencies. On the first three that we've done, there's been tremendous similarity between the Marsh standard rates and the agency standard rates."

Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.
I'll begin with some brief comments on the quarter before turning it over to Vanessa to provide additional information regarding our financial results. Then we would be happy to take your questions.
I am pleased to report that Marsh & McLennan’s Companies first quarter earnings performance was very encouraging. Vanessa will go into more detail, but let me say that each of our operating companies is doing an excellent job in managing their respective businesses including carefully controlling their operating expenses. Our performance is all the more impressive in light of the substantial challenges presented by the global recession. Despite signs that recessionary conditions are ebbing, economic weakness continues to affect our operating segments. 
Also, we continue to face soft market conditions in the global property-casualty commercial insurance marketplace. We are now in a seventh year of price declines and, frankly, we see no indication that the overall insurance market will change any time soon. In addition to successfully managing Marsh and Guy Carpenter through extremely turbulent times, Dan, Peter and their management teams are continuing to position their businesses for the future. 
In the first quarter, several positive trends that Marsh has generated over the past two years continued: growth in new business, solid client revenue retention rates, and a focus on controlling operating expenses. At the same time, management is implementing its strategy to improve operational efficiencies, strength in financial results and deliver superior risk and insurance capabilities to clients. And with its improved operating performance, Marsh is turning its attention to growth. 
In the past six months, we've announced seven acquisitions, the largest being HSBC Insurance Brokers. HSBC is a strong fit with Marsh, both operationally and geographically. The transaction was closed April 1, deepens Marsh's presence in the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East. This acquisition should add annualized revenue of approximately $200 million. 
As part of this acquisition, we have also entered into a strategic partnership but HSBC Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, in giving us preferred access to provide insurance broking and risk-management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients. 
Five of our recently-announced acquisitions are part of the Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative. On last quarter's call, I mentioned that we acquired Insurance Alliance, based in Houston; NIA Group, based in New Jersey; and in February of this year, we acquired Haake Companies, based in Kansas. In March, we announced our largest agency acquisition yet, Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., based in Virginia. Rutherfoord, with revenues exceeding $80 million, has more than 300 employees located from Philadelphia to the Gulf Coast. 
And yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Bostonian Group, one of the largest regional brokerages in New England. The firm specializes in employee benefits and has a revenue of approximately $14 million. As you know, our strategy for the Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative is to establish about 10 hubs throughout the United States. As you can see, we’re making great progress toward this objective. 
Guy Carpenter's results in the first quarter of 2010 reflect the positive themes we've talked about for the past year: excellent new business development, strong client revenue retention that remains at historically high levels, and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together, these factors resulted in underlying revenue growth in the quarter, which is impressive when you consider the difficult operating environment and that Guy Carpenter achieved the 10% increase in underlying revenue growth in the first quarter of last year. 
Furthermore, management continued to implement its strategy to grow internationally and to enhance its industry-leading analytical capabilities, while at the same time expanding operating income. We recently announced that Vicky Carter will join Guy Carpenter in September as Vice Chairman, which will further strengthen the Carpenter’s international operations. Vicky has more than 30 years of experience in the reinsurance industry. Based in London, she will report to Henry Keeling, President and CEO of Guy Carpenter, International. She joins Carpenter from Towers Watson, where she served as Chairman of the U.K. international operations. Finally, Carpenter will enhance its capabilities this year when it releases three industry-leading analytical models that will deliver significant value to clients.
Moving on to our Consulting segment, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman have been feeling the effects of the economic downturn for the past two years. However, growth and profitability re-emerged in the fourth quarter of last year and accelerated this quarter. 
Mercer saw underlying revenue growth in the majority of its practices but in total was down 1%. We would expect to see more positive growth starting in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, Michele and her team were able to achieve double-digit growth in operating income, as well as margin improvement in the first quarter. 
Before we move on, I'd like to give you a brief update on the Alaska lawsuit against Mercer. Since our last call, there have been a number of motions that have been filed in the litigation, and a trial is scheduled for early July in Juno. We take this matter very seriously as it represents a significant potential liability for Mercer. We cannot give any assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of the case. Since this is a pending litigation matter, we will not comment further at this time. Please refer to our public filings, including the 10-Q, which we will be filing later this week for more information on this matter.
Moving on to Oliver Wyman, revenue growth was evident in the majority of its businesses. For example, Financial Services, which is Oliver Wyman's largest practice, continue to be a bright spot among industry specialties producing a double-digit percentage increase in revenue. While uncertainty remains, leading indicators across its business support our expectations that Oliver Wyman will continue to produce favorable comparisons in 2010.
Now moving on to Risk Consulting and Technology, Kroll reported another quarter of improved profitability. Kroll Ontrack, its largest business, representing nearly half of its revenue, drove first quarter results with strong underlying revenue growth. As a result of substantial management actions, Kroll is re-establishing higher levels of profitability. 
In summary, let me say again that we feel very good about what we've accomplished throughout MMC in the first quarter. Now let me turn it over to the Vanessa."

First, I'll give an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's capital structure.
Let's start with earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations rose 48% from $0.33 in the first quarter of 2009 to $0.49 in this year's first quarter. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.51, an increase of 31% from $0.39 in the first quarter of 2009. 
As we indicated on last quarter's earnings call, our restructuring activities have been substantially completed. Although we will continue to search for efficiencies, we expect that future activities, as reflected in our schedule of non-GAAP measures, will be focused on the refinement of our support and back-office functions as well as integration of acquisitions such as HSBC Insurance Brokers. 
Additionally, I should point out that discontinued operations, net of tax in the quarter, was primarily due to the February sale of Kroll's Substance Abuse testing business. It had 2009 revenue of $37 million and a sale price of $110 million. Reflecting the de minimis effect and MMC's overall results, we have not restated prior periods for this sale. 
Let's look at the results of MMC's continuing operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. In the first quarter, we are pleased that our strong earnings growth reflects increased operating income for not only each of our three operating segments, but every one of our five operating companies. 
On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 18% compared with last year's first quarter. This is a significant increase, especially considering that higher net pension expense reduced profitability in the first quarter by $20 million. This is in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call. 
Investment income was $8 million in the first quarter. In addition to the mark-to-market gains in our private equity portfolio, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to sell some of our direct equity investments. Looking ahead, we currently anticipate investment income of approximately $10 million in the second quarter of 2010, which should result in a positive swing in EPS of about $0.05 compared with the second quarter of 2009. 
Turning back to this quarter, corporate expenses decreased 6% to $37 million in the first quarter from $39 million last year, consistent with our comments on last quarter's call that we expect corporate expenses to decline.
Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments, beginning with Risk & Insurance Services. On a reported basis, first quarter revenue rose 9% to $1.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth was flat. Risk and Insurance Services’ operating income rose 4% from $343 million to $357 million. 
Looking at insurance broking, Marsh's first quarter revenue rose 8% on a reported basis to $1.2 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue was flat. Despite difficult industry conditions, Marsh increased revenue in many areas of the world, including U.S./Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in new business generation Marsh achieved in the second half of 2009 continued with strong new business in the first quarter. 
Marsh's operating income rose in the first quarter as the continuing focus on controlling expenses more than offset increased pension expense. At the same time, we understand the importance of reinvesting in Marsh. We are continuing to develop and improve our client technologies. Dilutions like Marsh market information, Marsh business analytics and the CS Stars Enterprise Edition are tools that help our clients make better, more data-driven decisions.
Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance in first quarter. On a reported basis, revenue increased 12% to $315 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Underlying growth was 1% -- a good performance considering the headwinds from continued declines in reinsurance pricing in all lines of business and increased retentions by clients. The revenue growth reflects Carpenter's strong new business production that we have seen each quarter since the third quarter of 2008. 
A continued focus on cost containment kept operating expenses flat in the quarter, contributing to operating income growth. Overall, Carpenter achieved double-digit growth in operating income which includes the 2009 acquisitions of Collins and Rattner Mackenzie. We are extremely pleased with these acquisitions.
Now let's turn to our Consulting segment. Reported revenue rose 7% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue growth was 1%. Strong expense control continued, producing a 3% decline in operating expenses in the quarter despite an increase in pension expense. These management efforts resulted in a 57% increase in operating income from $74 million to $116 million, with the operating margin for the Consulting segment increasing 320 basis points. 
Mercer's reported revenue increased 6% in the first quarter to $849 million. Underlying revenue was down 1%. In the first quarter, retirement declined 5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see clients deferring discretionary projects. 
We’re very pleased to report that Health and Benefits grew 2% in the first quarter. The major geographies that contributed to this growth were Canada, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. This growth was in spite of a decline in the U.S. due to a near-term disruption in demand as Congress debated significant legislative changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Since this legislation has been passed, we expect an increase in demands for health and benefit services which should start in the second half of this year. 
Outsourcing revenue rose 3%, driven by new business in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Investment Consulting and Management increased 17%, due to very strong growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. Assets under management were $30 billion. 
Over the past two years, Michele and her team have done an excellent job of anticipating that economic conditions would dampen discretionary spending on the part of clients. As a result, Mercer continues to manage expenses closely. In the first quarter, even including the impact of higher pension expense, operating expenses fell 2%. Mercer achieved double-digit growth in operating income as well as margin improvement. 
Oliver Wyman generated strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Reported revenue grew 10% to $306 million and underlying growth was 6%. This continues the improving fundamentals for Oliver Wyman that began to develop in the second half of 2009. 
Among its industry specialties, Financial Services continued its strong performance. Reflecting the improving health of this sector, revenue rose double digits in the first quarter. Oliver Wyman is also seeing modest growth in the consumer sector and stabilization in the industrial sector. While some areas continue to experience weakness, we are very pleased that Oliver Wyman's revenue and profitability improvement in the first quarter.
Let's move to Risk Consulting and Technology. Kroll had another strong quarter of improved profitability. Revenue was down 3% to $162 million on a reported basis and 2% underlying. Operating income doubled. 
Since we sold Kroll Labs in mid-February, its results are included for only half of the first quarter. Given the underlying trends, the operating leverage created in 2009, and seasonality, we expect Q1 to be Kroll's lightest. Kroll's improved profitability was made possible by a turnaround in Risk Mitigation & Response as well as strong performance from Ontrack. 
Kroll Ontrack, Kroll's largest business, had revenue growth of 8%. While Background Screening was down 9%, pre-employment reports, which are more of a leading indicator, increased, reflecting an encouraging sign in the U.S. and U.K. employment markets. Due to the introduction of a new income verification product, the outlook for Kroll's Mortgage [ph] Origination business is more encouraging than current market conditions might indicate. 
Additionally, Ben Allen and his team continue to do an excellent job managing Kroll’s cost space with an 8% decrease in operating expenses in the first quarter. This positive leverage resulted in substantial growth in operating income and margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. We expect Kroll's growth and profitability to continue as we move forward in 2010.
Turning to MMC's capital structure. Net debt was $2.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. As you know, our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the funding of incentive compensation payments. 
Also, we used approximately $200 million of cash for acquisitions. This was primarily for HSBC Insurance Brokers. Although this deal closed on April 1, the cash was put in escrow on March 31. 
Shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were 541 million, an increase of 24 million from a year ago. The primary use of stock was 18 million shares for acquisitions, the largest of which were Collins in the second quarter of 2009 and Rutherfoord in the first quarter of 2010. 6 million shares w used for restricted stock and an employee stock purchase plan.
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

So let me start by saying that we've been very consistent in our approach. As I've said before, we believe the broader issue relate to all carrier revenue streams and the potential conflicts of interest that they present. All brokers receive carrier compensation in one form or another, and each of these arrangements requires a good system of internal controls to manage complex and, in our opinion, complete transparency to clients. At March, we operate in many different businesses in many different parts of the world, and the compensation norms differ significantly among them. So we recognize that there’s no one-size-fits-all model for compensation. The one thing we are committed to, however, is transparency in putting the interests of our clients first. When we looked specifically at contingent commission, we made a statement a month or so ago which was that we will not accept contingent compensation or contingent commission on any placements anywhere in the world for any U.S. client served by our core U.S. brokerage operation. Now we did that not out of any concern for the propriety of contingent commissions nor any concern about our ability to manage conflicts of interest. Rather, we did it in response to discussions we had with clients, but more particularly because we can be fairly -- our belief that we can be fairly compensated in that segment without contingent compensation. So the short answer, the summary, is we will take contingent commission in certain parts of the world and in certain segments, but in our core U.S. brokerage segment we will not."

So in terms of the agency, I’m very satisfied with what our progress has been. I mean, right now with our acquisition which we announced yesterday of the Bostonian group, we would be the ninth-largest agent broker in the United States once you exclude the three global brokers. So I am very positive about that. Our strategy was to start by purchasing high-quality hubs, platform hubs in which to do fold-in and bolt-on acquisitions later down the road. And really, that's where our focus has been. And there’s always competition in the marketplace for these assets but we have not been in any auction environments. In fact, I don't think we would participate in that kind of environment. We’re interested in finding agencies in which we believe they have high-quality management teams, management teams that focus mainly on capabilities and driving value for clients and that fit in with Marsh's overall values and culture. Even though the agencies themselves won't be integrated within Marsh, they'll be integrated with Marsh & McLennan Agency. Marsh as an organization still stands for certain things, and we want to make sure that any acquisition that we make meets that criteria. So in terms of our hub and platform acquisitions, there are other people interested but we have not seen dramatic levels of people. I think it's fair to say that some of the players who had been active acquirers before are more on the sidelines now. In terms of multiples, I'm a buyer. I'd always prefer lower multiples. The multiples, it’s clear, are significantly lower than what existed three or four years ago. But as a buyer, I'd always want a lower multiple if we could. But they are definitely consistent with the strategy that we outline in terms of our five-year plan as to what range of multiple on EBIT we would be willing to pay for hub and platform acquisitions."

Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.
I'll begin with some brief comments on the quarter before turning it over to Vanessa to provide additional information regarding our financial results. Then we would be happy to take your questions.
I am pleased to report that Marsh & McLennan’s Companies first quarter earnings performance was very encouraging. Vanessa will go into more detail, but let me say that each of our operating companies is doing an excellent job in managing their respective businesses, including carefully controlling their operating expenses. Our performance is all the more impressive in light of the substantial challenges presented by the global recession. Despite signs that recessionary conditions are ebbing, economic weakness continues to affect our operating segments. 
Also, we continue to face soft market conditions in the global property-casualty commercial insurance marketplace. We are now in a seventh year of price declines and, frankly, we see no indication that the overall insurance market will change any time soon. In addition to successfully managing Marsh and Guy Carpenter through extremely turbulent times, Dan, Peter and their management teams are continuing to position their businesses for the future. 
In the first quarter, several positive trends that Marsh has generated over the past two years continued: Growth in new business, solid client revenue retention rates and a focus on controlling operating expenses. At the same time, management is implementing its strategy to improve operational efficiencies, strengthen financial results and deliver superior risk and insurance capabilities to clients. And with its improved operating performance, Marsh is turning its attention to growth. 
In the past six months, we've announced seven acquisitions, the largest being HSBC Insurance Brokers. HSBC is a strong fit with Marsh, both operationally and geographically. The transaction was closed April 1, deepens Marsh's presence in the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East. This acquisition should add annualized revenue of approximately $200 million. 
As part of this acquisition, we have also entered into a strategic partnership with HSBC Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, giving us preferred access to provide insurance broking and risk-management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients. 
Five of our recently-announced acquisitions are part of the Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative. On last quarter's call, I mentioned that we acquired Insurance Alliance, based in Houston; NIA Group, based in New Jersey; and in February of this year, we acquired Haake Companies, based in Kansas. In March, we announced our largest agency acquisition yet, Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., based in Virginia. Rutherfoord, with revenues exceeding $80 million, has more than 300 employees located from Philadelphia to the Gulf Coast. 
And yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Bostonian Group, one of the largest regional brokerages in New England. The firm specializes in employee benefits and has revenue of approximately $14 million. As you know, our strategy for the Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative is to establish about 10 hubs throughout the United States. As you can see, we’re making great progress toward this objective. 
Guy Carpenter's results in the first quarter of 2010 reflect the positive themes we've talked about for the past year: Excellent new business development, strong client revenue retention that remains at historically high levels and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together, these factors resulted in underlying revenue growth in the quarter, which is impressive when you consider the difficult operating environment and that Guy Carpenter achieved the 10% increase in underlying revenue growth in the first quarter of last year. 
Furthermore, management continued to implement its strategy to grow internationally and to enhance its industry-leading analytical capabilities, while at the same time expanding operating income. We recently announced that Vicky Carter will join Guy Carpenter in September as Vice Chairman, which will further strengthen the Carpenter’s international operations. Vicky has more than 30 years of experience in the reinsurance industry. Based in London, she will report to Henry Keeling, President and CEO of Guy Carpenter, International. She joins Carpenter from Towers Watson, where she served as Chairman of the U.K. international operations. Finally, Carpenter will enhance its capabilities this year when it releases three industry-leading analytical models that will deliver significant value to clients.
Moving on to our Consulting segment, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman have been feeling the effects of the economic downturn for the past two years. However, growth and profitability re-emerged in the fourth quarter of last year and accelerated this quarter. 
Mercer saw underlying revenue growth in the majority of its practices but in total was down 1%. We would expect to see more positive growth starting in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, Michele and her team were able to achieve double-digit growth in operating income, as well as margin improvement in the first quarter. 
Before we move on, I'd like to give you a brief update on the Alaska lawsuit against Mercer. Since our last call, there have been a number of motions that have been filed in the litigation, and a trial is scheduled for early July in Juno. We take this matter very seriously as it represents a significant potential liability for Mercer. We cannot give any assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of the case. Since this is a pending litigation matter, we will not comment further at this time. Please refer to our public filings, including the 10-Q, which we will be filing later this week for more information on this matter.
Moving on to Oliver Wyman, revenue growth was evident in the majority of its businesses. For example, Financial Services, which is Oliver Wyman's largest practice, continue to be a bright spot among industry specialties producing a double-digit percentage increase in revenue. While uncertainty remains, leading indicators across its business support our expectations that Oliver Wyman will continue to produce favorable comparisons in 2010.
Now moving on to Risk Consulting and Technology, Kroll reported another quarter of improved profitability. Kroll Ontrack, its largest business, representing nearly half of its revenue, drove first quarter results with strong underlying revenue growth. As a result of substantial management actions, Kroll is re-establishing higher levels of profitability. 
In summary, let me say again that we feel very good about what we've accomplished throughout MMC in the first quarter. Now let me turn it over to the Vanessa."
473342,104430526,60884,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. There are several areas I'll cover in my remarks this morning. First, I'll give an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companie",1492,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. There are several areas I'll cover in my remarks this morning. First, I'll give an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's capital structure.
Let's start with earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations rose 48% from $0.33 in the first quarter of 2009 to $0.49 in this year's first quarter. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.51, an increase of 31% from $0.39 in the first quarter of 2009. 
As we indicated on last quarter's earnings call, our restructuring activities have been substantially completed. Although we will continue to search for efficiencies, we expect that future activities, as reflected in our schedule of non-GAAP measures, will be focused on the refinement of our support and back-office functions as well as integration of acquisitions such as HSBC Insurance Brokers. 
Additionally, I should point out that discontinued operations, net of tax in the quarter, was primarily due to the February sale of Kroll's Substance Abuse testing business. It had 2009 revenue of $37 million and a sale price of $110 million. Reflecting the de minimis effect and MMC's overall results, we have not restated prior periods for this sale. 
Let's look at the results of MMC's continuing operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. In the first quarter, we are pleased that our strong earnings growth reflects increased operating income for not only each of our three operating segments, but every one of our five operating companies. 
On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 18% compared with last year's first quarter. This is a significant increase, especially considering that higher net pension expense reduced profitability in the first quarter by $20 million. This is in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call. 
Investment income was $8 million in the first quarter. In addition to the mark-to-market gains in our private equity portfolio, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to sell some of our direct equity investments. Looking ahead, we currently anticipate investment income of approximately $10 million in the second quarter of 2010, which should result in a positive swing in EPS of about $0.05 compared with the second quarter of 2009. 
Turning back to this quarter, corporate expenses decreased 6% to $37 million in the first quarter from $39 million last year, consistent with our comments on last quarter's call that we expect corporate expenses to decline.
Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments, beginning with Risk & Insurance Services. On a reported basis, first quarter revenue rose 9% to $1.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth was flat. Risk and Insurance Services’ operating income rose 4% from $343 million to $357 million. 
Looking at insurance broking, Marsh's first quarter revenue rose 8% on a reported basis to $1.2 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue was flat. Despite difficult industry conditions, Marsh increased revenue in many areas of the world, including U.S./Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in new business generation Marsh achieved in the second half of 2009 continued with strong new business in the first quarter. 
Marsh's operating income rose in the first quarter as the continuing focus on controlling expenses more than offset increased pension expense. At the same time, we understand the importance of reinvesting in Marsh. We are continuing to develop and improve our client technologies. Solutions like Marsh market information, Marsh business analytics and the CS STARS Enterprise Edition are tools that help our clients make better, more data-driven decisions.
Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance in first quarter. On a reported basis, revenue increased 12% to $315 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Underlying growth was 1%,  a good performance considering the headwinds from continued declines in reinsurance pricing in all lines of business and increased retentions by clients. The revenue growth reflects Carpenter's strong new business production that we have seen each quarter since the third quarter of 2008. 
A continued focus on cost containment kept operating expenses flat in the quarter, contributing to operating income growth. Overall, Carpenter achieved double-digit growth in operating income which includes the 2009 acquisitions of Collins and Rattner Mackenzie. We are extremely pleased with these acquisitions.
Now let's turn to our Consulting segment. Reported revenue rose 7% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue growth was 1%. Strong expense control continued, producing a 3% decline in operating expenses in the quarter despite an increase in pension expense. These management efforts resulted in a 57% increase in operating income from $74 million to $116 million, with the operating margin for the Consulting segment increasing 320 basis points. 
Mercer's reported revenue increased 6% in the first quarter to $849 million. Underlying revenue was down 1%. In the first quarter, retirement declined 5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see clients deferring discretionary projects. 
We’re very pleased to report that Health and Benefits grew 2% in the first quarter. The major geographies that contributed to this growth were Canada, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. This growth was in spite of a decline in the U.S. due to a near-term disruption in demand as Congress debated significant legislative changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Since this legislation has been passed, we expect an increase in demands for health and benefit services which should start in the second half of this year. 
Outsourcing revenue rose 3%, driven by new business in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Investment Consulting and Management increased 17%, due to very strong growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. Assets under management were $30 billion. 
Over the past two years, Michele and her team have done an excellent job of anticipating that economic conditions would dampen discretionary spending on the part of clients. As a result, Mercer continues to manage expenses closely. In the first quarter, even including the impact of higher pension expense, operating expenses fell 2%. Mercer achieved double-digit growth in operating income as well as margin improvement. 
Oliver Wyman generated strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Reported revenue grew 10% to $306 million and underlying growth was 6%. This continues the improving fundamentals for Oliver Wyman that began to develop in the second half of 2009. 
Among its industry specialties, Financial Services continued its strong performance. Reflecting the improving health of this sector, revenue rose double digits in the first quarter. Oliver Wyman is also seeing modest growth in the consumer sector and stabilization in the industrial sector. While some areas continue to experience weakness, we are very pleased that Oliver Wyman's revenue and profitability improvement in the first quarter.
Let's move to Risk Consulting and Technology. Kroll had another strong quarter of improved profitability. Revenue was down 3% to $162 million on a reported basis and 2% underlying. Operating income doubled. 
Since we sold Kroll Labs in mid-February, its results are included for only half of the first quarter. Given the underlying trends, the operating leverage created in 2009 and seasonality, we expect Q1 to be Kroll's lightest. Kroll's improved profitability was made possible by a turnaround in Risk Mitigation & Response as well as strong performance from Ontrack. 
Kroll Ontrack, Kroll's largest business, had revenue growth of 8%. While Background Screening was down 9%, pre-employment reports, which are more of a leading indicator, increased, reflecting an encouraging sign in the U.S. and U.K. employment markets. Due to the introduction of a new income verification product, the outlook for Kroll's Mortgage [ph] Origination business is more encouraging than current market conditions might indicate. 
Additionally, Ben Allen and his team continue to do an excellent job managing Kroll’s cost space with an 8% decrease in operating expenses in the first quarter. This positive leverage resulted in substantial growth in operating income and margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. We expect Kroll's growth and profitability to continue as we move forward in 2010.
Turning to MMC's capital structure. Net debt was $2.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. As you know, our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the funding of incentive compensation payments. 
Also, we used approximately $200 million of cash for acquisitions. This was primarily for HSBC Insurance Brokers. Although this deal closed on April 1, the cash was put in escrow on March 31. 
Shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were 541 million, an increase of 24 million from a year ago. The primary use of stock was 18 million shares for acquisitions, the largest of which were Collins in the second quarter of 2009 and Rutherfoord in the first quarter of 2010. 6 million shares w used for restricted stock and an employee stock purchase plan.
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

As we go forward, we will continue to make very conservative decisions as we look at acquisitions, and you saw us use cash at the very end of the first quarter for HSBC.

So let me start by saying that we've been very consistent in our approach. As I've said before, we believe the broader issue relates to all carrier revenue streams and the potential conflicts of interest that they present. All brokers receive carrier compensation in one form or another, and each of these arrangements requires a good system of internal controls to manage complex and, in our opinion, complete transparency to clients. At March, we operate in many different businesses in many different parts of the world, and the compensation norms differ significantly among them. So we recognize that there’s no one-size-fits-all model for compensation. The one thing we are committed to, however, is transparency and putting the interests of our clients first. When we looked specifically at contingent commission, we made a statement a month or so ago which was that we will not accept contingent compensation or contingent commission on any placements anywhere in the world for any U.S. client served by our core U.S. brokerage operation. Now we did that not out of any concern for the propriety of contingent commissions, nor any concern about our ability to manage conflicts of interest, rather, we did it in response to discussions we had with clients, but more particularly because we can be fairly -- our belief that we can be fairly compensated in that segment without contingent compensation. So the short answer, the summary, is we will take contingent commission in certain parts of the world and in certain segments, but in our core U.S. brokerage segment we will not."

So in terms of the agency, I’m very satisfied with what our progress has been. I mean, right now with our acquisition which we announced yesterday of the Bostonian Group, we would be the ninth-largest agent broker in the United States once you exclude the three global brokers. So I am very positive about that. Our strategy was to start by purchasing high-quality hubs, platform hubs in which to do fold-in and bolt-on acquisitions later down the road. And really, that's where our focus has been. And there’s always competition in the marketplace for these assets but we have not been in any auction environments. In fact, I don't think we would participate in that kind of environment. We’re interested in finding agencies in which we believe they have high-quality management teams, management teams that focus mainly on capabilities and driving value for clients and that fit in with Marsh's overall values and culture. Even though the agencies themselves won't be integrated within Marsh, they'll be integrated with Marsh & McLennan Agency. Marsh as an organization still stands for certain things, and we want to make sure that any acquisition that we make meets that criteria. So in terms of our hub and platform acquisitions, there are other people interested but we have not seen dramatic levels of people. I think it's fair to say that some of the players who had been active acquirers before are more on the sidelines now. In terms of multiples, I'm a buyer. I'd always prefer lower multiples. The multiples, it’s clear, are significantly lower than what existed three or four years ago. But as a buyer, I'd always want a lower multiple if we could. But they are definitely consistent with the strategy that we outline in terms of our five-year plan as to what range of multiple on EBIT we would be willing to pay for hub and platform acquisitions."

And so I think what you would find is that there may be some upward pressure or concern in the offshore-drilling-rig marketplace. I don't even think that this loss is large enough to extend that concern to the entire energy marketplace. And in terms of size of loss, we don't have precise numbers. But in terms of the insurable amount of this loss, most prognosticators are using a number between $1 billion and $2 billion. And so even if you say it’s the upper end of that or even more than that level, it would not be enough to, in itself, impact either buying behaviors or the overall insurance marketplace."

Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; John Drzik of Oliver Wyman; and Ben Allen of Kroll, who is joining us for his last MMC conference call. Also, with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. 
I'll begin by making several comments, then turn it over to Vanessa to discuss our financial results. After that, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Let me start by saying I am pleased to report that MMC continued to make progress in the second quarter, producing strong earnings performance. Our operating companies continue to do an excellent job in managing their respective businesses. Our performance is impressive given the continued challenges presented by soft market conditions in the global property, casualty, commercial insurance marketplace, which shows no signs of abating and the overall weak economic environment in the developed markets. 
Insurance industry capital remains plentiful. Insured losses have been within normalized ranges and competition among underwriters remains intense. As I joined MMC as CEO in early 2008, I and the rest of the senior management team has spent considerable time and effort on resolving a number of legacy issues that prevented the company from operating at its fullest potential. I've mentioned several of these on previous calls, including the matters within Marsh that substantially depressed its operating performance through 2007. Marsh's performance has improved dramatically since then, due to the efforts of Marsh's senior management team, led by Dan Glaser, its CEO. 
Changes were also needed at Guy Carpenter. Peter Zaffino was appointed CEO in early 2008 and has overseen an impressive turnaround as evidenced by re-energized new business production, strict expense control and improved profitability. As an organization, we also had to adapt to the requirements imposed by the agreement reached with the New York Attorney General in 2005. For several years, we were required to compete on an unlevel playing field. We are gratified that with our involvement and perspective, the New York regulators revised the agreement earlier this year, leveling the playing field for Marsh and other large brokers. Additionally, we recently addressed two other significant matters. The sale of Kroll and the settlement of the Alaska litigation.
Over the past six years, Kroll has been a valued member of the MMC family. However, after careful analysis we concluded that MMC's long-term strategy should be the focus on our Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting businesses. We ran a very tightly-managed process for assessing the market value of Kroll, culminating in an agreement to sell Kroll to Altegrity, which we announced in June. Altegrity, an international screening and securities solutions firm, should be a superb partner for Kroll. We expect the deal to close this week, nearly two months earlier than originally projected. I want to thank Ben Allen for his leadership of Kroll over the last two years and recognize the tremendous efforts that he and his team undertook to ensure a successful transaction for MMC's shareholders. We wish Ben and his colleagues continued success with their new partners. 
In June, we settled the Alaska litigation against Mercer. Given the uncertainty of the jury trial in Juneau where a high percentage of residents have a direct connection to the retiree medical plans involved in the litigation, we determined that a settlement was in MMC's best interest. I would like to take this opportunity to give special recognition to Peter Beshar, MMC's Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Peter has done an outstanding job in managing the complex legal matters faced by MMC in recent years.
In summary, due to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues and the leadership demonstrated by our management team over the past two and a half years, we have addressed a number of issues that has impeded our ability to operate at full strength. Moving forward, our goal is to establish MMC as a world-class growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Generating superior, long-term total return for shareholders was a hallmark of MMC's first four decades as a public company. We believe we can achieve this status once again because of our leading market positions and the long-term growth characteristics of our businesses. To return to this record of performance, we will focus on four major pillars in the coming years: growth, low capital requirements, generating high levels of cash and lowering MMC's risk profile. I'll touch briefly on these.
First, earnings growth. We are committed to generating long term, sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Within each of our businesses and our global footprint, MMC should produce long-term organic revenue growth augmented by acquisitions at least equal to global GDP growth. A continuing focus on expense discipline, which is even more important during the cyclical downturns, will expand margins and lead to superior long-term earnings growth.
The second is low capital requirements. As a professional services firm, we don't require significant capital investments to successfully run our businesses. Unlike an insurance underwriter, MMC is not capital intensive and should not require a large balance sheet. We expect to maintain low capital requirements in each of our businesses. 
Third is high cash generation. Our businesses generate strong operating cash flow. As a result of MMC's cash earnings, we should equal or exceed our reported earnings. With long-term earnings per share growth, low capital requirements and the completion of the bulk of our restructuring activities, we should generate significant cash flow in future years.
Fourth and finally, the lowering of our risk profile. In addressing the legacy issues earlier, I noted we had made important progress in reducing the overall risk characteristics of MMC. In addition, we have implemented enhanced organizational, operational and risk management measurements that should contribute to further reducing the company's risk profile. 
To summarize, it is our belief that the successful execution of these four pillars over the next several years will restore MMC to its preeminent position as a global growth company. With a clear strategic direction, a strong competitive position, a cohesive management team and long-term growth prospects, we embrace the challenges of the future. We will provide more insights into MMC's operational and financial characteristics on September 30, when we will host an Investor Day in New York. We are in the process of sending out invitations to members of the investment community. We hope we will have the opportunity to have you join us. 
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa."

Next, I'll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's cash position.
On a GAAP basis, EPS in the second quarter of 2010 was $0.43 due to the inclusion of the Alaska settlement, we had a $0.06 loss from continuing operations. Kroll is now classified as a discontinued operation. A significant tax benefit from this pending disposition results in earnings from discontinued operations of $0.49 per share. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.46, an increase of 28% from $0.36 in last year's second quarter. For a more appropriate earnings comparisons, Kroll's operating results are included in adjusted earnings for all periods. Kroll contributed $0.03 to adjusted EPS in the second quarter, with an 8% increase in underlying revenue and strong growth in profitability and margins. To assist the investment community with financial modeling, the supplemental schedules included with this morning's press release detail the reclassification for the first quarter of 2010 as well as the four quarters of 2009.
Turning to the results of MMC's continuing operations, unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expense and adjusted operating income. On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 8% compared with last year's second quarter. Investment income was $18 million in the quarter, primarily due to mark-to-market gains at Trident II. This is compared with a loss of $32 million last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we currently anticipate an investment loss in the third quarter of $5 million, a negative swing in EPS of $0.04 from the third quarter of 2009. Corporate expenses decreased from $38 million to $36 million, consistent with the positive trends we saw in the first quarter. The effect of foreign currency translation on MMC's earnings in the second quarter was de minimis, with a slight positive at Risk and Insurance Services and a slight negative in the Consulting segment. Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments.
On a reported basis, second quarter revenue for Risk and Insurance Services rose 9% to $1.5 billion, and underlying growth was 1%. Operating income increased 11% from $271 million to $302 million. In the second quarter, we began the process of integrating the operations of HSBC Insurance Brokers into both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Additional restructuring charges will be incurred in the second half of the year. 
Marsh's second quarter revenue rose 9% on a reported basis to $1.2 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 1%, reflecting an improvement from the first quarter. In fact, Marsh's generated sequential improvement since the third quarter last year from minus 2% to minus 1% to flat, and now to growth of 1% in the second quarter. Marsh's international operations, particularly Asia Pacific and Latin America, drove revenue growth. 
The positive momentum in new business generation has continued in the second quarter with strong new business growth of 11% globally. Even while investing significant amounts back into the business and with higher pension expense, operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter. This resulted in growth in Marsh's operating income and margin. Guy Carpenter continued to generate revenue growth in the second quarter despite significant headwinds, including declines in both primary and reinsurance pricing, increased retentions by clients and declines in insurance exposures.
On a reported basis, revenue increased 7% to $243 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Underlying growth was 2%, reflecting the sixth sequential quarter of growth, and excellent performance. This revenue growth reflects Carpenter's strong revenue retention rate and new business production, led by its international operations. Cost containment efforts contributed to solid growth in operating income in the quarter. 
In our Consulting segment, reported revenue rose 2% to $1.2 billion. Underlying growth was also 2%, the second consecutive quarter of growth. Operating expenses, including higher pension costs, were held to 2% growth. Operating income decreased slightly from $131 million to $127 million. For the six months, operating income rose 19% from $205 million to $243 million with growth in the operating margin of 130 basis points. 
Mercer's reported revenue increased 1% in the second quarter to $838 million. Underlying revenue was down 1%, unchanged from the first quarter. In the second quarter, global demand for retirement consulting remain subdued as clients were generally reluctant to commit to discretionary work, similar to the first quarter. Health and benefits grew 2% for the third consecutive quarter. We saw growth in all of the major geographies except the U.S. 
Outsourcing revenue was stable in the quarter. Affirming our strategy, investment consulting and management increased 17% for the second consecutive quarter with very strong growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Oliver Wyman generated strong revenue growth in the second quarter. Reported revenue grew 6% to $330 million and underlying growth was 8%. This continues the improving fundamentals that began to emerge at the end of 2009. Among its industry specialties, Financial Services, representing almost 40% of revenue, continued its strong performance. 
Revenue rose double digits in the second quarter, reflecting the improving health of this sector. A number of other business sectors, most notably manufacturing and transportation also saw solid growth. Oliver Wyman generated growth in operating income and margin improvement, not only in the second quarter, but also year-to-date. 
Cash at the end of the second quarter was $1.5 billion, and upon the closing of the Kroll transaction we will receive cash proceeds of $1.13 billion. Additionally, we expect to receive an accumulated cash tax benefit of roughly $260 million, resulting from not only this disposition, but the sale of operations within Risk Consulting and Technology over the past two years. We expect to receive this cash tax benefit over the next six to nine months. On August 10, we will have an outflow of cash of $400 million, representing the Alaska settlement, net of insurance. We have a $550 million debt maturity in September that we will fund with cash. We have no other debt maturing until March 2012. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

We've articulated our strategy with respect to the brokerage with the Marsh & McLennan agencies and done some other acquisitions, and we were behind in that area because, with the issues at Marsh, it wouldn't make any sense to put additional companies together with it. But that's changed, and so we've been devoting our energies to the brokerage side. But that doesn't mean that acquisitions are not in the future of the Consulting. Certainly, we have been doing that over time, and I would expect that to continue. I think it's really a reflection of the fact that we had not been addressing the needs of the brokerage side. And so that's -- I think you'll see acquisitions going forward, and I mentioned that in my growth comments."

And the way that I would view our margins pickup, if you will, is as follows. First of all, I've talked before about the amount of work that we have put in as a company in terms of two things. First of all, retooling, in general, our infrastructure to better be able to leverage our business across all the geographies that we have. And secondly, we spent a significant amount of effort to retool our risk profile. And those efforts started in 2005 and '06 and have continued over the last four years so that our risk profile is different. In fact, I believe our risk is much better managed at this point in time. I think thirdly, it's important to remember that Mercer undertook a strategy about 2005, 2006 that should build out its three pillars. Our Consulting segment is quite strong. From a margin perspective, outsourcing and investments we have been growing and investing in. So we talk about a lot about M&A with this company and M&A being inorganic. But there is a way to look at Mercer that says that there's been a significant amount of organic M&A by building out outsourcing and investments. So in summary, if you look at that profile, we have two businesses that we've been investing in for five years that are rapidly maturing in terms of their infrastructure, as well as a better infrastructure overall, which would lead to an expectation of expanded margins for some time to come."

Once we get past our dividend policy, which should be significant, we would return it to shareholders in different ways. And I think the best way, frankly, is to continue to grow this company. As we ask about M&A earlier, I would use the cash for M&A purposes. We have a pipeline in the agency side, potential for the Consulting. So it is a question of what is best for the shareholders, what's the best return. In that equation, one has to consider the question of stock buybacks, so it would be a use if it is the best use for the ultimate benefit.

And that's how this company has grown over time, and I think that's the way it's going to continue to grow."

The underlying fundamentals in the market really make it tough to generate any kind of consistency, and the result is that a few key pieces of business falling in one quarter or another really change the results so change the numbers quite a bit. That said, I'm very pleased with how the U.S. business and Canadian business is actually performing. We've had solid new business in the U.S. Canada division as an example, $89 million, which was 6% growth part of the overall $229 million in the quarter. Our account retention levels are still very strong in the low 90s. And actually not only strong, but very stable with where they were last year as well. So the basic business is performing, and I don't believe that the minus four represents a new trend. I think that we're more likely, that you'll look at that as a six-month trend rather than a quarter."

Our underlying growth in -- and by the way, I'm an internationalist. So growth is growth, it doesn't matter much to me as to whether it's appearing in one spot or another, we run our business as a firm. When I look at our overall business in international growing 6% in the quarter, with really very strong growth in both Asia Pacific and also Latin America, and decent growth, 3% growth in EMEA. So it was really very broad based. More than 35 countries or territories grew more than 5% for us in the second quarter and 20 of those grew more than 15%. So I feel very good about where we're performing on a growth standpoint. And to me, margin -- there are -- we clearly are interested in growing our margin over time. As you know, it's a lot easier to do that when you're moving the top line. Having said that though, we focused on aligning our expense base with our revenues. So I'm quite comfortable that even in a very low growth environment, we would still be able to move our margins. We have a bit of a headwind now because as you know, our pension expense has grown a little bit. But in our view, we have just really started on looking at our business in a strategic way, reducing the number of process steps, creating less variability on how we handle business. And that will take, in my view, a significant amount of cost out of the business over the coming few years."

Between the six months to three months, we're seeing improvement in Consulting. We improved about one percentage point, still negative, but it's going in the right direction. The Retirement business remains subdued for those economic reasons, as well as the nature of that business. I think it's important to remember in Retirement that it is a big component of that Consulting number that we had positive growth in the second quarter and the first quarter of 2009, which is a little bit unusual. So as we continue to come off those comparabilities I think we'll see some growth in Retirement. Our H&B is showing some growth. And importantly, while Talent and Rewards is still negative, it is improving significantly quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we see a 3% decline in our Consulting business. But as you decompose it, it's actually some signs of positive things. The Talent and Rewards business tends to be the business that leads the way in terms of being a bit of a shift. I've took some optimism from that, not just about Mercer's business, but perhaps about the economic environment, which is still quite uncertain and bouncing around along the geographies. But at least in that area, it typically is an area that gives us some indication of what people are willing to spend discretionary dollars on. Outsourcing is doing what we expected to do. It's a strong business that's stable and it's continuing to have a strong pipeline of sale, which we will see, show up in 2011. So I think it's doing what we expected to do as the second pillar of a three-pillar strategy. And investments is doing exactly the same thing, investment has 17% growth across the six months and it's very exciting for us and also producing quarter-after-quarter. So I think both of those things together are important. When I step back from the Consulting basis doing more or less what one might expect in an uncertain economy with growth showing up in the right places, outsourcing holding stable and then investments leading the way with significant growth rates. And so as I've look at it, I feel pretty comfortable with where we are and continue to believe that Mercer's going to show overall growth in the low single digits some time during this year."

First of all, in regard to contingent commissions, we've been very consistent in our approach. As I've said before, the broader issue in our mind relate to all carrier revenue streams and the potential conflicts of interest that they present. All brokers, all of them, receive carrier compensation in one form or another and each of these arrangements requires a good system of internal controls to manage those conflicts. So I do think that the view that contingent commissions could represent the only conflict of interest facing insurance brokers is simplistic and actually wrong. In our view recently, Aon announced a change in their position. I respect their position. But as we've said, we do not intend to pursue contingent commissions on our Brokerage business in the U.S. and Canada. In other parts of our business around the world, though, we will consider taking them where appropriate. And one of the things is, over the last couple of years, we have been pursuing higher retail commissions and enhanced commissions now successfully. And so I don't see a material uplift certainly in the near term from our release from the settlement agreement. And enhanced yield, in terms of higher retail commission or enhanced commission or fee-for-services types of payment are an integral part of our revenue stream and their recurring revenues and they're very different from contingents. So on that basis, we don't plan on separately disclosing them."

Secondly, the move is a clear, if you will, endorsement of the Mercer three-pillar strategy, and a lot of a conversation around that acquisition confirms our strategy, which we believe very strongly as you hear me say quarter-after-quarter. And so I feel very good about that. And then finally, I believe that our business is quite strong. We have had to -- through this significant recession, we have done less damage to our Consulting organization of this size and scope than one might expect. And given that we are well positioned to spring forward as we hope the economy begins to recover and deploy all our assets in the marketplace right away. I feel very good about it.

So overall, the H&B business is strong. We focused a lot on the U.S. because it is a very significant part of that portfolio and it is also strong with regard to Consulting services, and it's growing and stabling and beginning to grow with regard to the Brokerage Services. The differential with the Brokerage end is that we are still lapping headcount reductions and that revenue is driven strictly by that.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michelle Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. 
I am pleased to report that in the third quarter, MMC produced strong revenue growth of 7% or 4% on an underlying basis. We are seeing some signs of the effects of the great recession are diminishing. However, overall economic conditions remain weak. Also, the insurance services segment continues to face the challenges presented by soft market conditions in the global property casualty marketplace. Even in this difficult operating environment, however, each of our four operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. This is the first quarter this has occurred since 2007. 
About six weeks ago, MMC held its first Investor Day under this management team. I was very pleased so many of the members of the investment community were able to attend, and many of us took advantage of the opportunity to watch our live video webcast. The entire program, which included presentations by each of the heads of our operating companies, as well as Vanessa's financial overview, remains available for viewing on our website, www.mmc.com. I would like to spend a few minutes reinforcing some of the major themes I talked about at Investor Day in making the investment case for MMC. 
In the 40 years after Marsh & McLennan companies became a public company in 1962, two of our most notable hallmarks were sustained growth and adjusted earnings per share and total return to shareholders. However, MMC operated in a crisis mode from late 2004 through the end of 2007. As a result,  new management was installed nearly three years ago. Since then, we have successfully resolved legacy issues that prevented the company from operating at its fullest potential. 
Today, MMC is comprised of four great companies: Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Each is a leader in its field and is led by a strong management team focused on enhancing growth in revenue and more importantly, earnings. Our goal is to establish MMC as an elite global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. 
To return to a record of superior long-term performance, we will focus on four major pillars in the coming years. First, growth. We are committed to generating long-term revenue and earnings growth. MMC should produce long-term organic revenue growth at least equal to global GDP growth, augmented by acquisitions. And a continuing focus on expense discipline should expand margins and lead to 10% growth in operating income in a multitude of operating environments. 
We are beginning to see the results of the strategy in MMC's financial performance for the first nine months of 2010, which is more indicative of our performance in any one particular quarter. Through the third quarter, MMC produced 11% growth in adjusted operating income. This was in an operating environment in which MMC's underlying revenue rose 2%, but adjusted underlying expenses were held to only 1%. Also contributing to long-term earnings growth is prudent and effective capital management, including the disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase. 
We have completed six acquisition so far in 2010. Four of these were in the Risk and Insurance Services segment including Haake Companies, Thomas Rutherfoord and the Bostonian Group. These were part of our Marsh & McLennan Agency strategy. We also acquired the insurance brokering operations of HSBC. 
In the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions at Mercer. In July, we acquired Innovative Process Administration, a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employment enrollment technology. And in August, we acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions.  Total consideration for these acquisitions exceeded $500 million, $300 million of which was in cash. This illustrates our capacity to make investments in our businesses. 
Another effective method of returning capital to shareholders and contributing to long-term growth in earnings per share is share repurchase. As I announced in Investor Day, the Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Since we have been in the blackout period related to the third quarter earnings, we have not yet activated this program. However, now that we have announced our third quarter earnings, we will begin buying back our stock. Over time, effective capital management can translate compound annual growth of 10% into operating income to earnings per share growth approaching 13%. 
Another element that contributes to annual shareholder returns is MMC's attractive dividend. Reflecting the recently announced dividend increase, our current yield is 3.2%. Long-term shareholder returns of 16% are what MMC was able to achieve during its first four decades as a public company, and this is what we are targeting for the future. 
The second pillar of our corporate strategy is maintaining low capital requirements. As a professional services firm, we do not require significant capital investments to successfully run our businesses. We, therefore, expect to maintain low capital requirements in each of our operating companies, effectively targeting a level of capital expenditure in the coming year of approximately $230 million. 
The third pillar is high cash generation. Our business generates strong cash flows. However, over the last few years, we've used these cash flows to restructure operations and deal with legacy issues, which averaged around $500 million per year. So our ability to reinvest in a classic growth manner was limited. Now that restructuring and legacy issues are largely behind us, we expect our businesses to generate over $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. Filing dividend payments currently at $450 million, we're left with approximately $550 million of excess cash that we can redeploy in acquisitions and share repurchase. 
And finally lowering our risk profile. Over the last several years, we have implemented enhanced, organizational, operational and risk management measures, including a focus on enterprise risk management that are designed to reduce the company's risk profile. 
To summarize, our strategy is to focus the company on the characteristics that create great value for investors: growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation and a low risk profile. It is our belief that emphasizing these four pillars, successfully combined with strong business operating in global markets and disciplined capital and expense management, should produce superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our third quarter results in more detail."

Then, I'll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's financial position. 
On a GAAP basis, EPS in the third quarter was $0.30, which included $0.22 from continuing operations and $0.08 from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations primarily include the gain on the sale of Kroll, the related tax benefits and Kroll's operations in the third quarter. The related tax benefits were slightly higher than the preliminary tax benefit recognized in the second quarter. 
In the third quarter of 2009, adjusted EPS was $0.48, which, as you may recall, included an $0.18 tax benefit. On adjusted basis, EPS in the third quarter of 2010 was $0.27. Adjusted EPS includes $4 million of operating income from Kroll through the closing of the sale. This compares with Kroll's adjusted operating income of $21 million in the third quarter of 2009. Accordingly, the sale of Kroll negatively impacted this year's third quarter by $0.02 a share. 
Due to declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag, we recorded an investment loss of $2 million in the third quarter, and last year's third quarter investment income was $22 million. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million compared with $23 million in last year's fourth quarter. Interest expense in the third quarter of $60 million was similar to prior quarters. However, with the repayment of the $550 million debt maturity in September, we expect interest expense to decrease beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the results of MMC's operations. Unless indicated otherwise, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in each of our businesses, not only in the third quarter, but for the first nine months of the year. 
On a consolidated basis, operating income rose 7% to $269 million compared with last year's third quarter. On a reported basis, third quarter revenue for Risk and Insurance Services rose 8% to $1.3 billion. Excluding fiduciary interest income, underlying revenue growth was 3%. Operating income decreased 4% to $165 million from $158 million last year. 
Marsh had a strong quarter despite the continuation of soft market conditions in the global insurance market. On a reported basis, revenue rose 9% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion. On an underlying basis, growth was 3%, reflecting a sequential improvement for the fourth quarter in a row. The strong performance in the third quarter was achieved with consistent revenue growth across all geographic operations. The positive momentum in new business generation also continued in the third quarter. Year-to-date, global new business growth was 8%. Client retention rates also stayed strong, in line with the first half of the year.  Despite an increase in pension expense, growth in operating expenses was 3% in the quarter and only 1% for the first nine months. 
Guy Carpenter continued to generate revenue growth despite the significant headwinds of declines in pricing within the reinsurance markets and increased retentions by clients. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4% to $233 million. On an underlying basis, Carpenter's revenue grew 3%. This is Carpenter's seventh sequential quarter of revenue growth, an outstanding performance considering the operating environment. This growth reflects Carpenter's high client retention and new business production, driven particularly by its international operations. This continues Carpenter's strong new business over the past two years where it has gained its market share from all segments within its competitive environment. 
In our Consulting segment, reported revenue rose 5% to $1.2  billion. Underlying revenue growth was strong at 6%. This represents the third consecutive quarter of growth and the highest growth rate at Consulting in the past nine quarters. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was 5% for the quarter and only 1% through the first nine months. Operating income increased 11% from $130 million to $144 million. For the nine months, operating income rose 16% from $335 million to $387 million, with margin improvement of 110 basis points. 
Mercer's reported revenue increased 6% in the third quarter to $881 million. Underlying revenue growth was also 6%, a marked improvement compared with last year's third quarter that felt the full impact of the global recession. Retirement consulting revenue, they're down slightly from last year, was substantially stronger in the third quarter than in the first half of this year, led by growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Health and benefits registered its strongest performance in two years. Revenue rose 8% in the third quarter, driven by increases in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Rewards, talent and communications produced double-digit revenue growth, its strongest performance since the first quarter of 2008. This was driven by growth in human capital consulting in the U.S., Canada and EMEA, as well as a resurgence of demands for compensation surveys. Outsourcing revenue was up 4% in the quarter, driven by new client wins in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. 
Affirming our strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for our clients retirement plans, investment consulting and management increased 17% for the third straight quarter, with strong growth in all geographies. Mercer's operating income increased in both the third quarter and year-to-date. 
Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the third quarter, which continues the improvement that we have seen throughout this year. Reported revenue growth grew 3% to $322 million, while underlying growth was 6%. Among its industry specialties, Financial Services, representing almost 40% of revenue, continued its outstanding performance. Revenue rose double digits for the third consecutive quarter, reflecting the improving demand from this sector. 
Oliver Wyman also generated strong growth in the healthcare, transportation and consumer sectors. Oliver Wyman produced strong growth in operating income and margin improvement for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. In addition to our normal cash generation in the quarter, we have received cash proceeds of $1.13 billion upon the closing of this Kroll transaction. 
Major usage of cash in the quarter included a $550 million debt maturity in September, $400 million for the Alaska settlement,a $200 million tax-advantaged discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan and $50 million for several small acquisitions. 
It's important to note, as I outlined in Investor Day, that there are substantial tax benefits associated with some of these actions. For example, we expect to receive a cash tax benefit of roughly $280 million from the sale of Kroll. We achieved this benefit because we carried back a tax basis loss on the sale of Kroll against the gain on the sale Putnam we realized in 2007. 
We also expect cash tax benefits of $160 million from the Alaska settlement and $70 million from our discretionary pension contribution. So in aggregate, we have over $500 million of cash tax benefits. Roughly $200 million should be received by the end of this year, $230 million in the first half of 2011, with the remainder realized over time. As you heard Brian say, we expect to begin our share repurchase program shortly. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

One, you know that our revenue in the third quarter is the lowest revenue that we have in the year, quarter-by-quarter. And our expense base does not reflect that same seasonality. So our expenses stayed pretty stable over the course of the year. So changes in expense have a more material impact on the third quarter than they would on any other quarter. So specifically to your question, my management team and I are very much focused on making sure that expense growth does not exceed revenue growth, I mean, that sort of a basic operating principle. So a direct answer to your question, I think you'd have to look at pension expense and the growth that we had in pension expense this quarter. That represented about half of that 3% increase. And so from that standpoint, it really masks, in this quarter, our underlying performance."

So you take that out and think about that a little bit differently. Otherwise, I think the company is perhaps somewhat less leveraged than a brokerage company. That said, we are in the business of producing scale businesses. So whether it's outsourcing, whether it's investment management, whether it's our data business, all these have scaled characteristics. So our expectation is that you will see positive leverage in this business as we enter growth especially looking like the growth that we have probably produced this quarter?"

In terms of contingencies, specifically, we have said that we do not intend to take contingent commissions in our core brokerage business in the U.S. and Canada and actually, probably in a few other large countries as well. But having said this, it doesn't mean that we're not looking to improve our carrier revenue streams.

I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michelle Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. 
I am pleased to report that in the third quarter, MMC produced strong revenue growth of 7% or 4% on an underlying basis. We are seeing some signs of the effects of the great recession are diminishing. However, overall economic conditions remain weak. Also, the insurance services segment continues to face the challenges presented by soft market conditions in the global property casualty marketplace. Even in this difficult operating environment, however, each of our four operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. This is the first quarter this has occurred since 2007. 
About six weeks ago, MMC held its first Investor Day under this management team. I was very pleased so many of the members of the investment community were able to attend, and many of us took advantage of the opportunity to watch our live video webcast. The entire program, which included presentations by each of the heads of our operating companies, as well as Vanessa's financial overview, remains available for viewing on our website, www.mmc.com. I would like to spend a few minutes reinforcing some of the major themes I talked about at Investor Day in making the investment case for MMC. 
In the 40 years after Marsh & McLennan companies became a public company in 1962, two of our most notable hallmarks were sustained growth and adjusted earnings per share and total return to shareholders. However, MMC operated in a crisis mode from late 2004 through the end of 2007. As a result, new management was installed nearly three years ago. Since then, we have successfully resolved legacy issues that prevented the company from operating at its fullest potential. 
Today, MMC is comprised of four great companies: Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Each is a leader in its field and is led by a strong management team focused on enhancing growth in revenue and more importantly, earnings. Our goal is to establish MMC as an elite global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. 
To return to a record of superior long-term performance, we will focus on four major pillars in the coming years. First, growth. We are committed to generating long-term revenue and earnings growth. MMC should produce long-term organic revenue growth at least equal to global GDP growth, augmented by acquisitions. And a continuing focus on expense discipline should expand margins and lead to 10% growth in operating income in a multitude of operating environments. 
We are beginning to see the results of the strategy in MMC's financial performance for the first nine months of 2010, which is more indicative of our performance in any one particular quarter. Through the third quarter, MMC produced 11% growth in adjusted operating income. This was in an operating environment in which MMC's underlying revenue rose 2%, but adjusted underlying expenses were held to only 1%. Also contributing to long-term earnings growth is prudent and effective capital management, including the disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase. 
We have completed six acquisitions so far in 2010. Four of these were in the Risk and Insurance Services segment including Haake Companies, Thomas Rutherfoord and the Bostonian Group. These were part of our Marsh & McLennan Agency strategy. We also acquired the insurance brokering operations of HSBC. 
In the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions at Mercer. In July, we acquired Innovative Process Administration, a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employment enrollment technology. And in August, we acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions.  Total consideration for these acquisitions exceeded $500 million, $300 million of which was in cash. This illustrates our capacity to make investments in our businesses. 
Another effective method of returning capital to shareholders and contributing to long-term growth in earnings per share is share repurchase. As I announced at Investor Day, the Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Since we have been in the blackout period related to third quarter earnings, we have not yet activated this program. However, now that we have announced our third quarter earnings, we will begin buying back our stock. Over time, effective capital management can translate compound annual growth of 10% into operating income to earnings per share growth approaching 13%. 
Another element that contributes to annual shareholder returns is MMC's attractive dividend. Reflecting the recently announced dividend increase, our current yield is 3.2%. Long-term shareholder returns of 16% are what MMC was able to achieve during its first four decades as a public company, and this is what we are targeting for the future. 
The second pillar of our corporate strategy is maintaining low capital requirements. As a professional services firm, we do not require significant capital investments to successfully run our businesses. We, therefore, expect to maintain low capital requirements in each of our operating companies. In fact, we are targeting a level of capital expenditure in the coming year of approximately $230 million. 
The third pillar is high cash generation. Our business generates strong cash flows. However, over the last few years, we've used these cash flows to restructure operations and deal with legacy issues, which averaged around $500 million per year. So our ability to reinvest in a classic growth manner was limited. Now that restructuring and legacy issues are largely behind us, we expect our businesses to generate over $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. Following dividend payments currently at $450 million, we're left with approximately $550 million of excess cash that we can redeploy in acquisitions and share repurchase. 
And finally lowering our risk profile. Over the last several years, we have implemented enhanced, organizational, operational and risk management measures, including a focus on enterprise risk management that are designed to reduce the company's risk profile. 
To summarize, our strategy is to focus the company on the characteristics that create great value for investors: growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation and a low risk profile. It is our belief that emphasizing these four pillars, successfully combined with strong business operating in global markets and disciplined capital and expense management, should produce superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our third quarter results in more detail."

Then, I'll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's financial position. 
On a GAAP basis, EPS in the third quarter was $0.30, which included $0.22 from continuing operations and $0.08 from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations primarily include the gain on the sale of Kroll, the related tax benefits and Kroll's operations in the third quarter. The related tax benefits were slightly higher than the preliminary tax benefit recognized in the second quarter. 
In the third quarter of 2009, adjusted EPS was $0.48, which, as you may recall, included an $0.18 tax benefit. On an adjusted basis, EPS in the third quarter of 2010 was $0.27. Adjusted EPS includes $4 million of operating income from Kroll through the closing of the sale. This compares with Kroll's adjusted operating income of $21 million in the third quarter of 2009. Accordingly, the sale of Kroll negatively impacted this year's third quarter by $0.02 a share. 
Due to declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag, we recorded an investment loss of $2 million in the third quarter, and last year's third quarter investment income was $22 million. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million compared with $23 million in last year's fourth quarter. Interest expense in the third quarter of $60 million was similar to prior quarters. However, with the repayment of the $550 million debt maturity in September, we expect interest expense to decrease beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the results of MMC's operations. Unless indicated otherwise, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in each of our businesses, not only in the third quarter, but for the first nine months of the year. 
On a consolidated basis, operating income rose 7% to $269 million compared with last year's third quarter. On a reported basis, third quarter revenue for Risk and Insurance Services rose 8% to $1.3 billion. Excluding fiduciary interest income, underlying revenue growth was 3%. Operating income decreased 4% to $165 million from $158 million last year. 
Marsh had a strong quarter despite the continuation of soft market conditions in the global insurance market. On a reported basis, revenue rose 9% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion. On an underlying basis, growth was 3%, reflecting a sequential improvement for the fourth quarter in a row. The strong performance in the third quarter was achieved with consistent revenue growth across all geographic operations. The positive momentum in new business generation also continued in the third quarter. Year-to-date, global new business growth was 8%. Client retention rates also stayed strong, in line with the first half of the year.  Despite an increase in pension expense, growth in operating expenses was 3% in the quarter and only 1% for the first nine months. 
Guy Carpenter continued to generate revenue growth despite the significant headwinds of declines in pricing within the reinsurance markets and increased retentions by clients. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4% to $233 million. On an underlying basis, Carpenter's revenue grew 3%. This is Carpenter's seventh sequential quarter of revenue growth, an outstanding performance considering the operating environment. This growth reflects Carpenter's high client retention and new business production, driven particularly by its international operations. This continues Carpenter's strong new business over the past two years where it has gained its market share from all segments within its competitive environment. 
In our Consulting segment, reported revenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue growth was strong at 6%. This represents the third consecutive quarter of growth and the highest growth rate at Consulting in the past nine quarters. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was 5% for the quarter and only 1% through the first nine months. Operating income increased 11% from $130 million to $144 million. For the nine months, operating income rose 16% from $335 million to $387 million, with margin improvement of 110 basis points. 
Mercer's reported revenue increased 6% in the third quarter to $881 million. Underlying revenue growth was also 6%, a marked improvement compared with last year's third quarter that felt the full impact of the global recession. Retirement consulting revenue, though down slightly from last year, was substantially stronger in the third quarter than in the first half of this year, led by growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Health and benefits registered its strongest performance in two years. Revenue rose 8% in the third quarter, driven by increases in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Rewards, talent and communications produced double-digit revenue growth, its strongest performance since the first quarter of 2008. This was driven by growth in human capital consulting in the U.S., Canada and EMEA, as well as a resurgence of demands for compensation surveys. Outsourcing revenue was up 4% in the quarter, driven by new client wins in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. 
Affirming our strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for our clients retirement plans, investment consulting and management increased 17% for the third straight quarter, with strong growth in all geographies. Mercer's operating income increased in both the third quarter and year-to-date. 
Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the third quarter, which continues the improvement that we have seen throughout this year. Reported revenue growth grew 3% to $322 million, while underlying growth was 6%. Among its industry specialties, Financial Services, representing almost 40% of revenue, continued its outstanding performance. Revenue rose double digits for the third consecutive quarter, reflecting the improving demands from this sector. 
Oliver Wyman also generated strong growth in the healthcare, transportation and consumer sectors. Oliver Wyman produced strong growth in operating income and margin improvement for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. In addition to our normal cash generation in the quarter, we have received cash proceeds of $1.13 billion upon the closing of the Kroll transaction. 
Major uses of cash in the quarter included a $550 million debt maturity in September, $400 million for the Alaska settlement, a $200 million tax-advantaged discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan and $50 million for several small acquisitions. 
It's important to note, as I outlined in Investor Day, that there are substantial tax benefits associated with some of these actions. For example, we expect to receive a cash tax benefit of roughly $280 million from the sale of Kroll. We achieved this benefit because we carried back a tax basis loss on the sale of Kroll against the gain on the sale of Putnam we realized in 2007. 
We also expect cash tax benefits of $160 million from the Alaska settlement and $70 million from our discretionary pension contribution. So in aggregate, we have over $500 million of cash tax benefits. Roughly $200 million should be received by the end of this year, $230 million in the first half of 2011, with the remainder realized over time. As you heard Brian say, we expect to begin our share repurchase program shortly. 
With that, let me turn it back to Brian."

One, you know that our revenue in the third quarter is the lowest revenue that we have in the year, quarter-by-quarter. And our expense base does not reflect that same seasonality. So our expenses stayed pretty stable over the course of the year. So changes in expense have a more material impact on the third quarter than they would on any other quarter. So specifically to your question, my management team and I are very much focused on making sure that expense growth does not exceed revenue growth, I mean, that sort of a basic operating principle. So a direct answer to your question, I think you'd have to look at pension expense and the growth that we had in pension expense this quarter. That represented about half of that 3% increase. And so from that standpoint, it really masks, in this quarter, our underlying performance."

So you take that out and think about that a little bit differently. Otherwise, I think the company is perhaps somewhat less leveraged than a brokerage company. That said, we are in the business of producing scale businesses. So whether it's outsourcing, whether it's investment management, whether it's our data business, all these have scaled characteristics. So our expectation is that you will see positive leverage in this business as we enter growth especially looking like the growth that we have probably produced this quarter."

I’d also like to welcome our operating company CEOs to today’s call - Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman.  Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.
I am pleased to report that in the third quarter, MMC produced strong revenue growth of 7%, or 4% on an underlying basis.  We are seeing some signs that the effects of the Great Recession are diminishing; however, overall economic conditions remain weak.  Also, the insurance services segment continues to face the challenges presented by soft market conditions in the global property casualty marketplace.
Even in this difficult operating environment, however, each of our four operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis.  This is the first quarter this has occurred since 2007.
About six weeks ago, MMC held its first investor day under this management team.  I was very pleased so many members of the investment community were able to attend, and many others took advantage of the opportunity to watch our live video webcast.  The entire program, which included presentations by each of the heads of our operating companies as well as Vanessa’s financial overview, remains available for viewing on our website, mmc.com.
I would like to spend a few minute reinforcing some of the major themes I talked about at investor day in making the investment case for MMC.  IN the 40 years after Marshall McLennan Companies became a public company in 1962, two of our most notable hallmarks were sustained growth in adjusted earnings per share and total return to shareholders.  However, MMC operated in a crisis mode from late 2004 through the end of 2007.  As a result, new management was installed nearly three years ago.  
Since then, we have successfully resolved legacy issues that prevented the Company from operating at its fullest potential.  Today MMC is comprised of four great companies - Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer, and Oliver Wyman.  Each is a leader in its field and is led by a strong management team focused on enhancing growth and revenue, and more importantly, earnings.  Our goal is to establish MMC as an elite global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors but with respect to other leading global companies.
To return to a record of superior long-term performance, we will focus on four major pillars in the coming years.  First, growth.  We are committed to generating long-term revenue and earnings growth.  MMC should produce long-term organic revenue growth at least equal to global GDP growth augmented by acquisitions; and a continuing focus on expense discipline should expand margins and lead to 10% growth in operating income in a multitude of operating environments.  
We are beginning to see the results of this strategy in MMC’s financial performance for the first nine months of 2010 which is more indicative of our performance than any one particular quarter.  Through the third quarter, MMC produced 11% growth in adjusted operating income.  This was in an operating environment in which MMC’s underlying revenue rose 2% but adjusted underlying expenses were held to only 1%.  
Also contributing to long-term earnings growth is prudent and effective capital management, including the disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase.  We have completed six acquisitions so far in 2010.  Four of these were in the risk and insurance services segment, including Haight (phon) Companies, Thomas Rutherford, and the Bostonian Group.  These were part of our Marsh McLennan agency strategy.  We also acquired the insurance broking operations of HSBC.
In the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions at Mercer.  In July we acquired Innovative Process Administration, a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employment enrollment technology; and in August we acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions.
Total consideration for these acquisitions exceeded $500 million, 300 million of which was in cash.  This illustrates our capacity to make investments in our businesses.
Another effective method of returning capital to shareholders and contributing to long-term growth in earnings per share is share repurchase.  As I announced at investor day, the Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program.  Since we have been in the blackout period related to third quarter earnings, we have not yet activated this program; however, now that we have announced our third quarter earnings, we will begin buying back our stock.  Over time, effective capital management can translate compound annual growth of 10% into operating income to earnings per share growth approaching 13%.
Another element that contributes to annual shareholder returns is MMC’s attractive dividend.  Reflecting the recently announced dividend increase, our current yield is 3.2%.  Long-term shareholder returns of 16% are what MMC was able to achieve during it’s first four decades as a public company, and this is what we are targeting for the future.
The second pillar of our corporate strategy is maintaining low capital requirements.  As a professional services firm, we do not require significant capital investments to successfully run our businesses.  We therefore expect to maintain low capital requirements in each of our operating companies.  In fact, we are targeting a level of capital expenditure in the coming year of approximately $230 million.  
The third pillar is high cash generation.  Our business generates strong cash flows; however, over the last few years we’ve used these cash flows to restructure operations and deal with legacy issues which averaged around $500 million per year, so our ability to reinvest in a classic growth manner was limited.  Now that restructuring and legacy issues are largely behind us, we expect our businesses to generate over $1 billion of cash on an annual basis.  Following dividend payments currently at 450 million, we’re left with approximately 550 million of excess cash that we can redeploy in acquisitions and share repurchase.
And finally, lowering our risk profile.  Over the next several years, we have implemented enhanced organizational, operational and risk management measures, including a focus on enterprise risk management, that are designed to reduce the Company’s risk profile.  
To summarize, our strategy is to focus the Company on the characteristics that create great value for investors - growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation, and a low risk profile.  It is our belief that emphasizing these four pillars, successfully combined with strong business operating in global markets and disciplined capital and expense management, should produce superior long-term returns to our shareholders.  
Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our third quarter results in more detail.

I’ll begin with an overview of MMC’s consolidated earnings for the quarter; then I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companies.  I’ll close with some observations regarding MMC’s financial position.
On a GAAP basis, EPS in the third quarter was $0.30 which included $0.22 from continuing operations and $0.08 from discontinued operations.  Discontinued operations primarily include the gain on the sale of Kroll, the related tax benefits, and Kroll’s operations in the third quarter.  The related tax benefits were slightly higher than the preliminary tax benefit recognized in the second quarter.
In the third quarter of 2009, adjusted EPS was $0.48 which, as you may recall, included an $0.18 tax benefit.  On an adjusted basis, EPS in the third quarter of 2010 was $0.27.  Adjusted EPS includes $4 million of operating income from Kroll through the closing of the sale.  This compares with Kroll’s adjusted operating income of $21 million in the third quarter of 2009.  Accordingly, the sale of Kroll negatively impacted this year’s third quarter by $0.02 a share.
Due to declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag, we recorded an investment loss of $2 million in the third quarter.  In last year’s third quarter, investment income was $22 million.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million compared with $23 million in last year’s fourth quarter.
Interest expense in the third quarter of $60 million was similar to prior quarters; however, with the repayment of the $550 million debt maturity in September, we expect interest expense to decrease beginning in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the results of MMC’s operations, unless indicated otherwise, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses, and adjusted operating income.  We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in each of our businesses, not only in the third quarter but for the first nine months of the year.  
On a consolidated basis, operating income rose 7% to $269 million compared with last year’s third quarter.  On a reported basis, third quarter revenue for risk and insurance services rose 8% to $1.3 billion.  Excluding fiduciary interest income, underlying revenue growth was 3%.
Operating income decreased 4% to $165 million from $158 million last year.  Marsh had a strong quarter despite the continuation of soft market conditions in the global insurance market.  On a reported basis, revenue rose 9% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion.  On an underlying basis, growth was 3% reflecting a sequential improvement for the fourth quarter in a row.  The strong performance in the third quarter was achieved with consistent revenue growth across all geographic operations.
The positive momentum in new business generation also continued in the third quarter.  Year-to-date, global new business growth was 8%.  Client retention rates also stayed strong, in line with the first half of the year.  Despite an increase in pension expense, growth in operating expenses was 3% in the quarter and only 1% for the first nine months.
Guy Carpenter continued to generate revenue growth despite the significant headwinds of declines in pricing within the reinsurance markets and increased retentions by clients.  On a reported basis, revenue increased 4% to $233 million.  On an underlying basis, Carpenter’s revenue grew 3%.  This is Carpenter’s seventh sequential quarter of revenue growth, an outstanding performance considering the operating environment.  This growth reflects Carpenter’s high client retention and new business production, driven particularly by its international operations.  This continues Carpenter’s strong new business over the past two years where it has gained market share from all segments within its competitive environment.
In our consulting segment, reported revenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion.  Underlying revenue growth was strong at 6%.  This represents the third consecutive quarter of growth and the highest growth rate at consulting in the past nine quarters.  
Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was 5% for the quarter and only 1% through the first nine months.  Operating income increased 11% from $130 million to $144 million.  For the nine months, operating income rose 16% from 335 million to $387 million with margin improvement of 110 basis points.  
Mercer’s reported revenue increased 6% in the third quarter to $881 million.  Underlying revenue growth was also 6%, a marked improvement compared with last year’s third quarter that felt the full impact of the global recession.
Retirement consulting revenue, though down slightly from last year, was substantially stronger in the third quarter than the first half of this year, led by growth in Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.  
Health and benefits registered its strongest performance in two years.  Revenue rose 8% in the third quarter driven by increases in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.  
Rewards, talent and communications produced double digit revenue growth, it’s strongest performance since the first quarter of 2008.  This was driven by growth in human capital consulting in the U.S., Canada, and EMEA as well as a resurgence of demand for compensation surveys.  Outsourcing revenue was up 4% in the quarter driven by new client wins in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.
Affirming our strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for our clients’ retirement plans, investment consulting and management increased 17% for the third straight quarter with strong growth in all geographies.  Mercer’s operating income increased in both the third quarter and year-to-date.
Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the third quarter which continues the improvement we have seen throughout this year.  Reported revenue growth grew 3% to $322 million while underlying growth was 6%.  Among its industry specialties, financial services representing almost 40% of revenue continued its outstanding performance.  Revenue rose double digits for the third consecutive quarter, reflecting the improving demand from this sector.
Oliver Wyman also generated strong growth in the healthcare, transportation, and consumer sectors.  Oliver Wyman produced strong growth in operating income and margin improvement for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year.
Cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion at the end of the second quarter.  In addition to our normal cash generation in the quarter, we received cash proceeds of $1.13 billion upon the closing of the Kroll transaction.  Major uses of cash in the quarter included a $550 million debt maturity in September, $400 million for the Alaska settlement, a $200 million tax advantaged discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, and $50 million for several small acquisitions.
It’s important to note as I outlined at investor day that there are substantial tax benefits associated with some of these actions.  For example, we expect to receive a cash tax benefit of roughly $280 million from the sale of Kroll.  We achieved this benefit because we carried back a tax basis loss on the sale of Kroll against a gain on the sale of Putnam we realized in 2007.  We also expect cash tax benefits of $160 million from the Alaska settlement and $70 million from our discretionary pension contribution.  
So in aggregate, we have over $500 million of cash tax benefits.  Roughly $200 million should be received by the end of this year, $230 million in the first half of 2011, with the remainder realized over time.  As you heard Brian say, we expect to begin our share repurchase program shortly.
With that, let me turn it back to Brian.

One, you know that our revenue in the third quarter is the lowest revenue that we have in the year, you know, quarter-by-quarter.  And our expense base does not reflect that same seasonality, so our expenses stay pretty stable over the course of the year.  So changes in expense have a more material impact on the third quarter than they would in any other quarter.  So specifically to your question, my management team and I are very much focused on making sure that expense growth does not exceed revenue growth.  I mean, that’s sort of a basic operating principle.  So in direct answer to your question, I think you’d have to look at pension expense and the growth that we had in pension expense this quarter.  That represented about half of that 3% increase, and so from that standpoint it really masks in this quarter our underlying performance.

That said, we are in the business of producing scale businesses, so whether it’s outsourcing, whether it’s capital management, whether it’s our data business, all these have scale characteristics.  So our expectation is that you will see positive leverage in this business as we enter growth, and growth especially looking like the growth that we were able to produce this quarter.

And in the case of IPA specifically, it will allow us to build out product and solutions that compliment our existing capabilities, so individual revenue from that organization as well as revenue growth, we will see coming because that product and solution just gets better with the IPA technology that we acquired.

As I’ve said in previous quarters, you know, it’s a difficult marketing environment and so it’s hard to actually see any real trend.  I mean, I am happy that this is the fourth quarter in a row of sequential improvement in our growth levels, but it is a very challenging market particularly in mature markets.  So when I look at the quarter and the year, we’re 1% year-to-date in terms of growth.  We’re 3% in the quarter, and so I believe positive territory is sustainable but I wouldn’t necessarily say that any particular number within that range would be sustainable.  I think we’d be in that range.
The other thing is in terms of the U.S., we do disclose the U.S. Canada division - you know, Canada represents about 10% of the overall division, and that division’s growth in the quarter was 3%.  We don’t disclose the U.K. separately from EMEA although I do want to say that the U.K. is the largest country by far in the EMEA division and that that division grew 1% in the quarter.

We have a strategy that I think is going to do us a great service over time, and that is each—and it’s not limited to Marsh.  I mean, we are out, as Michele pointed, we have a couple of acquisitions at Mercer this quarter that keep the momentum going, add to our capabilities, enhance our franchise, fill us out; and if you go back to my four pillars, that growth - we want it to be sustainable.  We want it to be long-term.  We want you to be dependent on it.  You could—of course, we’ve got to execute.  So it’s not necessary for us to make those kinds of acquisitions.  And when  you look at our portfolio of companies, and I emphasized in the beginning we have four fabulous companies, and so they’re pretty good in their own right.  It’s hard to find where we’re really so lacking that we need to make that change.
However, having said all that, we are opportunists.  If opportunities arise where we could do something that would absolutely be in your best interests and the rest of those who follow us and our shareholders, we’re going to do it; but frankly, you just can’t bet on those kinds of things, but you can, I think, more easily bet on our ability to find good quality companies that add year after year, year after year, to the Company.  And that’s the strategy we’re employing.
