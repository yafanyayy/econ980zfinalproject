This afternoon, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full-year performance. Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks and then we will take questions.The fourth quarter of 2009 capped what was a challenging year. The global recession was both steep and broad, and adversely affected many of our end-use markets. PPG reacted decisively as we implemented aggressive restructuring and cost-reduction actions and further increased our focus on cash flow. The impact of these efforts is clearly evident in our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Led by our Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials businesses, we have continued to realize positive momentum in our financial performance. These segments performed well and delivered higher year-over-year earnings. Given challenging end-use market conditions, our Performance Glazings business unit and Commodity Chemicals segment weakened in comparison with the prior year's quarter and a seasonally stronger third quarter.Overall demand in the quarter was lower year-over-year, with the exception of double-digit percentage growth in Asia, and improvement in a few select global industrial end-use market such as auto production. However, activity levels were stable or modestly improved versus the third quarter 2009 when taking into account seasonal trends. Our increased operating leverage, again being driven by our restructuring initiatives, was a major contributor to our improved financial performance. This was most evident in our Industrial Coatings segment where earnings grew by $129 million versus last year's fourth quarter on only modest volume improvement. In fact, Industrial Coatings earnings were even higher than fourth quarter 2007 despite over 15% lower demand.And our focus on cash and working capital continued with nearly $600 million of cash generation in the quarter, exceeding even last year's strong performance. PPG's full-year results provide continued validation that the strategic direction and the actions we have taken over the past few years to transform the company are yielding the intended improvement. Despite the severity of this recession, the aggregate full-year earnings of our Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments dropped by less than 10%. Measured in local currency, this figure was only about 5%, with the remainder due to negative currency conversion. This performance includes higher earnings in local currencies from our Architectural Coatings EMEA segment, which represents the majority of our 2008 SigmaKalon acquisition.Our focus on growing our presence in Asia also yielded significant benefits in 2009, as our markets there continued to demonstrate good growth characteristics. Lastly, our improved portfolio was important in enabling us to generate over $1.3 billion in cash from operations in 2009, which is our second highest year on record. Our strong cash performance allowed us to confidently raise our annual dividend payout yet again, and we substantially reduced our debt level, paying down an additional $675 million.I am pleased with how we finished the year. Our earnings are recovering, and our strong cash position provides us with financial flexibility to support earnings growth going forward. Yet, until we see further signs that demand is recovering more broadly, our attention will remain focused on cost management and diligent execution of our strategy. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob to review financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year."

Summarizing the fourth quarter sales, we're down $72 million or a modest 2% decline versus fourth quarter 2008 sales, which were partially impacted by the onset of the industrial recession.Commodity Chemicals experienced a sharp decline in",2999,"Thanks, Chuck. Summarizing the fourth quarter sales, we're down $72 million or a modest 2% decline versus fourth quarter 2008 sales, which were partially impacted by the onset of the industrial recession.Commodity Chemicals experienced a sharp decline in sales due to lower pricing. This decline was partially offset by higher sales in our other businesses, including higher volumes in Automotive Coatings and favorable currency impacts. Overall, we experienced fairly normal seasonal sales patterns with the exception of automotive production, which remained consistent throughout the quarter as opposed to the traditional pattern of trailing off in December.Our gross margins expanded not only versus 2008 but also versus solid 2007 results, reflecting the impact from our restructuring actions, additional cost-management initiatives and lower input costs. The full-year tax rate came in at 30% based on actual full-year mix of earnings by geography. The lower rate added $0.12 to fourth quarter earnings per share due to the catch up from the lowering of the tax rate the prior three quarters. We also estimated our 2010 tax rate will remain at 30%. We delivered very strong cash performance in the quarter, generating almost $600 million, and that is after recognizing an additional $100 million we contributed to our pension plans in December.Also, we've reduced debt by an additional $175 million during the quarter and ended the year with over $1 billion of cash on hand. A year-over-year bridge of our fourth quarter sales, along with some relevant trends is depicted on the next slide and a full-year sales bridge is included in the appendix for your reference. Negative price of $166 million is entirely attributable to lower selling prices in Commodity Chemicals and lower year-over-year energy and fuel surcharges in Glass. We realized modest price improvements in Coatings and Optical, but they were not sufficient to overcome the sharp drops in Commodity Chemicals and Glass.Following four consecutive quarters of headwind, currency conversion finally became a tailwind and positively impacted fourth quarter sales by $150 million. As depicted on the chart, the euro advanced modestly versus the third quarter of this year. However, year-over-year improvement was realized due to a rapidly weakening euro in the fourth quarter of 2008. Despite the favorable impact in the fourth quarter, currency translation reduced full-year sales by nearly $600 million.Our volumes remain negative in the quarter. However, they have recovered gradually over the year and the decline was less severe in the fourth quarter than prior quarters. This reflects a lower activity level in last year's fourth quarter, modest demand improvement in Asia and several of our industrial end-use markets and higher commodity chemicals exports.The next slide provides sales data by region. Our regional volume variance for each quarter in 2009 is provided versus the prior year's quarter. In the fourth quarter, volumes remained modestly negative in both the United States and Europe. However, we experienced growth in our emerging regions, including single-digit growth in Latin America and nearly 15% growth in Asia/Pacific, driven by higher industrial demand. And on a full year, the emerging regions of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe represented nearly 1/3 of our Coatings portfolio.Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix of today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at www.ppg.com. In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 and includes a 30% effective tax rate. We anticipate the same tax rate of 30% for year 2010. While lower taxes were part of an earnings-per-share improvement, a significant contributor to the earnings per share was the increase in savings generated by our restructuring actions. As we ended 2009, we had completed all major elements of these initiatives ahead of schedule, including the reduction of two European manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter. Throughout 2009, we realized partial year savings from many of our actions, and we will have an incremental $100 million of savings in 2010, in recognition of the full-year structural cost savings from these actions.Our improving EPS trend is detailed on the next slide. As you can see, our fourth quarter performance represented a sizable gain versus a difficult fourth quarter of 2008. The right side displays the segment earnings trends for our Coatings and Optical segments. While not immune to the effects of a recessionary economy, these segments have experienced only modest earnings declines. What's more, they've achieved these results despite the fact that several businesses are exposed to severely challenged end-use markets such as automotive and construction that were heavily impacted by this recession. As Chuck stated, the strong performance during a recession provides continued validation of our strategy to grow these segments as a portion of our portfolio.Moving now to review our individual business segments, let me start on the next slide with industrial coatings, which delivered dramatically improved results in the quarter, versus what was a poor performance last year. In the quarter, sales grew 12% or $92 million. Earnings improved by $129 million from a $40 million loss last year, and we achieved a 10% operating margin. This improvement was driven largely by lower costs, including restructuring and cost management. In addition, we experienced modest year-over-year end-use market demand improvement. All regions realized higher earnings, with the largest gains in Asia and the U.S.Looking quickly at the full year, we experienced the full affect of the global recession in 2009, as demand dropped dramatically due to lower consumer spending and significant industrial inventory destocking. While volumes have partially recovered this past quarter, they still remain well below historic levels. We reacted swiftly to the demand declines by completing major reductions in our cost structure. One bright spot this year has been Asia, which now represents more than 20% of this segment in sales and even more in earnings, as the region is now delivering our highest operating margins.Further details on our Industrial Coatings segment are included on the next slide. We grew volumes in the quarter versus a very weak fourth quarter of 2008. To put this in perspective, our volumes this past quarter were still more than 15% below fourth quarter 2007 volumes. By region, volumes improved significantly in Asia, growing over 40% and also in Latin America, but remained negative in the U.S. and Europe. The largest end-use market improvement was in automotive production. In North America, year-over-year auto production was down about 50% versus 2008 in the first half of the year. But fourth quarter 2009 was essentially flat with the weakened quarterly result from 2008.As illustrated on the bottom-right graph, North America vehicle production is still running below the level of U.S. auto sales, and automotive dealer inventories remain very low in comparison with historical levels. Also, we delivered very strong growth in Asia on a much higher year-over-year auto production.Overall for this segment, 2009 was a remarkably challenging year. That environment required us to aggressively manage and restructure the business to succeed, and we were pleased that our actions aided in achievement of double-digit operating margins this past quarter. Looking ahead to 2010, for the full year, we anticipate improvement in global industrial demand versus the low levels in 2009, especially in the early months of the year. These demand improvements will likely be led by automotive production, which we expect to increase by 10% globally versus [Audio Gap] We expect to fully leverage improving volume, while we keep our focus on tightly managing costs and execution.The Performance Coatings segment results are detailed on the next slide. In the quarter, despite sales volume decreases in the mid-teen percents, earnings grew modestly, aided by strong cost management. Positive currency conversion added about $50 million to quarterly sales and $5 million to earnings. This segment has historically demonstrated more stability in sales and earnings, given the large aftermarket nature of the end-use segments. As such, our fourth quarter volume results were similar to the volume results the prior three quarters of 2009.In the fourth quarter, year-over-year sales comparisons in Protective & Marine Coatings and Aerospace, both of which serve later-cycle industries trended down slightly. Volumes in our Architectural Coatings business declined slightly more than 10%, which is very similar to the prior two quarters. In the United States, our stores and dealer channels, which primarily serve professional paint contractors were down more, while our national accounts or DIY channel was only slightly negative. Full-year earnings were down a modest $31 million or 5%, including negative currency conversion of $24 million. Yet the segments' operating margins improved by 120 basis points. For the year and fourth quarter, the Automotive Refinished business experienced the most sizable volume declines, including the negative impacts from distributor inventory destocking earlier in the year. As we look ahead to 2010, we once again anticipate this segment will be a stable performer, with some year-over-year benefit due to the absence of inventory destocking and continued cost discipline.Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA business are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter were $457 million, up $43 million versus last year's period, and earnings improved by $11 million from a break-even level last year. The table in the center of the slide displays the seasonal mix of segment sales by quarter. You see a nearly identical trend in 2008 and 2009, including traditional seasonality in the fourth quarter. Volumes for both the quarter and the year were down slightly more than 5%, with improved results in the second half of the year. This performance occurred despite a severe economic decline in the region and clearly demonstrates the resilience of this segment due to the significant maintenance component of Architectural Coatings in Europe.Currency aided sales by about $14 million and earnings by $3 million in the quarter. However, for the year, currency represented about $200 million or 2/3 of the $300 million sales decline and had a $19 million negative impact on earnings. 2009 earnings in local currencies were higher than 2008, an exceptional achievement considering the economic environment. Also as expected, the segment delivered strong cash flow.Included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA. As you can see, our EBITDA margins improved for the year end despite the recession. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this business, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense stemming from the SigmaKalon acquisition. Looking ahead, we anticipate a longer recovery timetable for the European economies and therefore, continue to expect modest volume challenges in this segment. Our focus remains on cost management and in execution to maintain profitability levels, building our brands and positioning to grow in the emerging regions.Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed on the next slide. Fourth quarter sales of $245 million were up slightly versus 2008. Margins improved as earnings of $47 million were up over 40% from last year's level, aided by strong cost management. For the quarter, Optical product sales grew slightly, aided by favorable currency translation. Sales of our silicas products, which are used as a raw material in the production of tires and car batteries grew mid-single digit percents versus last year and reversed a sizable negative sequential volume trend that began in mid-2008.Full-year sales declined 12%, including volume declines in Silicas nearly 20% and single-digit percent decline in Optical products in comparison to 2008, which featured the benefit of a new transitions product introduction. One notable highlight was our near 25% transitions growth rate in Asia. Full-year segment earnings declined slightly in 2009 although our margins improved from focused cost-management efforts. Looking ahead, we expect the segment to return to its strong growth trend, based on our optical products offering and anticipate improvements in the Automotive OEM and aftermarkets, which would aid silicas.The next slide shows our Commodity Chemicals segment results. Sales declined by over $100 million versus last year's period, driven by lower pricing. Earnings fell $80 million in comparison with a strong performance the previous year. Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, the ECU price, fell significantly in comparison with last year's record fourth quarter but was higher versus the third quarter of 2009. Demand for our chlorine and caustic soda fell in North America versus a seasonally stronger third quarter in the prior year, although caustic exports grew, and we experienced unfavorable mix, driven by higher chlorine derivative exports.Our fourth quarter and full-year 2009 natural gas costs were approximately $6 per MMBTu. We anticipate our first quarter 2010 natural gas cost to be in the range of $6.50 to $7 per MMBTu, which includes the effects of recently higher market prices. In 2009, we had about 50% of our natural gas needs hedged at about $8 and in the full year of 2010, this drops to about 35% at similar price levels.On a full-year basis, the segment achieved a solid 12% operating margin and once again delivered good cash generation. Looking at early 2010, we have announced caustic soda price increases for the first quarter and has mentioned also anticipate higher natural gas prices versus the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect overall demand levels during the year to track closely with U.S. industrial production trends.Our Glass segment details are on the following slide. As with last quarter, we included 2008 results, both with and without the Automotive Glass and Services business that we divested at the end of third quarter 2008. My full-year comparison comments will be against the results, excluding auto glass. Sales this quarter were $223 million, down $22 million from last year. The demand environment for performance glazings or architectural glass deteriorated as U.S. commercial construction declined significantly versus last year and also versus the prior quarter. Fiberglas demand strengthened modestly year-over-year, but still remains nearly 25% below 2007 levels. Pricing was down in reflection of lower fuel and energy surcharges. Full-year sales declined 29%, stemming from the volume declines.Glass had $1 million in earnings this quarter versus a loss of $7 million in last year's quarter, aided by both lower cost and higher other income including improved equity affiliate results. Earnings for the full year are down more than $90 million, as significantly lower volumes overshadowed $25 million in cost improvements, including a 20% reduction in our performance glazing's manufacturing capacity. The segment did, however, produced positive cash flow for the year.In 2010, improving industrial demand will aid fiberglass but will likely be offset by commercial construction declines negatively impacting performance glazings. Our focus on cash and aggressively managing the cost structure will continue in 2010. Our cash position is detailed on the next slide, and we ended the year with over $1 billion of cash on hand. We intentionally maintained a higher cash balance during 2009, given the global economic environment. In light of a gradual improving economy and following two years of significant debt reduction, we will begin to manage our cash balance down towards historical levels.During the quarter, we generated almost $600 million of cash from operations. This strong cash performance and more importantly, step change improvement in cash stemming from our SigmaKalon acquisition continues, as our full-year cash from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, just below last year's record level.Several notable cash uses are detailed on the following slide. Our capital spending was $240 million, well below the prior-year levels and indicative of our ability to manage capital expenditures of our transformed business portfolio going forward. Debt repayment was one of our top priorities following our acquisition of SigmaKalon in early 2008. We repaid an additional $675 million of debt in 2009, following a similar figure in 2008. Since the acquisition, we have lowered our net debt by about $1.9 billion, which is over 2.5x our original target, despite operating in a much more challenging economic environment.Funding our pension plans is another cash use, and we have contributed about $450 million to our pension plans this year, with about $100 million of that consisting of stock. We mitigated the dilutive effect to our share count through share buybacks. I will remind you that pension contribution figures are pretax, and we do receive a tax benefit. Lastly, we once again raised our annual dividend payout, marking our 38th year in doing so. The track record we are pleased to continue and made possible by our portfolio's strong cash characteristics.This next slide details some estimates of key financial data for 2010 as compared to the approximate 2009 figures. First, on the income statement side, we expect our pension expense to decline by about $40 million to $160 million. This reflects our high level of pension funding in 2009 along with our asset performance and finalized 2009 discount rate. We anticipate that our full-year tax rate for 2010 will be 30%, consistent with 2009. Relative to cash deployment, the level of our pension funding is expected to decline to the range of about $200 million to $250 million.And although we still intend to keep our 2010 capital spending below the levels in most prior years, it will likely be higher than the very low 2009 figure. Following our SigmaKalon acquisition, debt reduction was a primary cash use and as I mentioned, we are well ahead of schedule. In 2010, we will likely make some further debt reductions, but the level of debt repayment will likely be notably lower than the prior two years. Finally, as we have mentioned in the past several years, if our proposed asbestos settlement is confirmed by the court, we will need to fund the trust, which would entail a net cash outlay totaling $310 million after-tax benefit.Let me conclude by saying that the generally favorable year-over-year trends and the key cash use as noted here, combined with our strong and consistent cash generation history will give us even further financial flexibility in 2010 to deploy cash with an earnings growth focus. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck for some closing remarks."

I will conclude our prepared remarks by highlighting a few key items. Overall demand in the fourth quarter improved gradually versus the third quarter when adjusted for the seasonal nature of many of our businesses. We experienced strong earnings leverage on a modest volume gains.While earnings have not fully recovered, I am pleased with the pace of our improvement given the continued challenges in the global economy. We have completed our restructuring actions ahead of schedule, and these actions benefited our 2009 performance and will do so to a greater degree in 2010. Despite the challenging environment, we once again delivered strong near-record cash generation in 2009 and raised our annual dividend payout.Let me end by saying that due to the severity of the recession, 2009 was an extremely challenging year. Like most companies, PPG was not immune to wide-reaching economic effects, but we reacted quickly and decisively. The rapid and full recovery of earnings in our Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, along with our near-record cash generation as a corporation, provides measurable validation of the soundness and execution of our strategy to focus on these businesses and expand our geographic breadth. As we begin 2010, we are guardedly optimistic. While recovery in the global economy remains gradual, PPG is well-positioned in several ways. Our strong and growing presence in Asia will continue to yield benefits based on economic growth in that region. We will also realize an incremental $100 million of savings from our completed restructuring actions that should enable us to fully leverage anticipated higher full-year global activity levels. And we have a strong cash position of just over $1 billion to support earnings growth opportunities.That concludes our prepared remarks.

In Europe, the story is slightly different. We think that OEM automotive production will be relatively flat, maybe slightly positive depending on how the year proceeds. And industrial production will be up slightly. These are low single digit numbers in Europe. The real positive story for us is going to continue to be Asia. As we mentioned in the report, Asia now makes up about 20% of the sales of our Industrial Coatings segment. We had record automotive build in China in 2009. We ended the year with a lot of momentum. The beginning of 2010 appears to be strong. So we're looking again in China for another 10% or so increase in automotive production. Korea and India are also positive and building momentum.

So I think the cost story for us is going to continue to be positive. We're going to pick up volume especially here in North America and in Asia. I think raw materials, although there is some inflation out there, I think it is manageable. So we're looking for some further improvement in the coatings margins for industrial in 2010."

And sequentially in the fourth quarter, some of that was related to the healthy export business that we're seeing from PBC and also back in the chain.

As we went into the first quarter here earlier in the month, I think there was lighter activity in part because I think there had been a number of shipments made at the end of the month around the pricing. We had bad weather. But we're seeing now, we think, a positive trend on volume for chlor-alkali. We also are increasingly confident about the success of the $75 caustic-price increase.

That was probably the weakest market and maybe to a lesser extent, some of the military applications here in 2010. Aerospace, we think still is holding up. The backlogs continue to slide for the big commercial airliners. We're looking at lower backlogs at Boeing and Airbus, but they have kept production schedules at the OEM level and Aerospace, up fairly steady. And we think that as they move through all the qualification steps and start ramping up production for the Dreamliner of the 787 at Boeing, that presents us and a number of other suppliers with some upside. So I think that if we can move out of this economic-crisis environment, 2010 should still be a good year for our Aerospace business. And we hope that if the recovery continues, the backlog can rebuild itself over the next 18 months to two years, and they can maintain some of the production schedule that we have. So our outlook there, we realized there's some weakness, but we think that it is manageable for us. Similar story on the Marine. On the Marine business, the production schedules in Asia and in China and Korea in particular, have been fairly steady over the last year. And we're only looking for a modest decline this year, 2010, in the OEM build. Now the backlogs there are coming down as well, so we could have an impact in 2011 in our Protective & Marine business as they adjust production schedules if the backlog doesn't start to rebuild. The Aftermarket business for Marine, we think is going to be pretty steady. Most of the indicators now, in terms of Marine activity, not the new OEM builds but overall, ship usage are going up. So we think that's going to be a positive and a potential offset in the aftermarket business. And the Protective side of our business unit that goes across a number of industrial and infrastructure assets, that's been very solid in Asia, and we look for that to continue. And we think that the business, if the stimulus dollar is here or potentially in 2010, in Europe, can get to those projects that, that will start to give us a little bit of growth. Because the protective side of the business has not been very strong here in North America nor in Europe. And we're hoping that industrial activity and some of these infrastructure projects, as the stimulus money gets through, could give us a little better story in that protective market for 2010."

We think as my comments on Don Carson's question is that we are near the bottom of the chlor-alkali cycle, and we're looking for improvement through the year in 2010, even if we're still at a relatively low point. So I think you're going to see a similar phenomena out of the Chlor-Alkali business. As I've commented, the increases that we're seeing in raw materials are modest at this time. And we're always going to have somewhat of a lag on that with our Chlor-Alkali business. But we also feel that we also have a lag in terms of when we get raw material increases, either because of contracts or our ability to negotiate with our suppliers. So we think that we will still get the benefits of chlor-alkali in terms of that countercyclical performance."

But we did not provide any additional incentives for our customers, our dealers and distributors to incentivize them to buy. And I think this is in recognition of, let's say, the more fragile nature of the recovery in the balance sheet or borrowing capabilities of everyone throughout the chain. And I think what we've seen during this cycle, as you've heard from our commentary about how we've watched cash and try to deliver good cash performance, strengthen the balance sheet. We've seen that at any number of customers, including the automotive refinished customers. So that there, clearly, have been watching their balance sheets more closely. So rather than restock aggressively to take into consideration a buying window or some other incentive from the manufacturers, we've seen what now is no longer a destocking because that was their initial reaction and especially, earlier, in this year, they were destocking inventories that they had been holding. But this year, we have also been listening to them. So they haven't been asking us to, give us some incentive so that we can restock. Let's manage demand and let's manage our inventories to the level of activity that we see out there. Now we also saw at the beginning of this month some more severe weather here in North America and in Europe. So we're hopeful that, that will lead to increased demand as we get into the spring because of the number of accidents and the other things that happened with that bad weather. But it did make it a little tougher at the beginning of this year to look at economic activity in both the North America and in European markets because the weather over the first two weeks, it's moderating now, was a little -- was much colder. And we think that we're not as able as a result of that here sitting in mid-January to say that we're going to see this sellthrough. But we're more confident that as the quarter goes on, we get into spring, refinish will be a stronger market because we definitely experienced destocking during the course of 2009."

This afternoon, I will provide a brief overview of our first quarter performance. Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.Throughout the first quarter, we continued to experience a moderate recovery in several of the global end-use markets that we serve. This recovery, combined with lower costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives the past 18 months, positively impacted our financial results in comparison with what was a very low earnings level in last year's first quarter. Higher year-over-year sales volumes were most evident in our Industrial Coatings segment, which benefited from improving global automotive builds and gains in several general industrial applications. As evidence of the operating leverage we are experiencing, the Industrial Coatings segment posted its highest first quarter earnings in 10 years, despite industry activity levels that, while improving, still remain well below historical levels. Also, our Optical and Specialty Materials segment delivered double-digit percentage sales growth versus last year's period and record first quarter earnings. Several businesses in our Performance Coatings segment and our Architectural Coatings EMEA segment experienced some weather-related sales softness early in the quarter, but rebounded strongly, easily exceeding our internal projections for March.The Commodity Chemicals segment remained at trough earnings levels, as we experienced higher input and maintenance costs versus the fourth quarter of 2009. However, caustic demand has improved. And we anticipate the segment will be solidly profitable in the second quarter, as we implement previously announced price increases. Our Glass segment improved versus a significant loss last year, as higher industrial activity benefited our Fiberglass business. However, we still experienced a slight loss in the quarter.Reviewing our results by region, our investments over the past several years to expand our presence in the emerging regions, such as Asia/Pacific, continue to pay off. Asia/Pacific remained our star performer, with 25% year-over-year volume growth and we realized first quarter sales and earnings records in that region. We also realized a high growth rate in Latin America. North America benefited from a modest improvement in activity, with strong year-over-year gains in industrial end-use markets, including Automotive OEM. The overall construction markets here, however, continued to remain weak. Volumes in Europe lagged that of the other major regions due to a slower economic recovery in that region. Lastly, in general, we believe our improved sales pace is consistent with improving demand levels. And we are not aware of any notable inventory building in most of our end-use markets.Overall for the quarter, I am very pleased that the difficult actions we took and all the hard work and effort we expanded over the past 18 months throughout the recession to properly position the company for a recovery is now beginning to yield measurable benefits. Also, several of our businesses that have been slower to recover, such as Commodity Chemicals, are beginning to exhibit signs of further improvement and that, combined with our continued cost reduction and execution focus, provides us with a clear path for continued earnings recovery.Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to review our financial performance for the quarter."

Let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales has improved from last year's lows, but we still remained well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses. We have been and will remain",2852,"Thanks, Chuck. Let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales has improved from last year's lows, but we still remained well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses. We have been and will remain diligent in managing our costs. This is apparent if you look at our margin leverage from our incremental sales. In aggregate, the Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments realized a greater than 80% earnings margin on the higher sales level, excluding favorable currency conversion impacts. We have experienced modest coatings raw material inflation in the low single-digit percent range, with notably different inflation rates by region and business. We anticipate the inflation rate will be higher in the second quarter, reflecting improved global demand and some transitory supply issues. We have and expect to continue to offset this inflation with selling prices and productivity.Our blended natural gas cost, both hedged and non-hedged in the quarter, was 650 per mmbtu, which is up about $0.50 from the fourth quarter of 2009, a down by approximately the same amount versus the prior year's first quarter. Using recent price trends, our blended unit prices expected a drop to between $5 and $5.50 in the second quarter. Like many other U.S. companies, our reported earnings per share result include a negative non-reoccurring impact of $85 million after-tax or $0.51 per share, due to a tax law change stemming from the recently enacted U.S. healthcare legislation.We issued a press release on April 8 with additional details on this matter. And lastly, our cash flow, cash position and liquidity all remained very solid. We have moved away from the strong emphasis we placed on cash conservation last year to now identifying ways to deploy our cash in a balanced, disciplined manner to drive earnings accretion. And now, I will review some details on the quarter.A year-over-year bridge of our first quarter sales is detailed on the next slide, along with some relevant trends. First quarter sales improved about $340 million or 12% versus the first quarter of 2009, which was severely impacted by the global recession. Lower year-over-year pricing was primarily attributable to commodity chemicals, coupled with lower energy surcharges in our Glass and Silicas businesses. Pricing in the remaining reporting segments was flat to higher year-over-year.Compared to the last year, currency translation added about $150 million to our sales and about $15 million to earnings. As illustrated on the bottom left chart, the value of the euro was higher against the dollar in comparison with last year's first quarter, which was depressed because of the recession. However, the euro has declined versus the fourth quarter of last year based on the recent exchange rates we expect currency to be a headwind in the second quarter.Volumes improved by over $300 million, with the largest increases driven by higher global industrial demand and strong growth in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China and Korea. We are pleased with the increase but recognize that it is in comparison to what were very low activity levels last year.Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As illustrated on the chart exhibiting our volume trends by region, Asia/Pacific delivered tremendous volume growth of 25% year-over-year, led by our Industrial Coatings businesses in the region. The momentum in that region has carry forward from last year, and we expect the end-use markets that we serve to remain robust. Our United States and Canada volumes also experienced solid growth, driven again by higher industrial activity, along with improving commodity chemical demand. Our businesses selling into the construction markets were flat to negative with the prior year, with declines in commercial construction a major continuing factor. We anticipate similar improvements in industrial demand going into the second quarter although outside a favorable seasonal trends, we do not expect a meaningful change in the pace of the construction markets.  Volumes in Europe were up modestly versus the prior year's quarter, yet the region lags the other major global regions in pace of economic recovery. Latin America, which is our smallest region, experienced solid industrial gains as well. The chart on the right demonstrates that while our  overall volumes have recovered somewhat from last year's low levels, they still remain between 10% and 15% below the pre-recession levels of early 2008. As a result, we still need further economic recovery to close this gap. And we are positioned to fully benefit from the improving volumes based on lower our cost structure.While I am a focused on our total volume performance, I want to mention that our Aggregate Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments had a similar sales volume decline from 2008, yet have delivered in an earnings improvement approaching 10% over that same time period. Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix of today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.70 versus a $0.19 adjusted figure last year. While we are pleased with our year-over-year improvement, we are fully aware that we are still below historical earnings levels. A key contributor in our improvement was a higher sales volume. Another other major factor was our lower cost structure, including the savings stemming from our restructuring actions. Lower commodity chemicals pricing served as a partial offset. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 30% in the first quarter of 2010 and 33% in the first quarter of 2009.Moving now to review our individual business segments. Let me start on the next slide with Industrial Coatings. This segment continued its rapid return to pre-recession earnings levels. In the quarter, sales grew 39% or about $250 million. Earnings improved by $117 million from a $16 million loss in the prior year's period. And our operating margin improved to 11.3%. This earnings level was the highest in 10 years, despite sales volumes in many end-use markets that remain depressed versus pre-recession levels.Cost management, restructuring-related cost savings and volume were all contributors to the earnings improvement. However, improved volumes was the largest factor. This segment, which was our most impacted segment during the recession, experienced the largest recovery with volumes improving by 31% versus the prior year's quarter. The segment volume trend chart details the dramatic volume trend changes in this segment over that time. From an individual business unit perspective, Automotive OEM Coatings, which is our largest individual business in the segment, had volumes, which were up 50% versus last year's extremely low level. Each region delivered strong year-over-year sales growth, supported by improved demand, including 100% growth in our Asian region. However, as depicted on the bottom right chart, auto bill levels in the Americas and Europe combined,  still remains about 20% below pre-recession levels. While we normally experience a seasonal uptick in the second quarter, we expect that to be muted this year the amount, given the consistent level of auto production in each market during the first quarter. As such, we anticipate a fairly similar global build rate in the second quarter as we experienced in the first quarter.Our Industrial Coatings business unit also delivered solid growth levels, up about 20%, which is a reflection of the improvement in the general industrial economy in all regions. Asia/Pacific is now our second largest region in this business and its growth rate approached 50% in the quarter. We expect the global industrial economy to continue its moderate recovery. The Packaging Coatings business also improved versus 2009 and once again, delivered solid financial results. Given the nature of the end-use market, this business is a more stable performer throughout the economic cycle. We did not experience a significant volume drop last year. And we realized a moderate volume improvement during the quarter.Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment, through much hard work, has returned much closer to historic operating margins. Given the lack of traditional seasonality in the auto OEM market this year, we anticipate a more modest seasonal improvement in this segment for the second quarter. However, we do expect some further gradual recovery in the general industrial economy in Asia to remain strong. Also, we intend to remain diligently focused on our cost structure.The Performance Coatings segment results are detailed on the next slide. In the quarter, sales grew by $37 million and earnings improved by $38 million versus the prior year. Overall, volumes were slightly negative, with improved volumes in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, offset by lower volumes in Europe and the U.S. However, a favorable business mix within the segment and lower cost enhanced our margins and created positive earnings leverage. Currency conversion added about $55 million to sales and $5 million to earnings. Our Automotive Refinish business was negatively impacted last year by the recession in customer destocking. This quarter, the business experienced high single-digit sales growth, excluding favorable currency impacts, aided by an improving trend in the overall miles driven and by the general economic recovery. Sales in the second quarter are historically higher due to seasonality. And we expect a similar pattern this year.Our Protective and Marine Coatings and Aerospace businesses, both of which have a sizable aftermarket component, of [ph] late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline in the first quarter of last year as most of our other businesses. Volumes this past quarter were down mid-single digit percent from last year. But as detailed on the slides, sales have been fairly consistent the past three quarters, and current quarter sales were actually slightly higher than the fourth quarter level. We expect this fairly stable sales performance to continue.In the quarter, our Architectural Coatings America and Asia/Pacific volumes declined once again. Solid growth in Asia/Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by lower volumes in the United States. Our U.S. volumes were largely negative in both January and February, reflecting in part, poor weather in most of the country. In March, our year-over-year trend improved dramatically as we fully recovered from the weather effects early in the quarter. For the entire quarter, U.S volumes were down due to lower commercial construction activity and the lack of any substantial rebound in residential activity. This business is highly seasonal. And we expect higher activity levels in the second quarter, but expect the overall construction markets in the U.S. to remain at low historical levels. Overall, Performance Coatings has proven its stability, has delivered some of our most consistent earnings results through the recession and has maintained or grown operating margin due in part to lowering its cost structure. Looking ahead in the second quarter, we expect similar stability and normal upward seasonal trends in the Auto Refinish and Architectural Coatings businesses.Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA business, are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter were $436 million, up $27 million versus last year's period. And earnings improved by $8 million in what is historically a seasonal slow period for this segment. Over the past year, this business has been much less cyclical than most others, with volumes for the full year of 2009 falling by only mid single-digit percent. Given the slower pace of recovery in Europe, our first quarter results were similar.Our higher earnings stem from a lower cost structure in overall cost-management actions. Currency conversion added about 7% to our top line but did not impact earnings. As we have traditionally done, included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense stemming from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As you can see, aided by lower cost, our EBITDA margins improved this past quarter versus, not only 2009, but also 2008.Looking ahead, we anticipate a longer recovery timetable for the European economies and therefore, continue to expect modest volume challenges in this segment. The second and third quarters should provide a sizable seasonal sales lift, with currency a potential headwind. Our focus remains on cost management and execution to maintain profitability, building our brands and positioning to grow in emerging regions. Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed on the following slide. Versus the prior year, first quarter sales increased by $39 million to $284 million on solid volume growth. Earnings grew by 37% to a new record first quarter level due to the impact of increased volumes, coupled with lower cost. Our optical product sales grew by double-digit percent, with solid growth in all major regions. Our silica products, some of which are used has a raw material in the production of tires and car batteries, experienced very significant volume declines early last year, but have reversed that trend consistent with year-over-year growth in the auto market.Looking ahead, we anticipate moderate seasonal improvements in sales and intend to increase our selling and marketing efforts in the second quarter to drive further growth for the quarter and the remainder of the year. The next slide shows our Commodity Chemicals segment results. Sales dropped by about $30 million versus last year's period, earnings fell $80 million in comparison what was a strong performance in Q1 of the previous year. Compared with the first quarter of 2009, sales volumes improved by over 30% or were more than offset by lower selling prices. Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, the ECU price, fell substantially. Chlorine prices improved, but those gains were erased by lower caustic prices, reflecting the impacts of lower industrial demand in most of last year. Also, our costs were modestly higher, primarily due to a much higher ethylene cost, somewhat offset by lower natural gas prices. Comparing first quarter results this year, versus the fourth quarter of 2009, the ECU price was flat as the chlorine price slipped mildly and was offset by strengthening caustic prices. As displayed on the chart, domestic caustic volumes improved, especially in March, drawing down our inventories. But the earnings impact was nullified by increases in our primary input costs. Our inventories have fallen in 30 of the past 36 weeks. Looking forward, we expect this business to return to solid profitability in the second quarter as we implement previously announced price increases and caustic soda and based on current input cost.Our Glass segment details are on the following slide. Sales were $220 million, up $24 million or 12%. Overall volumes advanced, while pricing declined due in part to a lower year-over-year energy and fuel surcharges. While the segment remained unprofitable, the $3 million loss was a dramatic improvement over the prior year's period where we lost $27 million. Our Fiberglass business benefited from the rebounding global industrial activity in volumes to improved nearly 45% in contrast to a similar percentage decline last year. This higher activity resulted in an improved manufacturing utilization.The architectural glass markets, both commercial and residential construction served by our Performance Glazings business, remained at recession levels. Both businesses benefited from a considerable cost reductions. Equity and royalty earnings improved, largely driven by equity results in our Asian fiberglass joint venture, which supplies the electronics industry. We expect both businesses to exhibit better seasonal trends in the second quarter. This would also improve capacity utilization, including in fiberglass, where inventory levels are low and where we have already announced price increases effective in the second quarter.Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details, which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $700 million of cash on hand. In the quarter, we used about $50 million of cash for operations, including traditional, seasonal working capital increases versus fourth quarter. Our first quarter cash from operations results puts us nearly $250 million ahead of our 2009 pace. And I will remind you, the full year of 2009, was our second best cash generation year on record. We spent $45 million on capital spending during the quarter. And we expect our full year capital spending to be in the range of 300 to $350 million. Our dividend payments, a long-standing heritage at PPG were $90 million.We also repaid more than $150 million of debt in the quarter, and don't anticipate any further term debt reduction of size for the remainder of the year. As we've previously stated, we do expect full year contribution to our pension fund of $240 million.  Last year, we put approximately $450 million of cash in company stock into our plans, including about $175 million in the first quarter. Our cash position remains very strong, especially when considering that our strongest cash generation quarters are late in the year. And we intended to play cash over the balance of the year in a disciplined manner with a focus on growing on earnings per share.We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also share repurchases, will be a likely usage here. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck talk for some closing remarks."

And we believe there has not been any sizable inventory building in many of our end-use markets we serve. We still have several end use markets or businesses that have yet to recover, such as commodity chemicals, which is beginning to exhibit positive signs that we expect will boost our earnings in the coming quarters. We continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Our efforts and investments over the past several years to expand our presence in emerging regions, such as Asia/Pacific, continue to pay off. As they, along with our Optical Products business, have once, again, proven to be critical growth drivers for the corporation.Let me conclude by commenting that global end-use market activity remains well below historical levels as do our earnings. And our objective is to continue to accelerate our earnings recovery back to pre-recession levels. To do so, we will remain focused on diligently managing our cost to maximize the impacts from further volume recovery. Also, we intend to further deploy our strong cash position, focused on bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases to further fuel our earnings growth.

We felt that, that would offset price increases from raw materials that we were experiencing. And we talked about the low 3% to 4% kind of inflationary indicators that we were seeing for raw materials. What we're seeing right now is, as we come into the early parts of the second quarter, we're seeing a little bit higher inflation level, especially in a couple of commodities. So we're watching this right now. I would say that today, in several of our channels where we have had pricing, we think that we're in pretty good shape, but we're watching the trends. In several of our segments or end-use markets where we haven't yet achieved all the price increases that we're looking for, we will be talking to customers because this is, I would say, a consistent trend across regions that we are seeing raw material inflation, combined with some shortages here that have emerged in the first quarter. And Europe is a similar story. Even though the volume there has been, I would say, weak in the first quarter, and similar weather conditions in Europe to what we experienced here in North America, there is some not as great inflationary pressure in Europe on the raw materials side, and we will be looking -- as we move through the second quarter, we're going to monitor our raw materials prices and see if we need to look at targeted price increases on the architectural side."

And we're getting some help from improved volume. On the silica side, we had a very nice improvement there as well, both in volume and in margins. As Bob mentioned in his remarks, the tire industry has recovered here in the first quarter. So that provided some volume lift. We also have some cost benefits in the Silica business, from lower natural gas costs and the restructuring actions that we took last year.

What we have been trying to do in the hedging program is take away the upside spikes in pricing. If you look at the experience in this decade until the last year and a half or so, most of the variability came on the upside, either during weather events like hurricanes or harsh periods of the winter, and we saw price spikes that would go well over $10 in MMBTu into the $13 and $15 range. So we were really trying to cap some of the upside risks that we saw from the pricing. Now what's happened over the last couple of years, we think, has changed the game when you have that in an overall weaker economy. But obviously, the shale gas has made a big difference. Whether in the Barnett field or the Marcellus field here in this region, the supply picture has changed quite a bit. And so even with an improving demand, we see pricing very stable, volumes and inventories continuing at very high level. So we think the game has changed. We're no longer concerned about protecting ourselves against these upside price spikes. So we really stopped hedging over a year ago. But up until that time, we were going out two or three years with some of our hedges, in order to protect ourselves. And we had a little more in the winter months, typically, where there was more potential for variability. So we've stopped hedging and we're going to just ride this thing out, and hopefully, this shale play is a long-term trend for us. And I think, if it is, it's going to be a very positive factor for the U.S. chemical industry and for a number of our other manufacturing industries, including our Glass business."

We're in, now, the fourth year of this housing recession here in North America. I predicted that we were going to be out of this recession, probably a year and a half or a year ago. And I have been, I think, continually disappointed by the pace of the recovery. Now I don't think we're going to get any worse. New housing starts, we've talked about building from this level of 600,000, but we haven't seen it so far. And the start of the year was very weak. Some of that, we hope, is weather. And now we have the commercial construction market a little weaker. We think that the renovation side of residential will be better. So overall, it's still going to be a positive story for us this year. But I am surprised that it's taking us as long as it has, as a country, to work through all these mortgage and foreclosure issues. We have a housing credit that is going to expire. So there's conflicting data. And so we think, overall, it'll be positive, but not strong. And clearly, with what we're seeing on the automotive side from maybe a deeper decline, we're seeing more of a bounce back. So I think, 2011, for us, seems like a better year to predict a strong upturn. We should get improvement in commercial. New homes should finally start to get better, maybe even later this year. But we just haven't seen volume on the construction markets, either here in North America or in Europe, that would lead us to say that we should be really bullish on that market for the rest of this year."

But certainly, those would be some of the markets and some of the products in the petrochemical chain that we saw, either with price increases or supply disruptions. In Europe, although the demand haven't been as strong, the economy has been weaker there and slower to recover than here, we've had some similar issues. There was a TiO2 plant that had a significant supply event in the U.K., and that has affected short-term supply/demand balance for TiO2. And we've had some raw material inflation, again, at the lower end of that 3% to 4% kind of inflation that we've been talking about.

This afternoon, I will provide a brief overview of our first quarter performance. Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.Throughout the first quarter, we continued to experience a moderate recovery in several of the global end-use markets that we serve. This recovery, combined with lower costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives the past 18 months, positively impacted our financial results in comparison with what was a very low earnings level in last year's first quarter. Higher year-over-year sales volumes were most evident in our Industrial Coatings segment, which benefited from improving global automotive builds and gains in several general industrial applications. As evidence of the operating leverage we are experiencing, the Industrial Coatings segment posted its highest first quarter earnings in 10 years, despite industry activity levels that, while improving, still remain well below historical levels. Also, our Optical and Specialty Materials segment delivered double-digit percentage sales growth versus last year's period and record first quarter earnings. Several businesses in our Performance Coatings segment and our Architectural Coatings EMEA segment experienced some weather-related sales softness early in the quarter, but rebounded strongly, easily exceeding our internal projections for March.The Commodity Chemicals segment remained at trough earnings levels, as we experienced higher input and maintenance costs versus the fourth quarter of 2009. However, caustic demand has improved. And we anticipate the segment will be solidly profitable in the second quarter, as we implement previously announced price increases. Our Glass segment improved versus a significant loss last year, as higher industrial activity benefited our Fiberglass business. However, we still experienced a slight loss in the quarter.Reviewing our results by region, our investments over the past several years to expand our presence in the emerging regions, such as Asia/Pacific, continue to pay off. Asia/Pacific remained our star performer, with 25% year-over-year volume growth and we realized first quarter sales and earnings records in that region. We also realized a high growth rate in Latin America. North America benefited from a modest improvement in activity, with strong year-over-year gains in industrial end-use markets, including Automotive OEM. The overall construction markets here, however, continued to remain weak. Volumes in Europe lagged that of the other major regions due to a slower economic recovery in that region. Lastly, in general, we believe our improved sales pace is consistent with improving demand levels. And we are not aware of any notable inventory building in most of our end-use markets.Overall for the quarter, I am very pleased that the difficult actions we took and all the hard work and effort we expanded over the past 18 months throughout the recession to properly position the company for a recovery is now beginning to yield measurable benefits. Also, several of our businesses that have been slower to recover, such as Commodity Chemicals, are beginning to exhibit signs of further improvement and that, combined with our continued cost reduction and execution focus, provides us with a clear path for continued earnings recovery.Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to review our financial performance for the quarter."
294639,98843577,56282,"PPG Industries Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2010",2010-04-15,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. Let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales has improved from last year's lows, but we still remained well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses. We have been and will remain",2852,"Thanks, Chuck. Let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales has improved from last year's lows, but we still remained well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses. We have been and will remain diligent in managing our costs. This is apparent if you look at our margin leverage from our incremental sales. In aggregate, the Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments realized a greater than 80% earnings margin on the higher sales level, excluding favorable currency conversion impacts. We have experienced modest coatings raw material inflation in the low single-digit percent range, with notably different inflation rates by region and business. We anticipate the inflation rate will be higher in the second quarter, reflecting improved global demand and some transitory supply issues. We have and expect to continue to offset this inflation with selling prices and productivity.Our blended natural gas cost, both hedged and non-hedged in the quarter, was 650 per mmbtu, which is up about $0.50 from the fourth quarter of 2009, a down by approximately the same amount versus the prior year's first quarter. Using recent price trends, our blended unit prices expected a drop to between $5 and $5.50 in the second quarter. Like many other U.S. companies, our reported earnings per share result include a negative non-reoccurring impact of $85 million after-tax or $0.51 per share, due to a tax law change stemming from the recently enacted U.S. healthcare legislation.We issued a press release on April 8 with additional details on this matter. And lastly, our cash flow, cash position and liquidity all remained very solid. We have moved away from the strong emphasis we placed on cash conservation last year to now identifying ways to deploy our cash in a balanced, disciplined manner to drive earnings accretion. And now, I will review some details on the quarter.A year-over-year bridge of our first quarter sales is detailed on the next slide, along with some relevant trends. First quarter sales improved about $340 million or 12% versus the first quarter of 2009, which was severely impacted by the global recession. Lower year-over-year pricing was primarily attributable to commodity chemicals, coupled with lower energy surcharges in our Glass and Silicas businesses. Pricing in the remaining reporting segments was flat to higher year-over-year.Compared to the last year, currency translation added about $150 million to our sales and about $15 million to earnings. As illustrated on the bottom left chart, the value of the euro was higher against the dollar in comparison with last year's first quarter, which was depressed because of the recession. However, the euro has declined versus the fourth quarter of last year based on the recent exchange rates we expect currency to be a headwind in the second quarter.Volumes improved by over $300 million, with the largest increases driven by higher global industrial demand and strong growth in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China and Korea. We are pleased with the increase but recognize that it is in comparison to what were very low activity levels last year.Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As illustrated on the chart exhibiting our volume trends by region, Asia/Pacific delivered tremendous volume growth of 25% year-over-year, led by our Industrial Coatings businesses in the region. The momentum in that region has carry forward from last year, and we expect the end-use markets that we serve to remain robust. Our United States and Canada volumes also experienced solid growth, driven again by higher industrial activity, along with improving commodity chemical demand. Our businesses selling into the construction markets were flat to negative with the prior year, with declines in commercial construction a major continuing factor. We anticipate similar improvements in industrial demand going into the second quarter although outside a favorable seasonal trends, we do not expect a meaningful change in the pace of the construction markets.  Volumes in Europe were up modestly versus the prior year's quarter, yet the region lags the other major global regions in pace of economic recovery. Latin America, which is our smallest region, experienced solid industrial gains as well. The chart on the right demonstrates that while our  overall volumes have recovered somewhat from last year's low levels, they still remain between 10% and 15% below the pre-recession levels of early 2008. As a result, we still need further economic recovery to close this gap. And we are positioned to fully benefit from the improving volumes based on lower our cost structure.While I am a focused on our total volume performance, I want to mention that our Aggregate Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments had a similar sales volume decline from 2008, yet have delivered in an earnings improvement approaching 10% over that same time period. Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix of today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.70 versus a $0.19 adjusted figure last year. While we are pleased with our year-over-year improvement, we are fully aware that we are still below historical earnings levels. A key contributor in our improvement was a higher sales volume. Another other major factor was our lower cost structure, including the savings stemming from our restructuring actions. Lower commodity chemicals pricing served as a partial offset. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 30% in the first quarter of 2010 and 33% in the first quarter of 2009.Moving now to review our individual business segments. Let me start on the next slide with Industrial Coatings. This segment continued its rapid return to pre-recession earnings levels. In the quarter, sales grew 39% or about $250 million. Earnings improved by $117 million from a $16 million loss in the prior year's period. And our operating margin improved to 11.3%. This earnings level was the highest in 10 years, despite sales volumes in many end-use markets that remain depressed versus pre-recession levels.Cost management, restructuring-related cost savings and volume were all contributors to the earnings improvement. However, improved volumes was the largest factor. This segment, which was our most impacted segment during the recession, experienced the largest recovery with volumes improving by 31% versus the prior year's quarter. The segment volume trend chart details the dramatic volume trend changes in this segment over that time. From an individual business unit perspective, Automotive OEM Coatings, which is our largest individual business in the segment, had volumes, which were up 50% versus last year's extremely low level. Each region delivered strong year-over-year sales growth, supported by improved demand, including 100% growth in our Asian region. However, as depicted on the bottom right chart, auto bill levels in the Americas and Europe combined,  still remains about 20% below pre-recession levels. While we normally experience a seasonal uptick in the second quarter, we expect that to be muted this year the amount, given the consistent level of auto production in each market during the first quarter. As such, we anticipate a fairly similar global build rate in the second quarter as we experienced in the first quarter.Our Industrial Coatings business unit also delivered solid growth levels, up about 20%, which is a reflection of the improvement in the general industrial economy in all regions. Asia/Pacific is now our second largest region in this business and its growth rate approached 50% in the quarter. We expect the global industrial economy to continue its moderate recovery. The Packaging Coatings business also improved versus 2009 and once again, delivered solid financial results. Given the nature of the end-use market, this business is a more stable performer throughout the economic cycle. We did not experience a significant volume drop last year. And we realized a moderate volume improvement during the quarter.Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment, through much hard work, has returned much closer to historic operating margins. Given the lack of traditional seasonality in the auto OEM market this year, we anticipate a more modest seasonal improvement in this segment for the second quarter. However, we do expect some further gradual recovery in the general industrial economy in Asia to remain strong. Also, we intend to remain diligently focused on our cost structure.The Performance Coatings segment results are detailed on the next slide. In the quarter, sales grew by $37 million and earnings improved by $38 million versus the prior year. Overall, volumes were slightly negative, with improved volumes in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, offset by lower volumes in Europe and the U.S. However, a favorable business mix within the segment and lower cost enhanced our margins and created positive earnings leverage. Currency conversion added about $55 million to sales and $5 million to earnings. Our Automotive Refinish business was negatively impacted last year by the recession in customer destocking. This quarter, the business experienced high single-digit sales growth, excluding favorable currency impacts, aided by an improving trend in the overall miles driven and by the general economic recovery. Sales in the second quarter are historically higher due to seasonality. And we expect a similar pattern this year.Our Protective and Marine Coatings and Aerospace businesses, both of which have a sizable aftermarket component, of [ph] late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline in the first quarter of last year as most of our other businesses. Volumes this past quarter were down mid-single digit percent from last year. But as detailed on the slides, sales have been fairly consistent the past three quarters, and current quarter sales were actually slightly higher than the fourth quarter level. We expect this fairly stable sales performance to continue.In the quarter, our Architectural Coatings America and Asia/Pacific volumes declined once again. Solid growth in Asia/Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by lower volumes in the United States. Our U.S. volumes were largely negative in both January and February, reflecting in part, poor weather in most of the country. In March, our year-over-year trend improved dramatically as we fully recovered from the weather effects early in the quarter. For the entire quarter, U.S volumes were down due to lower commercial construction activity and the lack of any substantial rebound in residential activity. This business is highly seasonal. And we expect higher activity levels in the second quarter, but expect the overall construction markets in the U.S. to remain at low historical levels. Overall, Performance Coatings has proven its stability, has delivered some of our most consistent earnings results through the recession and has maintained or grown operating margin due in part to lowering its cost structure. Looking ahead in the second quarter, we expect similar stability and normal upward seasonal trends in the Auto Refinish and Architectural Coatings businesses.Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA business, are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter were $436 million, up $27 million versus last year's period. And earnings improved by $8 million in what is historically a seasonal slow period for this segment. Over the past year, this business has been much less cyclical than most others, with volumes for the full year of 2009 falling by only mid single-digit percent. Given the slower pace of recovery in Europe, our first quarter results were similar.Our higher earnings stem from a lower cost structure in overall cost-management actions. Currency conversion added about 7% to our top line but did not impact earnings. As we have traditionally done, included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense stemming from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As you can see, aided by lower cost, our EBITDA margins improved this past quarter versus, not only 2009, but also 2008.Looking ahead, we anticipate a longer recovery timetable for the European economies and therefore, continue to expect modest volume challenges in this segment. The second and third quarters should provide a sizable seasonal sales lift, with currency a potential headwind. Our focus remains on cost management and execution to maintain profitability, building our brands and positioning to grow in emerging regions. Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed on the following slide. Versus the prior year, first quarter sales increased by $39 million to $284 million on solid volume growth. Earnings grew by 37% to a new record first quarter level due to the impact of increased volumes, coupled with lower cost. Our optical product sales grew by double-digit percent, with solid growth in all major regions. Our silica products, some of which are used has a raw material in the production of tires and car batteries, experienced very significant volume declines early last year, but have reversed that trend consistent with year-over-year growth in the auto market.Looking ahead, we anticipate moderate seasonal improvements in sales and intend to increase our selling and marketing efforts in the second quarter to drive further growth for the quarter and the remainder of the year. The next slide shows our Commodity Chemicals segment results. Sales dropped by about $30 million versus last year's period, earnings fell $80 million in comparison what was a strong performance in Q1 of the previous year. Compared with the first quarter of 2009, sales volumes improved by over 30% or were more than offset by lower selling prices. Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, the ECU price, fell substantially. Chlorine prices improved, but those gains were erased by lower caustic prices, reflecting the impacts of lower industrial demand in most of last year. Also, our costs were modestly higher, primarily due to a much higher ethylene cost, somewhat offset by lower natural gas prices. Comparing first quarter results this year, versus the fourth quarter of 2009, the ECU price was flat as the chlorine price slipped mildly and was offset by strengthening caustic prices. As displayed on the chart, domestic caustic volumes improved, especially in March, drawing down our inventories. But the earnings impact was nullified by increases in our primary input costs. Our inventories have fallen in 30 of the past 36 weeks. Looking forward, we expect this business to return to solid profitability in the second quarter as we implement previously announced price increases and caustic soda and based on current input cost.Our Glass segment details are on the following slide. Sales were $220 million, up $24 million or 12%. Overall volumes advanced, while pricing declined due in part to a lower year-over-year energy and fuel surcharges. While the segment remained unprofitable, the $3 million loss was a dramatic improvement over the prior year's period where we lost $27 million. Our Fiberglass business benefited from the rebounding global industrial activity in volumes to improved nearly 45% in contrast to a similar percentage decline last year. This higher activity resulted in an improved manufacturing utilization.The architectural glass markets, both commercial and residential construction served by our Performance Glazings business, remained at recession levels. Both businesses benefited from a considerable cost reductions. Equity and royalty earnings improved, largely driven by equity results in our Asian fiberglass joint venture, which supplies the electronics industry. We expect both businesses to exhibit better seasonal trends in the second quarter. This would also improve capacity utilization, including in fiberglass, where inventory levels are low and where we have already announced price increases effective in the second quarter.Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details, which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $700 million of cash on hand. In the quarter, we used about $50 million of cash for operations, including traditional, seasonal working capital increases versus fourth quarter. Our first quarter cash from operations results puts us nearly $250 million ahead of our 2009 pace. And I will remind you, the full year of 2009, was our second best cash generation year on record. We spent $45 million on capital spending during the quarter. And we expect our full year capital spending to be in the range of 300 to $350 million. Our dividend payments, a long-standing heritage at PPG were $90 million.We also repaid more than $150 million of debt in the quarter, and don't anticipate any further term debt reduction of size for the remainder of the year. As we've previously stated, we do expect full year contribution to our pension fund of $240 million.  Last year, we put approximately $450 million of cash in company stock into our plans, including about $175 million in the first quarter. Our cash position remains very strong, especially when considering that our strongest cash generation quarters are late in the year. And we intended to play cash over the balance of the year in a disciplined manner with a focus on growing on earnings per share.We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also share repurchases, will be a likely usage here. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck talk for some closing remarks."

I will conclude by reiterating a few key items. Global industrial demand is recovering at a moderate pace. And we believe there has not been any sizable inventory building in many of our end-use markets we serve. We still have several end use markets or businesses that have yet to recover, such as commodity chemicals, which is beginning to exhibit positive signs that we expect will boost our earnings in the coming quarters. We continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Our efforts and investments over the past several years to expand our presence in emerging regions, such as Asia/Pacific, continue to pay off. As they, along with our Optical Products business, have once, again, proven to be critical growth drivers for the corporation.Let me conclude by commenting that global end-use market activity remains well below historical levels as do our earnings. And our objective is to continue to accelerate our earnings recovery back to pre-recession levels. To do so, we will remain focused on diligently managing our cost to maximize the impacts from further volume recovery. Also, we intend to further deploy our strong cash position, focused on bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases to further fuel our earnings growth. I am encouraged that we are now entering what has historically been PPG's best quarter with a very low cost position and growing momentum. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions.'"

We're fairly optimistic about the business here in the developed regions, as well as what's happening in the emerging regions. We think the Architectural business was affected by weather conditions early in this quarter, was rebounding in March as the weather improved. So we think that even though we're not optimistic about strong volume growth in architectural, we do think we'll show better performance in the upcoming quarters than we did in the first quarter. And we think that Protective and Marine show some positive signs. And so we're looking for modest growth there and in Aerospace.

So we're watching this right now. I would say that today, in several of our channels where we have had pricing, we think that we're in pretty good shape, but we're watching the trends. In several of our segments or end-use markets where we haven't yet achieved all the price increases that we're looking for, we will be talking to customers because this is, I would say, a consistent trend across regions that we are seeing raw material inflation, combined with some shortages here that have emerged in the first quarter. And Europe is a similar story. Even though the volume there has been, I would say, weak in the first quarter, and similar weather conditions in Europe to what we experienced here in North America, there is some not as great inflationary pressure in Europe on the raw materials side, and we will be looking -- as we move through the second quarter, we're going to monitor our raw materials prices and see if we need to look at targeted price increases on the architectural side."

What we have been trying to do in the hedging program is take away the upside spikes in pricing. If you look at the experience in this decade until the last year and a half or so, most of the variability came on the upside, either during weather events like hurricanes or harsh periods of the winter, and we saw price spikes that would go well over $10 in MMBTu into the $13 and $15 range. So we were really trying to cap some of the upside risks that we saw from the pricing. Now what's happened over the last couple of years, we think, has changed the game when you have that in an overall weaker economy. But obviously, the shale gas has made a big difference. Whether in the Barnett field or the Marcellus field here in this region, the supply picture has changed quite a bit. And so even with an improving demand, we see pricing very stable, volumes and inventories continuing at very high level. So we think the game has changed. We're no longer concerned about protecting ourselves against these upside price spikes. So we really stopped hedging over a year ago. But up until that time, we were going out two or three years with some of our hedges, in order to protect ourselves. And we had a little more in the winter months, typically, where there was more potential for variability. So we've stopped hedging and we're going to just ride this thing out, and hopefully, this shale play is a long-term trend for us. And I think, if it is, it's going to be a very positive factor for the U.S. chemical industry and for a number of our other manufacturing industries, including our Glass business."

So overall, it's still going to be a positive story for us this year. But I am surprised that it's taking us as long as it has, as a country, to work through all these mortgage and foreclosure issues. We have a housing credit that is going to expire. So there's conflicting data. And so we think, overall, it'll be positive, but not strong. And clearly, with what we're seeing on the automotive side from maybe a deeper decline, we're seeing more of a bounce back. So I think, 2011, for us, seems like a better year to predict a strong upturn. We should get improvement in commercial. New homes should finally start to get better, maybe even later this year.

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.
Throughout the first quarter, we continued to experience a moderate recovery in several of the global end-use markets that we serve. This recovery, combined with lower costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives the past 18 months, positively impacted our financial results in comparison with what was a very low earnings level in last year's first quarter. 
Higher year-over-year sales volumes were most evident in our Industrial Coatings segment, which benefited from improving global automotive builds and gains in several general industrial applications. As evidence of the operating leverage we are experiencing, the Industrial Coatings segment posted its highest first quarter earnings in 10 years, despite industry activity levels that, while improving, still remain well below historical levels. Also, our Optical and Specialty Materials segment delivered double-digit percentage sales growth versus last year's period and record first quarter earnings. 
Several businesses in our Performance Coatings segment and our Architectural Coatings EMEA segment experienced some weather-related sales softness early in the quarter, but rebounded strongly, easily exceeding our internal projections for March.
The Commodity Chemicals segment remained at trough earnings levels, as we experienced higher input and maintenance costs versus the fourth quarter of 2009. However, caustic demand has improved. And we anticipate the segment will be solidly profitable in the second quarter, as we implement previously announced price increases. Our Glass segment improved versus a significant loss last year, as higher industrial activity benefited our Fiberglass business. However, we still experienced a slight loss in the quarter.
Reviewing our results by region, our investments over the past several years to expand our presence in the emerging regions, such as Asia/Pacific, continue to pay off. Asia/Pacific remained our star performer, with 25% year-over-year volume growth and we realized first quarter sales and earnings records in that region. We also realized a high growth rate in Latin America. 
North America benefited from a modest improvement in activity, with strong year-over-year gains in industrial end-use markets, including Automotive OEM. The overall construction markets here, however, continued to remain weak. Volumes in Europe lagged that of the other major regions due to a slower economic recovery in that region. Lastly, in general, we believe our improved sales pace is consistent with improving demand levels. And we are not aware of any notable inventory building in most of our end-use markets.
Overall for the quarter, I am very pleased that the difficult actions we took and all the hard work and effort we expanded over the past 18 months throughout the recession to properly position the company for a recovery is now beginning to yield measurable benefits. Also, several of our businesses that have been slower to recover, such as Commodity Chemicals, are beginning to exhibit signs of further improvement and that, combined with our continued cost reduction and execution focus, provides us with a clear path for continued earnings recovery.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to review our financial performance for the quarter."
294639,98843577,56417,"PPG Industries Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2010",2010-04-15,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. Let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales has improved from last year's lows, but we still remained well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses. We have been and will remain",2876,"Thanks, Chuck. Let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales has improved from last year's lows, but we still remained well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses. We have been and will remain diligent in managing our cost. This is apparent if you look at our margin leverage from our incremental sales. 
In aggregate, the Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments realized a greater than 80% earnings margin on the higher sales level, excluding favorable currency conversion impacts. We have experienced modest coatings raw material inflation in the low single-digit percent range, with notably different inflation rates by region and business. We anticipate the inflation rate will be higher in the second quarter, reflecting improved global demand and some transitory supply issues. We have and expect to continue to offset this inflation with selling prices and productivity.
Our blended natural gas cost, both hedged and non-hedged in the quarter, was 650 per MMBTu, which is up about $0.50 from the fourth quarter of 2009, but down by approximately the same amount versus the prior year's first quarter. Using recent price trends, our blended unit price is expected to drop to between $5 and $5.50 in the second quarter. Like many other U.S. companies, our reported earnings per share results include a negative non-reoccurring impact of $85 million after-tax or $0.51 per share, due to a tax law change stemming from the recently enacted U.S. healthcare legislation.
We issued a press release on April 8 with additional details on this matter. And lastly, our cash flow, cash position and liquidity all remained very solid. We have moved away from the strong emphasis we placed on cash conservation last year to now identifying ways to deploy our cash in a balanced, disciplined manner to drive earnings accretion. 
And now, I will review some details on the quarter. A year-over-year bridge of our first quarter sales is detailed on the next slide, along with some relevant trends. First quarter sales improved about $340 million or 12% versus the first quarter of 2009, which was severely impacted by the global recession. Lower year-over-year pricing was primarily attributable to Commodity Chemicals, coupled with lower energy surcharges in our Glass and Silicas businesses. Pricing in the remaining reporting segments was flat to higher year-over-year.
Compared to the last year, currency translation added about $150 million to our sales and about $15 million to earnings. As illustrated on the bottom left chart, the value of the euro was higher against the dollar in comparison with last year's first quarter, which was depressed because of the recession. However, the euro has declined versus the fourth quarter of last year. Based on the recent exchange rates we expect currency to be a headwind in the second quarter.
Volumes improved by over $300 million, with the largest increases driven by higher global industrial demand and strong growth in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China and Korea. We are pleased with the increase, but recognize that it is in comparison to what were very low activity levels last year.
Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As illustrated on the chart exhibiting our volume trends by region, Asia/Pacific delivered tremendous volume growth of 25% year-over-year, led by our Industrial Coatings businesses in the region. The momentum in that region has carried forward from last year, and we expect the end-use markets that we serve to remain robust. 
Our United States and Canada volumes also experienced solid growth, driven again by higher industrial activity, along with improving commodity chemical demand. Our businesses selling into the construction markets were flat to negative with the prior year, with declines in commercial construction a major continuing factor. We anticipate similar improvements in industrial demand going into the second quarter although outside a favorable seasonal trends, we do not expect a meaningful change in the pace of the construction markets. 
 
Volumes in Europe were up modestly versus the prior year's quarter, yet the region lags the other major global regions in pace of economic recovery. Latin America, which is our smallest region, experienced solid industrial gains as well. 
The chart on the right demonstrates that while our  overall volumes have recovered somewhat from last year's low levels, they still remain between 10% and 15% below the pre-recession levels of early 2008. As a result, we still need further economic recovery to close this gap. And we are positioned to fully benefit from the improving volumes based on lower our cost structure.
While I am a focused on our total volume performance, I want to mention that our Aggregate Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments had a similar sales volume decline from 2008, yet have delivered in an earnings improvement approaching 10% over that same time period. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix of today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.70 versus a $0.19 adjusted figure last year. While we are pleased with our year-over-year improvement, we are fully aware that we are still below historical earnings levels. A key contributor in our improvement was a higher sales volume. Another other major factor was our lower cost structure, including the savings stemming from our restructuring actions. Lower commodity chemicals pricing served as a partial offset. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 30% in the first quarter of 2010 and 33% in the first quarter of 2009.
Moving now to review our individual business segments. Let me start on the next slide with Industrial Coatings. This segment continued its rapid return to pre-recession earnings levels. In the quarter, sales grew 39% or about $250 million. Earnings improved by $117 million from a $16 million loss in the prior year's period. And our operating margin improved to 11.3%. This earnings level was the highest in 10 years, despite sales volumes in many end-use markets that remain depressed versus pre-recession levels.
Cost management, restructuring-related cost savings and volume were all contributors to the earnings improvement. However, improved volumes was the largest factor. This segment, which was our most impacted segment during the recession, experienced the largest recovery with volumes improving by 31% versus the prior year's quarter. The segment volume trend chart details the dramatic volume trend changes in this segment over that time. 
From an individual business unit perspective, Automotive OEM Coatings, which is our largest individual business in the segment, had volumes, which were up 50% versus last year's extremely low level. Each region delivered strong year-over-year sales growth, supported by improved demand, including 100% growth in our Asian region. However, as depicted on the bottom right chart, auto bill levels in the Americas and Europe combined,  still remains about 20% below pre-recession levels. 
While we normally experience a seasonal uptick in the second quarter, we expect that to be muted this year the amount, given the consistent level of auto production in each market during the first quarter. As such, we anticipate a fairly similar global build rate in the second quarter as we experienced in the first quarter.
Our Industrial Coatings business unit also delivered solid growth levels, up about 20%, which is a reflection of the improvement in the general industrial economy in all regions. Asia/Pacific is now our second largest region in this business and its growth rate approached 50% in the quarter. We expect the global industrial economy to continue its moderate recovery. 
The Packaging Coatings business also improved versus 2009 and once again, delivered solid financial results. Given the nature of the end-use market, this business is a more stable performer throughout the economic cycle. We did not experience a significant volume drop last year. And we realized a moderate volume improvement during the quarter.
Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment, through much hard work, has returned much closer to historic operating margins. Given the lack of traditional seasonality in the auto OEM market this year, we anticipate a more modest seasonal improvement in this segment for the second quarter. However, we do expect some further gradual recovery in the general industrial economy in Asia to remain strong. Also, we intend to remain diligently focused on our cost structure.
The Performance Coatings segment results are detailed on the next slide. In the quarter, sales grew by $37 million and earnings improved by $38 million versus the prior year. Overall, volumes were slightly negative, with improved volumes in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, offset by lower volumes in Europe and the U.S. However, a favorable business mix within the segment and lower cost enhanced our margins and created positive earnings leverage. Currency conversion added about $55 million to sales and $5 million to earnings. 
Our Automotive Refinish business was negatively impacted last year by the recession in customer destocking. This quarter, the business experienced high single-digit sales growth, excluding favorable currency impacts, aided by an improving trend in the overall miles driven and by the general economic recovery. Sales in the second quarter are historically higher due to seasonality. And we expect a similar pattern this year.
Our Protective and Marine Coatings and Aerospace businesses, both of which have a sizable aftermarket component, of [ph] late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline in the first quarter of last year as most of our other businesses. Volumes this past quarter were down mid-single digit percents from last year. But as detailed on the slide, sales have been fairly consistent the past three quarters, and current quarter sales were actually slightly higher than the fourth quarter level. We expect this fairly stable sales performance to continue.
In the quarter, our Architectural Coatings America and Asia/Pacific volumes declined once again. Solid growth in Asia/Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by lower volumes in the United States. Our U.S. volumes were largely negative in both January and February, reflecting in part, poor weather in most of the country. 
In March, our year-over-year trend improved dramatically as we fully recovered from the weather effects early in the quarter. For the entire quarter, U.S volumes were down due to lower commercial construction activity and the lack of any substantial rebound in residential activity. This business is highly seasonal. And we expect higher activity levels in the second quarter, but expect the overall construction markets in the U.S. to remain at low historical levels. 
Overall, Performance Coatings has proven its stability, and delivered some of our most consistent earnings results through the recession and has maintained or grown operating margin due in part to lowering its cost structure. Looking ahead in the second quarter, we expect similar stability and normal upward seasonal trends in the Auto Refinish and Architectural Coatings businesses.
Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA business, are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter were $436 million, up $27 million versus last year's period. And earnings improved by $8 million in what is historically a seasonal slow period for this segment. Over the past year, this business has been much less cyclical than most others, with volumes for the full year of 2009 falling by only mid single-digit percents. Given the slower pace of recovery in Europe, our first quarter results were similar.
Our higher earnings stem from a lower cost structure and overall cost-management actions. Currency conversion added about 7% to our top line but did not impact earnings. As we have traditionally done, included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense stemming from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As you can see, aided by lower cost, our EBITDA margins improved this past quarter versus, not only 2009, but also 2008.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a longer recovery timetable for the European economies and therefore, continue to expect modest volume challenges in this segment. The second and third quarters should provide a sizable seasonal sales lift, with currency a potential headwind. Our focus remains on cost management and execution to maintain profitability, building our brands and positioning to grow in emerging regions. 
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed on the following slide. Versus the prior year, first quarter sales increased by $39 million to $284 million on solid volume growth. Earnings grew by 37% to a new record first quarter level due to the impact of increased volumes, coupled with lower cost. 
Our optical product sales grew by double-digit percent, with solid growth in all major regions. Our silica products, some of which are used has a raw material in the production of tires and car batteries, experienced very significant volume declines early last year, but have reversed that trend consistent with year-over-year growth in the auto market.
Looking ahead, we anticipate moderate seasonal improvements in sales and intend to increase our selling and marketing efforts in the second quarter to drive further growth for the quarter and the remainder of the year. 
The next slide shows our Commodity Chemicals segment results. Sales dropped by about $30 million versus last year's period, earnings fell $80 million in comparison what was a strong performance in Q1 of the previous year. Compared with the first quarter of 2009, sales volumes improved by over 30% or were more than offset by lower selling prices. Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, the ECU price, fell substantially. Chlorine prices improved, but those gains were erased by lower caustic prices, reflecting the impacts of lower industrial demand in most of last year. Also, our costs were modestly higher, primarily due to a much higher ethylene cost, somewhat offset by lower natural gas prices. 
Comparing first quarter results this year, versus the fourth quarter of 2009, the ECU price was flat as the chlorine price slipped mildly and was offset by strengthening caustic prices. As displayed on the chart, domestic caustic volumes improved, especially in March, drawing down our inventories. But the earnings impact was nullified by increases in our primary input costs. Our inventories have fallen in 30 of the past 36 weeks. Looking forward, we expect this business to return to solid profitability in the second quarter as we implement previously announced price increases and caustic soda and based on current input cost.
Our Glass segment details are on the following slide. Sales were $220 million, up $24 million or 12%. Overall volumes advanced, while pricing declined due in part to a lower year-over-year energy and fuel surcharges. While the segment remained unprofitable, the $3 million loss was a dramatic improvement over the prior year's period where we lost $27 million. 
Our Fiberglass business benefited from the rebounding global industrial activity in volumes to improved nearly 45% in contrast to a similar percentage decline last year. This higher activity resulted in an improved manufacturing utilization.
The architectural glass markets, both commercial and residential construction served by our Performance Glazings business, remained at recession levels. Both businesses benefited from a considerable cost reductions. Equity and royalty earnings improved, largely driven by equity results in our Asian fiberglass joint venture, which supplies the electronics industry. We expect both businesses to exhibit better seasonal trends in the second quarter. This would also improve capacity utilization, including in fiberglass, where inventory levels are low and where we have already announced price increases effective in the second quarter.
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details, which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $700 million of cash on hand. In the quarter, we used about $50 million of cash for operations, including traditional, seasonal working capital increases versus fourth quarter. Our first quarter cash from operations results puts us nearly $250 million ahead of our 2009 pace. And I will remind you, the full year of 2009, was our second best cash generation year on record. We spent $45 million on capital spending during the quarter. And we expect our full year capital spending to be in the range of 300 to $350 million. Our dividend payments, a long-standing heritage at PPG, were $90 million.
We also repaid more than $150 million of debt in the quarter, and don't anticipate any further term debt reduction of size for the remainder of the year. As we've previously stated, we do expect full year contribution to our pension fund of $240 million.  Last year, we put approximately $450 million of cash and company stock into our plans, including about $175 million in the first quarter. Our cash position remains very strong, especially when considering that our strongest cash generation quarters are late in the year. And we intend to deploy cash over the balance of the year in a disciplined manner with a focus on growing earnings per share.
We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also share repurchases will be a likely usage here. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck talk for some closing remarks."

We still have several end use markets or businesses that have yet to recover, such as Commodity Chemicals, which is beginning to exhibit positive signs that we expect will boost our earnings in the coming quarters. 
We continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Our efforts and investments over the past several years to expand our presence in emerging regions, such as Asia/Pacific, continue to pay off. As they, along with our Optical Products business, have once, again, proven to be critical growth drivers for the corporation.
Let me conclude by commenting that global end-use market activity remains well below historical levels as do our earnings. And our objective is to continue to accelerate our earnings recovery back to pre-recession levels. To do so, we will remain focused on diligently managing our cost to maximize the impacts from further volume recovery.

We're fairly optimistic about the business here in the developed regions, as well as what's happening in the emerging regions. We think the Architectural business was affected by weather conditions early in this quarter, was rebounding in March as the weather improved. So we think that even though we're not optimistic about strong volume growth in architectural, we do think we'll show better performance in the upcoming quarters than we did in the first quarter. And we think that Protective and Marine show some positive signs. And so we're looking for modest growth there and in Aerospace.

What we're seeing right now is, as we come into the early parts of the second quarter, we're seeing a little bit higher inflation level, especially in a couple of commodities. So we're watching this right now. I would say that today, in several of our channels where we have had pricing, we think that we're in pretty good shape, but we're watching the trends. In several of our segments or end-use markets where we haven't yet achieved all the price increases that we're looking for, we will be talking to customers because this is, I would say, a consistent trend across regions that we are seeing raw material inflation, combined with some shortages here that have emerged in the first quarter. And Europe is a similar story. Even though the volume there has been, I would say, weak in the first quarter, and similar weather conditions in Europe to what we experienced here in North America, there is some not as great inflationary pressure in Europe on the raw materials side, and we will be looking -- as we move through the second quarter, we're going to monitor our raw materials prices and see if we need to look at targeted price increases on the architectural side."

As Bob mentioned in his remarks, the tire industry has recovered here in the first quarter. So that provided some volume lift.

What we have been trying to do in the hedging program is take away the upside spikes in pricing. If you look at the experience in this decade until the last year and a half or so, most of the variability came on the upside, either during weather events like hurricanes or harsh periods of the winter, and we saw price spikes that would go well over $10 in MMBTu into the $13 and $15 range. So we were really trying to cap some of the upside risks that we saw from the pricing. Now what's happened over the last couple of years, we think, has changed the game when you have that in an overall weaker economy. But obviously, the shale gas has made a big difference. Whether in the Barnett field or the Marcellus field here in this region, the supply picture has changed quite a bit. And so even with an improving demand, we see pricing very stable, volumes and inventories continuing at very high level. So we think the game has changed. We're no longer concerned about protecting ourselves against these upside price spikes. So we really stopped hedging over a year ago. But up until that time, we were going out two or three years with some of our hedges, in order to protect ourselves. And we had a little more in the winter months, typically, where there was more potential for variability. So we've stopped hedging and we're going to just ride this thing out, and hopefully, this shale play is a long-term trend for us. And I think, if it is, it's going to be a very positive factor for the U.S. chemical industry and for a number of our other manufacturing industries, including our Glass business."

We're in, now, the fourth year of this housing recession here in North America. I predicted that we were going to be out of this recession, probably a year and a half or a year ago. And I have been, I think, continually disappointed by the pace of the recovery. Now I don't think we're going to get any worse. New housing starts, we've talked about building from this level of 600,000, but we haven't seen it so far. And the start of the year was very weak. Some of that, we hope, is weather. And now we have the commercial construction market a little weaker. We think that the renovation side of residential will be better. So overall, it's still going to be a positive story for us this year. But I am surprised that it's taking us as long as it has, as a country, to work through all these mortgage and foreclosure issues. We have a housing credit that is going to expire. So there's conflicting data. And so we think, overall, it'll be positive, but not strong. And clearly, with what we're seeing on the automotive side from maybe a deeper decline, we're seeing more of a bounce back. So I think, 2011, for us, seems like a better year to predict a strong upturn. We should get improvement in commercial. New homes should finally start to get better, maybe even later this year. But we just haven't seen volume on the construction markets, either here in North America or in Europe, that would lead us to say that we should be really bullish on that market for the rest of this year."

In Europe, although the demand haven't been as strong, the economy has been weaker there and slower to recover than here, we've had some similar issues. There was a TiO2 plant that had a significant supply event in the U.K., and that has affected short-term supply/demand balance for TiO2.

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks and then we will take questions.
PPG’s strong results this quarter benefited largely from a 10% increase in volumes. The breadth of geographies and end use markets that we serve is enabling us to leverage continuing positive momentum in global industrial demand. The performance of our portfolio is being elevated by higher industrial activity and strong demand across Asia/Pacific and Latin America which is more than offsetting weak construction in North America and Europe.
Our performance and growth occurred consistently through the quarter and all of the major regions contributed. Our earnings per share were close to 2008 pre-recession levels as we leveraged the volume growth with our now lower cost structure. Our earnings this quarter were aided by an improved sales mix in some of our top performing businesses such as Aerospace, Auto Refinish and our Optical and Specialty Materials segment. 
As a matter of fact, both Optical and Specialty Materials and performance coating segments posted record earnings results. Our Optical segment posted sales growth rates approaching 20%, and it remained our top operating margin segment. Performance Coatings delivered record earnings as margins grew by over 200 basis points. Our auto refinish, aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses, all delivered increased sales which more than offset the impact of lower volumes in our US Architectural Coatings business.
Our Industrial Coatings segment continued to approach historical earnings levels. In the second quarter, the segment delivered 12% operating margins for the first time since 2006. Segment volume growth was more than 25% versus a recession-weakened prior year period. We achieved 40% growth in our automotive OEM Coatings business, easily outpacing the 25% year-over-year global industry growth and we continue to realize double-digit percent growth in our general industrial business in the emerging regions.
In architectural coatings, EMEA, our volume performance was consistent with the past several quarters, declining about 5%. Currency conversion negatively impacted sales and accounted for half of the earnings drop. Results in our commodity chemical segment improved nicely versus last year on higher demand and lower input cost. Most notable was the $50 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2010 due to improving pricing, higher demand and lower natural gas costs.
Our glass segment benefited from substantially improved performance in our Fiber Glass business, including improved equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures. The strong and continued improvement in the company’s financial performance this past quarter occurred despite demand that still remains more than 10% lower than 2008 pre-recession levels. Our strong performance clearly reflects the benefits from our improved business portfolio along with our lower cost structure. We are positioned for further earnings growth opportunities as the global economy continues to recover and through utilization of our strong balance sheet. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Bob to provide additional details on our financial performance for the quarter.

I will begin by reviewing the year-over-year bridge of our second quarter sales which is detailed in the accompanying slide pack on slide number four. Sales improved about $340 million or 11% versus the second quarter of 2009, which was negatively impacted by the global recession. 
Overall pricing improved modestly, by about $20 million. Higher prices in our coatings segment offset lower pricing in the glass businesses and more specifically in our performance glazing business, which remained impacted by weak US construction markets. 
Year-over-year pricing was also lower in commodity chemicals, however pricing levels in commodity chemicals this quarter [happened higher] versus the first quarter of 2010. Compared to last year, currency conversion reduced sales by $9 million as the impact of a much weaker Europe was nearly offset by stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada. 
As Chuck mentioned, we realized a strong increase in volumes. This improvement of more than $300 million was driven by higher global industrial activity in all regions of the world. Weaker construction markets in the mature regions of Europe and North America attracted somewhat from our volume growth. 
As illustrated on the graphs, our year-over-year volume comparisons this quarter were similar to the first quarter despite a more difficult comparison period in 2009. As detailed on the lower right chart in comparison with 2008 pre-recession levels, we remained down more than 10%, also comparable to the first quarter.
Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As you can see the emerging regions of Asia/Pacific and Latin America are continuing to grow faster than the developed regions of the world. Asia/Pacific continues to be a considerable growth platform for the company but primarily by our industrial businesses serving both exports from the region and local consumption within the region. 
While there is concern regarding property value appreciation in China as detailed on the top right chart, only 3% of our total Asian sales stem from China architectural coatings. In the United States and Canada we continue to experience solid growth, again driven by higher industrial activity along with improving commodity chemical demand. However, our business selling into the construction markets declined versus the prior year due to the continued weakness in those markets. 
Somewhere in the last quarter, our volumes in Europe increased slightly versus the prior year’s quarter and as we expected heading into the year, the region lags the other major global regions in overall pace of economic recovery. However volumes remain stable as our industrial businesses continue to benefit from higher activity levels including more exports from the region, which is offsetting the continuing modest weakness in the construction markets.
Looking ahead for the company, the global economic recovery began to take hold in the second half of 2009, and as such, our second half comparable periods will be more difficult. Also the third quarter’s traditionally a slower quarter seasonally in several of our businesses and we expect this historic trend to continue this year.
However for the second half of 2010 we do anticipate to benefit from the continuing of the macro trend of gradually improving global industrial activity and expect construction markets to remain sluggish. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today’s presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.64 versus $0.91 last year. Clearly the largest contributor in our improvement was the benefit from higher sales volume. Traditionally, our lower cost structure including the savings from our prior restructuring actions and our lower tax rate contributed heavily. 
While our selling prices were higher, they did not fully offset the impact of higher coatings raw material cost. Coatings raw materials begin to inflate early in the year due to higher demand in several supplier outages and that inflation increased in the second quarter. In total for our coatings businesses, cost roads, mid-single percent, although the rates differ by region and by business. Further inflation pressures have subsided and we are now working to offset the transitory margin compressions in several business units with additional pricing initiatives. 
Currency conversion also negatively impacted our earnings. Stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada offset a weaker year within our business segments. However, our corporate costs were impacted by just over $10 million as our losses from converting balance sheet exposures in this year compared with gains in the second quarter of 2009. 
Lastly, we lowered our 2010 tax rate to 28% based on the geographic mix of projected full year results. When compared with the company’s previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 30%, the lower rate added $0.07 to our second quarter results including $0.02 based on the catch up of reducing the rates for the first three months of 2010. Our second quarter 2009 tax rate was 33%. 
Moving now to review our individual business segment, let me start on the next slide with Performance Coatings. In the quarter sales exceeded $1.1 billion, growing by $45 million versus the period year’s period. Overall volumes were flat however the segment experienced positive currency conversion and delivered higher selling prices which were focused on countering inflation.
Earnings advanced by $32 million versus the prior year to a quarterly record of $190 million. Operating margins expanded 230 basis points as our continued strong cost controls supplemented the improved sales mix resulting from the performance of several of our top performing business units. 
Our automotive refinish business continued to recover from last year’s recession and customer de-stocking. Aided by an improved general economic recovery and higher miles driven, the business accelerated to double-digit sales growth this quarter excluding modest favorable currency impact.
Sales also grew in our protective and marine and aerospace business. These businesses both have a sizeable aftermarket component, sort of late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline during the recession as most of our other businesses. 
Combined sales for these businesses this past quarter were up low single digit percent versus last year, reversing the trend of very modest sales declines that we experienced in the past four quarters. We expect the stable nature of these businesses to go unchanged. 
Volumes in our architectural coatings, America and Asia/Pacific business declined mid-single digit percentages versus last year but the trend was modestly improved versus the year-over-year results in the first quarter.
Results in our national accounts or do-it-yourself channel once again outpaced our company-owned stores. US volumes continued to be hampered by restrained commercial construction activity and continued depressed levels of residential housing activity. However, selling price actions we initiated in the business earlier in the year had been successful, and we are selectively seeking additional price for the second half of the year in an effort to offset raw material inflation.
Looking ahead, we expect the overall construction markets in the United States to remain at low historic levels for the foreseeable future. Overall, Performance Coatings has continued to deliver strong results that are being further enhanced because some of our top performing businesses are growing more rapidly. Also aiding the segment results is the size of our Asian business, which is now the second largest region for the segment and it’s delivering the highest growth rate. We expect the improved business and geographic mix to continue to aid the second half results.
The Industrial Coatings segment results are on the next slide. As you can see the segment’s financial performance has continued to strengthen. In the quarter, sales grew 27% or about $200 million to $939 million, with nearly the entire gain coming from volume growth when compared with last year’s recession impacted results. All regions participated in the strong year-over-year growth, and importantly sales levels in each region were consistent with or higher than first quarter 2010 levels. Earnings improved by $84 million to $112 million and our operating margin is right below 12%. In addition to the higher volumes, lower costs from both cost management and restructuring related initiatives also contributed. Higher raw material costs somewhat tempered these earnings improvements.
Automotive Coatings, our largest individual business in this segment experienced 40% volume growth in comparison with last year’s very low level. Our growth outpaced the overall global auto industry production figures, which grew by more than 25% versus weak prior year global production figures.
Sequentially, industry production advanced about 6% versus the first quarter of 2010. In general, the industry continues to match production with sales and inventories remained at low levels from a historical perspective. Sales for this business in each region reflect strong year-over-year sales growth led by our US region which posted 75% growth on both end used market recovery and market share gains. The third quarter is normally a seasonally slower quarter to the planned automotive OEM facility shutdowns. And we expect a similar but lesser queue pattern this year.
Our Industrial Coatings business unit delivered solid growth levels around 20%, further reflecting an improving general industrial economy in all major regions. Both Asia-Pacific and Latin America growth was around 40%, somewhere to the first quarter. Growth in the mature regions also was consistent with the first quarter between 7% and 10%. All of these sequential comparisons are despite a more difficult comparable period in 2009.
Our Packaging Coatings business also delivered moderate sales growth and solid financial results. This business remains a consistent performer. Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment continues to return toward historic operating margins. The absolute earnings we achieved this quarter were our highest second quarter results in a decade, despite sales volumes that still remain nearly 15% below the recession 2008 levels. Looking ahead, we anticipate traditional seasonal impacts to result in lower third quarter sales. We will keep our cost focus and we remain comfortable with the prospects of continuing gradual recovery in the global industrial market. 
Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA business on the following slide. Sales in the quarter of $500 million were down $27 million versus last year’s period and earning declined $5 million. Currency conversion was a notable factor in the sales decline and accounted for half of the earnings decline. 
Over the past year, the results of this business have been stable and this pattern held true during the quarter. Volume trends remain consistent with the recent quarters down mid-single digit percent to do continued sluggish housing and construction markets in the geographies we serve. 
As illustrated on the bottom-right chart, our geographic footprint includes very little to no exposure in Southern European countries and other countries which have experienced the most significant declines in construction, including those such as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain which combined account for only about 1% of segment sales. 
As we have traditionally shown included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, we believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As detailed EBITDA margins were once again comparable this quarter versus last year. Looking ahead, we anticipate similar business trends will remain and based on current exchange rates we expect currency conversion to again detract from year-over-year segment results in the third quarter. 
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed on the next slide. Versus the prior year, second quarter sales surpassed $300 million up $46 million up nearly 20% volume growth. Earnings grew by 41% to $86 million a new record for this segment. Both, business units Optical Products and Silicas continued to benefit from improved overall demand, new product sales and product line extensions. 
Our Optical Product sales are now approaching the peak levels we achieved directly following the introduction of our Generation 6 Transition Lense product. Our operating margins were consistent with the past quarter and remained at more than 28% through the first half of the year, which is detailed on our chart compares favorably versus prior years doing parts of the benefits of restructuring actions completed in 2009. 
Looking ahead, the third quarter is typically a slower quarter seasonally and we anticipate this trend will continue this year. The next slide displays our Commodity Chemical segment results, compared with last years second quarter sales advance by more than $40 million and earnings grew by $11 million. Improved demand more than offset lower caustic soda pricing and our higher capacity utilization positively impacted manufacturing cost. 
In comparing results, this quarter versus the first quarter of the year we delivered significant improvement as the business has rapidly recovered from trough earning levels. Sales advanced $32 million as higher volumes were coupled with higher pricing for the ECU which is an aggregate of chlorine and caustic soda prices. Segment earnings jumped by $50 million as sales gains combined with lower natural gas cost. 
Despite our higher production rates, increased demand has cut our inventory in half versus last year. Looking forward we expect modestly higher natural gas unit cost in comparison with second quarter and we are implementing additional previously announced price increases in both chlorine and caustic soda.
Our glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $247 million, up $40 million or 19% due to dramatic improvement in fiber glass volumes which in turn are a result of improved global industrial demand. Segment earnings improved to a $16 million profit compared with a loss of $7 million in the prior year. The 60% year-over-year increase in fiber glass volumes resulted in improved manufacturing utilization, upto nearly a 100% capacity utilization at quarter’s end.
Activity levels in the US architectural glass market, both commercial and residential construction built by our performance glazings business remained challenging. Equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter and we also benefited from lower costs including savings from the restructuring actions we completed last year. We are pleased with the positive earnings momentum and looking forward, we have recently initiated further selling price initiatives.
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $800 million of cash on hand, down from last year’s $1 billion level. As we began to deploy our cash in a balanced manner over the past 12 months. We spent about $50 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $93 million.
We also repaid more than $50 million of debt in the quarter bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million. We don’t anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year. Our quarterly dividend payments, an important part of long-standing heritage at PPG were $90 million and a total of 
$180 million for the year. We also spent slightly over a $100 million on repurchasing 1.6 million shares of PPG stock. We have more than 4.5 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. Year-to-date returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks which is a PPG legacy has accounted from nearly half of our cash usages.
One other cash item is pension contributions and as we previously stated, we expect full year 2010 contributions to our pension plan of $240 million and have contributed about $50 million year-to-date. For the full year of 2009, we put approximately $450 million in cash and company stock into our plans including $210 million in the first half.
Our cash position still remained very strong, especially when considering that due to the seasonality of our businesses, our strongest cash generation quarters are in the second half of the year. We intend to remain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment, but with a focus on growing earnings per share. We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also anticipate further share repurchases will be a likely use of cash this year.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Chuck for some closing remarks.

Our global geographic footprint and a broad set of end-used markets that we serve are continuing to yield benefits. This was clearly in evidenced this past quarter as we leveraged the moderate global industrial recovery. Our results were aided by growth in emerging regions and an improved sales mix resulting from stronger results in our top performing business, including Optical and Specialty Materials, Aerospace and Auto Refinish. Our commodity chemical segment rapidly returned to solid profitability and our glass business delivered mid-single digit margins on strong fiber glass demand.
As with the first quarter, we continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Let me conclude by commenting that I am encouraged with our earnings recovery and that I believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on what we anticipate to be a continued gradual global economic recovery. Also, we are beginning to utilize our strong balance sheet to accelerate growth. We are currently reviewing several small to mid-sized acquisitions in the $20 million to $250 million range and intend to remain active on share repurchases. That concludes our prepared remarks.

Can you talk about the availability of raws, is that hampering?

There were a couple of suppliers that had unexpected outages or production problems. It probably shifted some business around for us, but we don’t think we lost any orders on an ongoing basis and if anything probably a little of the activity would shift into the third quarter.
So, availability is not a major concern for us right now and pricing has stabilized in the markets for our principle raw materials, so some of the feedstock costs as we've talked previously in propylene or ethylene are actually drifting down. So, at this point we don’t see supply issues and we think that raw material pricing is stabilized, albeit at a higher level than we saw at the beginning of the year.

So right now we do not anticipate any significant problems in implementing the second or this smaller third quarter increase, volumes have stayed up on the caustic soda side, inventories are low and we feel confident about the pricing environment for caustic soda.
There has been a price increase initiative in Europe, stable pricing in Asia, so on a global basis, we think that we have a solid pricing environment for caustic soda. On chlorine, there was a $50 announcement here in the third quarter that we expect to be phased in over the course of the quarter depending on contracts. There is a little more resistance with the PVC customers, but the other merchant chlorine customers are receiving price increases. So here too we feel that the pricing environment for chlorine is stable to firm.

We had these same economic conditions here in North America, weak construction markets, therefore weak PVC production; that strengthens the opportunity for firm pricing in caustic soda. So, we have shown in 2007-2008 that strong industrial activity while we have weak construction activity actually helps the merchant players like PPG, and it strengthens the pricing environment for caustic soda.

So right now as we went through the second quarter, we pre-announced guidance in the middle of June and we expected I think at that time to make the middle to higher end of the range but actually the second half of June finished strongly and couple of businesses notably chlor-alkali continued to accelerate through the rest of the month. We didn’t see any fall off in sales or orders in key markets in Asia or North America. So through the second quarter and now here starting in the third quarter, we have not seen an inflection point, certainly not down, and the continuation of the current trends that we’ve talked about in these announcements.

Aerospace, we had a modest volume improvement there.

The other businesses such as our General Industrial business, our Protective & Marine Coatings business, these would be businesses that we felt we didn’t see any appreciable share loss and it could turn out when we get all the data that these could be either stable to actual market share gains, but certainly Automotive OEM, Automotive Refinish, Aerospace would be coatings businesses where we were gaining share.

So if you will take automotive OEM, we are very well positioned, globally, we have worked hard to establish ourselves in markets like China and not only with the global players, but with the domestic players, we have a full product array to meet all of their needs. There is a move in automotive OEM to what we would call a shorter or a compact processes where we can deliver cost savings but provide the same corrosion in decorative protection. So I would say that clearly its global position in technology and automotive OEM.
In Refinish, we feel that we have the best waterborne or water-based refinished system out there that’s helping us to gain share, especially in markets or regions where they are going from a solvent-based to water-based mandated system. So we think we are well positioned there and we have always been not only the market leader, but the technology leader in our aerospace products. So I think in all three of these, it would be global positioned but technology. We haven’t been a cost base certainly in these businesses after our restructuring and I think you see the effects of that, but certainly we’re not trying to win any business by just pursuing a lower price strategy.

We have visibility typically two to three months out and there's good forecasting not always completely accurate for the full year and if you take the North American business, we started this year thinking that North American auto and light truck bills would be a little under 11 than I think at this meeting three months ago we said, hey, 11, 11.5 and now I’d say its probably 11.5, maybe 11.6. 
So, we have continued to see a good momentum out there, inventory levels are imbalanced. So our forecast if anything, have moved up slightly. In Europe, we aren’t expecting as strong a second half, but there is still volume growth as I’ve mentioned earlier. Russia is better than we thought, the German producers are stronger, and in China even though we’re probably not going to have the easy comps that we had in the first three or four months of the year, there is still good growth in Chinese automotive OEM productions. 
So that we’re maybe not going to be plus 40% as we were in the first three or four months, but we were saying all along that we thought that productions could be up 15% to 20% in China, for this year. We’re still sticking to that forecast, probably at the upper end of that. And we haven’t seen things appreciably slow down in China, at this point. So, I would say in automotive, we’re not seeing any significant deviation from what we’ve been looking at. 
On the industrial side, that is a whole range of products, including appliances, consumer electronics, coil and extrusion, and I would say that the business has been solid if not great, like automotive OEM. We haven’t seen any inflection points yet, certainly as I’ve talked about our electronics exposure in fiber glass is booming. So, at this point you know we are watching, because obviously there is some negative sentiment, if you look at the media and what they’re projecting for the second half. We have talked about the one market that we thought in China maybe overheated, which is Chinese construction, especially residential construction markets. We have much less of an exposure there. We have an architectural business in China, but it is the smallest of our major coatings businesses. We are doing fine there as well but we are watching that one, so at this point we have not seen an inflection point. We are watching and we are a little cautious because of some of the headlines out there, but our businesses continue to perform well and we haven't seen a drop off yet.

If you look at the cash for clunkers specifically, it was a third quarter of 2009, fourth quarter of 2009 influence. So the comparables for us in the third and fourth quarter of 2010 versus 2009 will be not as good as the second quarter because if you remember the second quarter of last year, that’s when we had the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler. That was probably the industry at its weakest. So, obviously on a year-over-year basis, we’re going to not show the same degree of improvement in the second half and we think that sales will continue to improve versus last year’s level without cash for clunkers. 
In Europe, again, the eastern European countries, Russia, they are coming out of their recession rather well and the production there is growing. Germany benefiting I think from a stronger German economy and the export opportunities with that weaker Europe. So, I think even without the scrappage programs that a number of European countries have instituted last year, we are still going to see modest sales growth in Europe. 
And in China, they did have some incentives in 2009 especially for smaller cars. Most of those are projected to decline in the second half or certainly into 2011. But right now, we see the growth rates moderating somewhat in China in the second half again, because of the strength of 2009 but still solid growth in that market even if some of the incentives from the Chinese government for the small vehicles are withdrawn.

You have epoxy resin systems as substrates with fiber glass on the electronics side and we’ve seen strength in both of those. Electronics has been booming but the reinforcements business which goes into a lot of industrial applications like automotives, that’s been very strong. 
We’re seeing more use of fiber glass and plastic systems in automobiles because of the light weight advantages. We’re also seeing a little more activity on wind blades, an important part of our, what we would call our direct drill product line and fiber glass goes into wind blade production, that’s been a little inconsistent over the last couple of years. 
We think wind power is the most competitive alternative energy source but some of the funding and financing for these big projects has been stalled out, so we haven’t seen quite as much growth there as we anticipate. But longer term, wind blade production for fiber glass and solar energy, glass production for performance glazings should be good market drivers for us in future years.

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.
PPG's strong results this quarter benefited largely from a 10% increase in volumes. The breadth of geographies and end-use markets that we serve is enabling us to leverage continuing positive momentum in global industrial demand. The performance of our portfolio is being elevated by higher industrial activity and strong demand across Asia-Pacific and Latin America, which is more than offsetting weak construction in North America and Europe. 
Our performance and growth occurred consistently through the quarter and all of the major regions contributed. Our earnings per share were close to 2008 pre-recession levels as we leveraged the volume growth with our now lower cost structure.
Our earnings this quarter were aided by an improved sales mix in some of our top-performing businesses such as Aerospace, Auto Refinish and our Optical and Specialty Materials segment. As a matter fact, both Optical and Specialty Materials and Performance Coatings segments posted record earnings results. Our Optical segment posted sales growth rates approaching 20%, and it remained our top operating margin segment. Performance Coatings delivered record earnings as margins grew by over 200 basis points. Our Auto Refinish, Aerospace and Protective & Marine Coatings businesses all delivered increased sales, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes in our U.S. Architectural Coatings business.
Our Industrial Coatings segment continue to approach historical earnings levels. In the second quarter, the segment delivered 12% operating margins for the first time since 2006. Segment volume growth was more than 25% versus a recession weekend prior-year period. We achieved 40% growth in our Automotive OEM Coatings business, easily outpacing the 25% year-over-year global industry growth. And we continue to realize double-digit percent growth in our General Industrial business in the emerging regions.
In Architectural Coatings EMEA, our volume performance was consistent with the past several quarters, declining about 5%. Currency conversion negatively impacted sales and accounted for half of the earnings drop.
Results in our Commodity Chemicals segment improved nicely versus last year on higher demand and lower input costs. Most notable was the $50 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2010 due to improving pricing, higher demand and lower natural gas costs.
Our Glass segment benefited from substantially improved performance in our Fiber Glass business, including improved equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures. The strong and continued improvement in the company's financial performance this past quarter occurred despite demand that still remains more than 10% lower than 2008 pre-recession levels. Our strong performance clearly reflects the benefits from our improved business portfolio, along with our lower cost structure. We are positioned for further earnings growth opportunities as the global economy continues to recover and through utilization of our strong balance sheet.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide additional details on our financial performance for the quarter."

I will begin by reviewing the year-over-year bridge of our second quarter sales, which is detailed in the company slide pack on Slide #4.
Sales improved about $340 million or 11% versus the second quarter of 2009, which was negatively impacted by the global recession.  Overall, pricing improved modestly by about $20 million. Higher prices in our Coating segments offset lower pricing in the Glass businesses, and more specifically, in our Performance Glazings business, which remains impacted by weak U.S. construction markets.
Year-over-year pricing was also lower in Commodity Chemicals. However, pricing levels in Commodity Chemicals this quarter have moved higher versus the first quarter of 2010. Compared to last year, currency conversion reduced sales by $9 million as the impact of a much weaker euro was nearly offset by stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada.
As Chuck mentioned, we realized a strong increase in volumes. This improvement of more than $300 million was driven by higher global industrial activity in all regions of the world. Weaker construction markets in the mature regions of Europe and North America detracted somewhat from our volume growth. As illustrated on the graphs, our year-over-year volume comparisons this quarter were similar to the first quarter, despite a more difficult comparison period in 2009. As detailed on the lower right chart in comparison with 2008 pre-recession levels, we remain down more than 10%, also comparable to the first quarter.
Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As you can see, the emerging regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America are continuing to grow faster than the developed regions of the world. Asia-Pacific continues to be a considerable growth platform for the company, led primarily by our Industrial businesses, serving both exports from the region and local consumption within the region. While there is concern regarding property value appreciation in China as detailed on the top right chart, only 3% of our total Asian sales stemmed from China Architectural Coatings. 
In the United States and Canada, we continue to experience solid growth, again driven by higher industrial activity along with improving Commodity Chemical demand. However, our business selling into the construction markets declined versus the prior year due to the continued weakness in those markets.
Similar to last quarter, our volumes in Europe increased slightly versus the prior year's quarter. And as we expected heading into the year, the region lags the other major global regions in overall pace of economic recovery. However, volumes remain stable as our Industrial businesses continue to benefit from higher activity levels including more exports from the region, which is offsetting the continuing modest weakness in the construction markets.
Looking ahead for the company, the global economic recovery began to take hold in the second half of 2009. And as such, our second half comparable periods will be more difficult. Also, the third quarter is traditionally a slower quarter seasonally in several of our businesses and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, for the second half of 2010, we do anticipate to benefit from the continuing of the macro trend of gradually improving global industrial activity and expect construction markets to remain sluggish.
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today's presentation materials which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.  
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.64 versus $0.91 last year. Clearly, the largest contributor in our improvement was the benefit from higher sales volume.  Additionally, our lower cost structure including the savings from our prior restructuring actions and our lower tax rate contributed heavily.
While our selling prices were higher, they did not fully offset the impact of higher coatings raw material cost. Coatings raw materials began to inflate early in the year due to higher demand and several supplier outages and that inflation increased in the second quarter. In total, for our Coatings businesses, costs rose mid single-digit percents, although the rates differ by region and by business. Further inflation pressures have subsided and we are now working to offset the transitory margin compression in several business units with additional pricing initiatives. 
Currency conversion also negatively impacted our earnings. Stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada offset a weaker euro within our business segments. However, our corporate costs were impacted by just over $10 million as our losses from converting balance sheet exposures in this year compared with gains in the second quarter of 2009.
Lastly, we lowered our 2010 tax rate to 28% based on the geographic mix of projected full-year results. When compared with the company's previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 30%, the lower rate added $0.07 to our second quarter results, including $0.02 based on the catch up of reducing the rate for the first three months of 2010. Our second quarter 2009 tax rate was 33%.
Moving now to review our individual business segments. Let me start on the next slide with Performance Coatings. In the quarter, sales exceeded $1.1 billion, growing by $45 million versus the prior year's period. Overall, volumes were flat. However, the segment experienced positive currency conversion and delivered higher selling prices, which were focused on countering inflation.
Earnings advanced by $32 million versus the prior year to a quarterly record of $190 million. Operating margins expanded 230 basis points as our continued strong cost controls supplemented the improved sales mix resulting from the performance of several of our top performing business units. Our Automotive Refinish business continued to recover from last year's recession and customer destocking. Aided by an improved general economic recovery and higher miles driven, the business accelerated into double-digit sales growth this quarter, excluding modest favorable currency impacts.
Sales also grew in our Protective & Marine and Aerospace business. These businesses both have a sizable aftermarket component, serve [ph](43:40) late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline during the recession as most of our other businesses.  Combined sales for these businesses this past quarter were up low single-digit percents versus last year. Reversing the trend of very modest sales declines that we experienced in the past four quarters, we expect the stable nature of these businesses to go unchanged.
Volumes in our Architectural Coatings, America and Asia-Pacific business declined mid single-digit percentages versus last year. But the trend was modestly improved versus the year-over-year results in the first quarter. Results in our national accounts or Do-It-Yourself channel once again outpaced our company-owned stores. U.S. volumes continue to be hampered by restrained commercial construction activity and continued depressed levels of residential housing activity. However, the selling price actions we initiated in the business earlier in the year have been successful, and we are selectively seeking additional price for the second half of the year in an effort to offset raw material inflation.
Looking ahead, we expect the overall construction markets in the United States to remain at low historic levels for the foreseeable future. Overall, Performance Coatings has continued to deliver strong results that are being further enhanced because some of our top-performing businesses are growing more rapidly. Also aiding the segment results is the size of our Asian business, which is now the second-largest region for the segment and is delivering the highest growth rate. We expect the improved business and geographic mix to continue to aid second half results.
The Industrial Coatings segment results are on the next slide. As you can see, the segment's financial performance has continued to strengthen. In the quarter, sales grew 27% or about $200 million to $939 million, with nearly the entire gain coming from volume growth when compared with last year's recession-impacted results. All regions participated in the strong year-over-year growth, and importantly, sales levels in each region were consistent with or higher than first quarter 2010 levels. 
Earnings improved by $84 million to $112 million and our operating margin is right below 12%. In addition to the higher volumes, lower costs for both cost management and restructuring-related initiatives also contributed. Higher raw material costs somewhat tempered these earnings improvements.
Automotive Coatings, our largest individual business in this segment, experienced 40% volume growth in comparison with last year's very low level. Our growth outpaced the overall global auto industry production figures which grew by more than 25% versus weak prior-year global production figures.
Sequentially, industry production advanced about 6% versus the first quarter of 2010. In general, the industry continues to match production with sales and inventories remain at low levels from a historical perspective. Our sales for this business in each region reflect strong year-over-year sales growth, led by our U.S. region which posted 75% growth on both end-use market recovery and market share gains.
The third quarter is normally a seasonally slower quarter due to planned Automotive OEM facility shutdowns, and we expect a similar but less acute pattern this year.
Our Industrial Coatings business unit delivered solid growth levels around 20%, further reflecting an improving general industrial economy in all major regions. Both Asia-Pacific and Latin America growth was around 40%, similar to the first quarter. Growth in the mature regions also was consistent with the first quarter between 7% and 10%. All of these sequential comparisons are despite a more difficult comparable period in 2009. Our Packaging Coatings business also delivered moderate sales growth and solid financial results. This business remains a consistent performer. 
Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment continues to return toward historic operating margins. The absolute earnings we achieved this quarter were our highest second quarter results in a decade, despite sales volumes that still remain nearly 15% below pre-recession 2008 levels.
Looking ahead, we anticipate traditional seasonal impacts to result in lower third quarter sales. We will keep our cost focus and we remain comfortable with the prospects of continuing gradual recovery in the global industrial market. 
Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA business are on the following slide.  Sales in the quarter of $500 million were down $27 million versus last year's period and earnings declined $5 million.  Currency conversion was a notable factor in the sales decline and accounted for half of the earnings decline. Over the past year, the results of this business have been stable and this pattern held true during the quarter. Volume trends remained consistent with recent quarters, down mid single-digit percent due to continued sluggish housing and construction markets in the geographies we serve. As illustrated on the bottom right chart, our geographic footprint includes very little to no exposure in Southern European countries and other countries which have experienced the most significant declines in construction, including those such as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, which combined, account for only about 1% of segment sales.
As we have traditionally shown, included on the slide are the Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization or EBITDA. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As detailed, EBITDA margins were once again comparable this quarter versus last year.
Looking ahead, we anticipate similar business trends will remain. And based on current exchange rates, we expect currency conversion to again detract from year-over-year segment results in the third quarter.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segments results are detailed on the next slide. Versus the prior year, second quarter sales surpassed $300 million, up $46 million or nearly 20% volume growth. Earnings grew by 41% to $86 million, a new record for the segment. Both business units, Optical Products and Silicas continue to benefit from improved overall demand, new product sales and product line extensions. Our Optical Product sales are now approaching the peak levels we achieved, directly following the introduction of our Generation VI transitional lens product. 
Our operating margins were consistent with the past quarter and remained at more than 28% through the first half of the year, which as detailed on the chart, compares favorably versus prior year's, due in part to the benefits of restructuring actions completed in 2009.  Looking ahead, the third quarter is typically a slower quarter seasonally. And we anticipate this trend will continue this year.
The next slide displays our Commodity Chemicals segment results. Compared with last year's second quarter, sales advanced by more than $40 million and earnings grew by $11 million. Improved demand more than offset lower caustic soda pricing, and our higher capacity utilization positively impacted manufacturing costs.
In comparing results this quarter versus the first quarter of the year, we delivered significant improvement as the business has rapidly recovered from trough earnings levels. Sales advanced $32 million as higher volumes were coupled with higher pricing for the ECU, which is an aggregate of chlorine and caustic soda prices. Segment earnings jumped by $50 million as sales gains combined with lower natural gas costs.  Despite our higher production rates, increased demand has cut our inventory in half versus last year.
Looking forward, we expect modestly higher natural gas unit cost in comparison with the second quarter, and we are implementing additional previously announced price increases in both chlorine and caustic soda.
Our Glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $247 million, up $40 million or 19%, due to dramatic improvement in Fiber Glass volumes, which in turn are a result of improved global industrial demand. Segment earnings improved to a $16 million profit compared with a loss of $7 million in the prior year. The 60% year-over-year increase in Fiber Glass volumes resulted in improved manufacturing utilization, up to nearly 100% capacity utilization at quarter's end.
Activity levels in the U.S. architectural glass markets, both commercial and residential construction served by our Performance Glazings business, remained challenging.
Equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter and we also benefited from lower costs, including savings from the restructuring actions we completed last year. We are pleased with the positive earnings momentum. And looking forward, we have recently initiated further selling price initiatives. 
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details, which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $800 million of cash on hand, down from last year's $1 billion level, as we begin to deploy our cash in a balanced manner over the past 12 months.  We spent about $50 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $93 million. We also repaid more than $50 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million. We don't anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year.
Our quarterly dividend payments, an important part of our long-standing heritage at PPG, were $90 million. In total, $180 million for the year. We also spent slightly over $100 million on repurchasing 1.6 million shares of PPG stock. We have more than 4.5 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations.  Year-to-date, returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, which is a PPG legacy, has accounted for nearly half of our cash usages.
One other cash item is pension contributions. And as we previously stated, we expect full-year 2010 contributions to our pension plans of $240 million and have contributed about $50 million year-to-date. For the full year of 2009, we put approximately $450 million in cash and company stock into our plans, including $210 million in the first half.
Our cash position still remained very strong especially when considering that due to the seasonality of our businesses, our strongest cash generation quarters are in the second half of the year. We intend to remain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment, but with the focus on growing earnings per share. We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also anticipate further share repurchases will be a likely use of cash this year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Chuck for some closing remarks."

Our global geographic footprint and a broad set of end-use markets that we serve are continuing to yield benefits. This was clearly in evidence this past quarter as we leveraged the moderate global industrial recovery. Our results were aided by growth in emerging regions and an improved sales mix resulting from stronger results in our top-performing businesses including Optical and Specialty Materials, Aerospace and Auto Refinish.
Our Commodity Chemicals segment rapidly returned to solid profitability, and our Glass business delivered mid single-digit margins on strong fiber glass demand.
As with the first quarter, we continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Let me conclude by commenting that I am encouraged with our earning recovery and that I believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on what we anticipate to be a continued, gradual, global economic recovery. 
Also, we are beginning to utilize our strong balance sheet to accelerate growth. We are currently reviewing several small to mid-sized acquisitions in the $20 million to $250 million range and intend to remain active on share repurchases.

I mean, it's the best result in several years at a minimum in the second quarter. We've been hearing a little bit about on the paints and coatings side that the raw materials have become tighter. I think you alluded a little bit about how the price inflation of raws has outpaced your selling prices. Can you talk about the availability of raws? Is that hampering your volumes to any extent? And I know that -- I think Bob mentioned that you've got some price initiatives underway, selective price initiatives underway in that sector. Would you anticipate that, that would fully offset, by year's end, the raw material inflation that you've seen so far in that sector?"

And if anything, probably a little of the activity which shift into the third quarter. So availability is not a major concern for us right now. And pricing has stabilized in the market for our principal raw materials. Some of the feedstock costs, as we've talked previously, in propylene or ethylene are actually drifting down. So at this point, we don't see supply issues. And we think that raw material pricing has stabilized, albeit at a higher level than we saw at the beginning of the year."

And now with the $35 increase announced in July, we think that this will be implemented on a customer basis, probably taking into consideration at what phase they were in contract. So right now, we do not anticipate any significant problems in implementing the second or this smaller third quarter increase. Volumes have stayed up on the caustic soda side. Inventories are low and we feel confident about the pricing environment for caustic soda. There has been a price increase initiative in Europe, stable pricing in Asia. So on a global basis, we think we have a solid pricing environment for caustic soda. On chlorine, there was a $50 announcement here in the third quarter that we expect to be phased-in over the course of the quarter depending on contracts. There's a little more resistance with the PVC customers, but the other merchant chlorine customers are receiving price increases.

But the construction markets, especially in the developed regions, have been weak. When we had these same economic conditions here in North America, weak construction markets, therefore, weak PVC production, that strengthens the opportunity for firm pricing in caustic soda. So we have shown in 2007, 2008 that strong industrial activity, while we have weak construction activity, actually helps the merchant players like PPG, and it strengthens the pricing environment for caustic soda. So at this point, even if we continue this economic environment that we saw in the second quarter, we feel quite optimistic that we are out of the trough for the Chlor-Alkali business and that we should continue to build on the momentum that you saw from us here in the second quarter."

We have one idle furnace that we are attempting to bring on here in the second half of the year. So we are sold out in the West and implementing price increases. Again, a lot of this is driven by the capacity reductions by ourselves and many of our competitors during the recession. And we think the environment is very solid for the coming years now because of some of these capacity rationalizations. On the electronics side which is we participate through a large joint venture that we have with Nan Ya Plastics in Taiwan and China, that business is booming. And we are running at capacity.

So right now as we went through the second quarter, we pre-announced guidance in the middle of June. And we expected, I think, at that time, to make the middle to the higher end of the range.

Inventory levels are in balance. So our forecast, if anything, have moved up slightly. In Europe, we aren't expecting as strong a second half, but there is still volume growth as I mentioned earlier. Russia is better than we thought. The German producers are stronger. And in China, even though we're probably not going to have the easy comps that we had in the first three or four months of the year, there is still good growth in Chinese Automotive OEM production so that we're maybe not going to be plus 40% as we were in the first three or four months. But we were saying all along that we thought that production could be up 15% to 20% in China for this year. We're still sticking to that forecast, probably at the upper end of that.

So I would say in Automotive, we're not seeing any significant deviation from what we've been looking at on the industrial side. That is a whole range of products including Appliances, Consumer Electronics, Coil & Extrusion. And I would say that the business has been solid, if not great like Automotive OEM. We haven't seen any inflection points yet. Certainly as I've talked about, our Electronics exposure in Fiber Glass is booming. So at this point, we are watching, because obviously, there's some negative sentiment if you look at the media and what they are projecting for the second half.

So the comparables for us in the third and fourth quarter of 2010 versus 2009 will be not as good as the second quarter. Because if you remember, in the second quarter of last year, that's when we had the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler. That was probably the industry at its weakest. So obviously, on a year-over-year basis, we're going to not show the same degree of improvement in the second half if we think that sales will continue to improve versus last year's level without Cash for Clunkers. In Europe, again, the Eastern European countries, Russia, they're coming out of their recession rather well and production there is growing. Germany, benefiting, I think, from a stronger German economy and export opportunities with that weaker Europe. So I think even without the scrappage programs that a number of European countries had instituted last year, we're still going to see modest sales growth in Europe. And in China, they did have some incentives in 2009, especially for smaller cars. Most of those are projected to decline in the second half or certainly into 2011. But right now, we see the growth rates moderating somewhat in China in the second half, again because of the strength of 2009, but still solid growth in that market, even if some of the incentives from the Chinese government for the small vehicles are withdrawn."

We're also seeing a little more activity on wind blades, an important part of our, what we would call, our direct-draw product line, in Fiber Glass goes into wind blade production. That's been a little inconsistent over the last couple of years. We think wind power is the most competitive alternative energy source.

We're seeing, as I mentioned, a very solid pricing environment for caustic soda. We think industrial activity has maintained. Inventory levels are low. The cost basis for U.S.-based industry in Chlor-Alkali, because of the lower natural gas costs, lower ethylene, the export environment is solid. The dollar, after a period of strengthening, seems to be now reverting to a weaker footing. And in fact, if I look at anything over the last week or so on the euro-dollar, that's going to help us a little more than we got helped in the second quarter. And it will also, I think, potentially keep European imports out of North America. As I mentioned, INEOS has just announced a price increase for caustic soda in Europe. The Asia aluminum settlement in caustic was up. So I would say that the pricing environment right now is very solid.

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.
PPG's strong results this quarter benefited largely from a 10% increase in volumes. The breadth of geographies and end-use markets that we serve is enabling us to leverage continuing positive momentum in global industrial demand. The performance of our portfolio is being elevated by higher industrial activity and strong demand across Asia-Pacific and Latin America, which is more than offsetting weak construction in North America and Europe. 
Our performance and growth occurred consistently through the quarter and all of the major regions contributed. Our earnings per share were close to 2008 pre-recession levels as we leveraged the volume growth with our now lower cost structure.
Our earnings this quarter were aided by an improved sales mix in some of our top-performing businesses such as Aerospace, Auto Refinish and our Optical and Specialty Materials segment. As a matter fact, both Optical and Specialty Materials and Performance Coatings segments posted record earnings results. Our Optical segment posted sales growth rates approaching 20%, and it remained our top operating margin segment. Performance Coatings delivered record earnings as margins grew by over 200 basis points. Our Auto Refinish, Aerospace and Protective & Marine Coatings businesses all delivered increased sales, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes in our U.S. Architectural Coatings business.
Our Industrial Coatings segment continue to approach historical earnings levels. In the second quarter, the segment delivered 12% operating margins for the first time since 2006. Segment volume growth was more than 25% versus a recession weakened prior-year period. We achieved 40% growth in our Automotive OEM Coatings business, easily outpacing the 25% year-over-year global industry growth. And we continue to realize double-digit percent growth in our General Industrial business in the emerging regions.
In Architectural Coatings EMEA, our volume performance was consistent with the past several quarters, declining about 5%. Currency conversion negatively impacted sales and accounted for half of the earnings drop.
Results in our Commodity Chemicals segment improved nicely versus last year on higher demand and lower input costs. Most notable was the $50 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2010 due to improving pricing, higher demand and lower natural gas costs.
Our Glass segment benefited from substantially improved performance in our Fiber Glass business, including improved equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures. The strong and continued improvement in the company's financial performance this past quarter occurred despite demand that still remains more than 10% lower than 2008 pre-recession levels. Our strong performance clearly reflects the benefits from our improved business portfolio, along with our lower cost structure. We are positioned for further earnings growth opportunities as the global economy continues to recover and through utilization of our strong balance sheet.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide additional details on our financial performance for the quarter."

I will begin by reviewing the year-over-year bridge of our second quarter sales, which is detailed in the company slide pack on Slide #4.Sales improved about $340 million or 11% versus the second quarter of 2009, which was negatively i",2684,"Thank you, Chuck. I will begin by reviewing the year-over-year bridge of our second quarter sales, which is detailed in the company slide pack on Slide #4.
Sales improved about $340 million or 11% versus the second quarter of 2009, which was negatively impacted by the global recession. Overall, pricing improved modestly by about $20 million. Higher prices in our Coating segments offset lower pricing in the Glass businesses, and more specifically, in our Performance Glazings business, which remains impacted by weak U.S. construction markets.
Year-over-year pricing was also lower in Commodity Chemicals. However, pricing levels in Commodity Chemicals this quarter have moved higher versus the first quarter of 2010. Compared to last year, currency conversion reduced sales by $9 million as the impact of a much weaker euro was nearly offset by stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada.
As Chuck mentioned, we realized a strong increase in volumes. This improvement of more than $300 million was driven by higher global industrial activity in all regions of the world. Weaker construction markets in the mature regions of Europe and North America detracted somewhat from our volume growth. As illustrated on the graphs, our year-over-year volume comparisons this quarter were similar to the first quarter, despite a more difficult comparison period in 2009. As detailed on the lower right chart in comparison with 2008 pre-recession levels, we remain down more than 10%, also comparable to the first quarter.
Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As you can see, the emerging regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America are continuing to grow faster than the developed regions of the world. Asia-Pacific continues to be a considerable growth platform for the company, led primarily by our Industrial businesses, serving both exports from the region and local consumption within the region. While there is concern regarding property value appreciation in China as detailed on the top right chart, only 3% of our total Asian sales stemmed from China Architectural Coatings. 
In the United States and Canada, we continue to experience solid growth, again driven by higher industrial activity along with improving Commodity Chemical demand. However, our business selling into the construction markets declined versus the prior year due to the continued weakness in those markets.
Similar to last quarter, our volumes in Europe increased slightly versus the prior year's quarter. And as we expected heading into the year, the region lags the other major global regions in overall pace of economic recovery. However, volumes remain stable as our Industrial businesses continue to benefit from higher activity levels including more exports from the region, which is offsetting the continuing modest weakness in the construction markets.
Looking ahead for the company, the global economic recovery began to take hold in the second half of 2009. And as such, our second half comparable periods will be more difficult. Also, the third quarter is traditionally a slower quarter seasonally in several of our businesses and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, for the second half of 2010, we do anticipate to benefit from the continuing of the macro trend of gradually improving global industrial activity and expect construction markets to remain sluggish.
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.  
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.64 versus $0.91 last year. Clearly, the largest contributor in our improvement was the benefit from higher sales volume. Additionally, our lower cost structure including the savings from our prior restructuring actions and our lower tax rate contributed heavily.
While our selling prices were higher, they did not fully offset the impact of higher coatings raw material cost. Coatings raw materials began to inflate early in the year due to higher demand and several supplier outages and that inflation increased in the second quarter. In total, for our Coatings businesses, costs rose mid single-digit percents, although the rates differ by region and by business. Further inflation pressures have subsided and we are now working to offset the transitory margin compression in several business units with additional pricing initiatives. 
Currency conversion also negatively impacted our earnings. Stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada offset a weaker euro within our business segments. However, our corporate costs were impacted by just over $10 million as our losses from converting balance sheet exposures in this year compared with gains in the second quarter of 2009.
Lastly, we lowered our 2010 tax rate to 28% based on the geographic mix of projected full-year results. When compared with the company's previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 30%, the lower rate added $0.07 to our second quarter results, including $0.02 based on the catch up of reducing the rate for the first three months of 2010. Our second quarter 2009 tax rate was 33%.
Moving now to review our individual business segments. Let me start on the next slide with Performance Coatings. In the quarter, sales exceeded $1.1 billion, growing by $45 million versus the prior year's period. Overall, volumes were flat. However, the segment experienced positive currency conversion and delivered higher selling prices, which were focused on countering inflation.
Earnings advanced by $32 million versus the prior year to a quarterly record of $190 million. Operating margins expanded 230 basis points as our continued strong cost controls supplemented the improved sales mix resulting from the performance of several of our top performing business units. Our Automotive Refinish business continued to recover from last year's recession and customer destocking. Aided by an improved general economic recovery and higher miles driven, the business accelerated into double-digit sales growth this quarter, excluding modest favorable currency impacts.
Sales also grew in our Protective & Marine and Aerospace business. These businesses both have a sizable aftermarket component, stipulate economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline during the recession as most of our other businesses. Combined sales for these businesses this past quarter were up low single-digit percents versus last year, reversing the trend of very modest sales declines that we experienced in the past four quarters. We expect the stable nature of these businesses to go unchanged.
Volumes in our Architectural Coatings, America and Asia-Pacific business declined mid single-digit percentages versus last year. But the trend was modestly improved versus the year-over-year results in the first quarter. Results in our national accounts or Do-It-Yourself channel once again outpaced our company-owned stores. U.S. volumes continue to be hampered by restrained commercial construction activity and continued depressed levels of residential housing activity. However, the selling price actions we initiated in the business earlier in the year have been successful, and we are selectively seeking additional price for the second half of the year in an effort to offset raw material inflation.
Looking ahead, we expect the overall construction markets in the United States to remain at low historic levels for the foreseeable future. Overall, Performance Coatings has continued to deliver strong results that are being further enhanced because some of our top-performing businesses are growing more rapidly. Also aiding the segment results is the size of our Asian business, which is now the second-largest region for the segment and is delivering the highest growth rate. We expect the improved business and geographic mix to continue to aid second half results.
The Industrial Coatings segment results are on the next slide. As you can see, the segment's financial performance has continued to strengthen. In the quarter, sales grew 27% or about $200 million to $939 million, with nearly the entire gain coming from volume growth when compared with last year's recession-impacted results. All regions participated in the strong year-over-year growth, and importantly, sales levels in each region were consistent with or higher than first quarter 2010 levels. 
Earnings improved by $84 million to $112 million and our operating margin is right below 12%. In addition to the higher volumes, lower costs from both cost management and restructuring-related initiatives also contributed. Higher raw material costs somewhat tempered these earnings improvements.
Automotive Coatings, our largest individual business in this segment, experienced 40% volume growth in comparison with last year's very low level. Our growth outpaced the overall global auto industry production figures which grew by more than 25% versus weak prior-year global production figures.
Sequentially, industry production advanced about 6% versus the first quarter of 2010. In general, the industry continues to match production with sales and inventories remain at low levels from a historical perspective. Our sales for this business in each region reflect strong year-over-year sales growth, led by our U.S. region which posted 75% growth on both end-use market recovery and market share gains.
The third quarter is normally a seasonally slower quarter due to planned Automotive OEM facility shutdowns, and we expect a similar but less acute pattern this year.
Our Industrial Coatings business unit delivered solid growth levels around 20%, further reflecting an improving general industrial economy in all major regions. Both Asia-Pacific and Latin America growth was around 40%, similar to the first quarter. Growth in the mature regions also was consistent with the first quarter between 7% and 10%. All of these sequential comparisons are despite a more difficult comparable period in 2009. Our Packaging Coatings business also delivered moderate sales growth and solid financial results. This business remains a consistent performer. 
Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment continues to return toward historic operating margins. The absolute earnings we achieved this quarter were our highest second quarter results in a decade, despite sales volumes that still remain nearly 15% below pre-recession 2008 levels.
Looking ahead, we anticipate traditional seasonal impacts to result in lower third quarter sales. We will keep our cost focus and we remain comfortable with the prospects of continuing gradual recovery in the global industrial market. 
Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA business are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter of $500 million were down $27 million versus last year's period and earnings declined $5 million.  Currency conversion was a notable factor in the sales decline and accounted for half of the earnings decline. Over the past year, the results of this business have been stable and this pattern held true during the quarter. Volume trends remained consistent with recent quarters, down mid single-digit percent due to continued sluggish housing and construction markets in the geographies we serve. As illustrated on the bottom right chart, our geographic footprint includes very little to no exposure in Southern European countries and other countries which have experienced the most significant declines in construction, including those such as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, which combined, account for only about 1% of segment sales.
As we have traditionally shown, included on the slide are the Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization or EBITDA. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As detailed, EBITDA margins were once again comparable this quarter versus last year.
Looking ahead, we anticipate similar business trends will remain. And based on current exchange rates, we expect currency conversion to again detract from year-over-year segment results in the third quarter.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segments results are detailed on the next slide. Versus the prior year, second quarter sales surpassed $300 million, up $46 million or nearly 20% volume growth. Earnings grew by 41% to $86 million, a new record for the segment. Both business units, Optical Products and Silicas continue to benefit from improved overall demand, new product sales and product line extensions. Our Optical Product sales are now approaching the peak levels we achieved, directly following the introduction of our Generation VI transitional lens product. 
Our operating margins were consistent with the past quarter and remained at more than 28% through the first half of the year, which as detailed on the chart, compares favorably versus prior year's, due in part to the benefits of restructuring actions completed in 2009. Looking ahead, the third quarter is typically a slower quarter seasonally. And we anticipate this trend will continue this year.
The next slide displays our Commodity Chemicals segment results. Compared with last year's second quarter, sales advanced by more than $40 million and earnings grew by $11 million. Improved demand more than offset lower caustic soda pricing, and our higher capacity utilization positively impacted manufacturing costs.
In comparing results this quarter versus the first quarter of the year, we delivered significant improvement as the business has rapidly recovered from trough earnings levels. Sales advanced $32 million as higher volumes were coupled with higher pricing for the ECU, which is an aggregate of chlorine and caustic soda prices. Segment earnings jumped by $50 million as sales gains combined with lower natural gas costs. Despite our higher production rates, increased demand has cut our inventory in half versus last year.
Looking forward, we expect modestly higher natural gas unit cost in comparison with the second quarter, and we are implementing additional previously announced price increases in both chlorine and caustic soda.
Our Glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $247 million, up $40 million or 19%, due to dramatic improvement in Fiber Glass volumes, which in turn are a result of improved global industrial demand. Segment earnings improved to a $16 million profit compared with a loss of $7 million in the prior year. The 60% year-over-year increase in Fiber Glass volumes resulted in improved manufacturing utilization, up to nearly 100% capacity utilization at quarter's end.
Activity levels in the U.S. architectural glass markets, both commercial and residential construction served by our Performance Glazings business, remained challenging.
Equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter and we also benefited from lower costs, including savings from the restructuring actions we completed last year. We are pleased with the positive earnings momentum. And looking forward, we have recently initiated further selling price initiatives. 
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details, which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $800 million of cash on hand, down from last year's $1 billion level, as we begin to deploy our cash in a balanced manner over the past 12 months. We spent about $50 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $93 million. We also repaid more than $50 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million. We don't anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year.
Our quarterly dividend payments, an important part of our long-standing heritage at PPG, were $90 million. In total, $180 million for the year. We also spent slightly over $100 million on repurchasing 1.6 million shares of PPG stock. We have more than 4.5 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations.  Year-to-date, returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, which is a PPG legacy, has accounted for nearly half of our cash usages.
One other cash item is pension contributions. And as we previously stated, we expect full-year 2010 contributions to our pension plans of $240 million and have contributed about $50 million year-to-date. For the full year of 2009, we put approximately $450 million in cash and company stock into our plans, including $210 million in the first half.
Our cash position still remained very strong especially when considering that due to the seasonality of our businesses, our strongest cash generation quarters are in the second half of the year. We intend to remain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment, but with the focus on growing earnings per share. We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also anticipate further share repurchases will be a likely use of cash this year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Chuck for some closing remarks."

Our global geographic footprint and a broad set of end-use markets that we serve are continuing to yield benefits. This was clearly in evidence this past quarter as we leveraged the moderate global industrial recovery. Our results were aided by growth in emerging regions and an improved sales mix resulting from stronger results in our top-performing businesses including Optical and Specialty Materials, Aerospace and Auto Refinish.
Our Commodity Chemicals segment rapidly returned to solid profitability, and our Glass business delivered mid single-digit margins on strong fiber glass demand.
As with the first quarter, we continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Let me conclude by commenting that I am encouraged with our earning recovery and that I believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on what we anticipate to be a continued, gradual, global economic recovery. 
Also, we are beginning to utilize our strong balance sheet to accelerate growth. We are currently reviewing several small to mid-sized acquisitions in the $20 million to $250 million range and intend to remain active on share repurchases. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

There were a couple of suppliers that had unexpected outages or production problems. It probably shifted some business around for us, but we don't think we lost any orders on an ongoing basis. And if anything, probably a little of the activity which shift into the third quarter. So availability is not a major concern for us right now. And pricing has stabilized in the market for our principal raw materials. Some of the feedstock costs, as we've talked previously, in propylene or ethylene are actually drifting down. So at this point, we don't see supply issues. And we think that raw material pricing has stabilized, albeit at a higher level than we saw at the beginning of the year."

And now with the $35 increase announced in July, we think that this will be implemented on a customer basis, probably taking into consideration at what phase they were in contract. So right now, we do not anticipate any significant problems in implementing the second or this smaller third quarter increase. Volumes have stayed up on the caustic soda side. Inventories are low and we feel confident about the pricing environment for caustic soda. There has been a price increase initiative in Europe, stable pricing in Asia. So on a global basis, we think we have a solid pricing environment for caustic soda. On chlorine, there was a $50 announcement here in the third quarter that we expect to be phased-in over the course of the quarter depending on contracts. There's a little more resistance with the PVC customers, but the other merchant chlorine customers are receiving price increases. So here too, we feel that the pricing environment for chlorine is stable to firm."

But the construction markets, especially in the developed regions, have been weak. When we had these same economic conditions here in North America, weak construction markets, therefore, weak PVC production, that strengthens the opportunity for firm pricing in caustic soda. So we have shown in 2007, 2008 that strong industrial activity, while we have weak construction activity, actually helps the merchant players like PPG, and it strengthens the pricing environment for caustic soda. So at this point, even if we continue this economic environment that we saw in the second quarter, we feel quite optimistic that we are out of the trough for the Chlor-Alkali business and that we should continue to build on the momentum that you saw from us here in the second quarter."

On the electronics side which is we participate through a large joint venture that we have with Nan Ya Plastics in Taiwan and China, that business is booming. And we are running at capacity.

So if you take Automotive OEM, we're very well positioned globally. We've worked hard to establish ourselves in markets like China, and not only with the global players but with the domestic players. We have a full product array to meet all of their needs. There is a move in Automotive OEM to what we would call a shorter or a compact processes, where we can deliver cost savings but provide the same corrosion and decorative protection. So I would say that clearly, it's global position in technology and Automotive OEM. In Refinish, we feel that we have the best water-borne or water-based refinish system out there that's helping us gain share, especially in markets or regions where they're going from a solvent-based to water-based mandated system. So we think we are well positioned there. And we have always been not only the market leader but the technology leader in our Aerospace products. And so I think in all three of these, it would be global position but technology. We have a better cost base certainly in these businesses after our restructuring, and I think you see the effects of that. But certainly, we're not trying to win any business by just pursuing a lower price strategy."

And there's good forecasting, not always completely accurate, for the full year. And if you take the North American business, we started this year thinking that North American auto and light truck builds would be a little under 11. And then I think at this meeting three months ago, we said, hey, 11, 11.5. And now I'd say, it's probably 11.5, maybe 11.6. So we have continued to see a good momentum out there. Inventory levels are in balance. So our forecast, if anything, have moved up slightly. In Europe, we aren't expecting as strong a second half, but there is still volume growth as I mentioned earlier. Russia is better than we thought. The German producers are stronger. And in China, even though we're probably not going to have the easy comps that we had in the first three or four months of the year, there is still good growth in Chinese Automotive OEM production so that we're maybe not going to be plus 40% as we were in the first three or four months. But we were saying all along that we thought that production could be up 15% to 20% in China for this year. We're still sticking to that forecast, probably at the upper end of that. And we haven't seen things appreciably slow down in China at this point. So I would say in Automotive, we're not seeing any significant deviation from what we've been looking at on the industrial side. That is a whole range of products including Appliances, Consumer Electronics, Coil & Extrusion. And I would say that the business has been solid, if not great like Automotive OEM. We haven't seen any inflection points yet. Certainly as I've talked about, our Electronics exposure in Fiber Glass is booming. So at this point, we are watching, because obviously, there's some negative sentiment if you look at the media and what they are projecting for the second half. We have talked about one market that we thought in China maybe overheated, which is that Chinese construction, especially residential construction market. We have much less of an exposure there. We have an Architectural business in China, but it is the smallest of our major Coatings businesses. We're doing fine there as well, but we are watching that one. So at this point, we have not seen an inflection point. We're watching and we're a little cautious because of some of the headlines out there.

So the comparables for us in the third and fourth quarter of 2010 versus 2009 will be not as good as the second quarter. Because if you remember, in the second quarter of last year, that's when we had the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler. That was probably the industry at its weakest. So obviously, on a year-over-year basis, we're going to not show the same degree of improvement in the second half if we think that sales will continue to improve versus last year's level without Cash for Clunkers. In Europe, again, the Eastern European countries, Russia, they're coming out of their recession rather well and production there is growing. Germany, benefiting, I think, from a stronger German economy and export opportunities with that weaker Europe.

And in fact, if I look at anything over the last week or so on the euro-dollar, that's going to help us a little more than we got helped in the second quarter. And it will also, I think, potentially keep European imports out of North America. As I mentioned, INEOS has just announced a price increase for caustic soda in Europe. The Asia aluminum settlement in caustic was up. So I would say that the pricing environment right now is very solid. And if industrial activity, if we see a return to the conditions that we saw 18 months ago where industrial activity dropped off, could that change this outlook conceivably? But right now, we haven't seen that. And if anything, we're seeing more of a reversion to the conditions in 2007 and 2008, which led to record caustic soda prices and drove significant earnings improvement from our Chlor-Alkali business."

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks and then we will take questions.
PPG once again posted very strong results. In fact, we delivered record third quarter adjusted earnings per share, which easily eclipsed our prior record. Our earnings per share results were more than 60% higher than last year’s recession impacted numbers and about 15% higher than the pre-recession levels of 2007 and 2008, even though volumes are still around 10% below those years.
This achievement reflects the benefits of the strategic initiatives we’ve undertaken to broaden our geographic footprint, especially in high-growth emerging regions and the diversity of the end-use markets we serve. In addition, our lower overall cost structure has allowed us to leverage the ongoing gradual global industrial recovery into a higher rate of earnings growth. We achieved this despite persistent raw material cost inflation and anemic construction markets in the developed economies of the world.
Overall, PPG sales volumes in the quarter grew 6% in comparison with 2009. For our businesses with links to global industrial activity, the growth trend remained fairly constant throughout the third quarter taking into account seasonal impacts. We anticipate that it will continue to do so for the remainder of the year.
However, given the lethargic construction markets in the mature regions, our year-over-year volumes remained negative in our Architectural Coatings businesses at a rate of decline consistent with prior quarters. We also delivered selling price increases totaling over 3% for the entire company. In many cases, this pricing is working to counteract elevated raw material inflation.
Year-over-year segment earnings grew by more than 35%. Higher industrial activity resulted in sizeable gains in PPG’s Industrial Coatings and commodity chemical segments and in our fiber glass business, all of which are experiencing strong demand recovery from the recession.
Our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments once again grew earnings at double-digit percentages and delivered third quarter earnings records. Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, segment earnings fell slightly with negative currency conversion being a major factor.
Overall, I was very satisfied with our performance for the quarter. I believe we demonstrated that our actions have properly positioned the company to grow in today’s environment. We are now beginning to deploy our strong balance sheet to provide additional future earnings growth opportunities.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Bob to provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter.

I will begin by reviewing the year-over-year bridge of third quarter sales detailed on slide number four. Sales increased by $235 million or 7% versus the third quarter of 2009.

Sales increased by $235 million or 7% versus the third quarter of 2009. In most businesses we experienced normal seasonal sales declines versus the second quarter.
Our overall pricing improved by over $100 million. Our coatings segments have delivered higher pricing each quarter this year as we continue to work to offset persistent raw materials inflation. Year-over-year pricing was also higher in the Commodity Chemicals segment due to continued tightening in the caustic soda market. Currency conversion reduced sales by $75 million, primarily as a result of much weaker euro compared to last year.
Our volumes improved by $188 million or 6% as illustrated on the total PPG volume trend chart. During the third quarter of last year we began to realize some economic recovery, so the third quarter comparable period was a more difficult comparison than the first two quarters of 2010.
Also, from a regional perspective, our growth in the emerging regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America remained considerably higher than the developed regions of the world.
This higher growth is primarily led by our industrial businesses serving both exports from these regions and local consumption. In the developed regions, we continued to experience higher industrial activity. However, our Architectural Coatings businesses selling into the weak construction markets declined once again versus the prior year.
During the quarter, we once again posted strong and broad-based year-over-year sales growth led by our growing position in emerging regions and a continued gradual global industrial recovery. We anticipate similar trends to continue, although sales in several of our businesses are traditionally much slower in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality.
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on slide number five. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today’s presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our Web site at ppg.com.
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.59 versus $0.97 last year and $1.37 in 2008. $1.59 per share is the highest third quarter EPS in the history of PPG and surpasses pre-recession levels of 2008 and 2007 by more than 10%.
In comparison with the third quarter of 2009, improved earnings were driven by higher sales. The improved volumes coupled with our lower manufacturing cost structure resulted in incremental margins on the higher volumes of about 60%.
As with prior quarters this year, higher selling prices primarily countered higher coatings raw material cost. Raw material cost rose high single digit percentages, although the inflation rates differed by region and by business. We anticipate further sporadic supply driven inflationary pressures and our expectation remains that we will offset this inflation with pricing gains.
Another driver in our record performance was our lower tax rate. We lowered our 2010 full year tax rate in the third quarter to 27%, reflecting stronger earnings outside the U.S. where our corporate tax rates are lower.
When compared with the company’s previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 28%, the lower tax rate added $0.06 per share to our third quarter results, including $0.04 of catch up from reducing the rate on earnings for the first six months of 2010. Our third quarter 2009 tax rate was about 33%.
Turning to Slide #6, for PPG in total, we had segment earnings of $484 million, 7% higher than our prior third quarter segment earnings high of $451 million which we achieved in 2008. This overall result includes nearly 25% growth in the Coatings and Optical businesses.
In our Commodity Chemical results, while up from last year, are still well below record 2008 levels. We have also improved our total segment margins by more than 300 basis points, a 30% increase. This is largely a result of our cost reduction initiatives and growth in emerging regions.
It’s important to note that we are delivering these record earnings despite volumes that remain about 10% below 2008 levels and despite significant currency translation headwinds. These results provide continued validation of our ongoing strategic actions to grow in emerging regions and lower our global cost structure.
Now let’s walk through each segments third quarter performance. Performance Coatings sales for the third quarter were $1.1 billion, up $28 million versus the prior year’s period.
Segment earnings improved 12% to a third quarter record of $174 million. Segment margins expanded 140 basis points to 15.8% due to a leaner cost structure and an improved sales mix resulting from continued growth in several of our top performing business units. Each business delivered higher selling prices in an effort to offset raw material inflation.
Overall segment volumes were flat, had solid growth in Protective and Marine Coatings, Aerospace and Automotive Refinish offset the decline in Architectural Coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific.
As illustrated on the chart, the year-over-year sales growth trends in our Protective and Marine and aerospace businesses continued to accelerate due to improving global activity levels in many of their end-use markets. Combined sales for these businesses in the past quarter were up 8% versus last year.
We also posted solid mid-single digit percentage sales growth in Automotive Refinish aided by emerging regions growth and continued market share gains on the success of our new water-based technology.
As in past quarters, volume trends in our Architectural Coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific business remained challenging, declining high-single digit percentages versus last year on continued weakness in the U.S. construction markets.
Despite the weaker Architectural results, Performance Coatings is on pace to deliver record earnings for the full year. As the year-to-date chart illustrates, we have dramatically increased our Asian presence, which is aiding growth rates in our top performing businesses.
The improving business and geographic mix is supplementing the positive impacts from our leaner cost structure. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect these overall trends to continue in what is typically a seasonally slower sales quarter for this segment.
The Industrial Coatings segment results are on the slide #8. The Industrial Coatings segment has continued to post strong year-over-year improvement with sales increasing 13% in the quarter to $927 million on volume growth and sales price gains. Currency conversion was a modest negative.
Earnings were $86 million, up $28 million or 48% against what were improving results in 2009 aided by the U.S. cash for clunkers program. Our 14% volume increase reflects improving global industrial markets, plus increased market penetration by PPG. Our improved segment margin reflects the high incremental margins on our sales growth, including the benefit of our lower manufacturing cost structure.
Similar to the prior quarters this year, higher sales pricing partially offset elevated raw material cost. In Automotive OEM Coatings, we posted volume growth of over 20% easily outpacing global industrial auto production growth which was about 11%.
Our Industrial Coatings business unit also posted double-digit percentage growth this quarter with increases in each major region, led by the emerging regions where our growth exceeded 20% due to the market share gains.
As anticipated, Packaging Coatings remained a stable performer. Emerging regions continued to be a significant growth driver for this segment with year-to-date growth rates of nearly 40% in Asia and Latin America. Emerging regions now account for about 45% of total segment sales and have margins comparable to or higher than operating margins in the mature regions.
So this segment as a whole, we are pleased to post solid earnings despite volumes that still remain below pre-recession levels. As a reminder, the normal historical pattern is for seasonally lower segment sales in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and we anticipate this will hold true again this year.
Results for our Architectural Coatings EMEA business are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter of $512 million were down $47 million versus last year’s period and earnings declined $9 million.
Negative currency conversion due primarily to a weakened euro was a significant factor in segment results negatively impacting sales by $45 million and accounting for $4 million of the earnings decline.
Volume results remained steady with prior quarters this year, declining mid single digit percentages. This reflects continued general sluggishness in the construction and maintenance markets.
Included on the slide are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA. EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition.
Over the past two years, this business has proven to be a very stable performer, as detailed, for both the quarter and year-to-date, EBITDA margins remained fairly consistent despite the modest volume declines and negative currency impacts. We expect that negative currency impacts to continue in the fourth quarter given that the euro strengthened in the fourth quarter of last year.
This business also exhibits significant seasonal slowing from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and we anticipate this year will follow historical patterns.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results on slide number 10. Third quarter sales of $288 million were up $31 million on 13% volume growth. Earnings grew by 22% to $82 million, a new third quarter record for the segment.
Sales growth trends were similar to prior quarters. The growth is primarily due to increased penetration in the Optical end use market of both our Transition lens product and other adjacent products, coupled with a recovery in several silicas end use markets, including automotive.
Our operating margins have remained consistent all year above 28%. Again, the fourth quarter is typically slower due to seasonality and we anticipate that trend to occur again this year. We also expect our year-over-year selling and advertising cost to increase by at least $5 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on growth initiatives moving into 2011.
Turning to Slide #11, the Commodity Chemicals segment, compared with last year’s third quarter, sales grew by $83 million and earnings increased by $41 million. The segment has rapidly returned to solid profitability as higher market demand increased volumes by 9% and pricing rose for both caustic soda and chlorine.
We also benefited from higher capacity utilization and lower natural gas cost, which were partially offset by higher maintenance costs. In comparing results this quarter versus the second quarter of this year sales and earnings increased despite lower production volumes as a weather-related event at one of our manufacturing facilities resulted in a force majeure declaration for a portion of August.
Both plastic and chlorine pricing improved. Our natural gas unit costs were essentially flat at about $5.25 including the impact from our prior natural gas hedges.
Looking forward, additional announced price increases are being implemented and based on current market pricing we expect our natural gas unit cost will be flat to modestly lower in the fourth quarter.
We anticipate lower operating rates due to seasonal trends and several schedule maintenance projects by both us and our customers. Finally, our caustic soda inventories remain negligible with our inventory position currently at its lowest level in the past five years.
Our Glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $260 million, up $37 million aided by continued strong year-over-year fiber glass volumes stemming from improved global industrial demand.
Year-over-year sales were comparable in our Performance Glazings flat glass business as we offset U.S. construction market weakness with increased sales in other end-use markets. Improved pricing in fiber glass was offset by Performance Glazings.
Segment earnings were $32 million profit compared with a loss of $6 million in the prior year. Several factors contributed to this, including higher fiber glass sales volumes, which also aided manufacturing utilization. Also equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter.
We remain pleased with the trend of the segment results for the past two quarters. The underlying market fundamentals remain stable. However, like our other segments, we anticipate a traditional seasonal decline in the fourth quarter.
Let me conclude my remarks by commenting on some of the cash details which are presented on the next slide. We ended the quarter with $930 million of cash of hand. We have generated about $700 million of cash from operations this year, including a deduction of $220 million for cash pension contributions.
We spent about $65 million on capital expenditures during the quarter bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $158 million. We made no substantial change to our debt in the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis we have repaid about $200 million. We don’t anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year.
In the quarter, dividend payments, an important element of our cash usage and a PPG heritage, were $90 million and totaled $270 million for the year-to-date period. We last raised our quarterly dividend payment this past July. During the quarter we spent about $160 million repurchasing PPG stock.
Year-to-date we have spent $275 million and repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $65 per share. We have about 3.1 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. Rewarding our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks remains a longstanding PPG tradition, and we have maintained that this year.
As detailed on the chart, year-to-date we have paid out nearly 80% of our cash from operations as either dividends or share buybacks. Our financial flexibility remained strong given our current cash position, and considering that due to the seasonality of our business, our strongest cash generation quarter is traditionally the fourth quarter.
We intend to remain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment, but with a focus on growing earnings per share. We continue to review potential bolt-on acquisitions and we anticipate further disciplined share repurchases will be a likely use of cash over the remainder of this year.
With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck for some closing remarks.

Our focus continues to be on operational excellence as we remain committed to cost management. As such, we are fully maximizing the continued gradual volume growth from the economic recovery by delivering strong incremental margins.
We have already established a strong coatings leadership position in the emerging regions that has and will continue to enable us to take full advantage of the expected future higher growth rates in these regions. We will do this organically, including market share gains and through bolt-on acquisitions.
As a side benefit, these regions typically have low tax rates, which will enable us to sustain our lower overall tax rate. The shift of our business portfolio to focus on Coatings and Optical Products has significantly reduced our capital intensity.
As a result, we have additional cash to use for earnings growth opportunities and to return to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly 80% of our cash from operations to our shareholders, and we are currently assessing a variety of disciplined ways to deploy our balance sheet to further accelerate our earnings growth.
Let me conclude by reiterating that we delivered record third quarter earnings despite the fact that the sales in our businesses have yet to fully recover, and in some cases such as Architectural Coatings remain at recessionary levels. This combined with our continued organic growth prospects and strong balance sheet give me continued optimism about our future earnings potential. That concludes our prepared remarks.

Right now, it’s holding up a little better than normal seasonality here, at least at the start of the fourth quarter. So we’re fairly optimistic, you do have some export opportunities with the weak dollar and some of the low ethylene natural gas prices. So we’ve seen some exports increase in the PVC chain. So I think that bodes well for a little stronger fourth quarter than typical. Natural gas prices have stayed calm.
At this point, I would say that the market conditions remain favorable. We are implementing the price increases announced earlier in the third quarter for caustic soda. There is another one on the table, as you know, here that’s been announced by several of the market participants here in the fourth quarter.
So caustic prices are I think also in a favorable trend. We’ve seen a restart of operations in the aluminum refinery in Jamaica. Pulp and paper, a number of the other end use markets for caustic are good. There is global pricing momentum in Europe and in Asia. So right now, I would say, conditions both at an operating level, volume and pricing remain favorable but there will still be some seasonality here in the fourth quarter.

In markets like China and India, where they do have on average smaller vehicles, we have a lower paint content per vehicle in a market like China or India, and that is largely attributable to the smaller sizes of many of the vehicles that are sold there.
As far as the repaint opportunities, for us, we always view these airline mergers and acquisitions as an opportunity for them to rebrand themselves, come up with the new livery, and I know we’ll be working hard to secure that business for PPG.

As I mentioned in an earlier comment, we still think we have some pricing opportunities in this business because demand now has caught up with supply. We also had a significant anti-dumping duty levied against the Chinese manufacturers in Europe, which should set a foundation we hope for improved pricing. So I would see the opportunity for further improvements in fiberglass and it would be more on the pricing rather than the volume side at least in the early part of 2011.

We continue to perform well, but we know, without the volume growth that you would normally expect in a market like this we’ve had to offset it with tactical pricing initiatives and cost reduction initiatives.
We have really worked hard on the cost side, pushing operating excellence and trying to lean out on our supply chain, and these are the things that we’re doing here in North America as well. We don’t think we’ve reached the end of the line in terms of our opportunities to improve the business. We’re committed to these businesses. They are performing well in many regions.
Yes, markets were probably overheated a couple of years ago. We would expect with the improvements that we’ve made, if we get back to something more considered a normal construction markets, both residential and housing that these businesses will be excellent contributors for PPG.
So we have not lost confidence in the longer-term. I feel that we’re performing now at a record earnings level for PPG in the third quarter. This is I think a very strong quarter when we haven’t been getting a significant contribution from the construction markets that serve a number of our businesses.
So I take that as a real opportunity for PPG. I’ve talked about that with a number of our investors, if you are getting record earnings from us when a market that is important for PPG is not yet contributing, and if we can get back not even to peak levels but more normalized operating levels in these businesses, I think we’ll do quite well and it will be another opportunity to take PPG to the next level.

As noted on Slide #2, our prepared remarks and comments made in subsequent question-and-answer session may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and as discussed in PPG Industries' filings with the SEC, may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates on these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirement of Regulation G, the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Before we begin our discussion on the third quarter, let me comment on a process change that we will be implementing beginning with our fourth quarter earnings call to be held in mid-January. Beginning with that earnings call, PPG will post on its website at ppg.com detailed prepared remarks, along with related presentation slides. These will be posted approximately 30 minutes prior to the beginning of that call. PPG will not read the prepared remarks on the call, but we will have a few summary opening comments from our Chairman and CEO, which will be followed by an extended period for questions. 
This revised process will provide the same amount of data, will enable each of you additional time to review the information to prepare for the call and will allow for significantly more time for Q&A. 
Now the agenda for today's discussion on the third quarter results is noted on Slide #3. And let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch, who will provide the opening remarks."

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.
PPG once again posted very strong results. In fact, we delivered record third quarter adjusted earnings per share, which easily eclipsed our prior record. Our earnings per share results were more than 60% higher than last year's recession-impacted numbers and about 15% higher than the pre-recession levels of 2007 and 2008, even though volumes are still around 10% below those years.
This achievement reflects the benefits of the strategic initiatives we've undertaken to broaden our geographic footprint, especially in high-growth emerging regions and the diversity of the end-use markets we serve. In addition, our lower overall cost structure has allowed us to leverage the ongoing gradual and global industrial recovery into a higher rate of earnings growth. We achieved this despite persistent raw material cost inflation and anemic construction markets in the developed economies of the world. 
Overall, PPG's sales volume in the quarter grew 6% in comparison with 2009. For our businesses with links to global industrial activity, the growth trend remained fairly constant throughout the third quarter, taking into account seasonal impacts. We anticipate that it will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. However, given the lethargic construction markets in the mature regions, our year-over-year volumes remained negative in our Architectural Coatings businesses at a rate of decline consistent with prior quarters.
We also delivered selling price increases totaling over 3% for the entire company. In many cases, this pricing is working to counteract elevated raw material inflation. Year-over-year segment earnings grew by more than 35%, higher industrial activity resulted in sizable gains in PPG's Industrial Coatings and Commodity Chemicals segments and in our Fiberglass business, all of which are experiencing strong demand recovery from the recession.
Our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments once again grew earnings at double-digit percentages and delivered third quarter earnings records. Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment earnings fell slightly, with negative currency conversion being a major factor.
Overall, I was very satisfied with our performance for the quarter. I believe we demonstrated that our actions have properly positioned the company to grow in today's environment. We are now beginning to deploy our strong balance sheet to provide additional future earnings growth opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter."

Sales increased by $235 million or 7% versus the third quarter of 2009. In most businesses, we experienced normal seasonal sales declines versus the second quarter. Our overall pricing improved by over $100 million. 
Our Coatings segments have delivered higher pricing each quarter this year as we continue to work to offset persistent raw materials inflation. Year-over-year pricing was also higher in the Commodity Chemicals segment due to continued tightening in the caustic soda market. Currency conversion reduced sales by $75 million, primarily as a result of much weaker euro compared to last year. 
Our volumes improved by $188 million or 6% as illustrated on a total PPG volume trend chart. During the third quarter of last year, we began to realize some economic recovery. So the third quarter comparable period was a more difficult comparison in the first two quarters of 2010.
Also, from a regional perspective, our growth in the emerging regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America remain considerably higher than the developed regions of the world. This higher growth is primarily led by our industrial businesses, serving both exports from these regions and local consumption. In the developed regions, we continued to experience higher industrial activity. However, our Architectural Coatings businesses selling into the weak construction markets declined once again versus the prior year.
During the quarter, we once again posted strong and broad-based year-over-year sales growth, led by our growing position in emerging regions and the continued gradual global industrial recovery. We anticipate similar trends to continue, although sales in several of our businesses are traditionally much slower in the fourth quarter due to seasonality.
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on Slide #5. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.59 versus $0.97 last year and $1.37 in 2008. $1.59 per share is the highest third quarter EPS in the history of PPG and surpasses pre-recession levels of 2008 and 2007 by more than 10%. In comparison with the third quarter of 2009, improved earnings were driven by higher sales. The improved volumes, coupled with our lower manufacturing cost structure, resulted in incremental margins on the higher volumes of about 60%.
As with prior quarters this year, higher selling prices, primarily countered higher coatings raw material costs. Raw material costs rose high single-digit percentages, although the inflation rates differed by region and by business. We anticipate further sporadic supply-driven inflationary pressures, and our expectation remains that we will offset this inflation with pricing gains.
Another driver in our record performance was our lower tax rate. We lowered our 2010 full year tax rate in the third quarter to 27%, reflecting stronger earnings outside the U.S., where our corporate tax rates are lower. When compared with the company's previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 28%, the lower tax rate added $0.06 per share to our third quarter results, including $0.04 of catch-up from reducing the rate on earnings for the first six months of 2010. Our third quarter 2009 tax rate was about 33%.
Turning to Slide #6. For PPG in total, we had segment earnings of $484 million, 7% higher than our prior third quarter segment earnings high of $451 million, which we achieved in 2008. This overall result includes nearly 25% growth in the Coatings and Optical businesses. And our Commodity Chemical results, while up from last year, are still well below record 2008 levels. We have also improved our total segment margins by more than 300 basis points, a 30% increase. This is largely a result of our cost reduction initiatives and growth in emerging regions.
It's important to note that we are delivering these record earnings despite volumes that remained about 10% below 2008 level and despite significant currency translation headwinds. These results provide continued validation of our ongoing strategic actions to grow in emerging regions and lower our global cost structure.
Now let's walk through each segment's third quarter performance. Performance Coatings sales for the third quarter were $1.1 billion, up $28 million products versus the prior year's period. Segment earnings improved 12% to a third quarter record of $174 million. Segment margins expanded 140 basis points to 15.8% due to a leaner cost structure and an improved sales mix resulting from continued growth in several of our top performing business units. 
Each business delivered higher selling prices in an effort to offset raw material inflation. Overall, segment volumes were flat, as solid growth in Protective & Marine Coatings, Aerospace and Automotive Refinish offset the decline in Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia Pacific.
As illustrated on the chart, the year-over-year sales growth trends in our Protective & Marine and Aerospace businesses continued to accelerate due to improving global activity levels in many of their end-use markets. 
Combined sales for these businesses in the past quarter were up 8% versus last year. We also posted solid mid-single-digit percentage sales growth in Automotive Refinish, aided by emerging regions growth and continuing market share gains on the success of our new water-based technology.
As in past quarters, volume trends in our Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia Pacific business remained challenging, declining high single-digit percentages versus last year on continued weakness in the U.S. construction markets. Despite the weaker Architectural results, Performance Coatings is on pace to deliver record earnings for the full year. 
As the year-to-date chart illustrates, we have dramatically increased our Asian presence, which is aiding growth rates in our top performing businesses. The improving business and geographic mix is supplementing the positive impacts from our leaner cost structure. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect these overall trends to continue in what is typically a seasonally slower sales quarter for this segment.
The Industrial Coatings segment results on the Slide #8. The Industrial Coatings segment has continued to post strong year-over-year improvement, with sales increasing 13% in the quarter to $927 million on volume growth and sales price gains. Currency conversion was a modest negative. 
Earnings were $86 million, up $28 million or 48% against what were improving results in 2009, aided by the U.S. Cash for Clunkers program.
Our 14% volume increase reflects improving global industrial markets, plus increased market penetration by PPG. Our improved segment margin reflects the high incremental margins on our sales growth, including the benefit of our lower manufacturing cost structure.
Similar to the prior quarters this year, higher sales pricing partially offset elevated raw material costs. In Automotive OEM Coatings, we posted volume growth of over 20%, easily outpacing global industrial auto production growth towards about 11%. Our Industrial Coatings business unit also posted double-digit percentage growth this quarter, with increases in each major region, led by the emerging regions where our growth exceeded 20% due to the market share gains.
As anticipated, Packaging Coatings remained a stable performer. Emerging regions continued to be a significant growth driver for this segment, with year-to-date growth rates of nearly 40% in Asia and Latin America. Emerging regions now account for about 45% of total segment sales and have margins comparable to or higher than operating margins in the mature regions.
For this segment as a whole, we are pleased to post solid earnings despite volumes that still remain below pre-recession levels. As a reminder, the normal historical pattern is for seasonally lower segment sales in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and we anticipate this will hold true again this year.
Results for our Architectural Coatings EMEA business are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter of $512 million were down $47 million versus last year's period, and earnings declined $9 million. Negative currency conversion, due primarily to a weakened euro, was a significant factor in segment results, negatively impacting sales by $45 million and accounting for $4 million of the earnings decline.
Volume results remained steady with prior quarters this year, declining mid-single-digit percentages. This reflects continued general sluggishness in the construction and maintenance markets.
Included on the slide are earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA. EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition. 
Over the past two years, this business has proven to be a very stable performer. As detailed for both the quarter and year-to-date, EBITDA margins remained fairly consistent. Despite the modest volume decline and negative currency impacts, we expect the negative currency impacts to continue in the fourth quarter, given that the euro strengthened in the fourth quarter of last year.
This business also exhibits significant seasonal slowing from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate this year will follow historical patterns. 
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results on Slide #10. Third quarter sales of $288 million were up $31 million on 13% volume growth. Earnings grew by 22% to $82 million, a new third quarter record for the segment. 
Sales growth trends were similar to prior quarters. The growth is primarily due to increased penetration in the optical end-use market of both our Transition lens product and other adjacent products, coupled with a recovery in several Silicas end-use market including automotive. Our operating margins have remained consistent all year above 28%. Again, the fourth quarter is typically slower due to seasonality, and we anticipate that trend to occur again this year.
We also expect our year-over-year selling and advertising costs to increase by at least $5 million in the fourth quarter, as we continue to focus on growth initiatives moving into 2011.
Turning to Slide 11, the Commodity Chemicals segment. Compared with last year's third quarter, sales grew by $83 million and earnings increased by $41 million. The segment has rapidly returned to solid profitability as higher market demand increased volumes by 9%, and pricing rose for both caustic soda and chlorine. We also benefited from higher capacity utilization and lower natural gas cost, which were partially offset by higher maintenance cost.
In comparing results this quarter versus the second quarter of this year, sales and earnings increased despite lower production volumes, as a weather-related event at one of our manufacturing facilities resulted in a force majeure declaration for a portion of August. Both caustic and chlorine pricing improved. Our natural gas unit costs were essentially flat at about $5.25, including the impact from our prior natural gas hedges.
Looking forward, additional announced price increases are being implemented. And based on current market pricing, we expect our natural gas unit costs will be flat to modestly lower in the fourth quarter. We anticipate lower operating rates due to seasonal trends and several scheduled maintenance projects by both us and our customers.  Finally, our caustic soda inventories remain negligible, with our inventory position currently at its lowest level in the past five years. 
Our Glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $260 million, up $37 million aided by continued strong year-over-year Fiberglass volumes stemming from improved global industrial demand. Year-over-year sales were comparable in our Performance Glazings flat glass business as we offset U.S. construction market weakness with increased sales in other end-use markets. Improved pricing in Fiberglass was offset by Performance Glazings.
Segment earnings were a $32 million profit compared with a loss of $6 million in the prior year. Several factors contributed to this, including higher Fiberglass sales volumes, which also aided manufacturing utilization. Also, equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter. We remain pleased with the trend of the segment results the past two quarters. The underlying market fundamentals remain stable. However, like our other segments, we anticipate a traditional seasonal decline in the fourth quarter.
Let me conclude my remarks by commenting on some of the cash details which are presented on the next slide. We ended the quarter with $930 million of cash on hand. And we have generated about $700 million of cash from operations this year, including a deduction of $220 million for cash pension contributions. 
We spent about $65 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $158 million. We made no substantial change to our debt in the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repaid about $200 million. We don't anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year.
In the quarter, dividend payments, an important element of our cash usage, and a PPG heritage, were $90 million, and totaled $270 million for the year-to-date period. We last raised our quarterly dividend payment this past July. 
During the quarter, we spent about $160 million repurchasing PPG stock. Year-to-date, we have spent $275 million and repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $65 per share. We have about 3.1 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. 
Rewarding our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks remains a long-standing PPG tradition, and we have maintained that this year. As detailed on the chart, year-to-date we had paid out nearly 80% from our cash from operations, as either dividends or share buybacks. Our financial stability remains strong, given our cash position. And considering that due to the seasonality of our business, our strongest cash generation quarter is traditionally the fourth quarter.
We intend to maintain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment but with a focus on growing earnings per share. We continue to review potential bolt-on acquisitions, and we anticipate further disciplined share repurchases will be a likely use of cash over the remainder of this year. 
With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck for some closing remarks."

I will conclude by reiterating a few key items. Our focus continues to be on operational excellence, as we remain committed to cost management.
As such, we are fully maximizing the continued gradual volume growth from the economic recovery by delivering strong incremental margins. We have already established a strong coatings leadership position in the emerging regions that has and will continue to enable us to take full advantage of the expected future higher growth rates in these regions. We will do this organically, including market share gains and through bolt-on acquisitions. 
As a side benefit, these regions typically have low tax rates, which will enable us to sustain our lower overall tax rate. The shift of our business portfolio to focus on coatings and optical products has significantly reduced our capital intensity. As a result, we have additional cash to use for earnings growth opportunities and to return to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly 80% of our cash from operations to our shareholders,  And we are currently assessing a variety of disciplined ways to deploy our balance sheet to further accelerate our earnings growth. 
Let me conclude by reiterating that we delivered record third quarter earnings despite the fact that the sales in our businesses had yet to fully recover, and in some cases, such as Architectural Coatings, remain at recessionary levels. This, combined with our continued organic growth prospects and strong balance sheet give me continued optimism about our future earnings potential.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

So at this point, I would say that the market conditions remain favorable. We are implementing the price increases announced earlier in the third quarter for caustic soda.

Yes, the markets were probably overheated a couple of years ago. We would expect, with improvements that we've made, if we can get back to something more considered normal construction markets, both residential and housing, that these businesses will be excellent contributors for PPG. So we have not lost confidence in the longer-term. And I feel that we are performing now at a record earnings level for PPG in the third quarter. I mean, this is, I think, a very strong quarter when we haven't been getting a significant contribution from the construction markets that serve a number of our businesses. So I take that as a real opportunity for PPG. I've talked about that with the number of our investors. If you're getting record earnings from us when a market that is important for PPG is not yet contributing, and if we can get back, not even to peak levels, but more normalized operating levels in these businesses, I think we'll do quite well, and it will be an opportunity to take PPG to the next level."

Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Dellinger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Navikas, Vice President and Controller.
Our comments relate to financial information released on Thursday, October 21, 2010. The presentation supporting this briefing may be accessed through the Investor Center on the PPG website at ppg.com.
As noted on Slide #2, our prepared remarks and comments made in subsequent question-and-answer session may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and as discussed in PPG Industries' filings with the SEC, may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates on these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirement of Regulation G, the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Before we begin our discussion on the third quarter, let me comment on a process change that we will be implementing beginning with our fourth quarter earnings call to be held in mid-January. Beginning with that earnings call, PPG will post on its website at ppg.com detailed prepared remarks, along with related presentation slides. These will be posted approximately 30 minutes prior to the beginning of that call. PPG will not read the prepared remarks on the call, but we will have a few summary opening comments from our Chairman and CEO, which will be followed by an extended period for questions. 
This revised process will provide the same amount of data, will enable each of you additional time to review the information to prepare for the call and will allow for significantly more time for Q&A. 
Now the agenda for today's discussion on the third quarter results is noted on Slide #3. And let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch, who will provide the opening remarks."

Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions.
PPG once again posted very strong results. In fact, we delivered record third quarter adjusted earnings per share, which easily eclipsed our prior record. Our earnings per share results were more than 60% higher than last year's recession-impacted numbers and about 15% higher than the pre-recession levels of 2007 and 2008, even though volumes are still around 10% below those years.
This achievement reflects the benefits of the strategic initiatives we've undertaken to broaden our geographic footprint, especially in high-growth emerging regions and the diversity of the end-use markets we serve. In addition, our lower overall cost structure has allowed us to leverage the ongoing gradual and global industrial recovery into a higher rate of earnings growth. We achieved this despite persistent raw material cost inflation and anemic construction markets in the developed economies of the world. 
Overall, PPG's sales volumes in the quarter grew 6% in comparison with 2009. For our businesses with links to global industrial activity, the growth trend remained fairly constant throughout the third quarter, taking into account seasonal impacts. We anticipate that it will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. However, given the lethargic construction markets in the mature regions, our year-over-year volumes remained negative in our Architectural Coatings businesses at a rate of decline consistent with prior quarters.
We also delivered selling price increases totaling over 3% for the entire company. In many cases, this pricing is working to counteract elevated raw material inflation. Year-over-year segment earnings grew by more than 35%. Higher industrial activity resulted in sizable gains in PPG's Industrial Coatings and Commodity Chemicals segments and in our Fiberglass business, all of which are experiencing strong demand recovery from the recession.
Our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments once again grew earnings at double-digit percentages and delivered third quarter earnings records. Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment earnings fell slightly, with negative currency conversion being a major factor.
Overall, I was very satisfied with our performance for the quarter. I believe we demonstrated that our actions have properly positioned the company to grow in today's environment. We are now beginning to deploy our strong balance sheet to provide additional future earnings growth opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter."

Sales increased by $235 million or 7% versus the third quarter of 2009. In most businesses, we experienced normal seasonal sales declines versus the second quarter. Our overall pricing improved by over $100 million. 
Our Coatings segments have delivered higher pricing each quarter this year as we continue to work to offset persistent raw materials inflation. Year-over-year pricing was also higher in the Commodity Chemicals segment due to continued tightening in the caustic soda market. Currency conversion reduced sales by $75 million, primarily as a result of much weaker euro compared to last year. 
Our volumes improved by $188 million or 6% as illustrated on a total PPG volume trend chart. During the third quarter of last year, we began to realize some economic recovery. So the third quarter comparable period was a more difficult comparison in the first two quarters of 2010.
Also, from a regional perspective, our growth in the emerging regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America remain considerably higher than the developed regions of the world. This higher growth is primarily led by our industrial businesses, serving both exports from these regions and local consumption. In the developed regions, we continued to experience higher industrial activity. However, our Architectural Coatings businesses selling into the weak construction markets declined once again versus the prior year.
During the quarter, we once again posted strong and broad-based year-over-year sales growth, led by our growing position in emerging regions and the continued gradual global industrial recovery. We anticipate similar trends to continue, although sales in several of our businesses are traditionally much slower in the fourth quarter due to seasonality.
Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on Slide #5. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today's presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com.
In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.59 versus $0.97 last year and $1.37 in 2008. $1.59 per share is the highest third quarter EPS in the history of PPG and surpasses pre-recession levels of 2008 and 2007 by more than 10%. In comparison with the third quarter of 2009, improved earnings were driven by higher sales. The improved volumes, coupled with our lower manufacturing cost structure, resulted in incremental margins on the higher volumes of about 60%.
As with prior quarters this year, higher selling prices, primarily countered higher coatings raw material costs. Raw material costs rose high single-digit percentages, although the inflation rates differed by region and by business. We anticipate further sporadic supply-driven inflationary pressures, and our expectation remains that we will offset this inflation with pricing gains.
Another driver in our record performance was our lower tax rate. We lowered our 2010 full year tax rate in the third quarter to 27%, reflecting stronger earnings outside the U.S., where our corporate tax rates are lower. When compared with the company's previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 28%, the lower tax rate added $0.06 per share to our third quarter results, including $0.04 of catch-up from reducing the rate on earnings for the first six months of 2010. Our third quarter 2009 tax rate was about 33%. 
Turning to Slide #6. For PPG in total, we had segment earnings of $484 million, 7% higher than our prior third quarter segment earnings high of $451 million, which we achieved in 2008. This overall result includes nearly 25% growth in the Coatings and Optical businesses. And our Commodity Chemical results, while up from last year, are still well below record 2008 levels. We have also improved our total segment margins by more than 300 basis points, a 30% increase. This is largely a result of our cost reduction initiatives and growth in emerging regions.
It's important to note that we are delivering these record earnings despite volumes that remained about 10% below 2008 levels and despite significant currency translation headwinds. These results provide continued validation of our ongoing strategic actions to grow in emerging regions and lower our global cost structure.
Now let's walk through each segment's third quarter performance. Performance Coatings sales for the third quarter were $1.1 billion, up $28 million versus the prior year's period. Segment earnings improved 12% to a third quarter record of $174 million. Segment margins expanded 140 basis points to 15.8% due to a leaner cost structure and an improved sales mix resulting from continued growth in several of our top performing business units. 
Each business delivered higher selling prices in an effort to offset raw material inflation. Overall, segment volumes were flat, as solid growth in Protective & Marine Coatings, Aerospace and Automotive Refinish offset the decline in Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia Pacific.
As illustrated on the chart, the year-over-year sales growth trends in our Protective & Marine and Aerospace businesses continued to accelerate due to improving global activity levels in many of their end-use markets. 
Combined sales for these businesses in the past quarter were up 8% versus last year. We also posted solid mid-single-digit percentage sales growth in Automotive Refinish, aided by emerging regions growth and continuing market share gains on the success of our new water-based technology.
As in past quarters, volume trends in our Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia Pacific business remained challenging, declining high single-digit percentages versus last year on continued weakness in the U.S. construction markets. Despite the weaker Architectural results, Performance Coatings is on pace to deliver record earnings for the full year. 
As the year-to-date chart illustrates, we have dramatically increased our Asian presence, which is aiding growth rates in our top performing businesses. The improving business and geographic mix is supplementing the positive impacts from our leaner cost structure. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect these overall trends to continue in what is typically a seasonally slower sales quarter for this segment.
The Industrial Coatings segment results on the Slide #8. The Industrial Coatings segment has continued to post strong year-over-year improvement, with sales increasing 13% in the quarter to $927 million on volume growth and sales price gains. Currency conversion was a modest negative. 
Earnings were $86 million, up $28 million or 48% against what were improving results in 2009, aided by the U.S. Cash for Clunkers program.
Our 14% volume increase reflects improving global industrial markets, plus increased market penetration by PPG. Our improved segment margin reflects the high incremental margins on our sales growth, including the benefit of our lower manufacturing cost structure.
Similar to the prior quarters this year, higher sales pricing partially offset elevated raw material costs. In Automotive OEM Coatings, we posted volume growth of over 20%, easily outpacing global industrial auto production growth towards about 11%. Our Industrial Coatings business unit also posted double-digit percentage growth this quarter, with increases in each major region, led by the emerging regions where our growth exceeded 20% due to the market share gains.
As anticipated, Packaging Coatings remained a stable performer. Emerging regions continued to be a significant growth driver for this segment, with year-to-date growth rates of nearly 40% in Asia and Latin America. Emerging regions now account for about 45% of total segment sales and have margins comparable to or higher than operating margins in the mature regions.
For this segment as a whole, we are pleased to post solid earnings despite volumes that still remain below pre-recession levels. As a reminder, the normal historical pattern is for seasonally lower segment sales in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and we anticipate this will hold true again this year.
Results for our Architectural Coatings EMEA business are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter of $512 million were down $47 million versus last year's period, and earnings declined $9 million. Negative currency conversion, due primarily to a weakened euro, was a significant factor in segment results, negatively impacting sales by $45 million and accounting for $4 million of the earnings decline.
Volume results remained steady with prior quarters this year, declining mid-single-digit percentages. This reflects continued general sluggishness in the construction and maintenance markets.
Included on the slide are earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA. EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment, given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition. 
Over the past two years, this business has proven to be a very stable performer. As detailed for both the quarter and year-to-date, EBITDA margins remained fairly consistent. Despite the modest volume decline and negative currency impacts, we expect the negative currency impacts to continue in the fourth quarter, given that the euro strengthened in the fourth quarter of last year.
This business also exhibits significant seasonal slowing from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate this year will follow historical patterns. 
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results on Slide #10. Third quarter sales of $288 million were up $31 million on 13% volume growth. Earnings grew by 22% to $82 million, a new third quarter record for the segment. 
Sales growth trends were similar to prior quarters. The growth is primarily due to increased penetration in the optical end-use market of both our Transition lens product and other adjacent products, coupled with a recovery in several Silicas end-use markets including automotive. Our operating margins have remained consistent all year above 28%. Again, the fourth quarter is typically slower due to seasonality, and we anticipate that trend to occur again this year.
We also expect our year-over-year selling and advertising costs to increase by at least $5 million in the fourth quarter, as we continue to focus on growth initiatives moving into 2011.
Turning to Slide 11, the Commodity Chemicals segment. Compared with last year's third quarter, sales grew by $83 million, and earnings increased by $41 million. The segment has rapidly returned to solid profitability as higher market demand increased volumes by 9%, and pricing rose for both caustic soda and chlorine. We also benefited from higher capacity utilization and lower natural gas cost, which were partially offset by higher maintenance cost.
In comparing results this quarter versus the second quarter of this year, sales and earnings increased despite lower production volumes, as a weather-related event at one of our manufacturing facilities resulted in a force majeure declaration for a portion of August. Both caustic and chlorine pricing improved. Our natural gas unit costs were essentially flat at about $5.25, including the impact from our prior natural gas hedges.
Looking forward, additional announced price increases are being implemented. And based on current market pricing, we expect our natural gas unit costs will be flat to modestly lower in the fourth quarter. We anticipate lower operating rates due to seasonal trends and several scheduled maintenance projects by both us and our customers.  Finally, our caustic soda inventories remain negligible, with our inventory position currently at its lowest level in the past five years. 
Our Glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $260 million, up $37 million aided by continued strong year-over-year Fiberglass volumes stemming from improved global industrial demand. Year-over-year sales were comparable in our Performance Glazings flat glass business as we offset U.S. construction market weakness with increased sales in other end-use markets. Improved pricing in Fiberglass was offset by Performance Glazings.
Segment earnings were a $32 million profit compared with a loss of $6 million in the prior year. Several factors contributed to this, including higher Fiberglass sales volumes, which also aided manufacturing utilization. Also, equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter. We remain pleased with the trend of the segment results the past two quarters. The underlying market fundamentals remain stable. However, like our other segments, we anticipate a traditional seasonal decline in the fourth quarter.
Let me conclude my remarks by commenting on some of the cash details which are presented on the next slide. We ended the quarter with $930 million of cash on hand. And we have generated about $700 million of cash from operations this year, including a deduction of $220 million for cash pension contributions. 
We spent about $65 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $158 million. We made no substantial change to our debt in the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repaid about $200 million. We don't anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year.
In the quarter, dividend payments, an important element of our cash usage, and a PPG heritage, were $90 million and totaled $270 million for the year-to-date period. We last raised our quarterly dividend payment this past July. 
During the quarter, we spent about $160 million repurchasing PPG stock. Year-to-date, we have spent $275 million and repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $65 per share. We have about 3.1 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. 
Rewarding our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks remains a long-standing PPG tradition, and we have maintained that this year. As detailed on the chart, year-to-date we had paid out nearly 80% from our cash from operations, as either dividends or share buybacks. Our financial flexibility remains strong, given our cash position. And considering that due to the seasonality of our business, our strongest cash generation quarter is traditionally the fourth quarter.
We intend to remain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment but with a focus on growing earnings per share. We continue to review potential bolt-on acquisitions, and we anticipate further disciplined share repurchases will be a likely use of cash over the remainder of this year. 
With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck for some closing remarks."

I will conclude by reiterating a few key items. Our focus continues to be on operational excellence, as we remain committed to cost management.
As such, we are fully maximizing the continued gradual volume growth from the economic recovery by delivering strong incremental margins. We have already established a strong coatings leadership position in the emerging regions that has and will continue to enable us to take full advantage of the expected future higher growth rates in these regions. We will do this organically, including market share gains and through bolt-on acquisitions. 
As a side benefit, these regions typically have low tax rates, which will enable us to sustain our lower overall tax rate. The shift of our business portfolio to focus on coatings and optical products has significantly reduced our capital intensity. As a result, we have additional cash to use for earnings growth opportunities and to return to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly 80% of our cash from operations to our shareholders. And we are currently assessing a variety of disciplined ways to deploy our balance sheet to further accelerate our earnings growth. 
Let me conclude by reiterating that we delivered record third quarter earnings despite the fact that the sales in our businesses have yet to fully recover, and in some cases, such as Architectural Coatings, remain at recessionary levels. This, combined with our continued organic growth prospects and strong balance sheet give me continued optimism about our future earnings potential.

So I would say that has, I think, that bodes well for a little stronger fourth quarter than typical. Natural gas prices have stayed calm. So at this point, I would say that the market conditions remain favorable. We are implementing the price increases announced earlier in the third quarter for caustic soda. There is another one on the table, as you know here, that's been announced by several of the market participants here in the fourth quarter. So caustic prices are, I think, also in a favorable trend. We've seen a restart of operations in the aluminum refinery in Jamaica. Pulp and paper, a number of the other end-use markets for caustic are good.

We saw somewhat of an effect of that in '08 and '09, especially with the higher gas prices. I'd say, if anything though, this year in North America anyway, that trend has stabilized, if not going back a little bit as you've seen the recovery of some of the SUV models. In markets like China and India where they do have, on average, smaller vehicles, we have a lower paint content per vehicle in a market like China or India. And that is largely attributable to the smaller sizes of many of the vehicles that are sold there. And as far as the repaint opportunities, for us, we always view these are airline mergers and acquisitions as an opportunity for them to rebrand themselves, come up with a new livery. And I know we'll be working hard to secure that business for PPG. So you can visit -- you can see our handiwork every time you go to the airport, hopefully, Bob, there in Houston."

So we have not lost confidence in the longer-term. And I feel that we are performing now at a record earnings level for PPG in the third quarter. I mean, this is, I think, a very strong quarter when we haven't been getting a significant contribution from the construction markets that serve a number of our businesses. So I take that as a real opportunity for PPG. I've talked about that with a number of our investors. If you're getting record earnings from us when a market that is important for PPG is not yet contributing, and if we can get back, not even to peak levels, but more normalized operating levels in these businesses, I think we'll do quite well, and it will be an opportunity to take PPG to the next level."
