Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. Also, please note that beginning with this call, a full-looking chart geographic revenue distribution will be available in our slide deck. Secondly, this call will be available to download as a podcast. For details, you may also visit the IR section of our website.With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirement of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variations in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion, we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information, a useful view of the company's financial result, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin."

Juniper Networks finished 2009 on a very strong note, financially, operationally and strategically. Our fourth quarter performance not only represented quarter-on-quarter growth, but also year-o",1145,"Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. Juniper Networks finished 2009 on a very strong note, financially, operationally and strategically. Our fourth quarter performance not only represented quarter-on-quarter growth, but also year-on-year growth. The results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole reinforce a few key points. First, they provide good indication that the macro environment continues to improve. While it remains too early to predict that pays and trajectory of recovery particularly by geography, we come a long way from the economic uncertainty we were facing at this time just a year ago.Second, our results reinforce that Juniper is executing operationally. We executed well on our R&D roadmap, and we strengthened and expanded our go-to market capability introducing potentially valuable new partnerships. We're also implementing our connected sales to marketing model worldwide, which is the foundation for continued improvements in sales execution. These achievements are translating to financial results. Our operating margins are improving, our cash flow generation in strengthening and we're getting these results while staying true to our commitment to invest in our innovation roadmap and customer support.And third, the fourth quarter is another data point that indicates we are on the right track strategically. We expanded our portfolio of offerings, leveraging our investment in R&D across both the Service Provider and Enterprise Sectors. That the core of Juniper is to drive for invasion which has enabled us to deliver routing, switching and security on a common software platform JUNOS. This programmable software platform running on custom silicon is changing the economics of networking, and it is attracting partners which is enabling more choice and flexibility to our customers.Many of you heard us talk in detail about our vision and strategy for the new networks in New York at our October event. As Internet traffic continues to increase, customers faced the difficult challenge of managing the complexity associated with the network, and the significant investments required to maintain and expand it. It becomes increasingly apparent that there's a tremendous opportunity to develop a new approach to the network that deliver significant value to customers as they manage these challenges.We believe the new network must be delivered on a common, open software platform, JUNOS, supported by dedicated silicon that allows scalability. It's a platform in which our partners and customers can innovate and deliver new and better user experiences, in an environment that is fast, reliable, secure and scalable. In New York , we made several key announcements that move us down this path. Our new JUNOS software platform which include JUNOS in the network, JUNOS Space, and our new network line, JUNOS Pulse. The launch of our next-generation silicon, Trio, which enable 3D Scaling and positions our MX Routers as the worlds first Universal Edge platform, a critical development for the mobile market. Five new solutions and a new suite of products for our Data Center Cloud Initiative (sic) [Data Center 2 Cloud Initiative] and a series of JUNOS-based partnerships, including agreements with IBM and Dell that extend our market reach, as well as a host of licensing and application development partnerships. You'll be hearing more about all these developments in the weeks and months ahead. In the meantime, they lend further validation to what we accomplished in 2009, and reinforce where we are going into this new decade. Early in 2009, we laid out for you a set of operating principles, by which we have managed the company through the worst macroeconomic environment any of us has ever faced. After establishing those principles in Q1, we consistently improved our financial performance sequentially in each quarter. As we look ahead at 2010, we've taken a fresh look at the principles that we will use to guide us in 2010. I want to layout those principles for you today and then hand over to Robyn for more details on the quarter and the look ahead.Five principles that will guide us in 2010 include: First, we are assuming in 2010 that the macro economy continues to improve as we move through the year, setting the stage for a year of growth. Stability has improved and GDP growth is forecasted in 2010. Though growth will vary by geography and of course, the sustainability of growth is dependent on the job recovery and many other factors. Second, we always plan for multiple scenarios, but our intent is to accelerate coming out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery in 2010. Visibility is good in the enterprise market. We continue to take share, we are increasing awareness and we have momentum. Visibility continues to improve in the Service Provider sector and there are good growth opportunities for Juniper. I'm particularly pleased to see the traction we are getting in the Service Provider sector in areas outside of our traditional scope, including Security and Managed Services.Third, we will invest in innovations that deliver long-term value for our customers. Our product roadmap is targeted to investments that extend our competitive advantage and enable our customer's success. I talked a moment ago about innovation in silicon, software and systems that will power the new network, and we will continue to target investments in Mobility, the Data Center and other key areas. In 2010, you will see us expand our focus on customer solutions that bring these technologies together in unique ways.Fourth, we remain diligent in managing our operating expenses. Our intent is to grow revenue faster than operating expenses, enabling us to drive year-on-year operating margin expansion. We'll do this by driving operational excellence as we continue to invest in innovation, our routes to market and customer support. And finally, we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flows. Our goal is to optimize financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and augment that with returns via share repurchases as business and market conditions warrant. The set of principles should communicate our optimism about 2010. Consistent with 2009, we will maintain agility as we come out of the downturn. To sum up, we're pleased with the performance of the company operationally, financially and strategically. The difference in tone of the business is strikingly different than it was a year ago at this time. Economic improvement has afforded us the opportunity to perform. But it's the execution on our operating principle throughout the past year that positions us to really succeed. As we enter a new decade, I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the Juniper employees and our partners who worked tirelessly in pursuit of our mission, enact everything and empower everyone. We know there is still much more to do, yet we see a year of growth ahead for Juniper, and we fully expect the company to accelerate out of the downturn. I'll ask Robyn now to review the financial results in more detail. Robyn?"

We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial result, which demonstrates that we are executing well in a market that appears to be improving. Our solid execution in the quarter resulted in record enterprise sector revenue and strong sequential growth in the service provider sector. Our key demand indicators were all healthy, with record levels of deferred revenue on both product and services and strong overall bookings, which led to product book-to-bill well in excess of one. We continue to demonstrate financial discipline, showing good improvement in gross margins and measured spending that contributed to a significant sequential improvement in our operating margin. These performance underscores the operating leverage built into our financial model.On a full-year basis, we did what we said we were going to do. We committed that if our revenues were down for the full year, our expenses would be flat to down. For the full year, revenue was down 7%, while non-GAAP operating expenses were down 3%. We achieved this goal by reducing OpEx, while carefully directing investments to R&D. These investments resulted in key product releases and projects that position us well as our markets continue to improve. These actions enabled us to improve our operating margin on a sequential basis throughout 2009.Now on to a discussion of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $941 million. This was a strong finish to the year and represents a 14% sequential increase, and a 2% increase from the prior year fourth quarter. Juniper recorded GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter, compared to $0.16 per share in the third quarter and $0.25 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. GAAP net income includes a $12 million charge due to the legal settlement related to a land development agreement for property purchased in 2000, and a restructuring charge of $3 million. Combined, these two items represent $0.02 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.32, an improvement of $0.09 compared to the third quarter, and flat compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Looking more closely at revenue, I will give you a color on the regions, business segments and markets. Looking at our revenue by region. For the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue, up three points sequentially. EMEA was 27% and APAC was 18%. On a sequential basis, the Americas revenue increased 22% and 7% year-over-year. These growth was driven by a record revenue quarter for the U.S., where Service Providers saw a strong sequential growth and both Enterprise and Service Providers saw a good year-over-year growth.EMEA revenue was up sequentially in the fourth quarter due to the growth in both the Enterprise and Service Provider markets. This growth was primarily driven by the U.K. APAC grew both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This growth was fueled by the Enterprise business and offset by slight declines in the Service Provider business. Growth was strongest in Australia and in India. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $695 million was up a strong 17% sequentially, and down 1% on a year-over-year basis. IPG saw growth on a sequential basis in MX, M and T products as well as higher services revenue. EX revenue increased 47% to $74 million, which we're presented our highest EX revenue quarter to date.SLT delivered another revenue record quarter of $246 million, which represents an increase of 8% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis. This growth was driven by strength in SRX and SSL VPN products. SRX products were $43 million, we are pleased with this 38% sequential increase. One of the significant drivers of the revenue increased for SLT was our continued expansion into the Service Provider market, with a record $71 million of revenue this quarter. This was led by increased sales of our SRX and Security products into our Tier 1 U.S. Service Provider customer.Overall, we are pleased with our return on investment in R&D, as evidenced by the strength of new products including MX, EX and SRX, which contribute more than $236 million in revenue in the quarter. For the full year, these products contributed over $700 million in product revenue.We are seeing increased success with our portfolios selling strategy, contributing to market share gains in Enterprise and expanding our market depth and breadth in Service Providers.Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was 68% and Enterprise revenue was 32% of the total revenue. Service Provider revenue was up 22% sequentially, and up 1% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. This success is a result of improving market conditions in the U.S., growth in routing and increased penetration of our Switching and Security products. This focus resulted in increased SLT product sales of 6% and EX sales of 67% sequentially.In terms of customers, AT&T was a greater than 10% of our revenue for the quarter and for the year. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects and new design wins in Security and Mobility. We remained very pleased with our strong relationship with AT&T. Enterprise revenue was up 1% sequentially, and up 5% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, Enterprise was up 11% as we delivered on our strategic objective to extend our presence in the Enterprise. Switching fuel to growth and our portfolio of selling enabled good expansion in Enterprise, Routing and Security.On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter were 66.9% of revenue. A significant improvement over the prior quarter and returning to our long-term model of 66% to 68%. Overall, the biggest factor to total gross margin was the increase in the mix of product revenues versus services. Product gross margins were 68.5% of revenue, up from 67.8% in the third quarter with the highest sequential improvement in IPG. This improvement was primarily due to volume and efficiencies resulting from our ongoing supply chain management. Service gross margin was 61.1% of revenue, up from 59.2% in the third quarter. This improvement was due to better-than-expected revenues as well as good cost management.Moving on to our operating expenses. I am very pleased with our continued cost management. A huge thank you goes out to our extraordinary employees, who showed great commitment to containing costs while continuing to execute at high levels. Their efforts directly contributed to our results. For the full year 2009, we reduced total non-GAAP OpEx by 3%, while redeploying investment into R&D and Customer Support and reducing our sales and marketing expenses by 7%.For Q4, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $400 million or 42.5% of revenue. Relative to the third quarter, operating expenses increased $29 million or 8% on revenue growth of 14%. R&D expenses were $172 million or 18.3% of revenue. A slight increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter and flat for the full year. This is a significant achievement by the R&D team, who have delivered on their roadmap and met significant markdowns on time.Sales and marketing expenses totaled $194 million or 20.6% of revenue, a $28 million increase sequentially. This is the result of higher variable sales expense and an increase in investment in revenue-generating marketing campaign. G&A expenses totaled $34 million or 3.6% of revenue, flat with the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $230 million, resulting in an operating margin of 24.4% of revenue, a very strong 3.6 point sequential gain.Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26.3%, up five points from the third quarter and contributed the most to our sequential improvement in total operating margins. This increase was due to a higher revenue, higher gross margins and good cost discipline in sales and R&D. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 19.3%, flat compared to the third quarter, and I am pleased with the strength in both segment operating margins.Turning to the bottom line. Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $174 million for the quarter, up 42% sequentially. Net other income and expense was zero for the quarter, interest income of $3 million was offset by a higher distributor financing cost as a result of the increase in volume and modest foreign exchange losses.The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected at 25.4%, down sequentially by 3.8 points. The primary driver was the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings. The reduced tax rate contributed $0.01 to our non-GAAP EPS. Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and investment. This balance was up $60 million from the prior quarter. We generated record cash flow from operations in the quarter of $260 million, up from $224 million in the third quarter. For 2009, we generated $796 million in cash from operation.During the quarter, we repurchased 8.1 million shares at an average price of $26.14 per share, or approximately $212 million. For the full year, we repurchased 20.7 million shares at an average price of $21.91 per share or $454 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter was 539 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, up slightly from the prior quarter.As of December 31, our absolute shares outstanding were 519 million shares, down 8 million compared to the end of 2008. As Kevin noted, it is our intention to continue to execute on our buy back program as business and market conditions warrant. CapEx for the quarter totaled $40 million, and depreciation and amortization was $37 million consistent with prior quarters. DSO increased to 44 days from 41 reported in the third quarter, which is in line with our long-term model and typical for the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was up significantly to a record $754 million. Sequentially product deferred revenue was up 27% or a $51 million increase.Services deferred revenue increased by 13% or $60 million. Year-over-year, total deferred revenue balance increased by a notable $163 million or 28%, with product deferred revenue up 53% and services deferred revenue up 19%. Our deferred revenue profile reflects the broad range of customers with no one single customer representing a majority of the increase. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 7,231.Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. As Kevin noted, earlier, while we are always planning for multiple business scenarios, our expectations of the 2010 will be a growth year for Juniper. We also anticipate that the pace of economic recovery will vary by geography, but that overall, the economic environment will strengthen as we move throughout the year. As we entered the first quarter, we are mindful of the strong demand metrics that we posted in the December quarter and we're balancing that with the fact that many of our customers is still sitting their 2010 budget. So for the March quarter, with the midpoint of $895 million, our revenue range is $880 million to $910 million. We are expecting gross margins for Q1 to remain solid and within our long-term model of 66% to 68%. We intend to manage operating expenses essentially flat with the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, OpEx in Q1 include higher FICA taxes as well as the resumption of some of our variable compensation expenses.Operating margin for the first quarter will be down sequentially on a reduced revenue, but it will be at 21% plus or minus half a point. And as we progress throughout 2010, we anticipate operating margin expansion as revenue growth in the year-over-year basis. We remain committed to achieving our long-term operating margin targets on a sustainable basis. We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to range between $0.23 and $0.26. A note on the tax rate. The anticipated tax rate for the March quarter will be approximately 31%. This is due to the R&D tax credit not yet being approved. The impact of this higher tax rate on the March quarter EPS is approximately $0.02. Share count is expected to be flat compared to the fourth quarter.In summary, throughout 2009, we demonstrated good financial discipline, and we're able to show good expansion in operating margin. We managed our cost structure well within our anticipated revenue opportunity and at the same time, continued to deliver great innovation to the marketplace. As we look forward to 2010, we will continue to be prudent with our cost and we'll execute our investments in line with the market and economic recovery. With that, we look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day scheduled for February 23, where we will provide more detail in our strategic plans supporting the long-term growth of the company. I will now hand it over to the operator for questions."

And really the variability in that range has to do with our Service Provider segment as we said in the commentary. I think we did have a very strong finish in 2004 in the fourth quarter when we saw good growth in both Routing and also Security and Switching and the Service Provider, and also we saw growth in Enterprise sector. So we are expecting sort of that range for the first quarter. And as you historically know, the first half of our year is about between 47% and 48% of total revenue for the year. If you go back over the last four or five years, that's been about the case. And then the second half of the year tends to be about 52% or 53%. So that is how we're looking at the year trends in terms of next year. We don't see any patent change in that. So we do expect the bigger second half than the first half.

When you look at the marketplace, anytime you have an explosion of devices, ubiquitous use of devices, lots of applications and connectivity to the Internet, you start to open up the risks and concerns of malware and viruses and security issues. And so our SRX and the solutions that we have with SRX and JUNOS polls have seen a lot of activity in the area of mobility. The second thing then is with the announcement of the MX 3D, the fact that we've got the world's first universal edge router that can scale on three dimensions, whether it's traffic, number of users, or the number of services provided to the user. I think that's generating opportunity as well. Now certainly on the wireless side, traffic continues to grow, and people have to continue to manage and tune their networks, and so continued build-outs on the wireline side continue. But when it comes to mobility, I think that's where we're seeing a lot of opportunity."

The first one that, as you saw the performance in Q4, this business has a lot of operating leverage opportunity in it. If we start driving revenue, the fact that we invest a dollar in R&D that can then be monetized in both the Service Provider sector and the Enterprise sector is a very powerful formula. And if we can accelerate revenue growth, there is a of operating margin expansion that we can drive. Now, as we're accelerating out of this downturn, obviously, if there are investments we can put in to further accelerate that growth in revenue, that's what's going to drive the most probability for shareholders. And so certainly, those investments may come near-term more in the form of sales and marketing to help us accelerate out of the downturn. Now long-term, certainly, keeping our eye on the R&D agenda, and we feel very good about the execution that we had in R&D in 2009. We feel very good about the decisions that we've made in terms of allocation of R&D resources in 2010. And so I think in many ways, we're going to execute against that R&D agenda in 2010 and the more we can accelerate, the operating leverage we're going to get. And your question of could this business, over the few years, can we get enough operating leverage and breakthrough rise above 25% operating margin? The answer is absolutely, it could. Our job right now today is to accelerate out of the downturn, and that is the strategy."

And so, I think in many ways, you look at that pattern of spending that started back when the macroeconomic situation was a -- lot more questions around it. I think today as our customers have worked through a lot of how they're planning through the economic downturn, the bigger question, right now, is whether or not, as they enter their fiscal year, they've landed and finalize their capital budgets and how much of that had been released? And I think that varies customer by customer. Certainly, when I look long term at the fundamentals of the networking industry, traffic volumes continue to grow, there's more users on more devices. There's more user scenarios in mobility and wireless, there's opportunities. Certainly, the earlier question was raised about optical and routing. There's a significant number of opportunities for us. And so I think in terms of putting the guidance together, as Robyn said, we looked and said that quarter-on-quarter, typically in the Enterprise sector, there is -- in enterprise spending, Q1 is a lower capital spend for enterprise customers in Q4. We're projecting our Enterprise business roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, and the one variable is the service providers. And so could that number be lower? Yes. Could it be higher? Sure.

First of all, the EX revenue grew 50% quarter-on-quarter, so another strong indicator of customer acceptance of the EX product line. The thing that you have to be careful of is part of that EX growth, we counted in the Service Provider sector, but it's used for Managed Services to serve as enterprise customers. And so as enterprise customers look to the service providers, certainly, service providers will be buying product in our enterprise solutions that are serving enterprise customers. And so I think that's the bulk of what you saw in this particular quarter. And I think Robyn's got a couple of specific numbers she can share."

Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirement of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variations in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.All statements made during this call are made only as of today.

Juniper Networks finished 2009 on a very strong note, financially, operationally and strategically. Our fourth quarter performance not only represented quarter-on-quarter growth, but also year-on-year growth. The results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole reinforce a few key points. First, they provide good indication that the macro environment continues to improve. While it remains too early to predict that pays and trajectory of recovery particularly by geography, we come a long way from the economic uncertainty we were facing at this time just a year ago.Second, our results reinforce that Juniper is executing operationally. We executed well on our R&D roadmap, and we strengthened and expanded our go-to market capability introducing potentially valuable new partnerships. We're also implementing our connected sales to marketing model worldwide, which is the foundation for continued improvements in sales execution. These achievements are translating to financial results. Our operating margins are improving, our cash flow generation in strengthening and we're getting these results while staying true to our commitment to invest in our innovation roadmap and customer support.And third, the fourth quarter is another data point that indicates we are on the right track strategically. We expanded our portfolio of offerings, leveraging our investment in R&D across both the Service Provider and Enterprise Sectors. That the core of Juniper is to drive for invasion which has enabled us to deliver routing, switching and security on a common software platform JUNOS. This programmable software platform running on custom silicon is changing the economics of networking, and it is attracting partners which is enabling more choice and flexibility to our customers.Many of you heard us talk in detail about our vision and strategy for the new networks in New York at our October event. As Internet traffic continues to increase, customers faced the difficult challenge of managing the complexity associated with the network, and the significant investments required to maintain and expand it. It becomes increasingly apparent that there's a tremendous opportunity to develop a new approach to the network that deliver significant value to customers as they manage these challenges.We believe the new network must be delivered on a common, open software platform, JUNOS, supported by dedicated silicon that allows scalability. It's a platform in which our partners and customers can innovate and deliver new and better user experiences, in an environment that is fast, reliable, secure and scalable. In New York , we made several key announcements that move us down this path. Our new JUNOS software platform which include JUNOS in the network, JUNOS Space, and our new network line, JUNOS Pulse. The launch of our next-generation silicon, Trio, which enable 3D Scaling and positions our MX Routers as the worlds first Universal Edge platform, a critical development for the mobile market. Five new solutions and a new suite of products for our Data Center Cloud Initiative (sic) [Data Center 2 Cloud Initiative] and a series of JUNOS-based partnerships, including agreements with IBM and Dell that extend our market reach, as well as a host of licensing and application development partnerships. You'll be hearing more about all these developments in the weeks and months ahead. In the meantime, they lend further validation to what we accomplished in 2009, and reinforce where we are going into this new decade. Early in 2009, we laid out for you a set of operating principles, by which we have managed the company through the worst macroeconomic environment any of us has ever faced. After establishing those principles in Q1, we consistently improved our financial performance sequentially in each quarter. As we look ahead at 2010, we've taken a fresh look at the principles that we will use to guide us in 2010. I want to layout those principles for you today and then hand over to Robyn for more details on the quarter and the look ahead.Five principles that will guide us in 2010 include: First, we are assuming in 2010 that the macro economy continues to improve as we move through the year, setting the stage for a year of growth. Stability has improved and GDP growth is forecasted in 2010. Though growth will vary by geography and of course, the sustainability of growth is dependent on the job recovery and many other factors. Second, we always plan for multiple scenarios, but our intent is to accelerate coming out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery in 2010. Visibility is good in the enterprise market. We continue to take share, we are increasing awareness and we have momentum. Visibility continues to improve in the Service Provider sector and there are good growth opportunities for Juniper. I'm particularly pleased to see the traction we are getting in the Service Provider sector in areas outside of our traditional scope, including Security and Managed Services.Third, we will invest in innovations that deliver long-term value for our customers. Our product roadmap is targeted to investments that extend our competitive advantage and enable our customer's success. I talked a moment ago about innovation in silicon, software and systems that will power the new network, and we will continue to target investments in Mobility, the Data Center and other key areas. In 2010, you will see us expand our focus on customer solutions that bring these technologies together in unique ways.Fourth, we remain diligent in managing our operating expenses. Our intent is to grow revenue faster than operating expenses, enabling us to drive year-on-year operating margin expansion. We'll do this by driving operational excellence as we continue to invest in innovation, our routes to market and customer support. And finally, we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flows. Our goal is to optimize financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and augment that with returns via share repurchases as business and market conditions warrant. The set of principles should communicate our optimism about 2010. Consistent with 2009, we will maintain agility as we come out of the downturn. To sum up, we're pleased with the performance of the company operationally, financially and strategically. The difference in tone of the business is strikingly different than it was a year ago at this time. Economic improvement has afforded us the opportunity to perform. But it's the execution on our operating principle throughout the past year that positions us to really succeed. As we enter a new decade, I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the Juniper employees and our partners who worked tirelessly in pursuit of our mission, enact everything and empower everyone. We know there is still much more to do, yet we see a year of growth ahead for Juniper, and we fully expect the company to accelerate out of the downturn. I'll ask Robyn now to review the financial results in more detail. Robyn?"

We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial result, which demonstrates that we are executing well in a market that appears to be improving. Our solid execution in the quarter resulted in record enterprise sector revenue and strong sequential growth in the service provider sector. Our key demand indicators were all healthy, with record levels of deferred revenue on both product and services and strong overall bookings, which led to product book-to-bill well in excess of one. We continue to demonstrate financial discipline, showing good improvement in gross margins and measured spending that contributed to a significant sequential improvement in our operating margin. These performance underscores the operating leverage built into our financial model.On a full-year basis, we did what we said we were going to do. We committed that if our revenues were down for the full year, our expenses would be flat to down. For the full year, revenue was down 7%, while non-GAAP operating expenses were down 3%. We achieved this goal by reducing OpEx, while carefully directing investments to R&D. These investments resulted in key product releases and projects that position us well as our markets continue to improve. These actions enabled us to improve our operating margin on a sequential basis throughout 2009.Now on to a discussion of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $941 million. This was a strong finish to the year and represents a 14% sequential increase, and a 2% increase from the prior year fourth quarter. Juniper recorded GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter, compared to $0.16 per share in the third quarter and $0.25 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. GAAP net income includes a $12 million charge due to the legal settlement related to a land development agreement for property purchased in 2000, and a restructuring charge of $3 million. Combined, these two items represent $0.02 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.32, an improvement of $0.09 compared to the third quarter, and flat compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Looking more closely at revenue, I will give you a color on the regions, business segments and markets. Looking at our revenue by region. For the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue, up three points sequentially. EMEA was 27% and APAC was 18%. On a sequential basis, the Americas revenue increased 22% and 7% year-over-year. These growth was driven by a record revenue quarter for the U.S., where Service Providers saw a strong sequential growth and both Enterprise and Service Providers saw a good year-over-year growth.EMEA revenue was up sequentially in the fourth quarter due to the growth in both the Enterprise and Service Provider markets. This growth was primarily driven by the U.K. APAC grew both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This growth was fueled by the Enterprise business and offset by slight declines in the Service Provider business. Growth was strongest in Australia and in India. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $695 million was up a strong 17% sequentially, and down 1% on a year-over-year basis. IPG saw growth on a sequential basis in MX, M and T products as well as higher services revenue. EX revenue increased 47% to $74 million, which we're presented our highest EX revenue quarter to date.SLT delivered another revenue record quarter of $246 million, which represents an increase of 8% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis. This growth was driven by strength in SRX and SSL VPN products. SRX products were $43 million, we are pleased with this 38% sequential increase. One of the significant drivers of the revenue increased for SLT was our continued expansion into the Service Provider market, with a record $71 million of revenue this quarter. This was led by increased sales of our SRX and Security products into our Tier 1 U.S. Service Provider customer.Overall, we are pleased with our return on investment in R&D, as evidenced by the strength of new products including MX, EX and SRX, which contribute more than $236 million in revenue in the quarter. For the full year, these products contributed over $700 million in product revenue.We are seeing increased success with our portfolios selling strategy, contributing to market share gains in Enterprise and expanding our market depth and breadth in Service Providers.Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was 68% and Enterprise revenue was 32% of the total revenue. Service Provider revenue was up 22% sequentially, and up 1% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. This success is a result of improving market conditions in the U.S., growth in routing and increased penetration of our Switching and Security products. This focus resulted in increased SLT product sales of 6% and EX sales of 67% sequentially.In terms of customers, AT&T was a greater than 10% of our revenue for the quarter and for the year. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects and new design wins in Security and Mobility. We remained very pleased with our strong relationship with AT&T. Enterprise revenue was up 1% sequentially, and up 5% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, Enterprise was up 11% as we delivered on our strategic objective to extend our presence in the Enterprise. Switching fuel to growth and our portfolio of selling enabled good expansion in Enterprise, Routing and Security.On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter were 66.9% of revenue. A significant improvement over the prior quarter and returning to our long-term model of 66% to 68%. Overall, the biggest factor to total gross margin was the increase in the mix of product revenues versus services. Product gross margins were 68.5% of revenue, up from 67.8% in the third quarter with the highest sequential improvement in IPG. This improvement was primarily due to volume and efficiencies resulting from our ongoing supply chain management. Service gross margin was 61.1% of revenue, up from 59.2% in the third quarter. This improvement was due to better-than-expected revenues as well as good cost management.Moving on to our operating expenses. I am very pleased with our continued cost management. A huge thank you goes out to our extraordinary employees, who showed great commitment to containing costs while continuing to execute at high levels. Their efforts directly contributed to our results. For the full year 2009, we reduced total non-GAAP OpEx by 3%, while redeploying investment into R&D and Customer Support and reducing our sales and marketing expenses by 7%.For Q4, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $400 million or 42.5% of revenue. Relative to the third quarter, operating expenses increased $29 million or 8% on revenue growth of 14%. R&D expenses were $172 million or 18.3% of revenue. A slight increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter and flat for the full year. This is a significant achievement by the R&D team, who have delivered on their roadmap and met significant markdowns on time.Sales and marketing expenses totaled $194 million or 20.6% of revenue, a $28 million increase sequentially. This is the result of higher variable sales expense and an increase in investment in revenue-generating marketing campaign. G&A expenses totaled $34 million or 3.6% of revenue, flat with the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $230 million, resulting in an operating margin of 24.4% of revenue, a very strong 3.6 point sequential gain.Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26.3%, up five points from the third quarter and contributed the most to our sequential improvement in total operating margins. This increase was due to a higher revenue, higher gross margins and good cost discipline in sales and R&D. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 19.3%, flat compared to the third quarter, and I am pleased with the strength in both segment operating margins.Turning to the bottom line. Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $174 million for the quarter, up 42% sequentially. Net other income and expense was zero for the quarter, interest income of $3 million was offset by a higher distributor financing cost as a result of the increase in volume and modest foreign exchange losses.The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected at 25.4%, down sequentially by 3.8 points. The primary driver was the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings. The reduced tax rate contributed $0.01 to our non-GAAP EPS. Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and investment. This balance was up $60 million from the prior quarter. We generated record cash flow from operations in the quarter of $260 million, up from $224 million in the third quarter. For 2009, we generated $796 million in cash from operation.During the quarter, we repurchased 8.1 million shares at an average price of $26.14 per share, or approximately $212 million. For the full year, we repurchased 20.7 million shares at an average price of $21.91 per share or $454 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter was 539 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, up slightly from the prior quarter.As of December 31, our absolute shares outstanding were 519 million shares, down 8 million compared to the end of 2008. As Kevin noted, it is our intention to continue to execute on our buy back program as business and market conditions warrant. CapEx for the quarter totaled $40 million, and depreciation and amortization was $37 million consistent with prior quarters. DSO increased to 44 days from 41 reported in the third quarter, which is in line with our long-term model and typical for the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was up significantly to a record $754 million. Sequentially product deferred revenue was up 27% or a $51 million increase.Services deferred revenue increased by 13% or $60 million. Year-over-year, total deferred revenue balance increased by a notable $163 million or 28%, with product deferred revenue up 53% and services deferred revenue up 19%. Our deferred revenue profile reflects the broad range of customers with no one single customer representing a majority of the increase. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 7,231.Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. As Kevin noted, earlier, while we are always planning for multiple business scenarios, our expectations of the 2010 will be a growth year for Juniper. We also anticipate that the pace of economic recovery will vary by geography, but that overall, the economic environment will strengthen as we move throughout the year. As we entered the first quarter, we are mindful of the strong demand metrics that we posted in the December quarter and we're balancing that with the fact that many of our customers is still sitting their 2010 budget. So for the March quarter, with the midpoint of $895 million, our revenue range is $880 million to $910 million. We are expecting gross margins for Q1 to remain solid and within our long-term model of 66% to 68%. We intend to manage operating expenses essentially flat with the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, OpEx in Q1 include higher FICA taxes as well as the resumption of some of our variable compensation expenses.Operating margin for the first quarter will be down sequentially on a reduced revenue, but it will be at 21% plus or minus half a point. And as we progress throughout 2010, we anticipate operating margin expansion as revenue growth in the year-over-year basis. We remain committed to achieving our long-term operating margin targets on a sustainable basis. We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to range between $0.23 and $0.26. A note on the tax rate. The anticipated tax rate for the March quarter will be approximately 31%. This is due to the R&D tax credit not yet being approved. The impact of this higher tax rate on the March quarter EPS is approximately $0.02. Share count is expected to be flat compared to the fourth quarter.In summary, throughout 2009, we demonstrated good financial discipline, and we're able to show good expansion in operating margin. We managed our cost structure well within our anticipated revenue opportunity and at the same time, continued to deliver great innovation to the marketplace. As we look forward to 2010, we will continue to be prudent with our cost and we'll execute our investments in line with the market and economic recovery. With that, we look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day scheduled for February 23, where we will provide more detail in our strategic plans supporting the long-term growth of the company. I will now hand it over to the operator for questions."

I think we did have a very strong finish in 2004 in the fourth quarter when we saw good growth in both Routing and also Security and Switching and the Service Provider, and also we saw growth in Enterprise sector. So we are expecting sort of that range for the first quarter. And as you historically know, the first half of our year is about between 47% and 48% of total revenue for the year. If you go back over the last four or five years, that's been about the case. And then the second half of the year tends to be about 52% or 53%. So that is how we're looking at the year trends in terms of next year. We don't see any patent change in that. So we do expect the bigger second half than the first half.

And for us, in many ways, two things: Number one, mobile security. When you look at the marketplace, anytime you have an explosion of devices, ubiquitous use of devices, lots of applications and connectivity to the Internet, you start to open up the risks and concerns of malware and viruses and security issues. And so our SRX and the solutions that we have with SRX and JUNOS polls have seen a lot of activity in the area of mobility. The second thing then is with the announcement of the MX 3D, the fact that we've got the world's first universal edge router that can scale on three dimensions, whether it's traffic, number of users, or the number of services provided to the user. I think that's generating opportunity as well. Now certainly on the wireless side, traffic continues to grow, and people have to continue to manage and tune their networks, and so continued build-outs on the wireline side continue.

The first one that, as you saw the performance in Q4, this business has a lot of operating leverage opportunity in it. If we start driving revenue, the fact that we invest a dollar in R&D that can then be monetized in both the Service Provider sector and the Enterprise sector is a very powerful formula. And if we can accelerate revenue growth, there is a of operating margin expansion that we can drive. Now, as we're accelerating out of this downturn, obviously, if there are investments we can put in to further accelerate that growth in revenue, that's what's going to drive the most probability for shareholders. And so certainly, those investments may come near-term more in the form of sales and marketing to help us accelerate out of the downturn. Now long-term, certainly, keeping our eye on the R&D agenda, and we feel very good about the execution that we had in R&D in 2009. We feel very good about the decisions that we've made in terms of allocation of R&D resources in 2010. And so I think in many ways, we're going to execute against that R&D agenda in 2010 and the more we can accelerate, the operating leverage we're going to get. And your question of could this business, over the few years, can we get enough operating leverage and breakthrough rise above 25% operating margin? The answer is absolutely, it could. Our job right now today is to accelerate out of the downturn, and that is the strategy."

We're not trying to second-guess what we were seeing in terms of our demand indicators, pipeline, et cetera. And we also set our guidance in discussions with our customers as well, so that's what we do each quarter. We were pleasantly surprised in the fourth quarter in terms of the ramp of the Service Provider business, particularly in the U.S. We saw that's sort of pick-up a little bit faster than we were originally expecting. And the linearity was good and the pace of that was very good. And we expect that to continue although we think that things get off to a slower start in the first quarter, given January is the reset for a lot of our customers in terms of their new fiscal year, et cetera, just like it is for us. So that's really reflected in our guidance and in the range itself."

And so, I think in many ways, you look at that pattern of spending that started back when the macroeconomic situation was a -- lot more questions around it. I think today as our customers have worked through a lot of how they're planning through the economic downturn, the bigger question, right now, is whether or not, as they enter their fiscal year, they've landed and finalize their capital budgets and how much of that had been released? And I think that varies customer by customer. Certainly, when I look long term at the fundamentals of the networking industry, traffic volumes continue to grow, there's more users on more devices. There's more user scenarios in mobility and wireless, there's opportunities. Certainly, the earlier question was raised about optical and routing. There's a significant number of opportunities for us. And so I think in terms of putting the guidance together, as Robyn said, we looked and said that quarter-on-quarter, typically in the Enterprise sector, there is -- in enterprise spending, Q1 is a lower capital spend for enterprise customers in Q4. We're projecting our Enterprise business roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, and the one variable is the service providers. And so could that number be lower? Yes. Could it be higher? Sure. But I think based on our best roll-up from our field teams and our look at the business, I think we've offered a reasonable or realistic range of guidance."

First, looking at enterprise, 1% growth is actually -- looks pretty weak on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And I'm trying to reconcile that with some of the growth you had in the -- by the way, you sliced it on the product side, specifically. You mentioned that EX was $74 million, correct me if I'm wrong, which means that, by itself, contributed to 3% growth quarter-over-quarter, relative to a September. And that implies that every other product within enterprise was actually down quarter-to-quarter shipping into the Enterprise channel, unless you're shipping a lot of EX into the carrier channels. So if you can clarify how much of Ex is really going into carriers? And is it my interpretation, correctly -- that actually, your Enterprise business, excluding EX, was actually down quarter-over-quarter? And do you expect EX to maintain momentum into March? Could it be actually, just finally take a breather here and be down in March?"

First, as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today’s conference call. To access the slides please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. Also, we have included a full look in to our geographic revenue distribution in our slide deck. This call will be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website.
I'm also pleased to announce that starting today, you can follow Juniper IR on Twitter at BelaJNPR. Over the next few weeks, the IR group will be posting items to our corporate blogs and network ahead and we would of course love to hear your input on how best to use social media to communicate with you.
With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper’s business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation, and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today’s discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC.
For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today’s press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition related charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
In today’s call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are generally excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.
Please note that today’s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm.
With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.

Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth. On our January call and at the February Financial Analyst Meeting,",1383,"Thanks, Kathleen and thanks, everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth. On our January call and at the February Financial Analyst Meeting, we laid out a set of operating principles for the year. Primary among them is that we see 2010 as a year of growth. The performance we are reporting today reinforces our posture for growth and increases our conviction of that view as we look ahead.
The economic environment continues to evolve constructively for us overall and as we commented in the past, the pace and trajectory of the recovery will vary by geography. We continue to see the U.S. economic situation improving with Western Europe economic indicators somewhat less favorable than those of the U.S. Macroeconomic indicators in Asia remain strong with the exception of Japan. And at a global level, demand for high performance networking continues to grow and we are seeing good momentum in critical areas of the business. Particularly, with the traction we are gaining in new products and our efforts to expand routes to market.
In addition to driving growth, we are also evolving our internal processes, systems, and execution capability. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities presented by the transformation of the network and at the same time, we are strengthening our organization to best support our growth objectives, both near and long term. Our entire company has done a great job embracing this transformation, staying focused, and delivering financially for our shareholders.
I'll give more details on the actions we are taking internally, but first, let's take a look at the business environment, starting with the service provider market. After a very strong finish to Q4 of 2009, our outlook for the first quarter implied a slight quarter-on-quarter contraction of carrier spending. Our Q1 results was in line with that expectation. As we enter Q2, we are already seeing positive signs in the pipeline of U.S. carrier for the upcoming quarter and for the year.
We were also pleased to see the resumption in investments during the quarter by our content service provider customers. In short, we expect it to be a good year for service provider spending overall and our outlook supports that.
Now, this quarter, we continue to make progress in core routing as we secured five new customer wins for the TX Matrix Plus; we reaffirmed our leadership in 100-Gig Ethernet networking during a trial that covered a 1,000 mile, optically amplified section of the Verizon network; we announced advances in silicon that will enable customers to upgrade their existing T Series Core Routers to a system capacity of 4 terabits per second without service interruption.
We believe the combination of increased demand for core routing, share gains we observed in Q4 of 2009, innovation in 100-Gig Ethernet trial, advances in silicon, and new customer adoption of our TX Matrix Plus is positive signs for our business in core routing.
In the area of edge routing, we were pleased with the customer response to the MX 3D and we are seeing some strong early bookings of the dense 10-Gig Ethernet line card, as well as several beta trials of the low-end MX80.
We have expanded our solutions footprint into the areas of mobility and video. Mobility and video represent significant drivers of network expansion and they are areas that complement the MX 3D Edge Router and our Programmable Junos platform. For example, our Traffic Direct solution is running in production of early adopters and will be generally available to all customers this quarter. This solution is the first deliverable from Project Falcon and enables wireless operators to offload bulk data traffic directly to the Internet and migrate seamlessly to next-gen network architectures, including 4G.
We launched the Junos Space platform late last year to enable partners and customers to drive automation, reduce operating expenses, and better support high performance network. At the end of Q1, we had over 60 service providers executing trials of Junos Space.
We introduced our Mobile Secure solution that is tailored for the new world of anywhere, anytime, any device connectivity and we are pleased to note that Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T, have all expanded their infrastructure routing base to include the high-end SRX solution to secure mobile traffic.
At the Mobile World Congress, we also announced Junos Pulse, which is software to secure SSL VPN and user access control experience, running onboard a range of mobile devices, including notebooks, netbooks, smartphones, and feature phones. We expanded Junos Pulse to now run on Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and earlier this month, Apple announced the Secure Mobile capability as part of their iPhone OS 4 announcement.
In addition to our progress in mobility, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Ankeena Networks, which closed yesterday. This combination aligned with our strategy. First, their technology enables rich media content caching and distribution within the network, as well as smooth streaming of video to end-user devices. It also directly integrates with our MX 3D Edge Router solution. As a partner and Ankeena developed their technology in alignment with the Junos platform, we believe this strengthens our value proposition not only for edge routing, but it expands our addressable market now to include the iCDN solutions.
Second, we have a roadmap of additional media and content capabilities that leverage Junos, Junos Space, and potentially Junos Pulse that further transform the economics and user experience of video distribution and consumption.
Finally, as part of the Media Flow solution, our sales force has been working with Ankeena to develop an opportunity pipeline across a number of service providers. We believe this tuck-in acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem, expands our portfolio of edge routing solution, and delivers unique value to our customers. It also opens up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper, which in turn creates additional shareholder value.
Let me now shift to the enterprise market. We grew our enterprise business in 2009 and this quarter represented a great start to 2010. We are gaining traction in the enterprise because of our ability to deliver a portfolio of routing, switching, and security solutions. Our EX Switch portfolio continues to grow on a sequential and year-over-year basis.
We expanded the EX portfolio with EX2200, we achieved engineering milestones on the Stratus Project which advances our vision for how datacenters will be architected in the future, and our product portfolio continues to expand. This is fueling several landmark customer wins. One example in public sector is the U.S. Joint Forces Command where we are enabling a comprehensive, core-to-edge network for real-time training of Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel.
We continue to expand in the financial services sector as well. We recently announced our work with the Tokyo Stock Exchange to provide a low-latency, ultra-reliable, high-capacity network that supports its next-generation securities trading system. At the Agricultural Bank of China, we announced Juniper as the provider for their new nationwide backbone network. These are just a few examples of the opportunities we are winning in the enterprise.
We are seeing more opportunity for growth in the enterprise and we intend to ramp up in our engagement with the channel and our field and sales and marketing with a goal of further accelerating our market penetration of the EX and the enterprise solution portfolio.
From an operational perspective, we implemented several improvements in Q1 that strength our operational capability and support the growth agenda for the company. Specifically, we implemented a new field operating model with specific operating areas aligned by our service provider and enterprise sectors. This provides more line-of-sight visibility on execution and accountability at the field level.
We implemented a new customer relationship management system that supports our sales, marketing, and services execution engine, and we also created the Junos Ready Software business group to amplify our focus on software that leverages Junos, Junos Space, and Junos Pulse.
In summary, we have a clear strategy and it's working. We are building a foundation to drive disciplined execution and long-term growth at Juniper. We have a big opportunity and we are going after it.
Now, I'll turn it over to Robyn to tell you a little bit more about the numbers. Robyn?

We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010.

We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010. As a result of continued market position wins and solid execution, our revenue and gross margin came within our expected range, whilst operating margin and earnings per share came in above our forecasted ranges.
We continue to deliver strong performance in both the service provider and enterprise markets. As expected, service provider declined modestly, following an exceptional fourth quarter and showed good year-over-year growth. Our momentum in the enterprise continued to build with another record revenue quarter. Overall, our underlying demand indicators this quarter were healthy with another record deferred revenue quarter and a book-to-bill of approximately.
Now, onto a review of the numbers. As you read in the press release, we early adopted the new revenue accounting rules. For the purposes of today's discussion, all Q1 2010 results reflect these new rules. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the first quarter was $913 million. This is a 19% increase from the prior-year first quarter and a 3% decline from Q4 2009. The $913 million includes $25 million of recognized under the new revenue accounting. All of the $25 million related to orders that were booked and shipped during the quarter.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the first quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $0.01 loss per share in the prior-year first quarter. GAAP net income includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules of approximately $0.02 per share and a non-recurring income tax benefit of $54 million or $0.10 per share.
This relates to a change in the tax treatment of stock-based compensation in R&D cost sharing arrangements due to a federal appellate court ruling in the Xilinx case earlier this quarter - earlier in Q2 - during the quarter in Q1. We also recognized the final portion of the 2009 restructuring costs in the amount of $8.1 million or approximately $0.01 per share.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.27, an increase of $0.10 compared to the prior-year first quarter and down $0.05 sequentially. Looking more closely at revenue, I'll give you color on the regions, business segments, and markets and for additional detailed commentary, please refer to the slide deck.
Looking at our revenue by region, for the quarter, the Americas was approximately 53% of total revenue. EMEA was 29% and APAC was 18%. The Americas revenue increased 36% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. As anticipated, the sequential decline primarily reflects lower spending by certain U.S. carriers compared to an exceptionally strong Q4 2009. EMEA revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to strength in the U.K. and Germany.
APAC revenue declined 12% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially due to declines in Japan service provider. The rest of APAC grew 8% year-over-year with significant service provider design wins. Total APAC enterprise grew 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.
As we move throughout the year, we expect the geographical mix of revenues to fluctuate quarter to quarter in keeping our view that the pace of the economic recovery will vary by geography. Overall, we are planning for 2010 to be a growth year for Juniper.
On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $679 million was up about 20% year-over-year, driven by both net new customer wins and expansion in our current installed base, and down 2% sequentially. IPG saw growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis in MX products.
We are pleased with the strong customer acceptance of our recently launched MX 3D line cards, which continues to fuel the growth of our overall MX product platform. We also crossed a significant milestone achieving over $1 billion of revenue for the MX product line since it first shipped in Q1 of 2007, making it one of our fastest ramping product families to date.
We saw a continuing resumption of customer investment in the core and we are pleased with the performance of our TX Matrix Plus Series core routers. This performance reflects both existing projects and new design wins.
TX revenue grew to $77 million, more than double the revenue level of the prior-year quarter and a 4% sequential increase. The momentum we are seeing from our EX Switch business continues to drive good results as we expand our market penetration and build our installed base.
SLT delivered revenue of $234 million, which represents a 19% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 5% decrease sequentially. The increase was driven by growth in SRX, which contributed $60 million in product revenue. The SRX product line continues to gain traction and is now at an annual run rate of about $240 million.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 67% and enterprise revenue was 33% of total revenue. Service provider revenue was up 17% on a year-over-year basis and down 5% sequentially. We saw a resumption in spending content service providers globally, as well as regional North American carriers. This was the result of new design wins with new customers and expansion of projects with existing customers. We also saw reasonable growth in the European carrier.
Verizon was greater than 10% of our revenue for the quarter. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects, as well as new design wins. We are very pleased with our strong relationship with Verizon.
Enterprise revenue was up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. IPG was up 36% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. EX was up more than double year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. SLT was up 1% year-over-year and reported a seasonal decline of 10% sequentially. These results are a reflection of our ongoing go-to-market strategy and increased focus on our sales of routing, switching, and security into the enterprise. We saw good traction in the financial services, government, and health care markets.
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter were 67.6% of revenue, which is within our long-term model of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.3% of revenue, up from 67.6% in the first quarter of last year and up from 68.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement is the result of cost reduction and mix.
Service gross margins were 61% of revenues compared to 62.4% in the first quarter of last year and compared to 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This decline is the result of higher services cost, driven by increased headcount and higher space purchases to support the continued growth in the business.
Moving onto our operating expenses, for Q1, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $405 million or 44.4% of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter and slightly better than expected, operating expenses declined marginally. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased $23 million or 6%. Factors affecting Q1 expenses include new hires as we continue to invest in R&D, sales and services and seasonal factors including bonus accruals and the reset of the FICA taxes.
R&D expenses were $189 million or 20.7% of revenue, up $17 million compared to the fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $180 million or 19.7% of revenue, a $20 million decreased sequentially due to lower marketing expenses and a reduction in sales commissions. D&A expenses totaled $36 million or 4% of revenue, up slightly sequentially.
I'm pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, which was better than expected at 23.2%. This represents a 1.2-point sequential decline, which is primarily a function of revenue. These results, overall, reflect continued good execution against our operating principles and support our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation, customer focus, and operational excellence.
Looking at the operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26% compared to 19.7% in the first quarter of last year and 26.3% in the prior quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both TX and projects Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 15% compared to 6.6% in the first quarter of last year and 19.3% in the prior quarter. This sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower revenue and higher costs including costs related to the FICA.
Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $146 million for the quarter, up 60% year-over-year and down 16% sequentially. As we noted earlier, we recorded a non-recurring income tax benefit of $54 million, which resulted in a GAAP tax rate for the quarter being a benefit of 1.8%. As expected, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 30.6%, which was higher than last quarter due primarily to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with nearly $2.8 billion in total cash and investments. This balance was approximately up $108 million from the prior quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. For the first quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $258 million before the litigation settlement payment of $169 million.
In late February, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $27.04 per share or approximately $74 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter were approximately 537 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, roughly flat with the prior quarter.
CapEx for the quarter totaled $38 million and depreciation and amortization was $35 million, consistent with prior quarters. DSO was 40 days compared to 44 days reported in the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was a record $790 million. Product deferred revenue was up 71% or $104 million year-over-year and up 4% or approximately $9 million sequentially. Services deferred revenue increased 16% year-over-year or $74 million and 5% or approximately $27 million sequentially.
Even with the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules, we continue to defer product revenue for arrangements entered into prior to the beginning of the year and we will recognize those revenues under the old rules. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,453. The increases were in R&D, customer service, sales and marketing and are all aimed at supporting growth in the business.
Since the end of the first quarter, we announced and have now closed the acquisition of Ankeena Networks, the cash plus the assumption of outstanding equity awards. The Ankeena acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem and expands our portfolio of edge routing solutions and delivers unique value to our customers. It will also open up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper. Total cash consideration at closing was less than $100 million.
Now, let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the economic environment continues to improve. We also anticipate the continued resumption of spending by service providers in both the core and the edge and that we will continue the momentum we've established in the enterprise sector. These factors are increasing our conviction that 2010 will be a year of growth for the company.
As a result, we are expecting revenue for the June quarter of $950 million plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for the - for Q2 are expected to remain flat with the first quarter at approximately 67%. Operating expenses will increase modestly as we invest in sales and marketing and R&D to support growth in the business.
Operating margin for the second quarter will be approximately 23% plus or minus 50 basis points. We remain committed to achieving our long-term targets on a sustainable basis. This would result in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of between $0.27 to $0.29. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 31%. And guidance is prior to any acquisition related costs, which we expect to round up to $0.01 for Q2.
For the year, let me remind you of our operating principles. First, we assume the macroeconomic environment will continue to improve. We intend to accelerate out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery. We will continue to invest in innovations that deliver long-term value to our customers and we will drive year-over-year margin expansion by growing revenue faster than OpEx. And we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flow.
And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.

Europe was stronger and we delivered year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth in Europe.

And so, we still had a significant amount of revenue, but less than we had a year ago in Japan and then when you look, a lot of Asia-Pacific is in some of the emerging markets or is certainly strong GDP growth markets, China and India in particular. And I think we are making some progress in some of those areas and we've got work to do in other areas. And so, Asia-Pacific, I think, remains a big opportunity for us.

It's only new business with new - with customers that were transacted from the 1st of January onwards that the new rules apply.
And what that means in the future feature commitment area is that you still defer an amount of revenue, but the amount is commensurate with the value of those features as opposed to deferring the whole of the revenue amount.

In terms of the - in terms of margin impact of the $25 million, we - you do record the costs associated with that and you also record the expenses associated with that. So it's not a windfall in terms of the operating margin. In terms of the - I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of the customer profile and where that was. It was a non-U.S. service provider customer and it was a new deal, new piece of business with that customer. And it was the service provider customer and it booked and shipped in the quarter.

So the team executed very well.
As I mentioned in our guidance commentary, we are obviously very prudent with our expense management across the board. We've done a very good job on our cost structure over the last couple of years and we will continue to do that as we move forward through the growth that we are seeing. But we do need to invest modestly in incremental sales and marketing areas to make sure that we are capturing the demand opportunity that's out there. And we will do that prudently and as I said, we do expect an operating margin for Q2 in that 23%, plus or minus a half.

And in this particular case, the fact that Ankeena had developed intellectual property in an area, video, that is a significant growth and it complements edge routing, it made a lot of sense for us to go ahead and move forward with this acquisition.

The focus that we have really is on the value proposition we have, beginning in the datacenter with what I would characterize as an architectural transition or an architectural disruption that is unfolding in datacenters in the way they are architected where these mega datacenters just have massive numbers of servers and storage devices that need to be connected together.
And strategically, we have a view that traditional three-tiered architecture is collapsing to two-tiers, which we deliver today with our EX product family and with the Stratus Project, it will collapse further to a single tier. And in many ways, that architectural disruption is driving a significant amount of dialog and the design wins that we are getting with many of these large enterprise customers and I think that’s something independent of what else is going on in the competitive landscape. That's a unique aspect that we bring to the table and that is generating a lot of the dialog and demand that we are engaging on today.
The second area that we are seeing a significant amount of discussion with customers and landmark wins is in the area of branch and access where customers are looking to consolidate what typically would be multiple network appliances. And so with our low-end SRX in the branch, the fact that we could do routing, switching, security in a single system, single solution and with Junos as a platform, we continue to expand the range of solutions that are available that run on that system. And so that too is driving demand.
So from a competitive approach, we are very focused on what we refer to as the new network, which is what we believe is a unique approach that dramatically changes the way that customers deploy capital and enable solutions in a way that leads to better economics and better experiences for their users.

I think certainly we've done work to increase the, I'll call it the unaided awareness of Juniper's offerings in the enterprise, recognizing certainly that there are some very significant competitors with big technology names that are also competing in that space. But I think within our enterprise growth, sequentially this quarter we saw 11% growth in our EX Switch product line, selling to the enterprise.
You mentioned in Q4 we had a 1% growth in the enterprise. But we saw a 50% growth overall in our EX Switch revenue from Q3 to Q4. And much of that was driven by service providers that were investing in that switch solution for managed services for enterprise. So at the end of the day, sometimes the revenue whether it's delivered to a managed services solution or delivered to an on-premise enterprise customer can get landed in either enterprise or service provider.
But overall, I think that the proposition we have for enterprise datacenter computing and this new architectural paradigm is unique and it resonates with customers. I think the proposition that we have around Junos and automation through Junos Space allows customers to dramatically reduce the operating expenses associated with networking. And I think when it comes to unique solutions such as branch, we've got an integrated routing, switching, security platform at the SRX that does well.
And going forward, you say, what can we do -

So - and most specifically, between the top end and the midpoints or between the $20 million, between the $950 million and $970 million.

I would expect all of those product areas to grow sequentially in that guidance.
Now, certainly there is - the range of plus or minus $20 million means there is certainly some upside and some downside depending on timing. Most of that is timing of service provider orders. And so there could be some upside on the $950 million depending on the timing of those orders. Likewise, there could be some downside.

First of all, I think that anytime we've got a strong value proposition and certainly the architectural disruption in the datacenter and really transforming the architecture of datacenters of the future, I think that creates product pull across the product line, not just for the EX, but for our entire portfolio in the enterprise. And I think we are seeing that a bit today as we've seen growth in our MX, SRX, and EX product lines and a complete solution focused on enterprise customers. And I think the Stratus Project is just going to reinforce that and strengthen that.
So the answer to the - to your first question is yes. I think that creates - if we execute well on that, we've got a strong value proposition, which I believe we do. I think that creates more pull for the overall portfolio of offerings and solutions we have in the enterprise.
Your second question then is, do you - do we see this type of consolidation in mega datacenters and things affecting or impacting service providers and certainly if you look at the architecture of next-generation central offices and pops, certainly we think the architectural focus we have to help reduce the cost footprint and help those service providers consolidate some of those assets on a high performance network, that creates opportunity for us. And that opportunity does not require us to get into the access business. That's an opportunity that I think is very complementary to the access solutions that they have in place today.

Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. 
A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder, there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. Also, we have included a full look into our geographic revenue distribution in our slide deck. This call will also be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website. 
I'm also pleased to announce that starting today, you can follow Juniper IR on twitter at BelaJNPR. Over the next few weeks, the IR group will be posting items to our corporate blog, The Network Ahead. And we'd, of course, love to hear your input on how best to use social media to communicate with you.
With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirement of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variations in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q, which we file with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial result, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release.
In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges, which are generally excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. 
Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin."

Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth. On our January call and at the February financial analyst meetin",1381,"Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth. On our January call and at the February financial analyst meeting, we laid out a set of operating principles for the year. Primary among them is that we see 2010 as a year of growth. The performance we're reporting today reinforces our posture for growth and increases our conviction of that view as we look ahead. The economic environment continues to evolve constructively for us overall. And as we commented in the past, the pace and trajectory of the recovery will vary by geography.
We continue to see the U.S. economic situation improving, with Western Europe economic indicators somewhat less favorable than those of the U.S. Macroeconomic indicators in Asia remain strong, with the exception of Japan. And at a global level, demand for high-performance networking continues to grow, and we are seeing good momentum in critical areas of the business, particularly with the traction we're gaining in new products and our efforts to expand routes to market. 
In addition to driving growth, we are also evolving our internal processes, systems and execution capability. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities presented by the transformation of the network and at the same time, we are strengthening our organization to best support our growth objectives, both near and long term.
Our entire company has done a great job embracing this transformation, staying focused in delivering financially for our shareholders. I'll give more detail on the actions we're taking internally. But first, let's take a look at the business environment, starting with the service provider market.
After a very strong finish to Q4 2009, our outlook for the first quarter implied a slight quarter-on-quarter contraction of carrier spending. Our Q1 result was in line with that expectation. As we enter Q2, we are already seeing positive signs in the pipeline of U.S. carrier spending for the upcoming quarter and for the year. We were also pleased to see the resumption in investment during the quarter by our content service provider customers. In short, we expect it to be a good year for service provider spending overall, and our outlook supports that. 
Now this quarter, we continue to make progress in core routing as we secured five new customer wins for the TX Matrix Plus. We reaffirmed our leadership in 100 Gig Ethernet networking during a trial that covered 1,000-mile, optically-amplified section of the Verizon network. We announced advances in silicon that will enable customers to upgrade their existing T Series core routers to a system capacity or four terabits per second without service interruption. 
We believe the combination of increased demand for core routing, share gains we observed in Q4 of 2009, innovation in 100 Gig Ethernet trials, advances in silicon and new customer adoption of our TX Matrix Plus is positive signs for our business in core routing. In the area of edge routing, we were pleased with the customer response to the MX 3D, and we are seeing some strong early bookings of the dense 10-Gig Ethernet line cards, as well as several beta trials of the low-end MX80. 
We have expanded our solutions footprint into the areas of mobility and video. Mobility and video represent significant drivers of network expansion, and they are areas that complement the MX 3D edge router and our programmable Junos platform. For example, our traffic direct solution is running in production of early adopters and will be generally available to all customers this quarter. This solution is the first deliverable from Project Falcon and enables wireless operators to offload bulk data traffic directly to the Internet and migrate seamlessly to next-gen network architectures, including 4G.
We launched the Junos Space platform late last year to enable partners and customers to drive automation, reduce operating expenses and better support high-performance networks. At the end of Q1, we had over 60 service providers executing trials of Junos Space. 
We introduced our Mobile Secure Solution that is tailored for the new world of anywhere, anytime, any device connectivity. And we are pleased to note that Verizon, Sprint and AT&T have all expanded their infrastructure routing base to include the high-end SRX solution to secure mobile traffic. At the Mobile World Congress, we also announced Junos Pulse, which is software to secure SSL, VPN and user access control experience, running on board a range of mobile devices, including notebooks, net books, smartphones and future phones. We expanded Junos Pulse to now on Android, Symbian Windows phone, and earlier this month, Apple announced the secure mobile capability as part of their iPhone OS 4 announcement.
In addition to our progress in mobility, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Ankeena Networks, which closed yesterday. The combination aligns with our strategy. First, their technology enables rich media content caching and distribution within the network, as well as smooth streaming of video to end-user devices. It also directly integrates with our MX 3D edge router solution. As a partner, Ankeena developed their technology in alignment with the Junos platform. We believe this strengthens our value proposition, not only for edge routing, but it expands our addressable market now to include the iCDN solution.
Second, we have a road map of additional media and content capabilities that leverage Junos, Junos Space and potentially, Junos Pulse to further transform the economics and the user experience of video distribution and consumption. Finally, as part of the Media Flow Solution, our sales force has been working with Ankeena to develop an opportunity pipeline across a number of service providers. We believe this tuck-in acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem, spans our portfolio of edge routing solutions and delivers unique value to our customers. It also opens up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper, which in turn creates additional shareholder value.
Let me now shift to the enterprise market. We grew our Enterprise business in 2009, and this quarter represented a great start to 2010. We're gaining traction in the Enterprise because of our ability to deliver a portfolio of routing, switching and security solutions. 
Our EX Switch portfolio continues to grow on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We expanded the EX portfolio with the EX2200. We achieved engineering milestones on the Stratus Project, which advances our vision for how data centers will be architect-ed in the future, and our product portfolio continues to expand. This is fueling several landmark customer wins. One example in public sector is the U.S. Joint Forces Command, where we are enabling a comprehensive core to edge network for realtime training of Army, Navy and Air Force personnel.
We continued to expand in the financial services sector as well. We recently announced our work with the Tokyo Stock Exchange to provide a little latency, ultra-reliable, high-capacity network that supports its next-generation securities trading system. At the Agriculture Bank of China, we announced Juniper as a provider for their new nationwide backbone network. These are just a few examples of the opportunities we are winning in the enterprise. 
We're seeing more opportunities for growth in the enterprise and we intend to ramp up in our engagement with the channel and our field in sales and marketing, with a goal of further accelerating our market penetration of the EX and the Enterprise Solution portfolio.
From an operational perspective, we implemented several improvements in Q1 that strengthen our operational capability and support the growth agenda for the company. Specifically, we implemented a new field operating model, with specific operating areas aligned by our service provider in enterprise sectors. This provides more line-of-sight visibility on execution and accountability at the field level. We implemented a new customer relationship management system that supports our sales, marketing and services execution engine. And we also created the Junos Ready Software business group to amplify our focus on software that leverages Junos, Junos Space and Junos Pulse. 
In summary, we have a clear strategy and it's working. We are building a foundation to drive disciplined execution and long-term growth at Juniper. We have a big opportunity, and we're going after it. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to tell you a little bit more about the numbers. Robyn?"
30439,100425055,56787,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010. As a result of continued market position wins and solid execution, our revenue and gross margin came within our expected range, whils",2088,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010. As a result of continued market position wins and solid execution, our revenue and gross margin came within our expected range, whilst operating margin and earnings per share came in above our forecasted ranges. We continue to deliver strong performance in both the service provider and enterprise market. As expected, service provider declined modestly, following an exceptional fourth quarter and showed good year-over-year growth.
Our momentum in the enterprise continued to build, with another record revenue quarter. Overall, our underlying demand indicators this quarter were healthy, with another record deferred revenue quarter and a book-to-bill of approximately one. 
Now on to our review of the numbers. As you read in the press release, we early adopted the new revenue accounting rules. For the purposes of today's discussion, all Q1 2010 results reflect these new rules. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the first quarter was $913 million. This is a 19% increase from the prior year first quarter, and a 3% decline from Q4 2009. The $913 million includes $25 million of recognized under the new revenue accounting. All of the $25 million related to orders that were booked and shipped during the quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the first quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $0.01 loss per share in the prior-year first quarter. GAAP net income includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules of approximately $0.02 per share, and a non-recurring income tax benefit of $54 million or $0.10 per share. This relates to a change in the tax treatment of stock-based compensation in R&D cost sharing arrangements due to a federal appellate court ruling in the Xilinx case, during the quarter in Q1. We also recognized the final portion of the 2009 restructuring cost in the amount of $8.1 million or approximately $0.01 per share. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.27, an increase of $0.10 compared to the prior year first quarter, and down $0.05 sequentially. Looking more closely at revenue, I'll give you color on the regions, business segments and market. And for additional detailed commentary, please refer to the slide deck.
Looking at our revenue by region, for the quarter, the Americas was approximately 53% of total revenue, EMEA was $0.29 and APAC was 18%. The Americas revenue increased 36% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. As anticipated, the sequential decline primarily reflects lower spending by certain U.S. carriers compared to an exceptionally strong Q4 of 2009. EMEA revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to strength in the U.K. and Germany. APAC revenue declined 12% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially due to declines in Japan service provider. The rest of APAC grew 8% year-over-year, with insignificant service provider design wins. Total APAC enterprise grew 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.
As we move throughout the year, we expect the geographical mix of revenues to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, in keeping with our view that the pace of the economic recovery will vary by geography. Overall, we are planning for 2010 to be a growth year for Juniper.
On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $679 million was up about 20% year-over-year, driven by both net new customer wins and expansion in our current install base, and down 2% sequentially. IPG saw growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis in MX products. We are pleased with the strong customer acceptance of our recently-launched MX 3D line cards, which continues to fuel the growth of our overall MX product platform. 
We also crossed a significant milestone, achieving over $1 billion of revenue for the MX product line since it first shipped in Q1 of 2007, making it one of our fastest ramping product families to date. We saw a continuing resumption of customer investment in the core, and we are pleased with the performance of our TX Matrix Plus Series core routers. This performance reflects both existing projects and new design wins.
TX revenue grew to $77 million, more than double the revenue level of the prior-year quarter, and a 4% sequential increase. The momentum we're seeing from our EX Switch business continues to drive good results as we expand our market penetration and build our install base. 
SLT delivered revenue of $234 million, which represents a 19% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 5% decrease sequentially. The increase was driven by growth in SRX, which contributed $60 million in product revenue. The SRX product line continues to gain traction and is now at an annual run rate of about $240 million. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 67% and enterprise revenue was 33% of total revenue. Service provider revenue was up 17% on a year-over-year basis and down 5% sequentially.
We saw a resumption in spending in content service providers globally, as well as regional North American carriers. This was the result of new design wins with new customers and expansion of projects with existing customers. We also saw a reasonable growth in the European carriers.
Verizon was greater that 10% of our revenue for the quarter. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects, as well as new design wins. We are very pleased with our strong relationship with Verizon. 
Enterprise revenue was up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. IPG was up 36% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. EX was up more than double year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. SLT was up 1% year-over-year and reported a seasonal decline of 10% sequentially. These results were a reflection of our ongoing go-to-market strategy and increased focus on our sales of routing, switching and security into the enterprise. We saw good traction in the financial services, government and healthcare markets.
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.6% of revenue, which is within our long-term model of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.3% of revenue, up from 67.6% in the first quarter of last year and up from 68.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement is a result of cost reduction and mix. Service gross margins were 61% of revenues compared to 62.4% in the first quarter of last year, and compared to 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This decline is the result of higher services cost driven by increased headcount and highest bid purchases to support the continued growth in the business.
Moving on to our operating expenses, the Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $405 million or 44.4% of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter and slightly better than expected, operating expenses declined marginally. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased $23 million or 6%. Factors affecting Q1 expenses include new hires, as we continue to invest in R&D, sales and services, and seasonal factors including bonus accruals and the reset of the FICA taxes. 
R&D expenses were $189 million or 20.7% of revenue, up $17 million compared to the fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $180 million or 19.7% of revenue, a $20 million decrease sequentially due lower marketing expenses and a reduction in sales commissions.
G&A expenses totaled $36 million or 4% of revenue, up slightly sequentially. I'm pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, which was better than expected at 23.2%. This represents a 1.2 point sequential decline, which was primarily a function of revenue. These results, overall, reflect continued good execution against our operating principles and support our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation, customer focus and operational excellence.
Looking at the operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26% compared to 19.7% in the first quarter of last year and 26.3% in the prior quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 15% compared to 6.6% in the first quarter of last year and 19.3% in the prior quarter. This sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower revenue and higher costs, including costs related to the FICA.
Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $146 million for the quarter, up 60% year-over-year and down 16% sequentially. As we noted earlier, we recorded a nonrecurring income tax benefit of $54 million, which resulted in a GAAP tax rate for the quarter being a benefit of 1.8%. As expected, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 30.6%, which was higher than last quarter due primarily to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with nearly $2.8 billion in total cash and investments. This balance was up approximately $108 million from the prior quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. For the first quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $258 million before the litigation settlement payment of $169 million. 
In late February, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $27.04 per share or approximately $74 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter were approximately 537 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, roughly flat with the prior quarter. CapEx for the quarter totaled $38 million and depreciation and amortization was $35 million, consistent with prior quarters.
DSO was 40 days compared to 44 days reported in the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was a record $790 million. Product deferred revenue was up 71% or $104 million year-over-year and up 4% or approximately $9 million sequentially. Services deferred revenue increased 16% year-over-year or $74 million and 5% or approximately $27 million sequentially.
Even with the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules, we continue to defer product revenue for arrangements entered into prior to the beginning of the year, and we will recognize those revenues under the old rules. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,453, the increases were R&D, customer service, sales and marketing, and are all aimed at supporting growth in the business. 
Since the end of the first quarter, we announced and have now closed the acquisition of Ankeena Networks, the cash plus the assumption of outstanding equity awards. The Ankeena acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem and expands our portfolio of edge routing solution and delivers unique value to our customers. It will also open up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper. Total cash consideration at closing was less than $100 million.
Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the economic environment continues to improve. We also anticipate that continued resumption of spending by service providers in both the core and the edge, and that we will continue the momentum we've established in the enterprise sector. These factors are increasing our conviction that 2010 will be a year of growth for the company. 
As a result, we're expecting revenues for the June quarter of $950 million, plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for Q2 are expected to remain flat with the first quarter at approximately 67%. Operating expenses will increase modestly as we invest in sales and marketing and R&D to support growth in the business. Operating margin for the second quarter will be approximately 23%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We remain committed to achieving our long-term targets on a sustainable basis. 
This would result in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of between $0.27 to $0.29. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 31%. And guidance is prior to any acquisition-related costs, which we expect to round up to $0.01 for Q2.
For the full year, let me remind you of our operating principles. First, we assume new macro economic environment will continue to improve. We intend to accelerate out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery. We will continue to invest in innovations that deliver long-term value to our customers, and we will drive year-over-year margin expansion by growing revenue faster than OpEx. And we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flow. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

And in terms of the second question around deferred revenue balance, yes, we are pleased with the continued growth there in terms of the deferred revenue. As I just mentioned, anything that was under a deal that was -- we had a purchase order or a contract that the business was transacted prior to the end of last fiscal year is under the old rule. So even if we book and ship that in the quarter in Q1, it would still be deferred. In terms of the growth, I mentioned last quarter that it wasn't any one single customer that's driving that growth. It's a nice, healthy, diversified balance across a few customers."

The focused that we have really is on the value proposition we have beginning in the data center with what I would characterize as an architectural transition or an architectural disruption that is unfolding in data centers and the way they're architected, where these mega data centers just have massive numbers of servers and storage devices that need to be connected together. And strategically, we have a view that the traditional three-tiered architecture is collapsing to two tiers, which we delivered today with our EX product family. And with the Stratus project, it will collapse further to a single tier. And in many ways, that architectural disruption is driving a significant amount of dialog and the design wins that we're getting with many of these large enterprise customers. And I think that's something independent of what else is going on in the competitive landscape. That's a unique aspect that we bring to the table, and that is generating a lot of the dialog and demand that we're engaging on today. The second area that we're seeing a significant amount of discussion with customers and landmark wins is in the area of branch and access, where we our customers are looking to consolidate what typically would be multiple-network appliances. And so with our low-end SRX in the branch, the fact that we could do routing, switching, security in a single system, single solution, and with Junos as a platform, we continue to expand the range of solutions that are available that run on that system. And so that, too, is driving demand. So from a competitive approach, we're very focused on what we referred to as the new network, which is what we believe is a unique approach that dramatically changes the way that customers deploy capital and enable solutions in a way that leads to better economics and better experiences for their users."

I think certainly we've done work to increase the, I'll call it, the unaided awareness of Juniper's offerings in the enterprise, recognizing certainly that there are some very significant competitors with big technology names that are also competing in that space. But I think within our enterprise growth, sequentially, this quarter, we saw an 11% growth in our EX Switch product line, selling to the enterprise. You mentioned in Q4, we had a 1% growth in the enterprise, but we saw a 50% growth overall in our EX Switch revenue from Q3 to Q4, and much of that was driven by service providers that were investing in that switch solution for managed services for enterprise. So at the end of the day, sometimes, the revenue whether it's delivered through a managed services solution or delivered to an on-premise enterprise customer can get landed in either enterprise or service provider. But overall, I think the proposition we have for enterprise data center computing and this new architectural paradigm is unique and it resonates with customers. I think the proposition that we have around Junos and automation through Junos Space allows customers to dramatically reduce the operating expenses associated with networking. And I think when it comes to unique solutions such as branch, we've got an integrated routing, switching, security platform with the SRX that does well.

And so there could be some upside on the $950 million, depending on the timing of those orders. Likewise, there could be some downside.

And I think the Stratus project is just going to reinforce that and strengthen that. So the answer to your first question is yes, I think that creates -- if we execute well on that and we've got a strong value proposition, which I believe we do, I think that creates more pull for the overall portfolio of offerings and solutions we have in the enterprise. You're second question that is do we see this type of consolidation in mega data centers and things affecting or impacting service providers.

Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth.

Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth. On our January call and at the February financial analyst meeting, we laid out a set of operating principles for the year. Primary among them is that we see 2010 as a year of growth. The performance we're reporting today reinforces our posture for growth and increases our conviction of that view as we look ahead. The economic environment continues to evolve constructively for us overall. And as we commented in the past, the pace and trajectory of the recovery will vary by geography.
We continue to see the U.S. economic situation improving, with Western Europe economic indicators somewhat less favorable than those of the U.S. Macroeconomic indicators in Asia remain strong, with the exception of Japan. And at a global level, demand for high-performance networking continues to grow, and we are seeing good momentum in critical areas of the business, particularly with the traction we're gaining in new products and our efforts to expand routes to market. 
In addition to driving growth, we are also evolving our internal processes, systems and execution capability. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities presented by the transformation of the network and at the same time, we are strengthening our organization to best support our growth objectives, both near and long term.
Our entire company has done a great job embracing this transformation, staying focused in delivering financially for our shareholders. I'll give more detail on the actions we're taking internally. But first, let's take a look at the business environment, starting with the service provider market.
After a very strong finish to Q4 2009, our outlook for the first quarter implied a slight quarter-on-quarter contraction of carrier spending. Our Q1 result was in line with that expectation. As we enter Q2, we are already seeing positive signs in the pipeline of U.S. carrier spending for the upcoming quarter and for the year. We were also pleased to see the resumption in investment during the quarter by our content service provider customers. In short, we expect it to be a good year for service provider spending overall, and our outlook supports that. 
Now this quarter, we continue to make progress in core routing as we secured five new customer wins for the TX Matrix Plus. We reaffirmed our leadership in 100 Gig Ethernet networking during a trial that covered 1,000-mile, optically-amplified section of the Verizon network. We announced advances in silicon that will enable customers to upgrade their existing T Series core routers to a system capacity or four terabits per second without service interruption. 
We believe the combination of increased demand for core routing, share gains we observed in Q4 of 2009, innovation in 100 Gig Ethernet trials, advances in silicon and new customer adoption of our TX Matrix Plus is positive signs for our business in core routing. In the area of edge routing, we were pleased with the customer response to the MX 3D, and we are seeing some strong early bookings of the dense 10-Gig Ethernet line cards, as well as several beta trials of the low-end MX80. 
We have expanded our solutions footprint into the areas of mobility and video. Mobility and video represent significant drivers of network expansion, and they are areas that complement the MX 3D edge router and our programmable Junos platform. For example, our traffic direct solution is running in production of early adopters and will be generally available to all customers this quarter. This solution is the first deliverable from Project Falcon and enables wireless operators to offload bulk data traffic directly to the Internet and migrate seamlessly to next-gen network architectures, including 4G.
We launched the Junos Space platform late last year to enable partners and customers to drive automation, reduce operating expenses and better support high-performance networks. At the end of Q1, we had over 60 service providers executing trials of Junos Space. 
We introduced our Mobile Secure Solution that is tailored for the new world of anywhere, anytime, any device connectivity. And we are pleased to note that Verizon, Sprint and AT&T have all expanded their infrastructure routing base to include the high-end SRX solution to secure mobile traffic. At the Mobile World Congress, we also announced Junos Pulse, which is software to secure SSL, VPN and user access control experience, running on board a range of mobile devices, including notebooks, net books, smartphones and future phones. We expanded Junos Pulse to now on Android, Symbian Windows phone, and earlier this month, Apple announced the secure mobile capability as part of their iPhone OS 4 announcement.
In addition to our progress in mobility, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Ankeena Networks, which closed yesterday. The combination aligns with our strategy. First, their technology enables rich media content caching and distribution within the network, as well as smooth streaming of video to end-user devices. It also directly integrates with our MX 3D edge router solution. As a partner, Ankeena developed their technology in alignment with the Junos platform. We believe this strengthens our value proposition, not only for edge routing, but it expands our addressable market now to include the iCDN solution.
Second, we have a road map of additional media and content capabilities that leverage Junos, Junos Space and potentially, Junos Pulse that further transform the economics and the user experience of video distribution and consumption. Finally, as part of the Media Flow Solution, our sales force has been working with Ankeena to develop an opportunity pipeline across a number of service providers. We believe this tuck-in acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem, expands our portfolio of edge-routing solutions and delivers unique value to our customers. It also opens up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper, which in turn creates additional shareholder value.
Let me now shift to the enterprise market. We grew our Enterprise business in 2009, and this quarter represented a great start to 2010. We're gaining traction in the Enterprise because of our ability to deliver a portfolio of routing, switching and security solutions. 
Our EX Switch portfolio continues to grow on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We expanded the EX portfolio with the EX2200. We achieved engineering milestones on the Stratus Project, which advances our vision for how data centers will be architect-ed in the future, and our product portfolio continues to expand. This is fueling several landmark customer wins. One example in public sector is the U.S. Joint Forces Command, where we are enabling a comprehensive core to edge network for realtime training of Army, Navy and Air Force personnel.
We continued to expand in the financial services sector as well. We recently announced our work with the Tokyo Stock Exchange to provide a little-latency, ultra-reliable, high-capacity network that supports its next-generation securities trading system. At the Agricultural Bank of China, we announced Juniper as the provider for their new nationwide backbone network. These are just a few examples of the opportunities we are winning in the enterprise. 
We're seeing more opportunity for growth in the enterprise and we intend to ramp up in our engagement with the channel and our field in sales and marketing, with a goal of further accelerating our market penetration of the EX and the Enterprise Solution portfolio.
From an operational perspective, we implemented several improvements in Q1 that strengthen our operational capability and support the growth agenda for the company. Specifically, we implemented a new field operating model, with specific operating areas aligned by our service provider in enterprise sectors. This provides more line-of-sight visibility on execution and accountability at the field level. We implemented a new customer relationship management system that supports our sales, marketing and services execution engine. And we also created the Junos Ready Software business group to amplify our focus on software that leverages Junos, Junos Space and Junos Pulse. 
In summary, we have a clear strategy and it's working. We are building a foundation to drive disciplined execution and long-term growth at Juniper. We have a big opportunity, and we're going after it. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to tell you a little bit more about the numbers. Robyn?"

We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010.

We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010. As a result of continued market position wins and solid execution, our revenue and gross margin came within our expected range, whilst operating margins and earnings per share came in above our forecasted ranges. We continue to deliver strong performance in both the service provider and enterprise markets. As expected, service provider declined modestly, following an exceptional fourth quarter and showed good year-over-year growth.
Our momentum in the enterprise continued to build, with another record revenue quarter. Overall, our underlying demand indicators this quarter were healthy, with another record deferred revenue quarter and a book-to-bill of approximately one. 
Now on to our review of the numbers. As you read in the press release, we early adopted the new revenue accounting rules. For the purposes of today's discussion, all Q1 2010 results reflect these new rules. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the first quarter was $913 million. This is a 19% increase from the prior year first quarter, and a 3% decline from Q4 2009. The $913 million includes $25 million of recognized under the new revenue accounting. All of the $25 million related to orders that were booked and shipped during the quarter. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the first quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $0.01 loss per share in the prior-year first quarter. GAAP net income includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules of approximately $0.02 per share, and a non-recurring income tax benefit of $54 million or $0.10 per share. This relates to a change in the tax treatment of stock-based compensation in R&D cost sharing arrangements due to a federal appellate court ruling in the Xilinx case, during the quarter in Q1. We also recognized the final portion of the 2009 restructuring cost in the amount of $8.1 million or approximately $0.01 per share. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.27, an increase of $0.10 compared to the prior year first quarter, and down $0.05 sequentially. Looking more closely at revenue, I'll give you color on the regions, business segments and market. And for additional detailed commentary, please refer to the slide deck.
Looking at our revenue by region, for the quarter, the Americas was approximately 53% of total revenue, EMEA was $0.29 and APAC was 18%. The Americas revenue increased 36% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. As anticipated, the sequential decline primarily reflects lower spending by certain U.S. carriers compared to an exceptionally strong Q4 of 2009. EMEA revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to strength in the U.K. and Germany. APAC revenue declined 12% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially due to declines in Japan service provider. The rest of APAC grew 8% year-over-year, with insignificant service provider design wins. Total APAC enterprise grew 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.
As we move throughout the year, we expect the geographical mix of revenues to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, in keeping with our view that the pace of the economic recovery will vary by geography. Overall, we are planning for 2010 to be a growth year for Juniper.
On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $679 million was up about 20% year-over-year, driven by both net new customer wins and expansion in our current install base, and down 2% sequentially. IPG saw growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis in MX products. We are pleased with the strong customer acceptance of our recently-launched MX 3D line cards, which continues to fuel the growth of our overall MX product platform. 
We also crossed a significant milestone, achieving over $1 billion of revenue for the MX product line since it first shipped in Q1 of 2007, making it one of our fastest ramping product families to date. We saw a continuing resumption of customer investment in the core, and we are pleased with the performance of our TX Matrix Plus Series core routers. This performance reflects both existing projects and new design wins.
TX revenue grew to $77 million, more than double the revenue level of the prior-year quarter, and a 4% sequential increase. The momentum we're seeing from our EX Switch business continues to drive good results as we expand our market penetration and build our install base. 
SLT delivered revenue of $234 million, which represents a 19% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 5% decrease sequentially. The increase was driven by growth in SRX, which contributed $60 million in product revenue. The SRX product line continues to gain traction and is now at an annual run rate of about $240 million. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 67% and enterprise revenue was 33% of total revenue. Service provider revenue was up 17% on a year-over-year basis and down 5% sequentially.
We saw a resumption in spending in content service providers globally, as well as regional North American carriers. This was the result of new design wins with new customers and expansion of projects with existing customers. We also saw a reasonable growth in the European carriers.
Verizon was greater that 10% of our revenue for the quarter. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects, as well as new design wins. We are very pleased with our strong relationship with Verizon. 
Enterprise revenue was up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. IPG was up 36% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. EX was up more than double year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. SLT was up 1% year-over-year and reported a seasonal decline of 10% sequentially. These results were a reflection of our ongoing go-to-market strategy and increased focus on our sales of routing, switching and security into the enterprise. We saw good traction in the financial services, government and healthcare markets.
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.6% of revenue, which is within our long-term model of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.3% of revenue, up from 67.6% in the first quarter of last year and up from 68.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement is a result of cost reduction and mix. Service gross margins were 61% of revenues compared to 62.4% in the first quarter of last year, and compared to 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This decline is the result of higher services cost driven by increased headcount and highest bid purchases to support the continued growth in the business.
Moving on to our operating expenses, the Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $405 million or 44.4% of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter and slightly better than expected, operating expenses declined marginally. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased $23 million or 6%. Factors affecting Q1 expenses include new hires, as we continue to invest in R&D, sales and services, and seasonal factors including bonus accruals and the reset of the FICA taxes. 
R&D expenses were $189 million or 20.7% of revenue, up $17 million compared to the fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $180 million or 19.7% of revenue, a $20 million decrease sequentially due lower marketing expenses and a reduction in sales commissions.
G&A expenses totaled $36 million or 4% of revenue, up slightly sequentially. I'm pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, which was better than expected at 23.2%. This represents a 1.2 point sequential decline, which was primarily a function of revenue. These results, overall, reflect continued good execution against our operating principles and support our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation, customer focus and operational excellence.
Looking at the operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26% compared to 19.7% in the first quarter of last year and 26.3% in the prior quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 15% compared to 6.6% in the first quarter of last year and 19.3% in the prior quarter. This sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower revenue and higher costs, including costs related to the FICA.
Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $146 million for the quarter, up 60% year-over-year and down 16% sequentially. As we noted earlier, we recorded a nonrecurring income tax benefit of $54 million, which resulted in a GAAP tax rate for the quarter being a benefit of 1.8%. As expected, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 30.6%, which was higher than last quarter due primarily to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with nearly $2.8 billion in total cash and investments. This balance was up approximately $108 million from the prior quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. For the first quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $258 million before the litigation settlement payment of $169 million. 
In late February, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $27.04 per share or approximately $74 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter were approximately 537 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, roughly flat with the prior quarter. CapEx for the quarter totaled $38 million and depreciation and amortization was $35 million, consistent with prior quarters.
DSO was 40 days compared to 44 days reported in the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was a record $790 million. Product deferred revenue was up 71% or $104 million year-over-year and up 4% or approximately $9 million sequentially. Services deferred revenue increased 16% year-over-year or $74 million and 5% or approximately $27 million sequentially.
Even with the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules, we continue to defer product revenue for arrangements entered into prior to the beginning of the year, and we will recognize those revenues under the old rules. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,453, the increases were in R&D, customer service, sales and marketing, and are all aimed at supporting growth in the business. 
Since the end of the first quarter, we announced and have now closed the acquisition of Ankeena Networks, the cash plus the assumption of outstanding equity awards. The Ankeena acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem and expands our portfolio of edge routing solution and delivers unique value to our customers. It will also open up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper. Total cash consideration at closing was less than $100 million.
Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the economic environment continues to improve. We also anticipate the continued resumption of spending by service providers in both the core and the edge, and that we will continue the momentum we've established in the enterprise sector. These factors are increasing our conviction that 2010 will be a year of growth for the company. 
As a result, we're expecting revenues for the June quarter of $950 million, plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for Q2 are expected to remain flat with the first quarter at approximately 67%. Operating expenses will increase modestly as we invest in sales and marketing and R&D to support growth in the business. Operating margin for the second quarter will be approximately 23%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We remain committed to achieving our long-term targets on a sustainable basis. 
This would result in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of between $0.27 to $0.29. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 31%. And guidance is prior to any acquisition-related costs, which we expect to round up to $0.01 for Q2.
For the full year, let me remind you of our operating principles. First, we assume new macro economic environment will continue to improve. We intend to accelerate out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery. We will continue to invest in innovations that deliver long-term value to our customers, and we will drive year-over-year margin expansion by growing revenue faster than OpEx. And we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flow. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

And it was around the operating expenses. So the team performed very well. And despite the headwinds that we have in Q1 with the FICA reset and the expenses to do with that and obviously the resetting of bonus and commission plans as a result of the new fiscal year. So the team executed very well. As I mentioned in our guidance commentary, we're obviously very prudent with our expense management across the board. We've done a very good job on our cost structure over the last couple of years, and we will continue to do that as we move forward through the growth that we're seeing. But we do need to invest modestly in incremental sales and marketing areas to make sure that we are capturing the demand opportunity that's out there. And we'll do that prudently. And as I said, we do expect an operating margin for Q2 in that 23%, plus or minus a half."

The focused that we have really is on the value proposition we have beginning in the data center with what I would characterize as an architectural transition or an architectural disruption that is unfolding in data centers and the way they're architected, where these mega data centers just have massive numbers of servers and storage devices that need to be connected together. And strategically, we have a view that the traditional three-tiered architecture is collapsing to two tiers, which we delivered today with our EX product family. And with the Stratus project, it will collapse further to a single tier. And in many ways, that architectural disruption is driving a significant amount of dialog and the design wins that we're getting with many of these large enterprise customers. And I think that's something independent of what else is going on in the competitive landscape. That's a unique aspect that we bring to the table, and that is generating a lot of the dialog and demand that we're engaging on today. The second area that we're seeing a significant amount of discussion with customers and landmark wins is in the area of branch and access, where we our customers are looking to consolidate what typically would be multiple-network appliances. And so with our low-end SRX in the branch, the fact that we could do routing, switching, security in a single system, single solution, and with Junos as a platform, we continue to expand the range of solutions that are available that run on that system. And so that, too, is driving demand. So from a competitive approach, we're very focused on what we referred to as the new network, which is what we believe is a unique approach that dramatically changes the way that customers deploy capital and enable solutions in a way that leads to better economics and better experiences for their users."

I think certainly we've done work to increase the, I'll call it, the unaided awareness of Juniper's offerings in the enterprise, recognizing certainly that there are some very significant competitors with big technology names that are also competing in that space. But I think within our enterprise growth, sequentially, this quarter, we saw an 11% growth in our EX Switch product line, selling to the enterprise. You mentioned in Q4, we had a 1% growth in the enterprise, but we saw a 50% growth overall in our EX Switch revenue from Q3 to Q4, and much of that was driven by service providers that were investing in that switch solution for managed services for enterprise. So at the end of the day, sometimes, the revenue whether it's delivered through a managed services solution or delivered to an on-premise enterprise customer can get landed in either enterprise or service provider. But overall, I think the proposition we have for enterprise data center computing and this new architectural paradigm is unique and it resonates with customers. I think the proposition that we have around Junos and automation through Junos Space allows customers to dramatically reduce the operating expenses associated with networking.

And I think the Stratus project is just going to reinforce that and strengthen that. So the answer to your first question is yes, I think that creates -- if we execute well on that and we've got a strong value proposition, which I believe we do, I think that creates more pull for the overall portfolio of offerings and solutions we have in the enterprise. You're second question that is do we see this type of consolidation in mega data centers and things affecting or impacting service providers. And certainly, if you look at the architecture of next-generation central offices and pops, certainly, we think the architectural focus we have to help reduce the cost footprint and help those service providers consolidate some of those assets on a high-performance network, that creates opportunity for us.

Juniper had a strong second quarter, including record revenue and operating margin expansion. We're executing well against the 2010 operating principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we look towards",957,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper had a strong second quarter, including record revenue and operating margin expansion. We're executing well against the 2010 operating principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we look towards the second half of the year, we intend to drive our growth agenda and build momentum going into 2011.
I will comment briefly on the current business climate and some progress against our strategic agenda. I will then hand off to Robyn for more details on our results and guidance for Q3.
The global economy continues to recover, yet the pace and trajectory of that recovery varied by geography. A number of economists now expect global GDP to grow in the low mid to single digits this year. 
In this economic climate, we have seen growing demand for our products and services and we delivered growth in all three theaters: EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific. Economic recovery in Europe continues to lag and the sovereign debt situation in southern Europe added to concerns about the pace of recovery across Europe. The U.S. continues to show modest GDP growth, though experts continue to debate the pace of the recovery.
Asia continues to grow, yet economic recovery in Japan continues to lag. Global demand for networking is increasing as more traffic is being carried over the Internet. Computing is being centralized in massive data centers, and more people and businesses rely on digital devices connected to the network. 
Our investment in R&D and expanded routes to market support our growth agenda and position us well for spending cycle in some key scenarios, including mobility, video, security and cloud computing.
We continue to win deals globally as customers embrace our vision for the new network. Our business grew 24% year-on-year, with Service Provider growing 21% and Enterprise growing 31%. We are expanding our footprint with Service Providers, and we are pleased with the growing demand for our MX 3D edge routers and SRX security platforms. 
We had a number of key design wins this quarter, including a significant win at Verizon with the MX 3D and SRX. We saw increased growth in our Mobile Secure Solution, based on the SRX platform. And we released Traffic Direct, a mobility solution on the MX 3D.
We are on track for early trial of the second offering from the Falcon project, the Evolved Packet Core, at the end of this year. We completed the acquisition of Ankeena. And we are now securing design wins and generating revenue from both Traffic Direct and the Media Flow Solutions. 
We've made good progress globally in the Service Provider segment and I am particularly pleased with our growing relationship with large U.S.-based carriers and cable operators. For example, Comcast continues to expand its relationship with Juniper Networks, deploying Juniper's MX technology and T1600 core routers to support network expansion, including commercial and metro services. Comcast is also utilizing Juniper's EX Ethernet switches for scaling new services.
Relative to the Enterprise, we continue to make headwinds in the segment with an expanded portfolio of offerings. Our comprehensive portfolio of routing, switching and security, all running Junos, and our architectural approach for the data center is resonating with customers. During the quarter, we launched our next-generation data center architecture called 321 that enables customers to connect large numbers of data center servers and storage devices in a way that improved the economics and the performance of these massive data centers.
This is enabling growth in our EX business and positions us to expand momentum with our Stratus project. Our Stratus Project is on track. Earlier this year, we successfully completed first power on. We have fully verified the features in silicon, and we are now moving into the system test phase of the first wave of products coming from the Stratus Project. We expanded roster market in the Enterprise with partners, including IBM, large service providers and now Dell.
Dell began shipping their OEM version of Juniper products, all running Junos, later this month. We are also seeing growing Enterprise opportunity with service providers, who are delivering managed services and on-premise solutions. Both Verizon and AT&T are strong partners, with Verizon recently recognized by us as Partner of the Year at our annual Partner Summit. 
In the Asia Pacific region, NEC is proving to be a great partner in the Enterprise segment. These are a few examples of the growing set of partners that are participating in our Enterprise growth agenda.
We are fueling innovation with investment in organic R&D, complemented by an increased focus on M&A that creates customer and shareholder value. Our combination with Ankeena is representative of the type of acquisitions we expect to do more of. This will be combinations that are complementary to Junos and accelerate our vision for the new network. 
Looking ahead to the future, we maintain a positive outlook. Revenue momentum is expected to continue in the second half of the year. And we're positioned to take share in both the enterprise and service provider markets.
The foundation is in place, yet we are not taking anything for granted. We have to be focused. We have to execute and we have to stay true to our operating principles. We have very good competitors and the macroeconomic recovery continues to have some twists and turns. We are focused on those investments that deliver long-term customer and shareholder value, while at the same time managing our expenses diligently, maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating healthy cash flows. I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. 
And now, I'm going to turn it over to Robyn to dive into the financial results, as well as our outlook for the next quarter. Robyn?"

I'm pleased to report that as a result of strong execution across our business and continued focus on our operating principles, we delivered record revenue and near-record operating profits in the quarter, all about underlying demand metrics was strong. Book-to-bill was well in excess of 1. Our products deferred revenue balance is healthy and pipelines exiting the quarter are robust.
We also expanded operating margins, while continuing to invest in R&D, customer support and sales and marketing. We are well on track to delivering profitable growth in 2010 and making progress against our long-term revenue growth objective while expanding operating margin. 
I will provide more commentary on our outlook in a few moments. But first, as a reminder, all numbers include the Ankeena acquisition, which closed on April 19, 2010. We've seen increased customer demand to this technology, and we are very pleased with the way the integration is taking place.
Now a review of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the second quarter was $978 million, up 7% sequentially and up 24% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the second quarter, compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2010 and $0.03 per share in the prior year second quarter. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.30, an increase of $0.03 sequentially and up $0.11 compared to the prior-year second quarter. Let me now provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segments and markets.
One of our operating principles for the year was that we expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to strengthen throughout the year, and that the price of recovery of standing by our customers will vary by geography. This is proving to be the case thus far, and for the quarter we saw improved levels of spending in both EMEA and APAC, with strong demand indicated in all three regions in both the Enterprise and Service Provider market. 
Looking at our revenue by region. For the quarter, Americas was approximately 50% of total revenue, EMEA was 30% and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue increased 1% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. We saw strength in regional service providers, content and cable service providers in the U.S. And in Latin America and Canada, we saw a strong sequential in year-over-year growth.
EMEA revenue was up 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year due to strength in Western Europe, Russia and the Middle East. APAC revenue increased 22% sequentially and 19% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by Japan, Southeast Asia and greater China. From a pipeline perspective, we had significant design wins in Edge and Security with both wireline and wireless carriers in all three geographies. And in addition, we had core design wins in Japan and Southeast Asia. 
On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $720 million, up $0.06 sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was $92 million, up 20% sequentially. This includes product revenue of $88 million and was another strong proof point of our focused execution. 
MX had another strong quarter with product revenue of $149 million, up 7% sequentially. Included in this result is our first full quarter of revenue for the MX 3D at $24 million. This new product has generated increased customer interest and showcases our innovation agenda.
SLT delivered record total revenue of $258 million, which represents an increase of 10% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 23% sequentially to almost $75 million. We had good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the U.S., EMEA and APAC. 
Our strategy is investing in R&D, and our effectiveness in execution on our innovation roadmap has translated into significant revenue growth over the past year. Our most recent product lines, EX, MX and SRX, have generated impressive combined revenues of just over $1 billion in the last four quarters, an 89% growth since Q2 of '09. This is another proof point that our R&D growth agenda is hitting the mark with our customers.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue is up 5% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. This is due to a strong momentum in EX, MX and SRX and solid growth in key products. We now have 35 customers that will provide Juniper-powered managed services. More than double a year ago. This quarter, we saw good customer response with Traffic Direct, after its offering from Project Falcon, reporting our first revenue and a design win with a large mobile carrier in the Middle East. 
Enterprise revenue was up 12% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. This strong performance reflects our continued market penetration with our switching, routing and security portfolio. We expanded our switching and routing footprint in the financial services and government verticals.
For the quarter, Service Provider revenue was 63% and Enterprise revenue was 37% of total revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.9% of revenue, which is at the high end of our long-term target model range of 66% to 68%.
Product gross margins was 70.2% of revenue, up from 69.3% in the third quarter 2010. And this was due to better product mix and a decrease in manufacturing costs. Service gross margins were 59.3% of revenues, compared to 61% in the first quarter of 2010. This change was due to service mix and [indiscernible] (29:04) investments in our customer support organization.
Moving on to our operating expenses. For Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $431 million or 44% of revenue. Relative to the first quarter, operating expenses increased $26 million, a decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $62 million or $0.17 due to an increase in variable compensation and investments in new product development and expanding routes to market.
R&D expenses were $206 million or 21% of revenue, up $16 million compared to the first quarter. This was due to ramping up headcount and prototype expenses to support key projects, including Falcon and Stratus, which are in advanced stages of development, as well as R&D expense from the Ankeena acquisition. 
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $187 million or 19.1% of revenue, a $7 million increase sequentially. As we continue to invest in sales and marketing program to support our go-to-market plan. G&A expenses totaled $38 million or 3.9% of revenue.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 23.9%, an increase of 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects continued execution against our operating principle of managing expenses while strategically utilizing resources in key growth areas. I am pleased with our progress towards our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. 
Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 25.2% compared to 26% in the first quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus, as well as Falcon, are included within the IPG segment.
SLT operating margin was a record 20.4% compared to 15% in the first quarter. This is the first time we have broken through the 20% level and reflects a fabulous effort by the team. This is a result of efficient R&D execution on the product roadmap and aligning the sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth. 
Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $164 million for the quarter, up 12% sequentially and up 58% from year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was 30.2%.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. 
For the second quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $221 million. During the quarter, we also repurchased 6.5 million shares at an average cost of $27.33 per share or approximately $177 million. Our cash flow also reflects $64 million of net cash out in connection with the Ankeena Networks acquisition.
On a housekeeping note, we want to make investors aware that we intend to file a new universal shelf registration of $1.5 billion with the SEC in the next couple of weeks. This filing replaces our prior shelf, which has expired. The filing is consistent with our desire to maintain financial flexibility.
Our weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter were 539 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, up 2 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx, consistent with prior quarters, totaled $45 million and depreciation and amortization was $37 million. 
DSO improved to 36 days compared to 40 days in the first quarter and well within our normal historical range. Total deferred revenue was a healthy $768 million. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was down 5% or approximately $13 million. As a reminder, product deferred revenue is generally made up of two major elements: Channel revenue deferrals, including other sell-through revenues and future features of projects. For Q2 the future feature balance of deferred revenue was roughly flat with the first quarter.
Services deferred revenue decreased by 2% or approximately $9 million, which is typical for the fiscal second quarter. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,732, an increase of 279 from the first quarter. This increase was due to investment in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. We also added approximately 65 new employees from the Ankeena acquisition.
Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As we outlined at our financial Analyst Day in February, we are on a multi-year growth agenda. Our investments in R&D, our M&A strategy and our go-to-market plan are all aimed at delivering against our long-term model of 20% or higher revenue growth and 25% or higher operating margin. 
As we continue to execute on our operating principles for 2010, we are confident that for 2010, our top line growth will be consistent with our long-term model. For the September quarter, we are expecting revenue of $1.02 billion, plus or minus $20 million. 
Gross margins for the third quarter are expected to range between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to remain roughly flat as a percent of revenue, an increase on an actual basis. We will focus our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to support projects that are coming to market soon and to capture the market opportunities ahead. These investments are consistent with the plan we outlined at our financial analyst meeting earlier this year.
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 23.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, we remain committed to growing our revenues faster than our operating expenses, resulting in profitable growth for the company. This would result in the third quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.30 and $0.32 and assumes a flat share count and tax rate of approximately 31%.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We continue to make good progress on our long-term model objective, including revenue growth, improved operating margin and operational excellence. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda. We are confident of capturing the market opportunity ahead of us and delivering profitable growth in 2010. 
Now with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

The second question, Jess, was -- I'll paraphrase it as, ""Do we believe the 25% operating margin is a sustainable margin to achieve?"" And the answer is we do. As we outlined in the financial analyst meeting, we actually gave a range of R&D as a percent of revenue, sales and marketing as a percent of revenue and G&A as a percent of revenue. And that 25% operating margin was kind of in the center of those ranges. If you look at this quarter, R&D as a percentage of revenues is up about 21%, which is probably about two points higher than the high end that we outlined at the analyst meeting. And I think that's because we're in the core of some significant R&D on projects Stratus and the Falcon project, which are significant elements of our growth agenda going forward. So we believe that the investments we're making in R&D are clearly linked to our multi-year growth agenda. Yet getting the margin expansion and certainly sustaining it at the 25% or higher really is a function of us continuing to break through and get the scale economics, which you see us starting to get in the enterprise. And so, look, as we outlined at the analyst meeting, we still got strong conviction that, that is the multi-year plan that we're pursuing.

So in terms of the impact of the euro, as a reminder, because we're working through distributors and other partners throughout the world, we actually bill in U.S. dollars in Europe by and large. So at the moment, there is obviously no direct impact from the effect of the euro. Clearly, overtime, if the U.S. stays where it is, we're watching very closely in terms of competitive pressures or anything else in terms of euro, or also whether or not any of the credit crisis over there or sovereign debt actually has an impact on the business. In enterprise, we saw a little bit in terms of demand pausing, if you like, in some parts of Southern Europe. But in the rest of Europe, the business was very strong as you saw, so I was pleased with that. In terms of the accounting change, so as we expected, for the second quarter, the absolute dollar amount was up compared to the first quarter. We were expecting that in terms of what we recognize under the new accounting rules. But the comment that I made in terms of deferred revenue, the only piece that is fixed in terms of deferred revenue on the product side is the future feature area, and that was flat with the first quarter. So really, that piece on the balance sheet is solid. The piece that actually declined was the channel and other filter revenue, which is what you would expect to happen as the business environment improves."

I was in Europe a few weeks ago with a team calling on customers and visited several countries. And consistent with my comments, I think generally, the economic recovery in Europe is lagging, and it certainly is visible. That said, I think in the quarter, we demonstrated still some strong growth both in service provider and in enterprise segments. Southern Europe, when you look at the sovereign debt situation in Southern Europe, we did have evidence that showed some enterprise customers in Southern Europe where maybe being somewhat baffled or deferring some of their projects, which slowed our enterprise growth in Southern Europe. Our service provider growth though in Southern Europe maintained some strength and with some good relationships with customers and some new design wins there. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag in Southern Europe. Certainly, the question is if I think today, probably there are less concerns about what Europe's going to do about the sovereign debt crisis than there were a couple of months ago, so there's more certainty there. And hopefully, that translates to continued confidence and leads to more signs of economic recovery. That said, we continue to feel like we've got good relationships and a good pipeline on the Service Provider business. We continue to build our Enterprise business in Europe. Yet, I think the European economic situation, that too, should be flagged as a risk.

I think that in the Service Provider segment, certainly, the big trends and things we see are related to mobility and video.

That, combined with the fact that the MX 3D is programmable and the deliverables that we have for the Falcon project is something that, I think, is generating significant interest and dialogue with our customers. So consistent with what we outlined at the analyst meeting, it really is the Junos as a single operating system, programmable operating system running on our platform, but technologies is helping customers, not only change the economics through reducing the cost per bit, but also enabling new business models, and it's delivering a better user experience.

It aligns with not only the network infrastructure they have in place but their operational expertise in terms of running large infrastructure-related businesses. And so in our partnership with large service providers, we've got a very specific team and set of resources that are building those relationships with those service providers who are building a managed services business. And that relationship involves us sharing our architecture with them around data center, collapsing layers in the data center going from three to two and to one with Stratus. It involves our technology across routing, switching and security, all running Junos. That involves us helping them find efficient ways to manage the operating expenses using Junos Space. And it certainly also provides them capability to provide user secure SSL VPN with Junos Pulse. And so the relationship is very broad in terms of the product set. And on a consistent basis, these service providers see this as a growth opportunity for them. Your specific question is how many of these relate to security. Well, to have a successful managed services business, you have to have a secure environment or enterprise customers will not turn over their processing and data and connections to run in your managed services. So security is at the heart of being able to be in that business. Regarding the relationship with ADVA and the investment piece, at the analyst meeting, I think Stefan and Pradeep conducted a session where they sort of took you through a view of the role that we saw optical playing in packets switch, what we are looking at with our routing technology. And I think there are many, many players in optical out there and ADVA is one of them, and we're pleased to have a relationship with them. But it relates to the partnerships that we're building in optical as it helps shape our agenda for our routing technology and where that's going in the future."

Number one, I think the portfolio that we've assembled, routing, switching, security, running Junos, the role of Junos Space and the role of Junos Pulse, the data center architecture of 321, that value proposition is one that we are communicating more broadly to more enterprise customers and it's one that's resonating. Our job is to help make sure that we've done the right job on R&D to create the right solution set and that we create demand in the market. And that's what we've been very focused on doing. And in doing that, that creates more opportunity for our partners to then sell into that demand that we're creating, and as they do that creates more demand and more awareness. And so I think we are executing against our plan to continue to do that. I think that we continue to make good progress relative to that plan. My expectation is as we do that, we continue to reach a point where we hit a tipping point where then awareness hits a certain point and that demand creation part has taken place, and then there's just a lot of partners fulfilling opportunity. I don't think we've hit that tipping point yet, but I do think we're a step closer. I look at the design wins, I look at the level of dialogue we're having, I look at the energy behind our partners, I participated in the Americas Region Partner Summit this last quarter, and there's just a lot of energy from our partners: Dell, IBM, Verizon and many, many other partners on a global basis. So look, our long-term growth agenda, we've got to grow the Enterprise, I think, at the analyst meeting, we've got to grow our Enterprise segment 25% plus higher over this period to drive that.

But in terms of service provider, it was within the range that we gave you on the Q1 call. So in terms of headcount, yes, the headcount was up. The main areas, as we said, they're about at the 65 headcount as a result of Ankeena, approximately 65. And then the rest were primarily R&D for the projects that we've talked about in terms of R&D, plus customer service and support. So those are the three categories. There was a little bit in sales and marketing, but it was still mainly the other categories."

So in terms of other areas, yes, the MX 3D is a higher gross margin product for us. It's our silicone, our IP. So obviously, that contributes to favorable gross margin in terms of mix. In terms of structural areas, the operations team has been doing a very good job in terms of continuing, just grinding away at the cost. And as I mentioned at the financial analyst meeting, there are two sides to the equation on the gross margin side, and cost is definitely an area that the team's very focused on driving."

I think certainly, our investments in silicone, I think is significant in terms of the value it creates for customers and for shareholders. And that the value for customers is being able to solve these kinds of networking problems at scale that we think is unique, and that we have differentiated position in the market, which allows us to have higher gross margins in some of those areas. The second piece is we're building out software businesses. You asked the question of Media Flow and Falcon. If I look at Media Flow, that's a software business. If I look at Falcon, it's a software business. If I look at Junos Space, it's a software business. If I look at Junos Pulse, it's a Software business. These software businesses have much higher gross margins, certainly, than our Systems business. And we love our Systems business, but we're going to complement our Systems business with the Software business. Certainly, the revenue for Media Flow was immaterial this quarter, but over time, as we're successful building these software businesses, that should also be something that provides us some lift or ability to improve product gross margins as that mix shifts."

With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call, concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlooks, future financial operating results and overall future prospects, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results.

Juniper had a strong second quarter, including record revenue and operating margin expansion. We're executing well against the 2010 operating principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we look towards",957,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper had a strong second quarter, including record revenue and operating margin expansion. We're executing well against the 2010 operating principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we look towards the second half of the year, we intend to drive our growth agenda and build momentum going into 2011.
I will comment briefly on the current business climate and some progress against our strategic agenda. I will then hand off to Robyn for more details on our results and guidance for Q3.
The global economy continues to recover, yet the pace and trajectory of that recovery varied by geography. A number of economists now expect global GDP to grow in the low mid to single digits this year. 
In this economic climate, we have seen growing demand for our products and services and we delivered growth in all three theaters: EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific. Economic recovery in Europe continues to lag and the sovereign debt situation in southern Europe added to concerns about the pace of recovery across Europe. The U.S. continues to show modest GDP growth, though experts continue to debate the pace of the recovery.
Asia continues to grow, yet economic recovery in Japan continues to lag. Global demand for networking is increasing as more traffic is being carried over the Internet. Computing is being centralized in massive data centers, and more people and businesses rely on digital devices connected to the network. 
Our investment in R&D and expanded routes to market support our growth agenda and position us well for spending cycle in some key scenarios, including mobility, video, security and cloud computing.
We continue to win deals globally as customers embrace our vision for the new network. Our business grew 24% year-on-year, with Service Provider growing 21% and Enterprise growing 31%. We are expanding our footprint with Service Providers, and we are pleased with the growing demand for our MX 3D edge routers and SRX security platforms. 
We had a number of key design wins this quarter, including a significant win at Verizon with the MX 3D and SRX. We saw increased growth in our Mobile Secure Solution, based on the SRX platform. And we released Traffic Direct, a mobility solution on the MX 3D.
We are on track for early trial of the second offering from the Falcon project, the Evolved Packet Core, at the end of this year. We completed the acquisition of Ankeena. And we are now securing design wins and generating revenue from both Traffic Direct and the Media Flow Solutions. 
We've made good progress globally in the Service Provider segment and I am particularly pleased with our growing relationship with large U.S.-based carriers and cable operators. For example, Comcast continues to expand its relationship with Juniper Networks, deploying Juniper's MX technology and T1600 core routers to support network expansion, including commercial and metro services. Comcast is also utilizing Juniper's EX Ethernet switches for scaling new services.
Relative to the Enterprise, we continue to make headwinds in the segment with an expanded portfolio of offerings. Our comprehensive portfolio of routing, switching and security, all running Junos, and our architectural approach for the data center is resonating with customers. During the quarter, we launched our next-generation data center architecture called 321 that enables customers to connect large numbers of data center servers and storage devices in a way that improved the economics and the performance of these massive data centers.
This is enabling growth in our EX business and positions us to expand momentum with our Stratus Project. Our Stratus Project is on track. Earlier this year, we successfully completed first power on. We have fully verified the features in silicon, and we are now moving into the system test phase of the first wave of products coming from the Stratus Project. We expanded router market in the Enterprise with partners, including IBM, large service providers and now Dell.
Dell begin shipping their OEM version of Juniper products, all running Junos, later this month. We are also seeing growing Enterprise opportunity with service providers, who are delivering managed services and on-premise solutions. Both Verizon and AT&T are strong partners, with Verizon recently recognized by us as Partner of the Year at our annual Partner Summit. 
In the Asia Pacific region, NEC is proving to be a great partner in the Enterprise segment. These are a few examples of the growing set of partners that are participating in our Enterprise growth agenda.
We are fueling innovation with investment in organic R&D, complemented by an increased focus on M&A that creates customer and shareholder value. Our combination with Ankeena is representative of the type of acquisitions we expect to do more of. This will be combinations that are complementary to Junos and accelerate our vision for the new network. 
Looking ahead to the future, we maintain a positive outlook. Revenue momentum is expected to continue in the second half of the year. And we're positioned to take share in both the enterprise and service provider markets.
The foundation is in place, yet we are not taking anything for granted. We have to be focused. We have to execute and we have to stay true to our operating principles. We have very good competitors and the macroeconomic recovery continues to have some twists and turns. We are focused on those investments that deliver long-term customer and shareholder value, while at the same time managing our expenses diligently, maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating healthy cash flows. I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. 
And now, I'm going to turn it over to Robyn to dive into the financial results, as well as our outlook for the next quarter. Robyn?"

I'm pleased to report that as a result of strong execution across our business and continued focus on our operating principles, we delivered record revenue and near-record operating profits in the quarter, all of our underlying demand metrics was strong. Book-to-bill was well in excess of 1. Our products deferred revenue balance is healthy and pipelines exiting the quarter are robust.
We also expanded operating margins, while continuing to invest in R&D, customer support and sales and marketing. We are well on track to delivering profitable growth in 2010 and making progress against our long-term revenue growth objective while expanding operating margin. 
I will provide more commentary on our outlook in a few moments. But first, as a reminder, all numbers include the Ankeena acquisition, which closed on April 19, 2010. We've seen increased customer demand to this technology, and we are very pleased with the way the integration is taking place.
Now a review of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the second quarter was $978 million, up 7% sequentially and up 24% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the second quarter, compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2010 and $0.03 per share in the prior year second quarter. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.30, an increase of $0.03 sequentially and up $0.11 compared to the prior-year second quarter. Let me now provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segments and markets.
One of our operating principles for the year was that we expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to strengthen throughout the year, and that the price of recovery of standing by our customers will vary by geography. This is proving to be the case thus far, and for the quarter we saw improved levels of spending in both EMEA and APAC, with strong demand indicated in all three regions in both the Enterprise and Service Provider market. 
Looking at our revenue by region. For the quarter, Americas was approximately 50% of total revenue, EMEA was 30% and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue increased 1% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. We saw strength in regional service providers, content and cable service providers in the U.S. And in Latin America and Canada, we saw a strong sequential in year-over-year growth.
EMEA revenue was up 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year due to strength in Western Europe, Russia and the Middle East. APAC revenue increased 22% sequentially and 19% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by Japan, Southeast Asia and greater China. From a pipeline perspective, we had significant design wins in Edge and Security with both wireline and wireless carriers in all three geographies. And in addition, we had core design wins in Japan and Southeast Asia. 
On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $720 million, up $0.06 sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was $92 million, up 20% sequentially. This includes product revenue of $88 million and was another strong proof point of our focused execution. 
MX had another strong quarter with product revenue of $149 million, up 7% sequentially. Included in this result is our first full quarter of revenue for the MX 3D at $24 million. This new product has generated increased customer interest and showcases our innovation agenda.
SLT delivered record total revenue of $258 million, which represents an increase of 10% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 23% sequentially to almost $75 million. We had good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the U.S., EMEA and APAC. 
Our strategy is investing in R&D, and our effectiveness in execution on our innovation roadmap has translated into significant revenue growth over the past year. Our most recent product lines, EX, MX and SRX, have generated impressive combined revenues of just over $1 billion in the last four quarters, an 89% growth since Q2 of '09. This is another proof point that our R&D growth agenda is hitting the mark with our customers.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue is up 5% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. This is due to a strong momentum in EX, MX and SRX and solid growth in key products. We now have 35 customers that will provide Juniper-powered managed services. More than double a year ago. This quarter, we saw good customer response with Traffic Direct, after its offering from Project Falcon, reporting our first revenue and a design win with a large mobile carrier in the Middle East. 
Enterprise revenue was up 12% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. This strong performance reflects our continued market penetration with our switching, routing and security portfolio. We expanded our switching and routing footprint in the financial services and government verticals.
For the quarter, Service Provider revenue was 63% and Enterprise revenue was 37% of total revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.9% of revenue, which is at the high end of our long-term target model range of 66% to 68%.
Product gross margins was 70.2% of revenue, up from 69.3% in the third quarter 2010. And this was due to better product mix and a decrease in manufacturing costs. Service gross margins were 59.3% of revenues, compared to 61% in the first quarter of 2010. This change was due to service mix and [indiscernible] (29:04) investments in our customer support organization.
Moving on to our operating expenses. For Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $431 million or 44% of revenue. Relative to the first quarter, operating expenses increased $26 million, a decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $62 million or $0.17 due to an increase in variable compensation and investments in new product development and expanding routes to market.
R&D expenses were $206 million or 21% of revenue, up $16 million compared to the first quarter. This was due to ramping up headcount and prototype expenses to support key projects, including Falcon and Stratus, which are in advanced stages of development, as well as R&D expense from the Ankeena acquisition. 
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $187 million or 19.1% of revenue, a $7 million increase sequentially. As we continue to invest in sales and marketing program to support our go-to-market plan. G&A expenses totaled $38 million or 3.9% of revenue.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 23.9%, an increase of 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects continued execution against our operating principle of managing expenses while strategically utilizing resources in key growth areas. I am pleased with our progress towards our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. 
Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 25.2% compared to 26% in the first quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus, as well as Falcon, are included within the IPG segment.
SLT operating margin was a record 20.4% compared to 15% in the first quarter. This is the first time we have broken through the 20% level and reflects a fabulous effort by the team. This is a result of efficient R&D execution on the product roadmap and aligning the sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth. 
Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $164 million for the quarter, up 12% sequentially and up 58% from year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was 30.2%.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. 
For the second quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $221 million. During the quarter, we also repurchased 6.5 million shares at an average cost of $27.33 per share or approximately $177 million. Our cash flow also reflects $64 million of net cash out in connection with the Ankeena Networks acquisition.
On a housekeeping note, we want to make investors aware that we intend to file a new universal shelf registration of $1.5 billion with the SEC in the next couple of weeks. This filing replaces our prior shelf, which has expired. The filing is consistent with our desire to maintain financial flexibility.
Our weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter were 539 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, up 2 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx, consistent with prior quarters, totaled $45 million and depreciation and amortization was $37 million. 
DSO improved to 36 days compared to 40 days in the first quarter and well within our normal historical range. Total deferred revenue was a healthy $768 million. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was down 5% or approximately $13 million. As a reminder, product deferred revenue is generally made up of two major elements: Channel revenue deferrals, including other sell-through revenues and future features of projects. For Q2 the future feature balance of deferred revenue was roughly flat with the first quarter.
Services deferred revenue decreased by 2% or approximately $9 million, which is typical for the fiscal second quarter. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,732, an increase of 279 from the first quarter. This increase was due to investment in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. We also added approximately 65 new employees from the Ankeena acquisition.
Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As we outlined at our financial Analyst Day in February, we are on a multi-year growth agenda. Our investments in R&D, our M&A strategy and our go-to-market plan are all aimed at delivering against our long-term model of 20% or higher revenue growth and 25% or higher operating margin. 
As we continue to execute on our operating principles for 2010, we are confident that for 2010, our top line growth will be consistent with our long-term model. For the September quarter, we are expecting revenue of $1.02 billion, plus or minus $20 million. 
Gross margins for the third quarter are expected to range between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to remain roughly flat as a percent of revenue, an increase on an actual basis. We will focus our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to support projects that are coming to market soon and to capture the market opportunities ahead. These investments are consistent with the plan we outlined at our financial analyst meeting earlier this year.
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 23.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, we remain committed to growing our revenues faster than our operating expenses, resulting in profitable growth for the company. This would result in the third quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.30 and $0.32 and assumes a flat share count and tax rate of approximately 31%.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We continue to make good progress on our long-term model objective, including revenue growth, improved operating margin and operational excellence. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda. We are confident of capturing the market opportunity ahead of us and delivering profitable growth in 2010. 
Now with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

The second question, Jess, was -- I'll paraphrase it as, ""Do we believe the 25% operating margin is a sustainable margin to achieve?"" And the answer is we do. As we outlined in the financial analyst meeting, we actually gave a range of R&D as a percent of revenue, sales and marketing as a percent of revenue and G&A as a percent of revenue. And that 25% operating margin was kind of in the center of those ranges. If you look at this quarter, R&D as a percentage of revenues is up about 21%, which is probably about two points higher than the high end that we outlined at the analyst meeting. And I think that's because we're in the core of some significant R&D on projects Stratus and the Falcon project, which are significant elements of our growth agenda going forward. So we believe that the investments we're making in R&D are clearly linked to our multi-year growth agenda. Yet getting the margin expansion and certainly sustaining it at the 25% or higher really is a function of us continuing to break through and get the scale economics, which you see us starting to get in the enterprise. And so, look, as we outlined at the analyst meeting, we still got strong conviction that, that is the multi-year plan that we're pursuing. We think 25% or higher operating margins are certainly achievable and sustainable."

Clearly, overtime, if the U.S. stays where it is, we're watching very closely in terms of competitive pressures or anything else in terms of euro, or also whether or not any of the credit crisis over there or sovereign debt actually has an impact on the business. In enterprise, we saw a little bit in terms of demand pausing, if you like, in some parts of Southern Europe. But in the rest of Europe, the business was very strong as you saw, so I was pleased with that. In terms of the accounting change, so as we expected, for the second quarter, the absolute dollar amount was up compared to the first quarter. We were expecting that in terms of what we recognize under the new accounting rules. But the comment that I made in terms of deferred revenue, the only piece that is fixed in terms of deferred revenue on the product side is the future feature area, and that was flat with the first quarter. So really, that piece on the balance sheet is solid. The piece that actually declined was the channel and other filter revenue, which is what you would expect to happen as the business environment improves."

I was in Europe a few weeks ago with a team calling on customers and visited several countries. And consistent with my comments, I think generally, the economic recovery in Europe is lagging, and it certainly is visible. That said, I think in the quarter, we demonstrated still some strong growth both in service provider and in enterprise segments. Southern Europe, when you look at the sovereign debt situation in Southern Europe, we did have evidence that showed some enterprise customers in Southern Europe where maybe being somewhat baffled or deferring some of their projects, which slowed our enterprise growth in Southern Europe. Our service provider growth though in Southern Europe maintained some strength and with some good relationships with customers and some new design wins there. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag in Southern Europe. Certainly, the question is if I think today, probably there are less concerns about what Europe's going to do about the sovereign debt crisis than there were a couple of months ago, so there's more certainty there. And hopefully, that translates to continued confidence and leads to more signs of economic recovery. That said, we continue to feel like we've got good relationships and a good pipeline on the Service Provider business. We continue to build our Enterprise business in Europe. Yet, I think the European economic situation, that too, should be flagged as a risk.

I think that in the Service Provider segment, certainly, the big trends and things we see are related to mobility and video.

That combined with the progress that we're making with MX 3D as a unified edge router for both fixed and mobile and the fact that many service providers architecturally are looking to converge those networks to where they're carrying that Internet traffic on a single network. That, combined with the fact that the MX 3D is programmable and the deliverables that we have for the Falcon project is something that, I think, is generating significant interest and dialogue with our customers. So consistent with what we outlined at the analyst meeting, it really is the Junos as a single operating system, programmable operating system running on our platform, but technologies is helping customers, not only change the economics through reducing the cost per bit, but also enabling new business models, and it's delivering a better user experience.

There's just more of these digital devices driving demand for mobile Internet. That's a very consistent perspective on a global basis. And so number one, we're working with these wireless providers to really help to understand their roadmap in terms of how they're enabling solutions and the ability to carry that traffic economically and provide a great experience for their customer base, and that's number one.

It aligns with not only the network infrastructure they have in place but their operational expertise in terms of running large infrastructure-related businesses. And so in our partnership with large service providers, we've got a very specific team and set of resources that are building those relationships with those service providers who are building a managed services business. And that relationship involves us sharing our architecture with them around data center, collapsing layers in the data center going from three to two and to one with Stratus. It involves our technology across routing, switching and security, all running Junos. That involves us helping them find efficient ways to manage the operating expenses using Junos Space. And it certainly also provides them capability to provide user secure SSL VPN with Junos Pulse. And so the relationship is very broad in terms of the product set. And on a consistent basis, these service providers see this as a growth opportunity for them. Your specific question is how many of these relate to security. Well, to have a successful managed services business, you have to have a secure environment or enterprise customers will not turn over their processing and data and connections to run in your managed services. So security is at the heart of being able to be in that business. Regarding the relationship with ADVA and the investment piece, at the analyst meeting, I think Stefan and Pradeep conducted a session where they sort of took you through a view of the role that we saw optical playing in packets switch, what we are looking at with our routing technology. And I think there are many, many players in optical out there and ADVA is one of them, and we're pleased to have a relationship with them. But it relates to the partnerships that we're building in optical as it helps shape our agenda for our routing technology and where that's going in the future."

Number one, I think the portfolio that we've assembled, routing, switching, security, running Junos, the role of Junos Space and the role of Junos Pulse, the data center architecture of 321, that value proposition is one that we are communicating more broadly to more enterprise customers and it's one that's resonating. Our job is to help make sure that we've done the right job on R&D to create the right solution set and that we create demand in the market. And that's what we've been very focused on doing. And in doing that, that creates more opportunity for our partners to then sell into that demand that we're creating, and as they do, that creates more demand and more awareness. And so I think we are executing against our plan to continue to do that. I think that we continue to make good progress relative to that plan. My expectation is as we do that, we continue to reach a point where we hit a tipping point where then awareness hits a certain point and that demand creation part has taken place, and then there's just a lot of partners fulfilling opportunity. I don't think we've hit that tipping point yet, but I do think we're a step closer. I look at the design wins, I look at the level of dialogue we're having, I look at the energy behind our partners, I participated in the Americas Region Partner Summit this last quarter, and there's just a lot of energy from our partners: Dell, IBM, Verizon and many, many other partners on a global basis. So look, our long-term growth agenda, we've got to grow the Enterprise, I think, at the analyst meeting, we've got to grow our Enterprise segment 25% plus CAGR over this period to drive that.

Certainly, the revenue for Media Flow was immaterial this quarter, but over time, as we're successful building these software businesses, that should also be something that provides us some lift or ability to improve product gross margins as that mix shifts."

So but net-net in the quarter, I want to be very clear, that part was flat. So there was no reduction in the deferred revenue associated with future features, even though the right at which we were putting it on was at a lower percentage of the total deal.

With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and the acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release.
In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis with the revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.

30439,114113657,80273,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kathleen. Welcome, everyone. Juniper delivered another quarter with greater than 20% year-on-year growth.

Juniper delivered another quarter with greater than 20% year-on-year growth. We ended the quarter with record revenue of just over $1 billion, exceptionally strong bookings and substantial growth and backlog. Frankly, because of the robust, overall demand environment and the strength in bookings, we could have done better from a revenue perspective. The third quarter is typically one in which orders come in very late in the quarter, and this was certainly the case. In addition, our latest MX 3D offering ramped faster than expected this quarter, and it took us longer than it should have to adequately support the supply requirements in light of the order mix. Robyn will add insights on the order linearity and how the December quarter is shaping up in a few moments. 
From a macro economic perspective, we have been consistent in our view that while we see a recovery underway, the pace and trajectory of the recovery is likely to vary by geography. Our view has not changed. Over the past few months, there have been a level of uncertainty about the strength of the economy given certain economic indicators. We continue to expect the economic recovery will be slow. The near-term signals we're getting from economic data whether it is GDP growth, consumer spending, manufacturing data or job growth all support a view that there will be bumps along the way. And while we won't be immune to all of them, we are highly confident in our strategy and our ability to strengthen our position in an industry with solid long-term fundamentals.
From a customer segment perspective, I'm very encouraged by the conversations I'm having with our large service provider customers. It is clear that their visibility and their confidence are high as they move toward the end of the year, and that's reflected in our outlook. As I've said a number of times recently, history shows the U.S. service providers typically spend over half their CapEx budgets in the second half of the calendar year. We expect that to be the case again in 2010, and we have significant opportunities in each of the markets we address. As I've noted on past calls, we continue to make net new inroads in many of our traditional service provider markets and continue to increase our relevance by expanding our total presence within their networks.
Outside the U.S., service provider customers are also increasing investment as they build up their current and next-generation networks. We're very pleased to have been awarded a significant contract with China mobile to supply our T Series core routers with our IP network. This was a major win for us during the quarter and underscores our strong market position within core routing. Also in Q3, we shipped the industry's first 100 gig ethernet interfaces that are IP and .pls capable. 
Our Enterprise business continues to grow. Our focus on solutions for the virtualized data center is paying off with more design wins. Our Enterprise business grew year-on-year in all three theaters. Our U.S. Federal business is typically strong in Q3 while some business move into the fourth quarter due to passage of a budget continuation measure by the U.S. Congress. 
Alliances are a key element of our growth strategy. Strong alliances enable us to extend our reach, increase our market velocity, enable new solutions for our customers. We recently announced the we entered into an agreement with Dell, and I'm pleased to note this new alliance is off to a good start. We continue to grow our relationship with IBM and other key alliance partners including Nokia Siemens Networks and Ericsson. Our emphasis on developing joint technology solutions as well as integrated marketing programs speak to the commitment we make to the success of both our alliance partners and our customers.
Juniper is executing well against the operating principles we laid out at the beginning of the year. We continue to drive an innovation agenda and, we have been disciplined and focused in our R&D investments. Our vision for the new network is centered on two significant market trends: mobile Internet and cloud computing. 
Let's start with a discussion on our focus on mobile Internet. Last October, we announced in MX 3D edge platform, and we continue to see increased service provider demand for this platform. Project Falcon continues to hit its milestones, and we expect to have our initial of all packet core solution in customer trial by the end of this year. As a reminder, Project Falcon addresses the of all packet core with software designed to run on the Junos Space MX 3D edge platform. Our Traffic Direct solution which was released in Q2 also runs on the Junos Space MX 3D edge platform. With the explosion of smartphones and tablet devices connected to the Internet, the MX 3D and Project Falcon are addressing a key aspect of scaling the wireless networks in support of the mobile Internet. 
Security is also a critical element of the mobile Internet. Our Mobile Secure Solution built on the Junos Space SRX product line is finding strong customer adoption globally. We have extended our security focus with Junos Pulse and the recent acquisition of SMobile. In addition to secure access for corporate data, Junos Pulse now offers antivirus, anti-malware, parental control and device policy in support of securing the mobile Internet. We have an event planned for later this month with additional information related to this offering.
With regards to the opportunity we see in cloud computing, we announced our architectural approach to data centers of the future with our three-to-one architecture. We continue to focus on data center design wins with our EX product line and the Stratus project continues to hit milestones for providing a single-tier data center fabric solution in 2011. The Stratus project is entering a critical testing and early customer adoption phase this quarter.
In support of our solutions for mobile Internet and cloud computing, we are beginning to add key sales and marketing resources ahead of several planned launches in 2011. But the growing strength of our product portfolio, we are investing with a disciplined approach in the specialty sales forces that drive design wins and revenue. Strategically, we are making progress expanding the portfolio of products and solutions aligned with the mobile Internet and cloud computing trends. Operationally, we continue to execute the principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. We are in a position for 2010 top line growth in excess of 20%. On a full year basis, we have managed our OpEx to grow slower than revenue, and we have taken immediate actions to improve order linearity during the quarter, as well as ensure we're fully prepared for the strong demand we see for our new products. The pace and trajectory of the economy will continue to vary as this economic recovery unfolds. We do see a strong Q4 ahead, and we are positioning for the opportunities we see in 2011. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to discuss our financial results and our outlook for the quarter. Robyn?"

I am pleased that we executed through our operating principles and exited the quarter with strong momentum. Demand for our products remained high and revenue and EPS came within our guidance range. Given the strong bookings in the quarter, revenue could have been higher.
Revenue for the quarter was impacted by demand for MX 3D, exceeding our internal supply forecast, and as a result not all orders were able to be fulfilled during the quarter. In addition, many orders came in late in the quarter as is typical for Q3, reducing our ability to obtain more supply. We've already increased our ongoing supply forecast. We exited the quarter with a set of robust demand metric. Book-to-bill with well in excess of one. Product backlog at the end of Q3 stood at approximately $325 million, up significantly from $260 million in the prior quarter. We also ended the quarter with a strong deferred revenue balance. Now, a review of the numbers.
As a reminder, all results include the SMobile acquisition, which closed on July 30, 2010. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the third quarter was a record $1,012,000,000, up 3% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.25 for the third quarter compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2010 and $0.16 per share in the prior year third quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.32, an increase of $0.02 sequentially and $0.09 compared to the prior year third quarter. This includes OpEx related to both the Ankeena and SMobile acquisitions of slightly less than $0.01 per share. Now let me provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segments and market.
We've been consistent in our view that the macro economic environment will continue to strengthen throughout the year and that the pace and trajectory of recovery will vary by geography. In Q3, we continue to see some of this variation in global recovery play out. 
Looking at our revenue by region for the quarter, Americas was approximately 53% of total revenue, EMEA was 27% and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue saw good growth and increased $0.08 sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven by content, cable and regional service providers in the U.S. EMEA revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. We saw sequential declines in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, while Western Europe, especially the U.K., Netherlands and France were stronger. APAC revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by China, South Korea and Australia.
From a pipeline perspective, we had design wins across our entire product portfolio in all three geographies. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $744 million, up 3% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was a record $102 million, up 10% sequentially and up over 100% year-over-year. This includes product revenue of $97 million and highlights our continued momentum in the enterprise market. Our new 10 gig EX2500 switch, which began shipping in Q2 is gaining excellent traction with data center and campus customers.
MX had another record quarter with total product revenue of $176 million, up 18% sequentially and 73% year-over-year. The MX 3D saw an exceptionally strong ramp in demand with $87 million of orders and $63 million of revenue. We are pleased with the ramp of MX 3D platform. 
During the quarter, we also had significant design wins with our T Series core products at several large service providers including China mobile. Traffic Direct, our third offering from Project Falcon, recorded another key win. This time in a major European service provider. SLT delivered record revenue of $268 million, up 4% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 13% sequentially to $84 million. We saw good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the U.S. and here in APAC. 
In addition, we are  seeing good customer engagement for products from the SMobile acquisition as part of our Junos Pulse offering. Overall, we continue to deliver great innovation to our customers as evidenced by the success of EX, MX and SRX product families. This quarter, the three product families generated a record combined product revenue of $357 million, up 15% sequentially and 96% year-over-year.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was up 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. This was due to solid growth in S routing and high-end firewall products. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in our content and cable service providers as well as new design wins with several social network customers.
Enterprise revenue was up 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our continued penetration in enterprise switching and branch firewall products. The third quarter is typically a strong one for our U.S. federal rages. This year, however, as a result of the Congress continuing resolution late in the quarter, some anticipated business shifted into Q4. 
From a pipeline perspective, during the quarter, we had key data center design wins in government, retail and financial services. Consistent with Q2, service provider was 63% and enterprise was 37% of total revenue.
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.5% of revenue, which is at the high end of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.5% of revenue, down slightly from 70.2% in the prior quarter mainly due to product mix. Services gross margin was 60.1% of revenue up slightly from 59.3% in the second quarter of 2010.
Moving on to our operating expenses. In Q3, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $439 million or 43.4% of revenue. Relative to the second quarter, operating expenses increased by $8 million, a decrease as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $62 million or 16% due to an increase in variable compensation and investment in new product development, acquisitions and expanding mark-to-market.  As a percent of revenue however, operating expenses was down significantly from 45.8% to Q3 of last year.
R&D expenses were $212 million or 20.9% of revenue, up $6 million compared to the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $191 million or 18.9% of revenue, a $4 million increase sequentially. G&A expenses totaled $36 million or 3.6% of revenue, down $2 million from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 24.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially. We continue to     execute against our operating principle of managing expenses carefully while focusing our investment in key strategic growth areas, and I am confident of reaching our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher on a sustained basis. 
Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 24.2% compared to 25.2% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was another record at 24.1% compared to 20.4% in the second quarter. This reflects the continued focus by the team to execute efficiently on the R&D roadmap and aligning Falcon marketing resources to drive revenue growth.
Turning to the bottom line. Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $172 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 40% year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.4%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30%. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter but as a reminder, during the quarter, we paid $69 million of net cash in connection with the SMobile acquisition. 
DSO was 42 days in the third quarter compared to 36 in the second quarter, well within our range of 35 to 45 days. This increase was due to the timing of shipments and in addition cash flow from operations was $131 million, down $90 million from the prior quarter as a result of timing of cash receipts relative to the accounts receivable balance.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $26.81 per share or approximately $135 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was 535 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, down 4 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx totaled $54 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to investments in R&D lab equipment. Depreciation and amortization consistent with prior quarters was approximately $40 million.
Total deferred revenue was $785 million. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was up 9% or $21 million. For Q3, both the channel inventory and future feature proportions of product-deferred revenue were up from the prior quarter. Typical for the third quarter, services-deferred revenue decreased marginally by 1% or $4 million. We ended the quarter with headcount of 8,104 employees, an increase of 372 from the second quarter. This increase was due to investments in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. Included in total headcount are approximately 27 new employees from the SMobile acquisition.
Now  let's  turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. We continue to focus on executing against our operating principles, and we are well on track to achieving 20% or higher revenue growth in 2010. And therefore, for Q4, we are expecting revenues of $1,120,000,000, plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to be slightly lower as a percentage of revenue, an increase on a dollar basis. Operating margins for the fourth quarter are expected to range between 24.5%, plus or minus half a point. This would result in fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.35 and $0.37 and a flat share count, tax rate of 30% and includes $0.01 of OpEx from our recent acquisition.
In summary, under them, indicators are strong. Our product portfolio is robust, and we are focused on executing against the market opportunity ahead of us. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda. And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

So if you look at our overall MX revenue, it was strong in the quarter, $176 million up from about $145 million, an 18% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue. What we saw during the quarter was very good strength in the ramp of MX 3D as a proportion of the total. We're expecting a big quarter in the next in total but we saw an increasing proportion of MX 3D orders as a total of MX orders that were coming in, and then actually accelerated in the last three to four weeks of the quarter. And so the type of customers are quite broad. We actually saw demand across all geographies in the service provider landscape in terms of the MX 3D. We think very good design wins. We obviously feel quite a number of those in the quarter. So it's a broad-based increase and overall level of MX and a higher proportion of MX 3D in the quarter. If you go back -- we called out the number last quarter. We called out $24 million our revenue for MX 3D last quarter, the total 145. This quarter as I said, we had bookings of 87, so more than 3x as much in the quarter and we tripled the amount of revenue as we did last quarter."

The MX 3D, as you're aware, is designed with the trio chipset that allows it to scale on three dimensions. It could scale on traffic volumes, it can scale on a number of subscribers or users and it can scale in a number of services provided. And as a result, we're finding MX 3D as a platform that's engaged in a wide number of scenarios. Certainly Traffic Direct and the winds that we've have had there, MX 3D is a platform for that. For content distribution networks and what we're doing with the Ankeena acquisition and the Media Flow offering, it's a platform for content distribution networks. We're finding customers using it where they're connecting data centers, connecting the clouds with the MX 3D. So there's not one common, or one single pattern of scenarios. It's actually getting broad adoption across a wide range of scenarios which reinforces, I guess, the design point that we have behind the product."

But all up, that group of partners are basically, their revenue growth year-on-year is a bit more than double what we've seen in our own revenue growth. So they're helping drive a larger portion of our revenue for us with our focus on those four strategic partners, and IBM's included in that. You asked specifically about the OEM relationship. The overall IBM relationship, whether it's reselling Juniper products or selling the IBM-branded version of Juniper products, that overall relationship continues to grow year-on-year. The OEM element of that though is moving slower. So the bulk of what IBM is doing is still resell  of Juniper product, which is fine with us obviously. But I think the key points are that our overall strategic alliances are continuing to help grow and help us drive revenue. Number two, IBM is a key part of that. They are growing as well and your specific question in OEM, we're seeing most of the growth of IBM being in traditional reselling versus the OEM version of the product."

Number one, we compete in a large addressable market and if you take just for example, ethernet switching and the fact that we surpassed out 2% market share, we just keep driving and taking market share. That's such a large addressable market that for us to continue to grow in that one gives us plenty of headroom for growth. Number two, we've expand the product portfolio. And if you look at going into 2011 with the progress that we've made on our Stratus project for our data center fabric, the progress we're making with Falcon for our mobile packet core, we've got an event later this month around Junos Pulse to share some new announcements and things we're doing there. That expands our opportunities, the work we're doing with Junos Space. And we've complemented that with some M&A and Ankeena and how that translates to the Media Flow Solution that we have for content distribution network, SMobile and how that's being integrated into features of Junos Pulse. So I think the large addressable market, the expanded product portfolio and the fact that we're complementing our organic R&D with some of these targeted M&A tuck-ins, I think those three things I think are all key to us delivering on this multiyear growth agenda that Robyn outlined.

And so it's important when you look at the work that we've done to establish the install base that we have of MX, that all becomes addressable platform for us for the Falcon offerings that are coming to market. I don't have a specific number on the number of customers that are running MX or MX 3D, but I think clearly the fact that just this quarter, we more than tripled the shipments of the MX 3D versus last quarter as just an indicator of the continued increased demand. And I think my comments earlier on the fact that there's a wide range of scenarios that those customers are running it in, which is also reflective of the fact it's a wide range of customers that are running it. The key area to think about though for mobile Internet and the focus is as these smartphones continue to grow and the amount of traffic delivered to these smartphones continues to just explode and transition from 3G to LTE, that is the sweet spot for what we targeted Falcon in the MX 3D for, and that's where we're going to be laser focused with our go-to-market efforts."

First, as a reminder, there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the “IR” section of our website at juniper.net. This call will also be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website.
With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, as a result of certain factors including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending; the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion; we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release.
In general, non-GAAP results excludes certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis with the exception of revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate.
Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm.
With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.

We ended the quarter with record revenue of just over $1 billion, exceptionally strong bookings and substantial growth in backlog. Frankly, because of the robust overall demand environment and the strength in bookings, we could have done better from a revenue perspective.
The third quarter is typically one in which orders come in very late in the quarter and this was certainly the case. In addition, our latest MX 3D offering ramped faster than expected this quarter, and it took us longer than it should have to adequately support the supply requirements in light of the order mix.
Robyn will add some insights on the order linearity and how the December quarter is shaping up in a few moments. From a macroeconomic perspective, we have been consistent in our view that while we see a recovery underway the pace and trajectory of the recovery is likely to vary by geography. Our view has not changed.
Over the past few months there have been a level of uncertainty about the strength of the economy given certain economic indicators. We continue to expect the economic recovery will be slow. The near-term signals we are getting from economic data, whether it is GDP growth, consumer spending, manufacturing data or job growth all support a view that there will be bumps along the way. While we won't be immune to all of them, we are highly confident in our strategy and our ability to strengthen our position in an industry with solid long-term fundamentals.
From a customer segment perspective, I am very encouraged by the conversations I am having with our large service provider customers. It is clear that their visibility and their confidence are high as they move towards the end of the year, and that's reflected in our outlook. As I have said a number of times recently, history shows that US service providers typically spend over half their CapEx budgets in the second half of the calendar year, we expect that to be the case again in 2010 and we have significant opportunities in each of the markets we address.
As I have noted on past calls, we continue to make net new inroads in many of our traditional service provider markets and continue to increase our relevance by expanding our total presence within their networks. Outside the US, service provider customers are also increasing investment as they build out their current and next-generation networks. We are very pleased to have been awarded a significant contract with China Mobile to supply our T Series Core Routers for their IP network. This was a major win for us during the quarter and underscores our strong market position within core routing.
Also in Q3, we shipped the industry's first 100 gig Ethernet interfaces that are IP/MPLS capable. Our enterprise business continues to grow. Our focus on solutions for the virtualized data center is paying off with more design wins. Our enterprise business grew year-on-year in all three theaters.
Our US Federal business is typically strong in Q3; saw some business move into the fourth quarter due to the passage of a budget continuation measure by the US congress. Alliances are key element of our growth strategy. Strong alliances enable us to extend our reach, increase our market velocity enable new solutions for our customers. We recently announced that we entered into an agreement with Dell and I am pleased to note that this new alliance is off to a good start.
We continue to grow our relationship with IBM and other key alliance partners including Nokia Siemens Networks and Ericsson. Our emphasis on developing joint technology solution as well as integrated marketing programs speak to the commitments we make to the success of both our alliance partners and our customers.
Juniper is executing well against the operating principles we have laid out at the beginning of the year. We continue to drive in innovation agenda and we have been disciplined and focused in our R&D investments. Our vision to the new network is centered on two significant market trends, mobile Internet and cloud computing. We will start with the discussion on our focus on mobile Internet.
Last October, we announced the MX 3D Edge platform and we continue to see increased service provider demand for this platform. Project Falcon continues to hit its milestones and we expect to have our initial Evolved Packet Core solution in customer trial by the end of this year. As a reminder, Project Falcon addresses the Evolved Packet Core was software designed to run on the Junos Space MX 3D Edge platform.
Our Traffic Direct solution, which was released in Q2, also runs on the Junos Space MX 3D Edge platform. With the explosion of smartphones and tablet devices connected to the Internet, the MX 3D and Project Falcon are addressing a key aspect of scaling the wireless networks in support of the mobile Internet.
Security is also a critical element of the mobile Internet. Our mobile secured solution built on the Junos Space SRX product line is finding strong customer adoption globally. We have extended our security focus with Junos Pulse and the recent acquisition of SMobile. In addition to secure access for corporate data, Junos Pulse now offers anti-virus, anti-malware, parental controls, and device policy in support of securing the mobile Internet. We have an event planned for later this month with additional information related to this offering.
With regards to the opportunity we see in cloud computing, we announced our architectural approach to data centers of the future with our 3-2-1 architecture. We continue to focus on data center design wins with our EX product line and the Stratus Project continues to hit milestones for providing a single tier data center fabric solution in 2011. The Stratus Project is entering a critical testing and early customer adoption phase this quarter.
In support of our solutions for mobile internet and cloud computing, we are beginning to add key sales and marketing resources ahead of several planned launches in 2011. With the growing strength of our product portfolio, we are investing with disciplined approach in the specialty sales forces that drive design wins and revenue.
Strategically, we are making progress, expanding the portfolio of products and solutions aligned with the mobile internet and cloud computing trends. Operationally, we continue to execute the principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. We are positioned for 2010 top line growth in excess of 20%. On a full year basis, we have managed our OpEx to grow slower than revenues and we have taken immediate actions to improve order linearity during the quarter as well as ensuring we are fully prepared for the strong demand we see for our new products. The pace and trajectory of the economy will continue to vary as this economic recovery unfolds. We do see a strong Q4 ahead, and we are positioning for the opportunities we see in 2011.
Now, I will turn it over to Robyn to discuss our financial results and our outlook for the quarter. Robyn?

I am pleased that we executed through our operating principles and exited the quarter with strong momentum. Demand for our products remained high and revenue and EPS came within our guidance range.
Given the strong bookings in the quarter, revenue could have been higher. Revenues for the quarter was impacted by demand for MX 3D exceeding our internal supply forecast, and as a result not all orders were able to be fulfilled during the quarter. In addition, many orders came in late in the quarter as is typical to Q3, reducing our ability to obtain more supply. We have already increased our ongoing supply forecast.
We exited the quarter with a set of robust demand metric. Book-to-bill was well in excess of one. Product backlog at the end of Q3 stood at approximately $325 million, up significantly from $260 million in the prior quarter. We also ended the quarter with a strong deferred revenue balance.
Review of the numbers. As a reminder, all results include the SMobile acquisition, which closed on July 30, 2010. On a GAAP basis, total revenues for the third quarter was a record $1.12 billion, up 3% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.25 for the third quarter compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2010 and $0.16 per share in the prior year third quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.32, an increase of $0.02 sequentially and $0.09 compared to the prior year third quarter. This includes OpEx related to both the Ankeena and SMobile acquisitions of slightly less than $0.01 per share.
Now, let me provide you with some color on revenue by regions, business segment, and markets. We have been consistent in our view that the macroeconomic environment will continue to strengthen throughout the year and that the pace and trajectory of recovery will vary by geography. In Q3, we continued to see some of this variation in global recovery play out.
Looking at our revenue by region, for the quarter, Americas was approximately 53% of total revenues. EMEA was 27%, and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue saw good growth and increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven by content, cable and regional service providers in the US. EMEA revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. We saw sequential declines in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, while Western Europe, especially the UK, Netherlands and France were stronger. APAC revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by China, South Korea and Australia. 
From a pipeline perspective, we had design wins across our entire product portfolio and all three geographies. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $744 million, up 3% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was a record $102 million, up 10% sequentially and up over a 100% year-over-year. This includes product revenue of $97 million and highlights our continued momentum in the enterprise switching market. Our new 10-Gig EX4500 switch, which began shipping in Q2, is gaining excellent traction with data centre and campus customers.
MX had another record quarter with total product revenue of $176 million, up 18% sequentially and 73% year-over-year. The MX 3D saw an exceptionally strong ramp in demand with $87 million of orders and $63 million of revenues. We are pleased with the ramp of MX 3D platform. During the quarter, we also had significant design wins for the T Series Core products at several large service providers, including China Mobile.
Traffic Direct, our first offering from Project Falcon recorded another key win this time at a major European service provider. SLT delivered record revenue of $268 million, up 4% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 13% sequentially to $84 million. We saw good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the US, EMEA, and APAC. In addition, we are seeing good customer engagement for products from the SMobile acquisition as part our Junos Pulse offerings.
Overall, we continue to deliver great innovation to our customers as evidenced by the success of EX, MX and SRX product families. This quarter the three product families generated record combined product revenue of $357 million, up 15% sequentially and 96% year-over-year.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was up 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. This was due to solid growth in Edge Routing and High-End Firewall products. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in our content and cable service providers as well as new design wins with several social network customers. Enterprise revenue was up 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our continued penetration in Enterprise Switching and Branch Firewall products.
The third quarter is typically a stronger one for our US Federal region. This year, however, as a result of the congress continuing resolution late in the quarter some anticipated business shifted into Q4. From a pipeline perspective, during the quarter, we had key datacenter design wins in government, retail and financial services. Consistent with Q2, service provider was 63% and enterprise was 37% of total revenues.
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.5% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.5% of revenue, down slightly from 70.2% in the prior quarter, mainly due to product mix. Services gross margins were 60.1% of revenue, up slightly from 59.3% in the second quarter of 2010.
Moving onto our operating expenses, the Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $439 million or 43.4% of revenues. Relative to the second quarter, operating expenses increased by $8 million, but decreased as a percentage of revenues. Year-over-year operating expenses were up $62 million or 16% due to an increase in variable compensation and investments in new product development, acquisitions and expanding routes to market. As a percent of revenue however, operating expenses are down significantly from 45.8% for Q3 of last year.
R&D expenses were $212 million or 20.9% of revenue up $6 million compared to the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled to $191 million or 18.9% of revenue a $4 million increase sequentially. D&A expenses totaled $36 million or 3.6% of revenues, down $2 million from the prior quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 24.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially. We continue to execute against our operating principle of managing expense carefully, while focusing our investments in key strategic growth areas and I am confident of reaching our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher on a sustained basis.
Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 24.2% compared to 25.2% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was another record at 24.1% compared to 20.4% in the second quarter. This reflects the continued focus by the team to execute efficiently on the R&D roadmap and aligning sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth.
Turning to the bottom line; Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $172 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 40% year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.4%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30%. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, but as a reminder during the quarter, we paid $69 million of net cash in connection with the SMobile acquisition.
DSO was 42 days in the third quarter compared to 36 in the second quarter, well within our range of 35 to 45 days. This increase was due to the timing of shipments and in addition, cash flow from operation was $131 million, down $90 million from the prior quarter as a result of timing of cash receipts relative to the accounts receivable balance.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $26.81 per share for approximately $135 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter were 535 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, down 4 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx totaled $54 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to investments in R&D lab equipment. Depreciation and amortization consistent with prior quarters was approximately $40 million.
Total deferred revenue was $785 million, sequentially product deferred revenue was up 9% or $21 million. For Q3, both the channel inventory and future feature portions of product deferred revenue were up from the prior quarter. Typical for the third quarter, services deferred revenue decrease marginally by 1% or $4 million. We ended the quarter with headcount of 8,104 employees, an increase of 372 from the second quarter. This increase was due to investments in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. Included in total headcount are approximately 27 new employees from the SMobile acquisition.
Now, let's turn to our guidance. As a remainder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We continue to focus on executing against our operating principles and we are well on track to achieving 20% or higher revenue growth in 2010, and therefore for Q4, we are expecting revenues of $1.120 billion plus or minus $20 million.
Gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to be slightly lower as a percentage of revenue and increase on a dollar basis. Operating margins for the fourth quarter are expected to range between 24.5% plus or minus 0.5 point. This would result in fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.35 and $0.37 and assumes a flat share count, a tax rate of 30% and includes a $0.01 of OpEx from our recent acquisitions.
In summary demand indicators are strong, our product portfolio is robust and we are focused on executing against the market opportunity ahead of us. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda.
With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.

This obviously the surge in shipments actually happened after that point, which actually resulted in the increase in the DSOs.
Let me talk about MX 3D for a minute. So, if you look at our overall MX revenue it was strong in the quarter $176 million up from about a $145 million, an 18% quarter over quarter increase in revenue. What we saw during the quarter was very good strength in the ramp up of MX 3D as a proportion of the total. We are expecting a big quarter in MX in total, but we saw an increasing proportion of MX 3D orders as a total of the MX orders that were coming. That actually accelerated in the last three to four weeks of the quarter.
So, the type of customers are quite broad. We actually saw a demand across all geographies in the service provider landscape in terms of the MX 3D. We’re seeing some very good design wins. We obviously fulfilled quite a number of those in the quarter. So, it's a broad-based increase in the overall level of MX and a higher proportion of MX 3D in the quarter. If you go back, we record a number last quarter. We record $24 million of revenue for MX 3D last quarter of the total 145. This quarter, as I said, we had bookings of 87. So, more than three times as much in the quarter and we tripled the amount of revenue as we did last quarter.

The MX 3D, as you are aware, is designed with the trio chips that allows to scale on three dimensions. It can scale on traffic volumes, it can scale on a number of subscribers or users and it can scale on the number of services provided. As a result, we are finding MX 3D as a platform that’s engaged in a wide number of scenarios. Certainly Traffic Direct and the wins that we've had there, MX 3D as a platform for that for content distribution networks and what we are doing with the Ankeena acquisition and the Media Flow offerings, it's a platform for content distribution networks. We're finding customers using it, where they're connecting data centers, connecting the clouds with the MX 3D. So, there's not one common or one single pattern of scenarios. It's actually getting broad adoption across the wide range of scenarios, which reinforces I guess the design point that we had behind the product.

So, if you look at the orders as well as the increase in demand, the design wins, the discussions with our service provider customers both in North America and elsewhere, we're pleased with the momentum that we have in service provider.
For the full year, we've talked about this before that we believe that the second half of the year is high proportion particularly for the North American service provider customers than the first half of the year. Our experience in Q3 with the orders that we did get was within the range that we were anticipating. We actually believe we're on track to hit that 52% to 55% in the second half.

First of all, a comment BLADE is a partner of ours and IBM is a partner of ours; IBM was very transparent with us as they went through this and letting us know their intentions behind this, but clearly BLADE Networks fills a need that IBM has for their BladeCenter technology and what they are doing with Blade servers, and the ability to have the Blade-switches that are architected for where IBM is taking their BladeCenter servers is an important element of what IBM's trying to do and we are very supportive of that.
Clearly, our hope is this continues to just strengthen our relationship with IBM as we can continue to work with them on the overall set of solutions that they have for networking.

So, overall, we view this as a positive thing where we have two partners that decided to combine and that we think this continues to strengthen our partnership with IBM.
The question on federal, could you take that one, Robyn?

Certainly, NSN and Ericsson focus more on the service provider side, where IBM and Dell focus more on the enterprise side, but all up, that group of partners are basically their revenue growth year-on-year is a bit more than double what we've seen in our own revenue growth. So they're helping drive a larger portion of our revenue force with our focus on those four strategic partners and IBM is included in that.
You asked specifically about the OEM relationship, the overall IBM relationship, whether it's reselling Juniper products or selling the IBM branded version of Juniper products that overall relationship continues to grow year-on-year. The OEM element of that though is moving slower. So the bulk of what IBM is doing is still resell of Juniper product, which is fine with us obviously. I think the key points are that our overall strategic alliances are continuing to help grow and help us drive revenue.
Number two, IBM is a key part of that. They are growing as well. Your specific question on OEM, we're seeing most of the growth with IBM being in traditional reselling versus the OEM version of the product.

Number one, we compete in a large addressable market and if you take, just for example, Ethernet switching and the fact that we surpass now 2% market share, we'll just keep driving and taking market share at such a large addressable market that for us to continue to grow in that one gives us plenty of headroom for grow.
Number two, we've expanded the product portfolio, and if you look at going into 2011 with the progress that we have made on our Stratus Project for data center fabric, the progress we are making with Falcon for our mobile packet core. We've got an event later this month around Junos Pulse to share some new announcements and things we are doing there that expands our opportunities, the work we are doing with Junos Space. We've complemented that with some M&A in Ankeena, and how that translates to the Media Flow solution that we have for content distribution networks as mobile and how that's being integrated into features of Junos Pulse.
The large addressable market, the expanded product portfolio, and the fact that we are complementing our organic R&D with some of this targeted M&A tuck-ins, I think those three things, I think are all key to us delivering on this multi-year growth agenda that Robyn outlined.

The first deliverable was Traffic Direct, and we shipped Traffic Direct in Q2 of this year, and so Traffic Direct is a shipping software product that runs on the MX 3D, and I think Robyn highlighted some of the design wins that we saw this last quarter on that. Falcon, Project Falcon and the next milestone is part of the Evolved Packet Core software that also runs on the MX 3D, and we anticipate being in a very limited number of customer testing early trials by the end of this calendar year, that's the only milestone that we've announced thus far, and we are on track to make that milestone.
Then beyond that, obviously, there are other milestones and certainly, as this unfolds, we'll share those with the marketplace as appropriate. In terms of your question on how many customers are running MX 3D, the first thing I'll remind folks is that, the MX chassis, the MX 3D is basically a line-card upgrade to the MX Chassis. So, all existing install base of MX customers can upgrade to the MX 3D by simply purchasing the MX 3D line cards. So, it's important when you look at the work that we've done to establish the install base that we have of MX, that all becomes addressable platform for us for the Falcon offerings that are coming to markets. I don't have a specific number on the number of customers that are running MX or MX 3D, but I think clearly by the fact that just this quarter, we more than tripled the shipments of the MX 3D versus last quarter, it's just an indicator of the continued increased demand.
My comments earlier on the fact that there is a wide range of scenarios that those customers are running it in which is also reflective of the fact it's a wide range of customers that are running it. The key areas to think about were mobile Internet and the focus is as these smartphones continue to grow and the amount of traffic delivered to these smartphones continues to just explode and the transition from 3G to LTE that is the sweet spot for what we've target Falcon and the MX 3D for, and that's where we're going to be laser focused with our go-to-market efforts.

To access the slides, please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. This call will also be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website. 
With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and the acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release.
In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis with the revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.

Juniper delivered another quarter with greater than 20% year-on-year growth. We ended the quarter with record revenue of just over $1 billion, exceptionally strong bookings and substantial growth and backlog. Frankly, because of the robust, overall demand environment and the strength in bookings, we could have done better from a revenue perspective. The third quarter is typically one in which orders come in very late in the quarter, and this was certainly the case. In addition, our latest MX 3D offering ramped faster than expected this quarter, and it took us longer than it should have to adequately support the supply requirements in light of the order mix. Robyn will add some insights on the order linearity and how the December quarter is shaping up in a few moments. 
From a macroeconomic perspective, we have been consistent in our view that while we see a recovery underway, the pace and trajectory of the recovery is likely to vary by geography. Our view has not changed. Over the past few months, there have been a level of uncertainty about the strength of the economy given certain economic indicators. We continue to expect that the economic recovery will be slow. The near-term signals we're getting from economic data whether it is GDP growth, consumer spending, manufacturing data or job growth all support a view that there will be bumps along the way. And while we won't be immune to all of them, we are highly confident in our strategy and our ability to strengthen our position in an industry with solid long-term fundamentals.
From a customer segment perspective, I'm very encouraged by the conversations I'm having with our large service provider customers. It is clear that their visibility and their confidence are high as they move toward the end of the year, and that's reflected in our outlook. As I've said a number of times recently, history shows that U.S. service providers typically spend over half their CapEx budgets in the second half of the calendar year. We expect that to be the case again in 2010, and we have significant opportunities in each of the markets we address. As I've noted on past calls, we continue to make net new inroads in many of our traditional service provider markets and continue to increase our relevance by expanding our total presence within their networks.
Outside the U.S., service provider customers are also increasing investment as they build up their current and next-generation networks. We are very pleased to have been awarded a significant contract with China Mobile to supply our T Series core routers for their IP network. This was a major win for us during the quarter and underscores our strong market position within core routing. Also in Q3, we shipped the industry's first 100 Gig Ethernet interfaces that are IP and .pls capable. 
Our Enterprise business continues to grow. Our focus on solutions for the virtualized data center is paying off with more design wins. Our Enterprise business grew year-on-year in all three theaters. Our U.S. Federal business, which is typically strong in Q3 saw some business move into the fourth quarter due to the passage of a budget continuation measure by the U.S. Congress. 
Alliances are a key element of our growth strategy. Strong alliances enable us to extend our reach, increase our market velocity, enable new solutions for our customers. We recently announced that we entered into an agreement with Dell, and I'm pleased to note this new alliance is off to a good start. We continue to grow our relationship with IBM and other key alliance partners including Nokia Siemens Networks and Ericsson. Our emphasis on developing joint technology solutions as well as integrated marketing programs speak to the commitment we make to the success of both our alliance partners and our customers.
Juniper is executing well against the operating principles we laid out at the beginning of the year. We continue to drive an innovation agenda and, we have been disciplined and focused in our R&D investments. Our vision for the new network is centered on two significant market trends: mobile Internet and cloud computing. 
Let's start with a discussion on our focus on mobile Internet. Last October, we announced the MX 3D edge platform, and we continue to see increased service provider demand for this platform. Project Falcon continues to hit its milestones, and we expect to have our initial evolved packet core solution in customer trial by the end of this year. As a reminder, Project Falcon addresses the evolved packet core with software designed to run on the Junos Space MX 3D edge platform. Our Traffic Direct solution, which was released in Q2, also runs on the Junos Space MX 3D edge platform. With the explosion of smartphones and tablet devices connected to the Internet, the MX 3D and Project Falcon are addressing a key aspect of scaling the wireless networks in support of the mobile Internet. 
Security is also a critical element of the mobile Internet. Our Mobile Secure Solution built on the Junos Space SRX product line is finding strong customer adoption globally. We have extended our security focus with Junos Pulse and the recent acquisition of SMobile. In addition to secure access for corporate data, Junos Pulse now offers antivirus, anti-malware, parental controls and device policy in support of securing the mobile Internet. We have an event planned for later this month with additional information related to this offering.
With regards to the opportunity we see in cloud computing, we announced our architectural approach to data centers of the future with our 321 architecture. We continue to focus on data center design wins with our EX product line and the Stratus project continues to hit milestones toward providing a single-tier data center fabric solution in 2011. The Stratus project is entering a critical testing and early customer adoption phase this quarter.
In support of our solutions for mobile Internet and cloud computing, we are beginning to add key sales and marketing resources ahead of several planned launches in 2011. With the growing strength of our product portfolio, we are investing with a disciplined approach in the specialty sales forces that drive design wins and revenue. Strategically, we are making progress expanding the portfolio of products and solutions aligned with the mobile Internet and cloud computing trends. Operationally, we continue to execute the principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. We are positioned for 2010 top line growth in excess of 20%. On a full year basis, we have managed our OpEx to grow slower than revenue, and we have taken immediate actions to improve order linearity during the quarter, as well as ensuring we're fully prepared for the strong demand we see for our new products. The pace and trajectory of the economy will continue to vary as this economic recovery unfolds. We do see a strong Q4 ahead, and we are positioning for the opportunities we see in 2011. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to discuss our financial results and our outlook for the quarter. Robyn?"
30439,114113657,80296,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin noted, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. I am pleased that we executed to our operating principles and exited the quarter with strong momentum. Demand for our products remained",1726,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin noted, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. I am pleased that we executed to our operating principles and exited the quarter with strong momentum. Demand for our products remained high and revenue and EPS came within our guidance range. Given the strong bookings in the quarter, revenue could have been higher.
Revenue for the quarter was impacted by demand for MX 3D, exceeding our internal supply forecast, and as a result not all orders were able to be fulfilled during the quarter. In addition, many orders came in late in the quarter as is typical for Q3, reducing our ability to obtain more supply. We've already increased our ongoing supply forecast. We exited the quarter with a set of robust demand metric. Book-to-bill was well in excess of one. Product backlog at the end of Q3 stood at approximately $325 million, up significantly from $260 million in the prior quarter. We also ended the quarter with a strong deferred revenue balance. Now, a review of the numbers.
As a reminder, all results include the SMobile acquisition, which closed on July 30, 2010. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the third quarter was a record $1,012,000,000, up 3% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.25 for the third quarter compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2010 and $0.16 per share in the prior year third quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.32, an increase of $0.02 sequentially and $0.09 compared to the prior year third quarter. This includes OpEx related to both the Ankeena and SMobile acquisitions of slightly less than $0.01 per share. Now let me provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segments and market.
We've been consistent in our view that the macroeconomic environment will continue to strengthen throughout the year and that the pace and trajectory of recovery will vary by geography. In Q3, we continued to see some of this variation in global recovery play out. 
Looking at our revenue by region for the quarter, Americas was approximately 53% of total revenue, EMEA was 27% and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue saw good growth and increased $0.08 sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven by content, cable and regional service providers in the U.S. EMEA revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. We saw sequential declines in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, while Western Europe, especially the U.K., Netherlands and France were stronger. APAC revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by China, South Korea and Australia.
From a pipeline perspective, we had design wins across our entire product portfolio and all three geographies. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $744 million, up 3% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was a record $102 million, up 10% sequentially and up over 100% year-over-year. This includes product revenue of $97 million and highlights our continued momentum in the enterprise switching market. Our new 10 gig EX4500 switch, which began shipping in Q2 is gaining excellent traction with data center and campus customers.
MX had another record quarter with total product revenue of $176 million, up 18% sequentially and 73% year-over-year. The MX 3D saw an exceptionally strong ramp in demand with $87 million of orders and $63 million of revenue. We are pleased with the ramp of MX 3D platform. 
During the quarter, we also had significant design wins with our T Series core products at several large service providers including China Mobile. Traffic Direct, our third offering from Project Falcon, recorded another key win. This time in a major European service provider. SLT delivered record revenue of $268 million, up 4% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 13% sequentially to $84 million. We saw good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the U.S. and here in APAC. 
In addition, we are seeing good customer engagement for products from the SMobile acquisition as part of our Junos Pulse offering. Overall, we continue to deliver great innovation to our customers as evidenced by the success of EX, MX and SRX product families. This quarter, the three product families generated a record combined product revenue of $357 million, up 15% sequentially and 96% year-over-year.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was up 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. This was due to solid growth in S routing and high-end firewall products. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in our content and cable service providers as well as new design wins with several social network customers.
Enterprise revenue was up 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our continued penetration in enterprise switching and branch firewall products. The third quarter is typically a strong one for our U.S. federal region. This year, however, as a result of the Congress continuing resolution late in the quarter, some anticipated business shifted into Q4. 
From a pipeline perspective, during the quarter, we had key data center design wins in government, retail and financial services. Consistent with Q2, service provider was 63% and enterprise was 37% of total revenue.
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.5% of revenue, which is at the high end of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.5% of revenue, down slightly from 70.2% in the prior quarter mainly due to product mix. Services gross margin was 60.1% of revenue up slightly from 59.3% in the second quarter of 2010.
Moving on to our operating expenses. For Q3, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $439 million or 43.4% of revenue. Relative to the second quarter, operating expenses increased by $8 million, a decrease as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $62 million or 16% due to an increase in variable compensation and investments in new product development, acquisitions and expanding route-to-market.  As a percent of revenue, however, operating expenses are down significantly from 45.8% to Q3 of last year.
R&D expenses were $212 million or 20.9% of revenue, up $6 million compared to the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $191 million or 18.9% of revenue, a $4 million increase sequentially. G&A expenses totaled $36 million or 3.6% of revenue, down $2 million from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 24.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially. We continue to execute against our operating principle of managing expenses carefully while focusing our investments in key strategic growth areas, and I am confident of reaching our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher on a sustained basis. 
Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 24.2% compared to 25.2% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was another record at 24.1% compared to 20.4% in the second quarter. This reflects the continued focus by the team to execute efficiently on the R&D roadmap and aligning sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth.
Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $172 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 40% year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.4%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30%. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter but as a reminder, during the quarter, we paid $69 million of net cash in connection with the SMobile acquisition. 
DSO was 42 days in the third quarter compared to 36 in the second quarter, well within our range of 35 to 45 days. This increase was due to the timing of shipments and in addition cash flow from operations was $131 million, down $90 million from the prior quarter as a result of timing of cash receipts relative to the accounts receivable balance.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $26.81 per share or approximately $135 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was 535 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, down 4 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx totaled $54 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to investments in R&D lab equipment. Depreciation and amortization consistent with prior quarters was approximately $40 million.
Total deferred revenue was $785 million. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was up 9% or $21 million. For Q3, both the channel inventory and future feature portions of product-deferred revenue were up from the prior quarter. Typical for the third quarter, services-deferred revenue decreased marginally by 1% or $4 million. We ended the quarter with headcount of 8,104 employees, an increase of 372 from the second quarter. This increase was due to investments in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. Included in total headcount are approximately 27 new employees from the SMobile acquisition.
Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. We continue to focus on executing against our operating principles, and we are well on track to achieving 20% or higher revenue growth in 2010. And therefore, for Q4, we are expecting revenues of $1,120,000,000, plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to be slightly lower as a percentage of revenue and increase on a dollar basis. Operating margins for the fourth quarter are expected to range between 24.5%, plus or minus half a point. This would result in fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.35 and $0.37 and assumes a flat share count, a tax rate of 30% and includes $0.01 of OpEx from our recent acquisition.
In summary, our demand indicators are strong. Our product portfolio is robust, and we are focused on executing against the market opportunity ahead of us. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda. And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

It sounded like you saw some increased business at the end there, in particular for the MX 3D. Can you just give us a little bit more sense of what kind of customers were asking for that increased business? And also I think you made a comment that it's typical for the third quarter to be back-end loaded. However, when I look back in the last three years, DSOs are actually flat to down in each one of those years, and this year it’s up significantly. So I would just appreciate a little bit more color on the linearity and kind of what were the various puts and takes there."

From a DSO perspective, let me handle that part of the question first. It's really day 45 or before in terms of -- or week nine and before in terms of DSO, that gives us an opportunity to collect it. The surge in shipments actually happened after that point, which actually resulted in the increase in the DSOs. Let me talk about MX 3D for a minute. So if you look at our overall MX revenue, it was strong in the quarter, $176 million up from about $145 million, an 18% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue. What we saw during the quarter was very good strength in the ramp of MX 3D as a proportion of the total. We were expecting a big quarter in MX in total, but we saw an increasing proportion of MX 3D orders as a total of the MX orders that were coming in, and that actually accelerated in the last three to four weeks of the quarter. And so the type of customers are quite broad. We actually saw demand across all geographies in the service provider landscape in terms of the MX 3D. We’re seeing some very good design wins. We obviously fulfilled quite a number of those in the quarter. So it's a broad-based increase in the overall level of MX and a higher proportion of MX 3D in the quarter. If you go back -- we called out the number last quarter. We called out $24 million of revenue for MX 3D last quarter, the total $145 million. This quarter as I said, we had bookings of $87 million, so more than 3x as much in the quarter and we tripled the amount of revenue as we did last quarter."

For content distribution networks and what we're doing with the Ankeena acquisition and the Media Flow offering, it's a platform for content distribution networks. We're finding customers using it where they're connecting data centers, connecting the clouds with the MX 3D. So there's not one common, or one single pattern of scenarios.

In terms of service provider overall, we were pleased with the 2% sequential increase in the quarter. We're actually overall very pleased with the orders in the quarter. As you can imagine, many of the MX 3D in particular but other orders in the backlog are actually service provider-related. So if you look at the orders as well as the increase in demand, the design wins, the discussions with our service provider, customers both in North America and elsewhere, we're pleased with the momentum that we have in service provider. And for the full year, we've talked about this before that we believe that the second half of the year is a high proportion particularly for the North American service provider customers than the first half of the year. And our experience in Q3 with the orders that we did get was within the range that we were anticipating, we actually believe we're on track to hit that 52% to 55% in the second half."

And IBM was very transparent with us as they went through this in letting us know their intentions behind this. But clearly, Blade Networks fills a need that IBM has with their BladeCenter technology, and what they're doing with Blade servers and the ability to have the Blade switches that are architected for where IBM is taking their BladeCenter servers is an important element of what IBM’s trying to do, and we're very supportive of that. Clearly, our hope is this continues to just strengthen our relationship with IBM as we continue to work with them on the overall set of solutions that they have for networking. There is a little bit of overlap in the top-of-rack switch, but I don't see that as being a significant issue. And I think we continue to have a very constructive open dialogue with IBM strategically on where we're going with the technology and the solution. So overall we view this as a positive thing where we had two partners that decided to combine, and that we think this continues to strengthen our partnership with IBM."

But all up, that group of partners are basically, their revenue growth year-on-year is a bit more than double what we've seen in our own revenue growth. So they're helping drive a larger portion of our revenue for us with our focus on those four strategic partners, and IBM's included in that. You asked specifically about the OEM relationship. The overall IBM relationship, whether it's reselling Juniper products or selling the IBM-branded version of Juniper products, that overall relationship continues to grow year-on-year. The OEM element of that though is moving slower. So the bulk of what IBM is doing is still resell of Juniper product, which is fine with us, obviously. But I think the key points are that our overall strategic alliances are continuing to help grow and help us drive revenue. Number two, IBM is a key part of that. They are growing as well and your specific question in OEM, we're seeing most of the growth of IBM being in traditional reselling versus the OEM version of the product."

Number one, we compete in a large addressable market and if you take just for example, ethernet switching and the fact that we surpassed out 2% market share, we just keep driving and taking market share. That's such a large addressable market that for us to continue to grow in that one gives us plenty of headroom for growth. Number two, we've expand the product portfolio. And if you look at going into 2011 with the progress that we've made on our Stratus project for data center fabric, the progress we're making with Falcon for our mobile packet core, we've got an event later this month around Junos Pulse to share some new announcements and things we're doing there. That expands our opportunities, the work we're doing with Junos Space. And we've complemented that with some M&A and Ankeena and how that translates to the Media Flow Solution that we have for content distribution network, SMobile and how that's being integrated into features of Junos Pulse. So I think the large addressable market, the expanded product portfolio and the fact that we're complementing our organic R&D with some of this targeted M&A tuck-ins, I think those three things I think are all key to us delivering on this multiyear growth agenda that Robyn outlined.

If you could specify any kind of milestones that you could share with us. And since this Falcon will be primarily on MX 3D, I'm curious how many customers are currently on MX 3D now?

The first deliverable was Traffic Direct, and we shift to Traffic Direct in Q2 of this year. And so Traffic Direct is a shipping software product that runs on the MX 3D, and I think Robyn highlighted some of the design wins that we saw this last quarter on that. Falcon, Project Falcon and the next milestone is part of the evolved packet core software that also runs on the MX 3D and we anticipate being in a very limited number of customer testing, early trials by the end of this calendar year. That's the only milestone that we've announced thus far, and we're on track to make that milestone. And then beyond that, obviously, there are other milestones and certainly as this unfolds, we'll share those with the marketplace as appropriate. In terms of your question on how many customers are running MX 3D, the first thing I'll remind folks is that the MX chassis, the MX 3D, is basically a line card upgrade to the MX chassis. So all existing installed base of MX customers can upgrade to the MX 3D by simply purchasing the MX 3D line cards. And so it's important when you look at the work that we've done to establish the install base that we have of MX, that all becomes addressable platform for us for the Falcon offerings that are coming to market. I don't have a specific number on the number of customers that are running MX or MX 3D, but I think clearly the fact that just this quarter, we more than tripled the shipments of the MX 3D versus last quarter is just an indicator of the continued increased demand. And I think my comments earlier on the fact that there's a wide range of scenarios that those customers are running it in, which is also reflective of the fact it's a wide range of customers that are running it. The key areas to think about though for mobile Internet and the focus is as these smartphones continue to grow and the amount of traffic delivered to these smartphones continues to just explode and the transition from 3G to LTE, that is the sweet spot for what we targeted Falcon and the MX 3D for, and that's where we're going to be laser focused with our go-to-market efforts."

So at the Analyst Day, I gave you lots of different inputs into what will keep our gross margin range in that very healthy 66% to 68% of revenue. And MX 3D is one of those areas. The extension of the platform, the continued penetration into different accounts and the fact that we continue to grow in volume across all of our major platforms, SRX, EX and MX as well. And obviously T is growing well as well in terms of core. So all of those things help in terms of the gross margin range."
