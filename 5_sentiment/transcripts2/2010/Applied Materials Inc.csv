Applied generated strong growth in our first quarter, led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew net sales by nearly 50%. Our business momentum continues and we're raising our company-wide fiscal year sales out",1125,"Thanks, Mike, and welcome to today's call. Applied generated strong growth in our first quarter, led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew net sales by nearly 50%. Our business momentum continues and we're raising our company-wide fiscal year sales outlook to growth of more than 50%. We completed the acquisition of Semitool, giving us new growth opportunities in semiconductor equipment and leadership in advanced packaging. We also took actions to improve our efficiency and bring the core of our operations closer to more of our customers. The steep ramp in SSG challenged our manufacturing and field support operations, and I'd like to thank our teams and suppliers for working especially hard to meet our customers' needs.I'll now comment on each of our businesses. We now expect SSG sales to more than double in fiscal 2010. We've raised our wafer fab equipment spending projection to a range of $21 billion to $23 billion for the calendar year, and we view 2010 as just the first year of a strong investment cycle. Memory prices remain high, encouraging customers to invest in the next generation of technology. In 2010, bit demand for memory is expected to outpace supply. Foundries are investing aggressively for their transition to 32 nanometers and for capacity additions at 45 nanometers. We believe the next phase of investment will be driven by DRAM technology transitions along with capacity expansions in both flash memory and foundry. Customers are also discussing plans for new fabs, which should lead to increased equipment spending in 2011.We expect this year to have strong competitive gains, with more than two points of share growth across SSG. We expect Applied's net sales to more than double in the calendar year, reflecting market growth, share gains and favorable memory customer exposure. Increased memory spending is also the catalyst for our Brightfield system, giving us the opportunity to gain five points a share in the nearly $1 billion wafer defect inspection market. In radical inspection, we expanded our installed base with another strategic placement at a major foundry. In CMP, our new Reflexion GT is gaining traction as it allows customers to greatly reduce the costs of consumables. And our new Astra laser anneal system is enabling advanced transistors at 32 nanometers and beyond. In PVD and CVD, we're on track to gain share leading edge where steps are being added in metal gates, silicides, gap fill and packaging. We're very pleased with the progress of our Semitool acquisition. We've been collaborating with Semitool in advanced packaging for years, allowing us to hit the ground running with a suite of products to serve a growing market, which is expected to reach nearly $800 million by 2012. For example, we expect to have at least 25 charger PVD systems installed for packaging in 2010 In AGS, the number of semiconductor tools under contract in Asia grew by 20% year-over-year. We're focusing on additional service and spares growth in the region, which is expected to drive 75% of all new wafer capacity. The Display industry sees strong demand in LCD TVs, particularly in China. High factory utilization of around 90% is leading customers to plan for new capacity. We expect Display equipment spending to grow by more than 60% over approximately the next 12 months. Looking ahead, we expect Applied's orders to increase driven by higher investments in Gen 8.5 capacity over the cycle. We've ramped our manufacturing facility in Taiwan and maintained our system lead times despite this transition. Our Gen. 10 CVD systems are now proven in production and we're ready to ramp this next generation of glass size.In solar, worldwide PVD PV installations are expected to be up 50% year-over-year, with about half of this growth in European countries outside of Germany. Module prices have absorbed the polysilicon price drops and we see price declines moderating ahead of the German FIT adjustment. In China, the government has made solar a national priority and crystal and silicon solar manufacturers are responding by boosting capacity. We expect 5 to 7 gigawatts of incremental capacity additions in China this year, which represents a near doubling from '09. Globally, we see the possibility of up to 9 gigawatts of capacity additions. Solar CapEx should exceed $4 billion this calendar year and factory utilization across the industry is reported to be around 50%, and today's aggressive capacity additions could lead to oversupply and a reduction in investment plans. The strong solar capacity expansion in China has been a positive for our Crystal and Silicon business. We achieved sign-offs for our new Baccini Esatto Technology in the quarter as double printing became established at multiple customers. And we expect our Baccini Cell Systems to gain 3 points of metallization share in 2010.Turning to SunFab, we achieved sign-off at two new lines during the quarter, bringing the total to nine. The price declines in crystal and silicon modules have exerted margin pressure at some of our thin film customers. In some cases, lowering their demand and factory utilization to very low levels. We made further progress in driving SunFab module efficiency and cost reductions to help customers be more competitive. Two customers announced large development projects this quarter and our customers now have 30 megawatts of modules installed, providing field performance data to demonstrate the capabilities of our technology.I'd like to comment briefly on the recent events in Korea. As you know, several of our employees were charged with improperly using customer confidential information. We are working with the Korean prosecutor and also conducting our own investigation in order to better understand the facts in this situation. Applied has strict policies and procedures designed to protect our customers' confidential information. We are also committed to upholding high ethical standards in all of our business dealings. And for more than 40 years, we have developed a history of outstanding, intellectual property protection, which is at the heart of our company's values. The conduct described by the charges is not consistent with either our policies or the great work performed by Applied's talented and dedicated employees. It is important to note that Applied Materials has not been charged in this case. Our focus at this time is on being close to our customers, helping them to meet a steep ramp and ensuring that the strategic relationships and trust that we built over many years remain strong. In closing, our goal is to leave the industry in our core semiconductor market, expand our opportunities in Display and services and drive new growth in Energy and Environmental Solutions. We're also significantly improving our efficiency and effectiveness to deliver outstanding profitability for the long term. I'll now hand the call over to George for more details on our financial results and targets. George?"

Applied's financial performance improved in a strengthening business environment with results in the upper end of our target range led by strong operating performance in our Silicon Systems",1191,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied's financial performance improved in a strengthening business environment with results in the upper end of our target range led by strong operating performance in our Silicon Systems Group. Applied's orders were up 33% sequentially, driven almost entirely by SSG. Net sales increased 21% to $1.85 billion, with growth in all segments except Display. We reported non-GAAP net income of $179 million or $0.13 per share. Our GAAP results included restructuring and acquisition charges, along with investment impairments that together reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results and guidance now include stock-based compensation.Our backlog increased by $200 million to $2.9 billion in line with order growth. The net positive backlog adjustment of $79 million was driven primarily by the Semitool acquisition. Please note that except for ending balances, the Semitool acquisition will be included in our results beginning in Q2 reported on a one month lag through the end of this fiscal year. The company generated operating cash flow of $367 million or 20% of sales. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.2 billion, a reduction from Q4 of just under $70 million, despite spending $323 million for Semitool and $80 million for dividends.Turning to spending, operating expenses grew as expected and included $24 million in acquisition and legal costs that were not in our November outlook. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew during the quarter by approximately $90 million, primarily due to the elimination of certain temporary savings, impacting base and variable compensation, and the absence of approximately $20 million in favorable adjustments in our Q4 numbers. During the quarter, we took restructuring charges of $104 million and realized $12 million in net savings from our longer-term cost initiatives. In the balance of the year, we expect our operating expenses to be between $520 million and $540 million per quarter. This run rate includes $25 million in quarterly spending for Semitool, the elimination of shutdowns and incremental spending to support the steep business ramp, partially offset by ongoing cost initiatives.We remain focused on our longer-term initiatives to enhance the company's Pan-Asia supply chain, to integrate our sales teams into the business units and to improve our back office and IT infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. These programs are still expected to deliver $450 million of annualized cost savings by the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2011. We expect these benefits to be back-end loaded due to the intensity of the ramp.Beginning in Q1, we moved certain costs associated with sales and marketing and variable compensation adjustments into the operating segments. This treatment provides a clear picture of each segment's performance and attains to reduce each segment's operating margin by one to three points in Q1. Of course, these changes have no impact on the company's overall results. A reconciliation is provided on our website.Turning to the segments, Silicon Systems Group orders increased by 80% over Q4, with four customers accounting for over 65% of the total. Net sales in the quarter grew 48%, well above our expectations of greater than 20%. This is a very steep ramp from 2009 levels and our supply chain was challenged during the quarter to meet demand. Our customers continue to expect short lead times and just over 70% of our sales were from orders received in the quarter.  SSG operating profit of $306 million was up nearly six points from Q4, reflecting strong flow-through and some offset due to higher compensation accruals and above normal logistics and expediting costs. We see room for further margin improvement as net sales increase. In Applied Global Services, orders increased 41% of a low Q4 level and net sales were up 9% on higher fab utilization and increased wafer starts. Operating margin declined two points to 15%, primarily due to low margin refurbished systems. Display orders decreased slightly in Q1 but we expect momentum later in the year as customers remain on track for new Gen 8.5 investments. Net sales of $132 million were lower as anticipated and operating margin was down modestly to 18.9%. In EES, orders decreased 36% primarily due to declines in thin film solar. Orders for crystal and silicon solar equipment more than tripled versus Q4 on strong demand for our wafering and cell products, particularly from China. Net sales increased to $321 million driven by two SunFab sign-offs. Growth of 15% was close to our expectation of 20%. While EES reported a modest loss this quarter, we're still targeting EES to be break even on a non-GAAP basis for the year based on crystal and silicon profitability and SunFab sign-offs in the latter part of our fiscal year. Non-GAAP break even represents a $160 million improvement over 2009 and is one of the most important profit enhancement efforts for the company in 2010.Now let me talk about our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year and for Q2. While second half visibility remains limited, we are encouraged by strong demand across most of our customers and markets. As a result, we expect sales to be up by more than 50% in fiscal 2010 or by more than $2.5 billion over 2009. We expect SSG sales to be up more than 100% in fiscal 2010, reflecting growth in capital spending, improved market share and the addition of Semitool. We expect AGS sales to be up in the range of 30% this fiscal year, in line with higher utilization rates and wafer starts. We expect Display sales to be up 30% year-over-year, in line with the industry ramp. We also expect EES sales to be in the range of flat to plus or minus 10% for the fiscal year, with upside potential if crystal and silicon solar equipment demand remains strong in the second half. Our tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 31% to 33%. Now I'll discuss our second quarter business environment. We remain cautious with respect to forecasting orders, particularly due to limited visibility as a result of the high turns business in SSG. Currently, our best estimate is that total company orders will be up by more than 10% quarter-over-quarter. SSG should continue to benefit from strong foundry and memory demand and sales are expected to be up by more than 25% in the quarter. AGS sales are expected to grow by more than 10%, reflecting a return to more normalized spending per wafer pass. In Display, the second quarter is shaping up to be the strongest of the fiscal year, with sales projected to more than double Q1 levels. EES sales are expected to decrease by more than 25% as growth in crystal and silicon solar equipment is more than offset by a near-term decline in thin film solar sales.We expect the company's overall net sales to be up by 15 to 25% in Q2. We also expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings to be between $0.17 and $0.22 per share, which equates to profits growing at more than twice the rate of sales. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions."

And what's your view on the possibility to surpass the peak sales level during this current up cycle, especially if it's driven by these foundry customers? And my follow-up question to that is similar on the Silicon segment operating margin. Do you think Applied can surpass those operating margins in 2007?

Let me start by saying it feels much better to be talking about this year's second quarter than it did just a year ago, while we were experiencing the bottom of the downturn and the global economic recession.Ou",1246,"Thanks, Mike, and welcome to today's call. Let me start by saying it feels much better to be talking about this year's second quarter than it did just a year ago, while we were experiencing the bottom of the downturn and the global economic recession.
Our employees have done a terrific job responding to the challenge of the steep ramp over the last three quarters, and our results reflect their commitment to excellence. Our customers are responding to growing demand for consumer electronics in emerging markets. And after a long period of underinvestment by our semiconductor and display customers, we now see a multi-year up cycle in both industries. This improved outlook has given us the confidence to increase our cash dividend and resume our stock buyback program.
We generated strong results in Q2 led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew sales by over 40%, well above our expectations. The Display business also exceeded our goals for sales and profitability. We saw a quarter-over-quarter sales growth and profit improvement across all of our major businesses except for thin film solar, where we are taking decisive steps to realign the business with a lower market output. 
I'll now comment on each of our businesses and the markets they serve. In Silicon, we are again raising our wafer fab equipment spending projection to a new range of $26 billion to $28 billion for the calendar year. This new estimate is $5 billion higher than our forecast just three months ago. We also have increased confidence that we are in a multi-year up cycle that began three quarters ago. We are now tracking 11 new fabs and fab expansions, which alone would support $35 billion to $40 billion of WFE spending over the next six to eight quarters.
Our customers now have higher confidence in the cycle. And their focus is shifted with more than half of overall spending now targeted at capacity additions. We're also seeing spending from a broader base of our foundry and memory customers. We have ongoing strength from foundry and DRAM this quarter. And the supply of advanced memory has remained tight with prices holding firm. 
The initial success of the Apple iPad is a good leading indicator that tablet computers are emerging as a major new category and then driver of NAND flash capacity. In fact, we believe that incremental demand for iPads and smartphones will absorb about 60% of the new NAND capacity coming online in 2011. 
As we said at our Analyst Meeting, our goal is to gain share in the recovery, and third-party market research released this quarter shows that we are well on track. Applied gain more than two points of WFE share in calendar '09, more than any of the other top 10 suppliers. 
The addition of Semitool to our advanced packaging lineup has also given us the number one position in this fast growing market. Growth in advanced packaging is outpacing WFE, and we are the only equipment supplier to have a full suite of products for this market.
Applied is on track to gain another two points of WFE share in 2010, which should bring our total share above our 2006 peak. In Etch, our sales in this quarter alone were equivalent to all of our sales last fiscal year.
Moving to Display. The industry is seeing strong demand for flats panel TVs and notebooks, particularly in China, where consumer demand for flat panels is outgrowing the U.S. market. High factory utilization of about 95% is leading our customers to invest in new capacity. We expect the current Display cycle to be broader and longer than previous cycles, with the first lag consisting of orders from major customers in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And the second lag driven primarily by new factories in China based on Gen 7.5 and Gen 8 technology. 
We are raising our industry forecast for Display equipment spending to be up by more than 70% from calendar '09. I'm proud with the solid profitability achieved by our Display business this quarter during the demanding ramp. And in PiVot PVD, we recently secured repeat orders at a leading flat panel customer, while achieving sign offs at our third customer sign.
In solar, total industry PV installations have accelerated and are now expected to be in the range of eight to 10 gigawatts for the year, and module prices have stabilized. Capacity additions are also trending higher with 10 to 12 gigawatts expected in 2010, driven primarily by customers in China. While demand signals for crystalline silicon equipment remains strong in the near term, we are closely watching the longer-term capital spending outlook, given the growing potential for overcapacity, the changing value of the euro and uncertainty about future European incentives.
This year, over half of all solar panels will be made in China and Applied is favorably exposed in this opportunity. Q2 was our highest-ever quarter for crystalline silicon bookings, which was led by our Baccini Cell Systems, and we expect to gain several points of metallization share this year. 
We're seeing strong demand for our new Baccini Esatto system with double-printing technology that boosts sale efficiency by up to a half a point. We shipped a gigawatt of nameplate capacity in Esatto systems this quarter, and we expect to increase that run rate by an additional 50% during Q3. We're managing a steep ramp in our Wire Saw business, while closely monitoring the demand from a concentrated customer base.
Turning to thin film. The second quarter was very difficult in all respects. A large customer filed for insolvency, a major new customer failed to secure financing and several other customers experienced weaker outlooks and reduced their spending plans. These events have significantly reduced our thin film solar revenue expectations for the year and lowered our demand forecast for new factories. As a result, our thin film performance for 2010 will be well below expectations, and we now expect that EES will not meet its goal to achieve break even for the year on a non-GAAP basis.
We have viewed break even is an important milestone for EES that would contribute a substantial improvement to our company's profitability. Since the goal is no longer achievable, I've asked our team to develop a plan that will accelerate reductions in our thin film cost structure beyond the levels we discussed at our recent Analyst Meeting. 
These reductions will bring our costs in line with a lower demand profile, while allowing Applied to meet our commitments to existing customers. I expect the plan to be finalized by the middle of June, and I expect EES to make a positive contribution to our company's financial performance in fiscal 2011.
Going forward, we will continue to sell some fabs, but only where we see an acceptable return on investment. Our confidence in the long-term potential of the thin film solar market remains high, and we know that Applied has the technology and people needed to drive excellence excellent solutions. However, we must have a business that stands on its own.
In closing, Q2 was an exciting quarter for Applied Materials, with a significant ramp and a bright outlook for our Silicon, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. At the same time, we are taking decisive action to address the shortfall in demand for our thin film solar equipment. 
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our financial results and targets. George?"
251230,105624412,62262,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 19, 2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Applied Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Ord",1050,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Order growth was 29% quarter-over-quarter with better-than-expected increases in Silicon and EES. Net sales were up 24% led by better-than-expected Silicon growth. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million or $0.22 per share. This performance included the impact of an operating loss of $145 million in our EES segment, which I will discuss in a few minutes.
Before covering our sequential results in detail, I want to share a few comparisons with the second quarter of 2009. Compared to our results from one year ago, orders increased 290% and net sales grew by 125%. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was up over $450 million from the loss position of a year ago, increasing earnings per share by $0.34. These numbers showed just how difficult 2009 was for our businesses and how rapidly demand for our products has ramped in 2010.
Now I will return to sequential comparisons of our results. Gross margin increased almost two points from Q1 of this year, reaching 40.4%, driven by higher net sales in our most profitable business segments. This improvement included the impact of an $83 million inventory charge relating to thin film solar, which lower gross margin by 3.6 points. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $527 million were within our targeted range. We still expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to remain between $520 million and $540 million through the end of the fiscal year.
We opened our new manufacturing and logistics center in Singapore this quarter and expanded production in our display facility in Tainan, bringing our operations closer to more of our customers. Throughout our transition to these new sites, we are meeting the steep ramps in our Silicon and Display businesses. 
The consolidation of worldwide operations is a critical element of our long-term productivity program. The operations group has 2,500 employees worldwide, supporting 17 manufacturing centers in eight countries. With approximately $4 billion in annual receipts, we expect that our initiatives in these areas will yield tangible cost improvements across all of our businesses.
Backlog increased slightly to $3 billion, reflecting a healthy order book across all of our segments. Backlog adjustments were negative and totaled $184 million driven by cancellations, debookings and currency adjustments, primarily within EES. 
Operating cash flow performance for the quarter was very healthy, reaching 23% of sales or $527 million. Strong working capital management resulted in record low days sales outstanding, and only a modest increase in inventory despite a significant increase in our net sales. Our cash flow also benefited from a tax refund of approximately $130 million related to 2009 operating losses. 
We announced a 17% increase in the dividend earlier this quarter and resumed our share buyback program, requiring 7.6 million shares in the quarter. Total cash used for repurchases and dividends in Q2 was $181 million, and we added $365 million to our cash and investment portfolio, which ended the quarter at approximately $3.6 billion.
Now turning to the segments. Silicon orders increased 25% from Q1 led by memory and logic customers. Customer lead times remain short with over 65% of silicon sales coming from orders received within the quarter. Our supply chain was able to respond to the increased demand despite short lead times, global air traffic delays and transitions to the new manufacturing site. 
Net sales were much higher than expected, growing 45% quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing a broadening of customers spending with approximately 60% of sales expected to come from five to six customers in the second half of this year, compared to only three in the first half of the year.
With the higher forecast for wafer fab equipment spending, our improving market share position and the addition of Semitool, we expect to significantly exceed the net sales growth target for silicon that we provided at our recent Analyst Meeting. We are well into our integration process with Semitool and expect to achieve GAAP accretion early in fiscal 2011.
Applied Global Services orders were approximately 2% higher than in Q1, net sales grew 7% and operating margin increased almost five points to just below 20%. Spares availability, along with our performance to customer delivery goals, improved significantly during the quarter. 
Display delivered an exceptional quarter. Orders increased over 100% driven by customer investments in China, sales also more than doubled and operating margin increased 14 points to 33%, reflecting strong flow through and a favorable product mix. During the quarter, the Display team made significant progress toward completing the volume manufacturing transition to our new facility in Taiwan. 
EES reported a segment loss of $145 million, primarily driven by losses in our Thin Film Solar business. Challenging market conditions, associated with the growing supply of low-cost crystalline silicon panels and a limited expansion of utility-scale opportunities, are impacting demand from our current and prospective customers. The inventory charge, the impact of a major customer insolvency and diminished demand overall will result in EES posting a non-GAAP operating loss for the year. We are committed to taking the necessary actions for EES to reach profitability in 2011.
Moving to the outlook for our third fiscal quarter, we see continuing strength in our most profitable businesses. We expect silicon net sales will be roughly in line with a very strong Q2 levels. AGS net sales were expected to increase in line with wafer starts and higher used equipment demand. 
Display expects another solid quarter, but we expect net sales to be down at least 20% below a very strong Q2. We expect EES net sales to be up by more than 25%, primarily as a result of higher crystalline silicon sales. 
With that segment mix, we expect the company's overall net sales in Q3 to be in the range of down 2% to up 5%. We also expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.22 and $0.26 per share. This forecast does not include any potential charges related to EES restructuring, as a plan for that is being developed and will not be completed until later in this quarter. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions."

If you look at non-GAAP OpEx, which is really what we've been guiding to, is we were up about $50 million.

On the NAND flash question, of course, NAND has great productivity, and it depends whether the growth is going to be on two-bits or three-bits-per-cell or one-bit-per-cell kind of devices, how much productivity they get. But frankly, I think that the capacity is quite stretched right now. If the iPad or products like it -- I assume some other major computer companies are coming out with similar products in that category. If they just sell something close to 7 million to 10 million units in the second half of the year, it will seriously stretch NAND flash capacity.

And then you have FX adjustments of $36 million, which quite frankly, was mostly euro, which is all crystal and Silicon sales, which are made out of Europe. You have some minor contributions, minor cancellations and debookings, normal puts and takes in the services and Silicon area. But it was really EES that was the dominant contributor overall, thin film, the largest of that, in terms of cancellations."

Let me start by saying it feels much better to be talking about this year's second quarter than it did just a year ago, while we were experiencing the bottom of the downturn and the global economic recession.
Our employees have done a terrific job responding to the challenge of the steep ramp over the last three quarters, and our results reflect their commitment to excellence. Our customers are responding to growing demand for consumer electronics in emerging markets. And after a long period of underinvestment by our semiconductor and display customers, we now see a multi-year up cycle in both industries. This improved outlook has given us the confidence to increase our cash dividend and resume our stock buyback program.
We generated strong results in Q2 led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew sales by over 40%, well above our expectations. The Display business also exceeded our goals for sales and profitability. We saw a quarter-over-quarter sales growth and profit improvement across all of our major businesses except for thin film solar, where we are taking decisive steps to realign the business with a lower market output. 
I'll now comment on each of our businesses and the markets they serve. In Silicon, we are again raising our wafer fab equipment spending projection to a new range of $26 billion to $28 billion for the calendar year. This new estimate is $5 billion higher than our forecast just three months ago. We also have increased confidence that we are in a multi-year up cycle that began three quarters ago. We are now tracking 11 new fabs and fab expansions, which alone would support $35 billion to $40 billion of WFE spending over the next six to eight quarters.
Our customers now have higher confidence in the cycle. And their focus is shifted with more than half of overall spending now targeted at capacity additions. We're also seeing spending from a broader base of our foundry and memory customers. We have ongoing strength from foundry and DRAM this quarter. And the supply of advanced memory has remained tight with prices holding firm. 
The initial success of the Apple iPad is a good leading indicator that tablet computers are emerging as a major new category and then driver of NAND flash capacity. In fact, we believe that incremental demand for iPads and smartphones will absorb about 60% of the new NAND capacity coming online in 2011. 
As we said at our Analyst Meeting, our goal is to gain share in the recovery, and third-party market research released this quarter shows that we are well on track. Applied gain more than two points of WFE share in calendar '09, more than any of the other top 10 suppliers. 
The addition of Semitool to our advanced packaging lineup has also given us the number one position in this fast growing market. Growth in advanced packaging is outpacing WFE, and we are the only equipment supplier to have a full suite of products for this market.
Applied is on track to gain another two points of WFE share in 2010, which should bring our total share above our 2006 peak. In Etch, our sales in this quarter alone were equivalent to all of our sales last fiscal year.
Moving to Display. The industry is seeing strong demand for flats panel TVs and notebooks, particularly in China, where consumer demand for flat panels is outgrowing the U.S. market. High factory utilization of about 95% is leading our customers to invest in new capacity. We expect the current Display cycle to be broader and longer than previous cycles, with the first lag consisting of orders from major customers in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And the second lag driven primarily by new factories in China based on Gen 7.5 and Gen 8 technology. 
We are raising our industry forecast for Display equipment spending to be up by more than 70% from calendar '09. I'm proud with the solid profitability achieved by our Display business this quarter during the demanding ramp. And in PiVot PVD, we recently secured repeat orders at a leading flat panel customer, while achieving sign offs at our third customer sign.
In solar, total industry PV installations have accelerated and are now expected to be in the range of eight to 10 gigawatts for the year, and module prices have stabilized. Capacity additions are also trending higher with 10 to 12 gigawatts expected in 2010, driven primarily by customers in China. While demand signals for crystalline silicon equipment remains strong in the near term, we are closely watching the longer-term capital spending outlook, given the growing potential for overcapacity, the changing value of the euro and uncertainty about future European incentives.
This year, over half of all solar panels will be made in China and Applied is favorably exposed in this opportunity. Q2 was our highest-ever quarter for crystalline silicon bookings, which was led by our Baccini Cell Systems, and we expect to gain several points of metallization share this year. 
We're seeing strong demand for our new Baccini Esatto system with double-printing technology that boosts sale efficiency by up to a half a point. We shipped a gigawatt of nameplate capacity in Esatto systems this quarter, and we expect to increase that run rate by an additional 50% during Q3. We're managing a steep ramp in our Wire Saw business, while closely monitoring the demand from a concentrated customer base.
Turning to thin film. The second quarter was very difficult in all respects. A large customer filed for insolvency, a major new customer failed to secure financing and several other customers experienced weaker outlooks and reduced their spending plans. These events have significantly reduced our thin film solar revenue expectations for the year and lowered our demand forecast for new factories. As a result, our thin film performance for 2010 will be well below expectations, and we now expect that EES will not meet its goal to achieve break even for the year on a non-GAAP basis.
We have viewed break even is an important milestone for EES that would contribute a substantial improvement to our company's profitability. Since the goal is no longer achievable, I've asked our team to develop a plan that will accelerate reductions in our thin film cost structure beyond the levels we discussed at our recent Analyst Meeting. 
These reductions will bring our costs in line with a lower demand profile, while allowing Applied to meet our commitments to existing customers. I expect the plan to be finalized by the middle of June, and I expect EES to make a positive contribution to our company's financial performance in fiscal 2011.
Going forward, we will continue to sell some fabs, but only where we see an acceptable return on investment. Our confidence in the long-term potential of the thin film solar market remains high, and we know that Applied has the technology and people needed to drive excellence excellent solutions. However, we must have a business that stands on its own.
In closing, Q2 was an exciting quarter for Applied Materials, with a significant ramp and a bright outlook for our Silicon, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. At the same time, we are taking decisive action to address the shortfall in demand for our thin film solar equipment. 
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our financial results and targets. George?

251230,105624412,62263,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 19, 2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Applied Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Ord",1050,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Order growth was 29% quarter-over-quarter with better-than-expected increases in Silicon and EES. Net sales were up 24% led by better-than-expected Silicon growth. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million or $0.22 per share. This performance included the impact of an operating loss of $145 million in our EES segment, which I will discuss in a few minutes.
Before covering our sequential results in detail, I want to share a few comparisons with the second quarter of 2009. Compared to our results from one year ago, orders increased 290% and net sales grew by 125%. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was up over $450 million from the loss position of a year ago, increasing earnings per share by $0.34. These numbers showed just how difficult 2009 was for our businesses and how rapidly demand for our products has ramped in 2010.
Now I will return to sequential comparisons of our results. Gross margin increased almost two points from Q1 of this year, reaching 40.4%, driven by higher net sales in our most profitable business segments. This improvement included the impact of an $83 million inventory charge relating to thin film solar, which lower gross margin by 3.6 points. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $527 million were within our targeted range. We still expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to remain between $520 million and $540 million through the end of the fiscal year.
We opened our new manufacturing and logistics center in Singapore this quarter and expanded production in our display facility in Tainan, bringing our operations closer to more of our customers. Throughout our transition to these new sites, we are meeting the steep ramps in our Silicon and Display businesses. 
The consolidation of worldwide operations is a critical element of our long-term productivity program. The operations group has 2,500 employees worldwide, supporting 17 manufacturing centers in eight countries. With approximately $4 billion in annual receipts, we expect that our initiatives in these areas will yield tangible cost improvements across all of our businesses.
Backlog increased slightly to $3 billion, reflecting a healthy order book across all of our segments. Backlog adjustments were negative and totaled $184 million driven by cancellations, debookings and currency adjustments, primarily within EES. 
Operating cash flow performance for the quarter was very healthy, reaching 23% of sales or $527 million. Strong working capital management resulted in record low days sales outstanding, and only a modest increase in inventory despite a significant increase in our net sales. Our cash flow also benefited from a tax refund of approximately $130 million related to 2009 operating losses. 
We announced a 17% increase in the dividend earlier this quarter and resumed our share buyback program, requiring 7.6 million shares in the quarter. Total cash used for repurchases and dividends in Q2 was $181 million, and we added $365 million to our cash and investment portfolio, which ended the quarter at approximately $3.6 billion.
Now turning to the segments. Silicon orders increased 25% from Q1 led by memory and logic customers. Customer lead times remain short with over 65% of silicon sales coming from orders received within the quarter. Our supply chain was able to respond to the increased demand despite short lead times, global air traffic delays and transitions to the new manufacturing site. 
Net sales were much higher than expected, growing 45% quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing a broadening of customers spending with approximately 60% of sales expected to come from five to six customers in the second half of this year, compared to only three in the first half of the year.
With the higher forecast for wafer fab equipment spending, our improving market share position and the addition of Semitool, we expect to significantly exceed the net sales growth target for silicon that we provided at our recent Analyst Meeting. We are well into our integration process with Semitool and expect to achieve GAAP accretion early in fiscal 2011.
Applied Global Services orders were approximately 2% higher than in Q1, net sales grew 7% and operating margin increased almost five points to just below 20%. Spares availability, along with our performance to customer delivery goals, improved significantly during the quarter. 
Display delivered an exceptional quarter. Orders increased over 100% driven by customer investments in China, sales also more than doubled and operating margin increased 14 points to 33%, reflecting strong flow through and a favorable product mix. During the quarter, the Display team made significant progress toward completing the volume manufacturing transition to our new facility in Taiwan. 
EES reported a segment loss of $145 million, primarily driven by losses in our Thin Film Solar business. Challenging market conditions, associated with the growing supply of low-cost crystalline silicon panels and a limited expansion of utility-scale opportunities, are impacting demand from our current and prospective customers. The inventory charge, the impact of a major customer insolvency and diminished demand overall will result in EES posting a non-GAAP operating loss for the year. We are committed to taking the necessary actions for EES to reach profitability in 2011.
Moving to the outlook for our third fiscal quarter, we see continuing strength in our most profitable businesses. We expect silicon net sales will be roughly in line with a very strong Q2 levels. AGS net sales were expected to increase in line with wafer starts and higher used equipment demand. 
Display expects another solid quarter, but we expect net sales to be down at least 20% below a very strong Q2. We expect EES net sales to be up by more than 25%, primarily as a result of higher crystalline silicon sales. 
With that segment mix, we expect the company's overall net sales in Q3 to be in the range of down 2% to up 5%. We also expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.22 and $0.26 per share. This forecast does not include any potential charges related to EES restructuring, as a plan for that is being developed and will not be completed until later in this quarter. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.

In terms of OpEx, I think what you saw in terms of saving this quarter was really the absence of restructuring cost that took place. If you look at non-GAAP OpEx, which is really what we've been guiding to, is we were up about $50 million. All of it can be explained by the addition of Semitool into our financials and increase in variable comp in line with the increase in revenue.

It's generally the softest quarter for our customers' demand. And we've been trying to see if there's really any place where there's something that's out of line from a days of inventory or from a historic days of inventory, and we still see inventories in a pretty healthy range. Now could one product be out of line and we missed it? I guess that's possible. When we look at the seasonality through Q2, we haven't seen anything that would raise alarm bells at this point. On the NAND flash question, of course, NAND has great productivity, and it depends whether the growth is going to be on two-bits or three-bits-per-cell or one-bit-per-cell kind of devices, how much productivity they get. But frankly, I think that the capacity is quite stretched right now. If the iPad or products like it -- I assume some other major computer companies are coming out with similar products in that category. If they just sell something close to 7 million to 10 million units in the second half of the year, it will seriously stretch NAND flash capacity. We think that to supply that, you need something between 250,000 and 300,000 wafers. I'm not sure where those are going to come from because everyone today is pretty much already utilized.

Let me start by saying it feels much better to be talking about this year's second quarter than it did just a year ago, while we were experiencing the bottom of the downturn and the global economic recession.
Our employees have done a terrific job responding to the challenge of the steep ramp over the last three quarters, and our results reflect their commitment to excellence. Our customers are responding to growing demand for consumer electronics in emerging markets. And after a long period of underinvestment by our semiconductor and display customers, we now see a multi-year up cycle in both industries. This improved outlook has given us the confidence to increase our cash dividend and resume our stock buyback program.
We generated strong results in Q2 led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew sales by over 40%, well above our expectations. The Display business also exceeded our goals for sales and profitability. We saw a quarter-over-quarter sales growth and profit improvement across all of our major businesses except for thin film solar, where we are taking decisive steps to realign the business with a lower market output. 
I'll now comment on each of our businesses and the markets they serve. In Silicon, we are again raising our wafer fab equipment spending projection to a new range of $26 billion to $28 billion for the calendar year. This new estimate is $5 billion higher than our forecast just three months ago. We also have increased confidence that we are in a multi-year up cycle that began three quarters ago. We are now tracking 11 new fabs and fab expansions, which alone would support $35 billion to $40 billion of WFE spending over the next six to eight quarters.
Our customers now have higher confidence in the cycle. And their focus has shifted with more than half of overall spending now targeted at capacity additions. We're also seeing spending from a broader base of our foundry and memory customers. We have ongoing strength from foundry and DRAM this quarter. And the supply of advanced memory has remained tight with prices holding firm. 
The initial success of the Apple iPad is a good leading indicator that tablet computers are emerging as a major new category and a driver of NAND flash capacity. In fact, we believe that incremental demand for iPads and smartphones will absorb about 60% of the new NAND capacity coming online in 2011. As we said at our Analyst Meeting, our goal is to gain share in the recovery, and third-party market research released this quarter shows that we are well on track. Applied gained more than two points of WFE share in calendar '09, more than any of the other top 10 suppliers. 
The addition of Semitool to our advanced packaging lineup has also given us the number one position in this fast growing market. Growth in advanced packaging is outpacing WFE, and we are the only equipment supplier to have a full suite of products for this market.  Applied is on track to gain another two points of WFE share in 2010, which should bring our total share above our 2006 peak. In Etch, our sales in this quarter alone were equivalent to all of our sales last fiscal year.
Moving to Display. The industry is seeing strong demand for flat panel TVs and notebooks, particularly in China, where consumer demand for flat panels is outgrowing the U.S. market. High factory utilization of about 95% is leading our customers to invest in new capacity. We expect the current Display cycle to be broader and longer than previous cycles, with the first lag consisting of orders from major customers in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And the second lag driven primarily by new factories in China based on Gen 7.5 and Gen 8 technology. 
We are raising our industry forecast for Display equipment spending to be up by more than 70% from calendar '09. I'm proud of the solid profitability achieved by our Display business this quarter during a demanding ramp. And in PiVot PVD, we recently secured repeat orders at a leading flat panel customer, while achieving sign offs at our third customer sign.
In Solar, total industry PV installations have accelerated and are now expected to be in the range of eight to 10 gigawatts for the year and module prices have stabilized. Capacity additions are also trending higher with 10 to 12 gigawatts expected in 2010, driven primarily by customers in China. While demand signals for crystalline silicon equipment remains strong in the near term, we are closely watching the longer-term capital spending outlook, given the growing potential for overcapacity, the changing value of the euro and uncertainty about future European incentives.
This year, over half of all solar panels will be made in China and Applied is favorably exposed to this opportunity. Q2 was our highest-ever quarter for crystalline silicon bookings, which was led by our Baccini Cell Systems, and we expect to gain several points of metallization share this year. 
We're seeing strong demand for our new Baccini Esatto system with double printing technology that boosts cell efficiency by up to a half a point. We shipped a gigawatt of nameplate capacity in Esatto systems this quarter, and we expect to increase that run rate by an additional 50% during Q3. We're managing a steep ramp in our Wire Saw business, while closely monitoring the demand from a concentrated customer base.
Turning to thin film. The second quarter was very difficult in all respects. A large customer filed for insolvency, a major new customer failed to secure financing and several other customers experienced weaker outlooks and reduced their spending plans. These events have significantly reduced our thin film solar revenue expectations for the year and lowered our demand forecast for new factories. As a result, our thin film performance for 2010 will be well below expectations, and we now expect that EES will not meet its goal to achieve break even for the year on a non-GAAP basis.
We have viewed break even is an important milestone for EES that would contribute a substantial improvement to our company's profitability. Since the goal is no longer achievable, I've asked our team to develop a plan that will accelerate reductions in our thin film cost structure beyond the levels we discussed at our recent Analyst Meeting. 
These reductions will bring our costs in line with a lower demand profile, while allowing Applied to meet our commitments to existing customers. I expect the plan to be finalized by the middle of June, and I expect EES to make a positive contribution to our company's financial performance in fiscal 2011.
Going forward, we will continue to sell some fabs, but only where we see an acceptable return on investment. Our confidence in the long-term potential of the thin film solar market remains high, and we know that Applied has the technology and people needed to drive excellence excellent solutions. However, we must have a business that stands on its own.
In closing, Q2 was an exciting quarter for Applied Materials, with a significant ramp and a bright outlook for our Silicon, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. At the same time, we are taking decisive action to address the shortfall in demand for our thin film solar equipment. 
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our financial results and targets. George?"
251230,105624412,62628,"Applied Materials Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 19, 2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Applied Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Ord",1049,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Order growth was 29% quarter-over-quarter with better-than-expected increases in Silicon and EES. Net sales were up 24% led by better-than-expected Silicon growth. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million or $0.22 per share. This performance included the impact of an operating loss of $145 million in our EES segment, which I will discuss in a few minutes.
Before covering our sequential results in detail, I want to share a few comparisons with the second quarter of 2009. Compared to our results from one year ago, orders increased 290% and net sales grew by 125%. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was up over $450 million from the loss position of a year ago, increasing earnings per share by $0.34. These numbers showed just how difficult 2009 was for our businesses and how rapidly demand for our products has ramped in 2010.
Now I will return to sequential comparisons of our results. Gross margin increased almost two points from Q1 of this year, reaching 40.4%, driven by higher net sales in our most profitable business segments. This improvement included the impact of an $83 million inventory charge relating to thin film solar, which lower gross margin by 3.6 points. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $527 million were within our targeted range. We still expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to remain between $520 million and $540 million through the end of the fiscal year.
We opened our new manufacturing and logistics center in Singapore this quarter and expanded production in our display facility in Tainan, bringing our operations closer to more of our customers. Throughout our transition to these new sites, we are meeting the steep ramps in our Silicon and Display businesses. 
The consolidation of worldwide operations is a critical element of our long-term productivity program. The operations group has 2,500 employees worldwide, supporting 17 manufacturing centers in eight countries. With approximately $4 billion in annual receipts, we expect that our initiatives in these areas will yield tangible cost improvements across all of our businesses.
Backlog increased slightly to $3 billion, reflecting a healthy order book across all of our segments. Backlog adjustments were negative and totaled $184 million driven by cancellations, debookings and currency adjustments, primarily within EES. 
Operating cash flow performance for the quarter was very healthy, reaching 23% of sales or $527 million. Strong working capital management resulted in record low days sales outstanding, and only a modest increase in inventory despite a significant increase in our net sales. Our cash flow also benefited from a tax refund of approximately $130 million related to 2009 operating losses. 
We announced a 17% increase in the dividend earlier this quarter and resumed our share buyback program, requiring 7.6 million shares in the quarter. Total cash used for repurchases and dividends in Q2 was $181 million, and we added $365 million to our cash and investment portfolio, which ended the quarter at approximately $3.6 billion.
Now turning to the segments. Silicon orders increased 25% from Q1 led by memory and logic customers. Customer lead times remain short with over 65% of silicon sales coming from orders received within the quarter. Our supply chain was able to respond to the increased demand despite short lead times, global air traffic delays and transitions to the new manufacturing site. 
Net sales were much higher than expected, growing 45% quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing a broadening of customers spending with approximately 60% of sales expected to come from five to six customers in the second half of this year, compared to only three in the first half of the year.
With the higher forecast for wafer fab equipment spending, our improving market share position and the addition of Semitool, we expect to significantly exceed the net sales growth target for silicon that we provided at our recent Analyst Meeting. We are well into our integration process with Semitool and expect to achieve GAAP accretion early in fiscal 2011.
Applied Global Services orders were approximately 2% higher than in Q1. Net sales grew 7% and operating margin increased almost five points to just below 20%. Spares availability, along with our performance to customer delivery goals, improved significantly during the quarter. 
Display delivered an exceptional quarter. Orders increased over 100% driven by customer investments in China. Sales also more than doubled and operating margin increased 14 points to 33%, reflecting strong flow-through and a favorable product mix. During the quarter, the Display team made significant progress toward completing the volume manufacturing transition to our new facility in Taiwan. 
EES reported a segment loss of $145 million, primarily driven by losses in our Thin Film Solar business. Challenging market conditions, associated with the growing supply of low-cost crystalline silicon panels and a limited expansion of utility-scale opportunities, are impacting demand from our current and prospective customers. The inventory charge, the impact of a major customer insolvency and diminished demand overall will result in EES posting a non-GAAP operating loss for the year. We are committed to taking the necessary actions for EES to reach profitability in 2011.
Moving to the outlook for our third fiscal quarter. We see continuing strength in our most profitable businesses. We expect silicon net sales will be roughly in line with the very strong Q2 levels. AGS net sales were expected to increase in line with wafer starts and higher used equipment demand. 
Display expects another solid quarter, but we expect net sales to be down at least 20% below a very strong Q2. We expect EES net sales to be up by more than 25%, primarily as a result of higher crystalline silicon sales. 
With that segment mix, we expect the company's overall net sales in Q3 to be in the range of down 2% to up 5%. We also expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.22 and $0.26 per share. This forecast does not include any potential charges related to EES restructuring, as a plan for that is being developed and will not be completed until later in this quarter. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions."

I think other things have to be on timing and how orders are received from customers. On the flat panel display, it's just a lumpy business and I think the market is strengthening. We're very -- and actually, the way the cycle is going in flat panel display is, it's broadening. And quite different than the last cycle where there was just a rush to buy capacity in one quarter, I think our orders went up to 500 million in one quarter, we're seeing a much broader and stronger effect that's going on right now as different customers are in different places. And then, who's going to actually get the build in China and who's not. I think those factors are all playing into the flat panel display order and revenue trends. But I would say that, that market is strong and literally, as strong as I've seen at any time. George?"

If you step back and say, ""What do we really seeing here?"" We're seeing a multi-year cycle in our view in both semiconductors and display. We expect orders will reflect that. We expect to continue to gain share and actually in both of those markets, so we're quite positive. It's not a lack of optimism that is keeping us from guiding orders. In terms of OpEx, I think what you saw in terms of saving this quarter was really the absence of restructuring cost that took place. If you look at non-GAAP OpEx, which is really what we've been guiding to, is we were up about $50 million. All of it can be explained by the addition of Semitool into our financials and increase in variable comp in line with the increase in revenue.

Now could one product be out of line and we missed it? I guess that's possible. When we look at the seasonality through Q2, we haven't seen anything that would raise alarm bells at this point. On the NAND flash question, of course, NAND has great productivity, and it depends whether the growth is going to be on two-bits or three-bits-per-cell or one-bit-per-cell kind of devices, how much productivity they get. But frankly, I think that the capacity is quite stretched right now. If the iPad or products like it -- I assume other major computer companies are coming out with similar products in that category. If they just sell something close to 7 million to 10 million units in the second half of the year, it will seriously stretch NAND flash capacity. We think that to supply that, you need something between 250,000 and 300,000 wafers. I'm not sure where those are going to come from because everyone today is pretty much already utilized."

Applied delivered solid third quarter results, driven by our semiconductor, display, and crystalline silicon solar businesses.

Applied delivered solid third quarter results, driven by our semiconductor, display, and crystalline silicon solar businesses. Sales were up 10% and earnings per share were $0.03 above the range of our forecast. During the quarter, we announced a clear path to profitability in our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, which strengthens our company's overall financial outlook. And we expect a strong finish to our fiscal year.
Turning to the industry environment, 2010 has been a very good year for electronic product sales, led by consumer demand in the BRIC countries. In the second calendar quarter, our customers saw year-over-year growth across their end markets with LCD TV units up 43%, PC units up 20%, and cell phones up 15%, led by smartphones. We are mindful of the soft macroeconomic leading indicators and certainly of leading industry reports. We will stay close to our customers to anticipate any changes in their markets or investment plans.
Next, I will cover each of our markets in more detail. For the semiconductor industry, we maintain our WFE spending outlook of $26 billion to $28 billion, the midpoint of which represents growth of 110% for the year. We now expect our equipment sales in SSG and AGS to be up more than 160% for our fiscal year. The foundries are investing more aggressively than previously expected with significant new orders from a broader set of our customers.
Over the first three fiscal quarters, roughly 75% of our orders were concentrated in foundry and DRAM. DRAM pricing is stable and availability has remained tight with bit supply and demand, both growing at 50% to 60%. NAND pricing fell about 5% this quarter and there has been little change all year with supply and demand both growing at 70% to 80%. Overall, memory inventories remain relatively low.
We expect DRAM spending to moderate over the rest of the year, with growth in foundry, NAND, and logic expected to offset the decline. We see NAND investments continuing well into 2011 as demand for flash storage outpaces supply. Q3 was the fifth consecutive growth quarter for SSG and AGS. And today, we are monitoring 15 fabs and fab expansion projects that are projected to add $50 billion in new spending over the next eight to 12 quarters.
In SSG, our focus on capturing new opportunities at key market inflections is paying off. During the quarter, we won significant customer decisions in metal gate transistors, copper interconnects, and wafer-level packaging. We remain confident that we will gain 2 points of WFE share for the year, driven by net positional wins across our portfolio and favorable exposure to the increase in foundry spending.
Sales growth for year is being led by Etch, where we are tracking the 4 points of share gains, even as DRAM spending is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. In inspection, we see shifts in the timing of key customer spending and orders for brightfield and mask inspection are projected to be at record levels in Q4.
Our CMP business had a record sales quarter with share growth led by Reflexion GT wins at key foundry and memory customers. Semitool booked record orders this quarter and won new copper interconnect positions at three major customers with two wins at advanced nodes in foundry, and another win at leading-edge in memory.
Share gains at Applied and another leading equipment companies are in effect consolidating the industry, despite limited merger and acquisition activity. Over the past four quarters, total share at the top five equipment companies has grown from under 60% to nearly 70% of WFE. In services, AGS had substantial growth in 200 millimeter used equipment orders with overall revenue growing in line with a modest uptick in fab utilization.
Moving to the LCD industry, TV shipments grew to 44 million units in the second quarter, which benefited from World Cup demand. Panel makers ran at higher utilization levels in the quarter and reported a week's worth of excess inventory in retail, and that's including in China which had a seasonal decline of 18%. The current outlook is for these inventories to be absorbed in Q3, and we now believe LCD equipment spending will be 75% to 80% higher for the year, which is above our previous forecast.
Applied is winning in CVD and color filter PVD, and we are competing very effectively for the new projects in China. Our PiVot PVD is gaining traction; we now have 50% share at a leading customer. We also see touch screens taking off in Tablet PCs and smartphones, which is generating growth opportunities in PVD and some modest new opportunities in Web.
In the solar industry, worldwide panel installations are trending above 12 gigawatts for the year, driven by pull-ins related to the feed-in tariff in Germany. It's likely that Germany's growth will moderate in 2011, but we see panel demand increasing next year with strength in Europe, China, Japan, and parts of the U.S.
Fab utilization has improved throughout the crystalline silicon supply chain. Panel ASPs remain stable. Leading panel markers reported sold-out conditions through the end of the year with visibility into the first half of 2011.
We believe crystalline silicon capacity additions will be in a range of 11 to 13 gigawatts for the year, which is up about 80%. Crystalline silicon equipment spending is likely to double from last year to about $8 billion. While early indications for 2011 are positive, we will keep a close eye on equipment demand as this year's capacity is absorbed by the industry.
Over time, we expect ratable reductions in panel prices to continue, resulting in a market that is less dependent on government support. Applied had a record profitability in crystalline silicon solar this quarter, led by the highest ever sales at Baccini Cell Systems. Baccini is the platform of choice in China, which is driving 60% of the world's capacity additions this year. We are pleased with our product roadmap, which we see driving further reductions in cost per watt over the next several years.
In summary, Q3 resulted in strong performance across our semiconductor, display, and crystalline silicon solar businesses; and we expect revenues to be higher in Q4. The macro signals have become more cautious, yet the summer is often a time of concern for our customers. We have not seen a pause in semiconductor capital investment and we expect a solid finish to our year. I am also confident that the structural improvements we have made in 2010 will improve Applied's financial performance across a range of business scenarios in 2011.
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our results and targets. George?

Applied's results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses.Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion resulting in the highest qua",1017,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Applied's results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses.
Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion resulting in the highest quarterly order levels since the year 2000. Our order outlook continues to appear strong. Backlog increased nearly 5% to $3.1 billion. Net sales grew 10%, surpassing the high end of our target, driven by better-than-expected crystalline silicon and semiconductor equipment sales.
GAAP gross margin was 34% for the quarter and was negatively impacted by 10 margin points as a result of the EES inventory-related charges. Excluding those charges, gross margin would have been 44%.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were in line with our target at $538 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to remain near the upper end of our $520 million to $540 million range, as savings initiatives partially offset increases associated with the growth in the business.
Non-GAAP net income was $0.17 per share. For the purposes of your models, our current results included $0.12 per share of inventory-related charges. Adjusting for these effects, we would have achieved non-GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share against our original target range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share, a very strong quarter for our ongoing businesses.
Operating cash flow was $299 million or 12% of sales, reflecting increases in working capital to support the current business. We used $100 million to buy back 7.9 million shares and paid $94 million in dividends, including an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share.
Cash and investments grew slightly to over $3.6 billion. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, which is approximately 18% of revenues.
I will now comment on our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders grew 8%, with all applications higher except DRAM. We expect to see strong bookings again in our fourth quarter, with foundry and logic orders leading the mix. Semitool had excellent performance, with record orders and the business was accretive to our results.
SSG net sales grew 3% sequentially and are up 191% year-on-year. Operating margins improved to over 36% in the quarter. AGS orders grew over 23%, led by strong demand for 200 millimeter refurbished equipment. Operating margin decreased modestly due to ramp challenges, but we expect improvement in the fourth quarter as our supply chain works through some materials constraints to deliver on increasing 200 millimeter systems demand. For the fiscal year, we still expect AGS revenue to be 35% above 2009.
Display results were once again solid, even as orders and revenue declined with expectations. Orders of $242 million were down 6% and net sales were down 20% at $216 million. Display operating margins remained healthy at just under 30% as we realized the benefits of our shift to the Taiwan manufacturing center.
During the quarter we shipped more than 90% of our large-area deposition equipment from the Tainan facility. For the fiscal year, we now believe display net sales will improve to more than 70% relative to 2009.
In our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, orders remained at high levels and revenue more than doubled, reflecting a very strong demand for equipment from our crystalline solar customers. Orders of $353 million were down 7%, but still represent the third highest booking quarter for EES, despite the absence of any thin film orders. Net sales were $387 million, an increase of 133%.
Our Baccini business was particularly robust, as net sales from that group were more than 75% above the previous high achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also recognized revenue on the single junction SunFab line. Our thin film solar backlog ended the period at about $300 million, with two more factory signoffs expected over the next two quarters.
The $405 million EES restructuring charge consisted of inventory related charges of approximately $250 million, and severance and asset impairment charges of $155 million. The inventory related charges were reported in cost of sales and had a 10-point impact on overall gross margin. The other charges were reported in operating expenses, net of a $20 million favorable adjustment to the restructuring plan announced last November.
We expect the benefits of the EES restructuring to be reflected in the segment's results over the next three quarters. EES will maintain a modest investment in advanced thin film technology while upgrades and services for existing SunFab customers will be managed through AGS.
Next, I will share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We anticipate another strong quarter, despite some caution around the potential impact of the softening macroeconomic conditions.
We expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be in line with the third quarter and we see preliminary indications from customers that SSG will grow in our first quarter of fiscal 2011. AGS net sales are expected to be up more than 10%, largely due to increased shipments of refurbished equipment and growth in wafer starts.
In display, we believe net sales will be up approximately 20%, in line with strong second half investment by display customers. We expect EES net sales to be down 10% to 20% but still reflective of strong crystalline solar equipment demand. Upside to this number is possible if we achieve customer acceptance for a major SunFab factory in China during the quarter.
Overall, we expect the company's net sales in our fourth quarter to be flat to up 5%. We expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.28 and $0.32 per share.
With these fourth quarter targets, we also have a clear picture of our full-year performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion for the fiscal year, up over 80% versus 2009, with non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 per share. Adjusting your models to remove the year-to-date EES inventory related charges would reflect fiscal year 2010 performance of between $0.96 and $1 per share.
So in summary, we see a very strong finish to an excellent fiscal year.
Now, Mike, let's open the call for questions.

But combined with the activities in those facilities, we also have a major supply chain initiative.

What we are seeing from the demand aspect is it's pretty broad-based in this segment from analog, automotive, foundry, and MEMS growing capacity, the sustainability of which is pretty good. I think - especially when you look at the analog and automotive parts, those parts aren't going to go off 200 millimeter; MEMS is just getting onto 200 millimeter. So we think that this market is going to see some - certainly some significant growth in the next couple of quarters and then stabilize at a high and sustainable level.

251230,111550524,75378,"Applied Materials Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-18-2010",2010-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Applied Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Applied delivered solid third quarter results driven by our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. Sales were up 10% and earnings per share were $0.03 above the range of our forecast. During the quarter, we announce",1112,"Thanks, Mike. Applied delivered solid third quarter results driven by our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. Sales were up 10% and earnings per share were $0.03 above the range of our forecast. During the quarter, we announced a clear path to profitability in our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, which to strengthens our company's overall financial outlook, and we expect a strong finish to our fiscal year.
Turning to the industry environment. 2010 has been a very good year for electronic product sales led by consumer demand in the BRIC countries. In the second calendar quarter, our customers saw a year-over-year growth across their end markets, with LCD TV units up 43%, PC units up 20% and cell phones up 15%, led by smartphones.
We're mindful of the soft macroeconomic leading indicators and certainly of leading industry reports. We'll stay close to our customers to anticipate any changes in their markets or investment plans.
Next, I'll cover each of our markets in more detail. For the semiconductor industry, we maintain our WFE spending outlook of $26 billion to $28 billion, the midpoint of which represents growth of 110% for the year. We now expect our equipment sales in SSG and AGS to be up more than 160% for our fiscal year.
The foundries are investing more aggressively than previously expected with significant new orders from a broader set of our customers. Over the first three fiscal quarters, roughly 75% of our orders were concentrated in foundry and DRAM. DRAM pricing is stable, and availability has remained tight with bit supply and demand both growing at 50% to 60%. NAND pricing fell about 5% this quarter and there's been little change all year with supply and demand both growing at 70% to 80%. Overall, memory inventories remain relatively low.
We expect DRAM spending to moderate over the rest of the year, with growth in foundry, NAND and Logic expected to offset the decline. We see NAND investments continuing well into 2011 as demand for flash storage outpaces supply. Q3 was the fifth consecutive growth quarter for SSG and AGS. And today, we're monitoring 15 fabs and fab expansion projects that are projected to add $50 billion in new spending over the next eight to 12 quarters.
In SSG, our focus on capturing new opportunities at key market inflections is paying off. During the quarter, we won significant customer decisions in metal gate transistors, copper interconnects and wafer level packaging. We remain confident that we'll gain two points of WFE share for the year, driven by net positional wins across our portfolio and favorable exposure to the increase in foundry spending.
Sales growth for the year is being led by Etch, where we're tracking the four points of share gains, even as DRAM spending is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. In inspection, we see shifts in the timing of key customer spending and orders for Brightfield and mask inspection are projected to be at record levels in Q4.
Our CMP business had a record sales quarter with share growth led by Reflexion GT, wins at key foundry and memory customers. Semitool booked record orders this quarter and won new copper interconnect positions at three major customers with two wins at advanced nodes and foundry, and another win at a leading edge in memory.
Share gains at Applied and other leading equipment companies are, in effect, consolidating the industry despite limited merger and acquisition activity. Over the past four quarters, total share at the top five equipment companies has grown from under 60% to nearly 70% of WFE. In services, AGS had substantial growth in 200-millimeter used-equipment orders with overall revenue growing in line with a modest uptick in fab utilization.
Moving to the LCD industry, TV shipments grew to 44 million units in the second quarter, which benefited from World Cup demand. Panel makers ran at higher utilization levels in the quarter and reported a week's worth of excess inventory in retail, and that's including in China, which had a seasonal decline of 18%. The current outlook is for these inventories to be absorbed in Q3, and we now believe LCD equipment spending will be 75% to 80% higher for the year, which is above our previous forecast. 
Applied is winning in CVD and color filter PVD, and we're competing very effectively for the new projects in China. Our PiVot PVD is gaining traction, we now have 50% share of the leading customer. We also see touch screens taking off in tablet PCs and smartphones, which is generating growth opportunities in PVD and some modest new opportunities in web.
In the solar industry, worldwide panel installations are trending above 12 gigawatts for the year, driven by pull-ins related to the feed-in tariff in Germany. It's likely that Germany's growth will moderate in 2011, but we see panel demand increasing next year with strength in Europe, China, Japan and parts of the U.S. Fab utilization has improved throughout the crystalline silicon supply chain. Panel ASPs remain stable. Leading panel makers reported sold-out conditions through the end of the year, with visibility into the first half of 2011.
We believe crystalline silicon capacity additions will be in a range of 11 to 13 gigawatts for the year, which is up about 80%. Crystalline silicon equipment spending is likely to double from last year to about $8 billion. While early indications for 2011 are positive, we'll keep a close eye on equipment demand as this year's capacity is absorbed by the industry.
Over time, we expect ratable reductions in panel prices to continue, resulting in a market that is less dependent on government support. Applied had a record profitability in crystalline silicon solar this quarter, led by the highest ever sales at Baccini Cell Systems. Baccini is the platform of choice in China, which is driving 60% of the world's capacity addition this year. We're pleased with our product roadmap, which we see driving further reductions in cost per watt over the next several years.
In summary, Q3 resulted in strong performance across our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses, and we expect revenues to be higher in Q4. The macro signals have become more cautious, yet the summer is often a time of concern for our customers. We have not seen a pause in semiconductor capital investment, and we expect a solid finish to our year. I'm also confident that the structural improvements we've made in 2010 will improve Applied's financial performance across the range of business scenarios in 2011. 
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our results and targets. George?"

Applied results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion, resulting in the highest qua",1006,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Applied results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. 
Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion, resulting in the highest quarterly order levels since the year 2000. Our order outlook continues to appear strong. Backlog increased nearly 5% to $3.1 billion. 
Net sales grew 10% surpassing the high end of our target driven by better-than-expected crystalline silicon and semiconductor equipment sales. GAAP gross margin was 34% for the quarter and was negatively impacted by 10 margin points as a result of the EES inventory-related charges. Excluding those charges, gross margin would've been 44%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were in-line with our target at $538 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to remain near the upper end of our $520 million to $540 million range, as savings initiatives partially offset increases associated with the growth in the business. 
Non-GAAP net income was $0.17 per share. For the purposes of your models, our current results included $0.12 per share of inventory-related charges. Adjusting for these effects, we would have achieved non-GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share against our original target range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share, a very strong quarter for ongoing businesses.
Operating cash flow was $299 million or 12% of sales, reflecting increases in working capital to support the current business. We used $100 million to buy back 7.9 million shares and paid $94 million in dividends, including an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share.
Cash and investments grew slightly to over $3.6 billion. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, which is approximately 18% of revenues. I'll now comment on our operating segments.
Silicon Systems Group orders grew 8%, with all applications higher, except DRAM. We expect to see strong bookings again in our fourth quarter, with foundry and Logic orders leading the mix. Semitool had excellent performance with record orders, and the business was accretive to our results. 
SSG net sales grew 3% sequentially and are up 191% year-on-year. Operating margins improved to over 36% in the quarter. AGS orders grew over 23% led by strong demand for 200-millimeter refurbished equipment. Operating margin decreased modestly due to ramp challenges, but we expect improvement in the fourth quarter as our supply chain works through some materials constraints to deliver on increasing 200-millimeter systems demand. For the fiscal year, we still expect AGS revenue to be 35% above 2009.
Display results were once again solid even as orders and revenue declined with expectations. Orders of $242 million were down 6% and net sales were down 20% at $216 million. Display operating margins remained healthy at just under 30% as we realized the benefits of our shift to the Taiwan manufacturing center. 
During the quarter, we shipped more than 90% of our large area deposition equipment from the Tainan facility. For the fiscal year, we now believe Display net sales will improve to more than 70% relative to 2009.
In our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, orders remained at high levels and revenue more than doubled, reflecting the very strong demand for equipment from our crystalline solar customers. Orders of $353 million were down 7%, but still represent the third highest booking quarter for EES, despite the absence of any thin film orders. Net sales were $387 million, an increase of 133%. 
Our Baccini business was particularly robust as net sales from that group were more than 75% above the previous high achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also recognized revenue on a single-junction SunFab line. Our thin film solar backlog ended the period at about $300 million, with two more factory sign-offs expected over the next two quarters.
The $405 million EES restructuring charge consisted of inventory-related charges of approximately $250 million, and severance and asset impairment charges of $155 million. The inventory-related charges were reported in cost of sales and had a 10-point impact on overall gross margin. The other charges were reported in operating expenses, net of a $20 million favorable adjustment to the restructuring plan announced last November. 
We expect the benefits of the EES restructuring to be reflected in the segment's results over the next three quarters. EES will maintain a modest investment in advanced thin film technology, while upgrades and services for existing SunFab customers will be managed through AGS.
Next, I'll share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We anticipate another strong quarter despite some caution around the potential impact of the softening macroeconomic conditions. We expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be in-line with the third quarter, and we see preliminary indications from customers that SSG will grow in our first quarter of fiscal 2011. AGS net sales are expected to be up more than 10%, largely due to increased shipments of refurbished equipment and growth in wafer starts. 
In Display, we believe net sales will be up approximately 20% in-line with strong second half investment by Display customers. We expect EES net sales to be down 10% to 20%, but still reflective of strong crystalline solar equipment demand. Upside to this number is possible, if we achieve customer acceptance for a major SunFab factory in China during the quarter. 
Overall, we expect the company's net sales in our fourth quarter to be flat to up 5%. We expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.28 and $0.32 per share. 
With these fourth quarter targets, we also have a clear picture of our full year performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion for the fiscal year, up over 80% versus 2009, with non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 per share. Adjusting your models to remove the year-to-date EES inventory-related charges would reflect fiscal year 2010 performance of between $0.96 and $1 per share.
So in summary, we see a very strong finish to an excellent fiscal year. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions."

Applied delivered solid third quarter results driven by our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. Sales were up 10% and earnings per share were $0.03 above the range of our forecast. During the quarter, we announce",1112,"Thanks, Mike. Applied delivered solid third quarter results driven by our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. Sales were up 10% and earnings per share were $0.03 above the range of our forecast. During the quarter, we announced a clear path to profitability in our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, which to strengthens our company's overall financial outlook, and we expect a strong finish to our fiscal year.
Turning to the industry environment. 2010 has been a very good year for electronic product sales led by consumer demand in the BRIC countries. In the second calendar quarter, our customers saw a year-over-year growth across their end markets, with LCD TV units up 43%, PC units up 20% and cell phones up 15%, led by smartphones.
We're mindful of the soft macroeconomic leading indicators and certainly of leading industry reports. We'll stay close to our customers to anticipate any changes in their markets or investment plans.
Next, I'll cover each of our markets in more detail. For the semiconductor industry, we maintain our WFE spending outlook of $26 billion to $28 billion, the midpoint of which represents growth of 110% for the year. We now expect our equipment sales in SSG and AGS to be up more than 160% for our fiscal year.
The foundries are investing more aggressively than previously expected with significant new orders from a broader set of our customers. Over the first three fiscal quarters, roughly 75% of our orders were concentrated in foundry and DRAM. DRAM pricing is stable, and availability has remained tight with bit supply and demand both growing at 50% to 60%. NAND pricing fell about 5% this quarter and there's been little change all year with supply and demand both growing at 70% to 80%. Overall, memory inventories remain relatively low.
We expect DRAM spending to moderate over the rest of the year, with growth in foundry, NAND and Logic expected to offset the decline. We see NAND investments continuing well into 2011 as demand for flash storage outpaces supply. Q3 was the fifth consecutive growth quarter for SSG and AGS. And today, we're monitoring 15 fabs and fab expansion projects that are projected to add $50 billion in new spending over the next eight to 12 quarters.
In SSG, our focus on capturing new opportunities at key market inflections is paying off. During the quarter, we won significant customer decisions in metal gate transistors, copper interconnects and wafer level packaging. We remain confident that we'll gain two points of WFE share for the year, driven by net positional wins across our portfolio and favorable exposure to the increase in foundry spending.
Sales growth for the year is being led by Etch, where we're tracking the four points of share gains, even as DRAM spending is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. In inspection, we see shifts in the timing of key customer spending and orders for Brightfield and mask inspection are projected to be at record levels in Q4.
Our CMP business had a record sales quarter with share growth led by Reflexion GT, wins at key foundry and memory customers. Semitool booked record orders this quarter and won new copper interconnect positions at three major customers with two wins at advanced nodes and foundry, and another win at a leading edge in memory.
Share gains at Applied and other leading equipment companies are, in effect, consolidating the industry despite limited merger and acquisition activity. Over the past four quarters, total share at the top five equipment companies has grown from under 60% to nearly 70% of WFE. In services, AGS had substantial growth in 200-millimeter used-equipment orders with overall revenue growing in line with a modest uptick in fab utilization.
Moving to the LCD industry, TV shipments grew to 44 million units in the second quarter, which benefited from World Cup demand. Panel makers ran at higher utilization levels in the quarter and reported a week's worth of excess inventory in retail, and that's including in China, which had a seasonal decline of 18%. The current outlook is for these inventories to be absorbed in Q3, and we now believe LCD equipment spending will be 75% to 80% higher for the year, which is above our previous forecast. 
Applied is winning in CVD and color filter PVD, and we're competing very effectively for the new projects in China. Our PiVot PVD is gaining traction, we now have 50% share of the leading customer. We also see touch screens taking off in tablet PCs and smartphones, which is generating growth opportunities in PVD and some modest new opportunities in web.
In the solar industry, worldwide panel installations are trending above 12 gigawatts for the year, driven by pull-ins related to the feed-in tariff in Germany. It's likely that Germany's growth will moderate in 2011, but we see panel demand increasing next year with strength in Europe, China, Japan and parts of the U.S. Fab utilization has improved throughout the crystalline silicon supply chain. Panel ASPs remain stable. Leading panel makers reported sold-out conditions through the end of the year, with visibility into the first half of 2011.
We believe crystalline silicon capacity additions will be in a range of 11 to 13 gigawatts for the year, which is up about 80%. Crystalline silicon equipment spending is likely to double from last year to about $8 billion. While early indications for 2011 are positive, we'll keep a close eye on equipment demand as this year's capacity is absorbed by the industry.
Over time, we expect ratable reductions in panel prices to continue, resulting in a market that is less dependent on government support. Applied had a record profitability in crystalline silicon solar this quarter, led by the highest ever sales at Baccini Cell Systems. Baccini is the platform of choice in China, which is driving 60% of the world's capacity addition this year. We're pleased with our product roadmap, which we see driving further reductions in cost per watt over the next several years.
In summary, Q3 resulted in strong performance across our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses, and we expect revenues to be higher in Q4. The macro signals have become more cautious, yet the summer is often a time of concern for our customers. We have not seen a pause in semiconductor capital investment, and we expect a solid finish to our year. I'm also confident that the structural improvements we've made in 2010 will improve Applied's financial performance across the range of business scenarios in 2011. 
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our results and targets. George?"

Applied results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion, resulting in the highest qua",1007,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Applied results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. 
Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion, resulting in the highest quarterly order levels since the year 2000. Our order outlook continues to appear strong. Backlog increased nearly 5% to $3.1 billion. 
Net sales grew 10% surpassing the high end of our target driven by better-than-expected crystalline silicon and semiconductor equipment sales. GAAP gross margin was 34% for the quarter and was negatively impacted by 10 margin points as a result of the EES inventory-related charges. Excluding those charges, gross margin would've been 44%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were in-line with our target at $538 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to remain near the upper end of our $520 million to $540 million range, as savings initiatives partially offset increases associated with the growth in the business. 
Non-GAAP net income was $0.17 per share. For the purposes of your models, our current results included $0.12 per share of inventory-related charges. Adjusting for these effects, we would have achieved non-GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share against our original target range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share, a very strong quarter for ongoing businesses.
Operating cash flow was $299 million or 12% of sales, reflecting increases in working capital to support the current business. We used $100 million to buy back 7.9 million shares and paid $94 million in dividends, including an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share.
Cash and investments grew slightly to over $3.6 billion. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, which is approximately 18% of revenues. I'll now comment on our operating segments.
Silicon Systems Group orders grew 8%, with all applications higher, except DRAM. We expect to see strong bookings again in our fourth quarter, with foundry and Logic orders leading the mix. Semitool had excellent performance with record orders, and the business was accretive to our results. 
SSG net sales grew 3% sequentially and are up 191% year-on-year. Operating margins improved to over 36% in the quarter. AGS orders grew over 23% led by strong demand for 200-millimeter refurbished equipment. Operating margin decreased modestly due to ramp challenges, but we expect improvement in the fourth quarter as our supply chain works through some materials constraints to deliver on increasing 200-millimeter systems demand. For the fiscal year, we still expect AGS revenue to be 35% above 2009.
Display results were once again solid even as orders and revenue declined with expectations. Orders of $242 million were down 6% and net sales were down 20% at $216 million. Display operating margins remained healthy at just under 30% as we realized the benefits of our shift to the Taiwan manufacturing center. 
During the quarter, we shipped more than 90% of our large area deposition equipment from the Tainan facility. For the fiscal year, we now believe Display net sales will improve to more than 70% relative to 2009.
In our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, orders remained at high levels and revenue more than doubled, reflecting the very strong demand for equipment from our crystalline solar customers. Orders of $353 million were down 7%, but still represent the third highest booking quarter for EES, despite the absence of any thin film orders. Net sales were $387 million, an increase of 133%. 
Our Baccini business was particularly robust as net sales from that group were more than 75% above the previous high achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also recognized revenue on a single-junction SunFab line. Our thin film solar backlog ended the period at about $300 million, with two more factory sign-offs expected over the next two quarters.
The $405 million EES restructuring charge consisted of inventory-related charges of approximately $250 million, and severance and asset impairment charges of $155 million. The inventory-related charges were reported in cost of sales and had a 10-point impact on overall gross margin. The other charges were reported in operating expenses, net of a $20 million favorable adjustment to the restructuring plan announced last November. 
We expect the benefits of the EES restructuring to be reflected in the segment's results over the next three quarters. EES will maintain a modest investment in advanced thin film technology, while upgrades and services for existing SunFab customers will be managed through AGS.
Next, I'll share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We anticipate another strong quarter despite some caution around the potential impact of the softening macroeconomic conditions. We expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be in line with the third quarter, and we see preliminary indications from customers that SSG will grow in our first quarter of fiscal 2011. AGS net sales are expected to be up more than 10%, largely due to increased shipments of refurbished equipment and growth in wafer starts. 
In Display, we believe net sales will be up approximately 20% in-line with strong second half investment by Display customers. We expect EES net sales to be down 10% to 20%, but still reflective of strong crystalline solar equipment demand. Upside to this number is possible, if we achieve customer acceptance for a major SunFab factory in China during the quarter. 
Overall, we expect the company's net sales in our fourth quarter to be flat to up 5%. We expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.28 and $0.32 per share. 
With these fourth quarter targets, we also have a clear picture of our full year performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion for the fiscal year, up over 80% versus 2009, with non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 per share. Adjusting your models to remove the year-to-date EES inventory-related charges would reflect fiscal year 2010 performance of between $0.96 and $1 per share.
So in summary, we see a very strong finish to an excellent fiscal year. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions."

Applied delivered solid third quarter results driven by our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. Sales were up 10% and earnings per share were $0.03 above the range of our forecast. During the quarter, we announced a clear path to profitability in our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, which to strengthens our company's overall financial outlook, and we expect a strong finish to our fiscal year.
Turning to the industry environment. 2010 has been a very good year for electronic product sales led by consumer demand in the BRIC countries. In the second calendar quarter, our customers saw a year-over-year growth across their end markets, with LCD TV units up 43%, PC units up 20% and cell phones up 15%, led by smartphones.
We're mindful of the soft macroeconomic leading indicators and certainly of leading industry reports. We'll stay close to our customers to anticipate any changes in their markets or investment plans.
Next, I'll cover each of our markets in more detail. For the semiconductor industry, we maintain our WFE spending outlook of $26 billion to $28 billion, the midpoint of which represents growth of 110% for the year. We now expect our equipment sales in SSG and AGS to be up more than 160% for our fiscal year.
The foundries are investing more aggressively than previously expected with significant new orders from a broader set of our customers. Over the first three fiscal quarters, roughly 75% of our orders were concentrated in foundry and DRAM. DRAM pricing is stable, and availability has remained tight with bit supply and demand both growing at 50% to 60%. NAND pricing fell about 5% this quarter and there's been little change all year with supply and demand both growing at 70% to 80%. Overall, memory inventories remain relatively low.
We expect DRAM spending to moderate over the rest of the year, with growth in foundry, NAND and Logic expected to offset the decline. We see NAND investments continuing well into 2011 as demand for flash storage outpaces supply. Q3 was the fifth consecutive growth quarter for SSG and AGS. And today, we're monitoring 15 fabs and fab expansion projects that are projected to add $50 billion in new spending over the next eight to 12 quarters.
In SSG, our focus on capturing new opportunities at key market inflections is paying off. During the quarter, we won significant customer decisions in metal gate transistors, copper interconnects and wafer level packaging. We remain confident that we'll gain two points of WFE share for the year, driven by net positional wins across our portfolio and favorable exposure to the increase in foundry spending.
Sales growth for the year is being led by Etch, where we're tracking the four points of share gains, even as DRAM spending is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. In inspection, we see shifts in the timing of key customer spending and orders for Brightfield and mask inspection are projected to be at record levels in Q4.
Our CMP business had a record sales quarter with share growth led by Reflexion GT, wins at key foundry and memory customers. Semitool booked record orders this quarter and won new copper interconnect positions at three major customers with two wins at advanced nodes and foundry, and another win at a leading edge in memory.
Share gains at Applied and other leading equipment companies are, in effect, consolidating the industry despite limited merger and acquisition activity. Over the past four quarters, total share at the top five equipment companies has grown from under 60% to nearly 70% of WFE. In services, AGS had substantial growth in 200-millimeter used-equipment orders with overall revenue growing in line with a modest uptick in fab utilization.
Moving to the LCD industry, TV shipments grew to 44 million units in the second quarter, which benefited from World Cup demand. Panel makers ran at higher utilization levels in the quarter and reported a week's worth of excess inventory in retail, and that's including in China, which had a seasonal decline of 18%. The current outlook is for these inventories to be absorbed in Q3, and we now believe LCD equipment spending will be 75% to 80% higher for the year, which is above our previous forecast. 
Applied is winning in CVD and color filter PVD, and we're competing very effectively for the new projects in China. Our PiVot PVD is gaining traction, we now have 50% share of the leading customer. We also see touch screens taking off in tablet PCs and smartphones, which is generating growth opportunities in PVD and some modest new opportunities in web.
In the solar industry, worldwide panel installations are trending above 12 gigawatts for the year, driven by pull-ins related to the feed-in tariff in Germany. It's likely that Germany's growth will moderate in 2011, but we see panel demand increasing next year with strength in Europe, China, Japan and parts of the U.S. Fab utilization has improved throughout the crystalline silicon supply chain. Panel ASPs remain stable. Leading panel makers reported sold-out conditions through the end of the year, with visibility into the first half of 2011.
We believe crystalline silicon capacity additions will be in a range of 11 to 13 gigawatts for the year, which is up about 80%. Crystalline silicon equipment spending is likely to double from last year to about $8 billion. While early indications for 2011 are positive, we'll keep a close eye on equipment demand as this year's capacity is absorbed by the industry.
Over time, we expect ratable reductions in panel prices to continue, resulting in a market that is less dependent on government support. Applied had a record profitability in crystalline silicon solar this quarter, led by the highest ever sales at Baccini Cell Systems. Baccini is the platform of choice in China, which is driving 60% of the world's capacity addition this year. We're pleased with our product roadmap, which we see driving further reductions in cost per watt over the next several years.
In summary, Q3 resulted in strong performance across our Semiconductor, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses, and we expect revenues to be higher in Q4. The macro signals have become more cautious, yet the summer is often a time of concern for our customers. We have not seen a pause in semiconductor capital investment, and we expect a solid finish to our year. I'm also confident that the structural improvements we've made in 2010 will improve Applied's financial performance across the range of business scenarios in 2011. 
I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our results and targets. George?"

Applied results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion, resulting in the highest qua",1007,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Applied results exceeded our revised earnings target range by $0.03 per share, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. 
Orders grew 8% to $2.7 billion, resulting in the highest quarterly order levels since the year 2000. Our order outlook continues to appear strong. Backlog increased nearly 5% to $3.1 billion. 
Net sales grew 10% surpassing the high end of our target driven by better-than-expected crystalline silicon and semiconductor equipment sales. GAAP gross margin was 34% for the quarter and was negatively impacted by 10 margin points as a result of the EES inventory-related charges. Excluding those charges, gross margin would've been 44%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were in-line with our target at $538 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to remain near the upper end of our $520 million to $540 million range, as savings initiatives partially offset increases associated with the growth in the business. 
Non-GAAP net income was $0.17 per share. For the purposes of your models, our current results included $0.12 per share of inventory-related charges. Adjusting for these effects, we would have achieved non-GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share against our original target range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share, a very strong quarter for ongoing businesses.
Operating cash flow was $299 million or 12% of sales, reflecting increases in working capital to support the current business. We used $100 million to buy back 7.9 million shares and paid $94 million in dividends, including an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share.
Cash and investments grew slightly to over $3.6 billion. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, which is approximately 18% of revenues. I'll now comment on our operating segments.
Silicon Systems Group orders grew 8%, with all applications higher, except DRAM. We expect to see strong bookings again in our fourth quarter, with foundry and Logic orders leading the mix. Semitool had excellent performance with record orders, and the business was accretive to our results. 
SSG net sales grew 3% sequentially and are up 191% year-on-year. Operating margins improved to over 36% in the quarter. AGS orders grew over 23% led by strong demand for 200-millimeter refurbished equipment. Operating margin decreased modestly due to ramp challenges, but we expect improvement in the fourth quarter as our supply chain works through some materials constraints to deliver on increasing 200-millimeter systems demand. For the fiscal year, we still expect AGS revenue to be 35% above 2009.
Display results were once again solid even as orders and revenue declined with expectations. Orders of $242 million were down 6% and net sales were down 20% at $216 million. Display operating margins remained healthy at just under 30% as we realized the benefits of our shift to the Taiwan manufacturing center. 
During the quarter, we shipped more than 90% of our large area deposition equipment from the Tainan facility. For the fiscal year, we now believe Display net sales will improve to more than 70% relative to 2009.
In our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, orders remained at high levels and revenue more than doubled, reflecting the very strong demand for equipment from our crystalline solar customers. Orders of $353 million were down 7%, but still represent the third highest booking quarter for EES, despite the absence of any thin film orders. Net sales were $387 million, an increase of 133%. 
Our Baccini business was particularly robust as net sales from that group were more than 75% above the previous high achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also recognized revenue on a single-junction SunFab line. Our thin film solar backlog ended the period at about $300 million, with two more factory sign-offs expected over the next two quarters.
The $405 million EES restructuring charge consisted of inventory-related charges of approximately $250 million, and severance and asset impairment charges of $155 million. The inventory-related charges were reported in cost of sales and had a 10-point impact on overall gross margin. The other charges were reported in operating expenses, net of a $20 million favorable adjustment to the restructuring plan announced last November. 
We expect the benefits of the EES restructuring to be reflected in the segment's results over the next three quarters. EES will maintain a modest investment in advanced thin film technology, while upgrades and services for existing SunFab customers will be managed through AGS.
Next, I'll share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We anticipate another strong quarter despite some caution around the potential impact of the softening macroeconomic conditions. We expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be in line with the third quarter, and we see preliminary indications from customers that SSG will grow in our first quarter of fiscal 2011. AGS net sales are expected to be up more than 10%, largely due to increased shipments of refurbished equipment and growth in wafer starts. 
In Display, we believe net sales will be up approximately 20% in-line with strong second half investment by Display customers. We expect EES net sales to be down 10% to 20%, but still reflective of strong crystalline solar equipment demand. Upside to this number is possible, if we achieve customer acceptance for a major SunFab factory in China during the quarter. 
Overall, we expect the company's net sales in our fourth quarter to be flat to up 5%. We expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.28 and $0.32 per share. 
With these fourth quarter targets, we also have a clear picture of our full year performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion for the fiscal year, up over 80% versus 2009, with non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 per share. Adjusting your models to remove the year-to-date EES inventory-related charges would reflect fiscal year 2010 performance of between $0.96 and $1 per share.
So in summary, we see a very strong finish to an excellent fiscal year. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions."

In crystalline, obviously, we had an extremely strong quarter already in the third quarter, but again, we're continuing to see strong orders.

I won't comment on the specifics of the margins, but it will be positive to AGS' margins for the quarter.

I'm pleased to report that Applied ended our fiscal year with an outstanding fourth quarter and enter 2011 with positive momentum. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue to $2.9 billion, generated $700 million in operating profit and delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our target.
Reflecting on the year as a whole, I'm pleased with the progress we've made against our strategic plan. Our goals for 2010 were clear: capitalize on the recovery in our markets, gain share in our core businesses and achieve a new level of operating performance and profitability. We delivered in all three of these areas.
We took advantage of the recovery in semiconductor and display equipment, with revenue growth and an expected two points of share gain in wafer fab equipment spending. We took aggressive actions to restructure our Solar Business, which enabled the EES to achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. In addition, we made operational improvements throughout the organization that make us more efficient. These changes included opening new operation centers in Singapore and Taiwan that are already improving customer delivery and gross margins. 
Before I comment on the upcoming year, I'd like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their outstanding achievements during 2010.
While we are mindful of the fragile state of the global economy, we have a positive view of the markets we serve and expect the fundamental drivers of 2010 to remain in place next year. We see demand for consumer electronics remaining strong, led by the emerging markets. PC sales are projected to grow 5% to 10%, smartphones are forecast approach 400 million units, LCD TVs reaching 215 million units and tablets are expected to grow to 50 million units or greater. 
Tablets are also leading the transition to solid-state storage. And as a result, we expect NAND bit growth to be in the range of 80% to 90% next year. This is projected to support more than $6 billion of equipment spending, and NAND investment will likely suppress DRAM for the first time. 
In semiconductor equipment, we see PCs as the biggest swing factor in our wafer fab equipment forecast for next year. 
We also see continued strength in Solar, where installations are on track to grow at 20% to 30% in 2011. This growth is being driven by solid project returns even as feed-in tariffs decline.
Let me now turn to each of our segments. In Semiconductor, we expect WFE spending to finish this calendar year in the range of $29 billion to $30 billion, which is above our previous view of $26 billion to $28 billion. We anticipate next year's spending to be in line with 2010, plus or minus 10%. 
Looking further ahead, we are now tracking 17 new fabs and fab expansion projects that represent about $60 billion of equipment spending over the next eight to 12 quarters. We expect next year's foundry and logic spending to remain solid, with an acceleration in NAND helping to offset a pause in DRAM investment. 
NAND provides a number of market inflections that Applied can leverage to win further share. These customers were the first to adopt double patterning, which has enabled us to gain positional wins with our mask and Brightfield inspection products. Recent double patterning etch wins would also contribute to our anticipated share growth next year. And as NAND makers transitioning to the 3x node, our full-blown CBD solution would be the key enabler for their multilevel cell architectures. 
SSG exits 2010 with momentum, and we are on track to increase share in every one of our served markets. We expect to gain two points of share in overall WFE spending, which equates to roughly $600 million of revenue.
We are especially pleased with our traction in Etch, where we won a number of strategic orders and expect four points of share gain this year. In PVD, we're increasing our position across all applications, including copper barrier/seed. And we had key production wins in the rapid growing metal gate area. 
In addition, CMP and Semitool achieved revenue records in the fourth quarter. Our share gains are being fueled by new product innovations, including 12 new products introduced over the past 12 months. And next year, we expect about 20% of our revenue to come from these products.
We are particularly excited about our leadership in the rapidly growing wafer-level packaging market, where we have one over 2/3 of the advanced packaging decisions this year. In 2011, we anticipate wafer starts to increase by approximately 4% year-over-year and our global services business to grow faster when wafer starts. We are earning a larger share of business in Asia, a region that has traditionally been a challenge for service penetration. 
In Display, we expect CapEx for 2010 to be 75% to 80% higher than in 2009. And in Q4, our Display group delivered one of the best quarters in its history.
As the holiday season approaches, we are seeing weakness in the end markets. TV makers are cutting prices to reduce inventory levels. And we expect LCD CapEx to be down more than 20% next year. However, we believe we can outperform this overall trend with continued share gains in PVD and revenue growth from touch panel and OLED products. Touch panel equipment alone represents a $200 million market opportunity next year.
In EES, the fourth quarter was a tremendous end to a record year for our Baccini and PWS businesses. Both businesses surpassed their previous peaks for quarterly revenues and orders. And we expect this record performance to be eclipsed in the first quarter of 2011. 
Demand in the solar market remains extremely robust. We now believe panel installations will reach 16 gigawatts for the calendar year and expect 2011 installations to be in the 19 to 21 gigawatt range. The top panel manufacturers are running at full utilization and are still adding capacity. 
Following a year that exceeded our expectations, we are projecting Solar CapEx for 2011 to be approximately flat year-over-year, in the range of 13 to 15 gigawatts, with each gigawatt of capacity representing over $200 million of equipment opportunity for Applied Materials.
China and Taiwan drove three quarters of this year's crystalline silicon capacity addition and now constitutes 65% of capacity worldwide. Applied has higher market share in China. Then in the rest of the world, service trend bodes well for our business. 
In summary, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to an excellent year for Applied Materials. We delivered on our objectives and gained market share. We have reached profitability in our Energy and Environmental business and made operational improvements across the company. We increased our R&D spending to $1.1 billion through the year with a pipeline of innovative products. This sets the stage for us to outperform our markets again in 2011. We enter the new year with a strong balance sheet that allows us to fund our innovation, maintain strategic flexibility and return cash to stockholders.
Now let me hand the call over to George who will provide additional details about our performance and our outlook. George?"

I also want to thank the employees of Applied Materials for their efforts to drive a very strong quarter and year for the company. After a most difficult 2009, our employees around the world rallied to meet the challenges of a 90% ramp in revenue, while accelerating new product developments, growing market share and improving the operating performance in all of our businesses.
Now I'll start with a brief summary of our results for the fourth quarter. 
Orders were up 11% over Q3, driven by solar and semi equipment demand. This is our sixth consecutive growth quarter and our highest quarter level in almost 10 years. It is worth noting that China accounted for 32% of the orders, led by our crystalline silicon customers. 
Net sales grew 15%, well above our target range, with stronger-than-expected results in our Solar, Display and Semiconductor Equipment businesses. A SunFab sign-up of $225 million was the largest single contributor to higher-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up eight points on higher revenue in the absence of the inventory charge taken last quarter. The SunFab sign-up lowered overall gross margin by two points. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $516 million were favorable to our target range due to an accelerated reduction of EES thin film-related spending and the favorable impact of some discrete items. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $500 million to $520 million for the quarter during the first half of 2011, down from our recent quarterly run rate of between $530 million and $540 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.36 per share, exceeding the high end of our range by $0.04. The increase was driven primarily by higher net sales and lower spending. The SunFab sign-up contributed approximately $0.02 of incremental earnings per share. 
Operating cash flow was $525 million or 18% of sales. During the quarter, we increased our buyback to $150 million used $93 million to pay a dividend of $0.07 per share.
The Silicon Systems Group had order growth in the quarter of 9% and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Net sales increased 2% to $1.5 billion. Foundry customers once again led investments, with growth in logic offsetting a decline in DRAM spending. We see this mixed pattern continuing into the first half of 2011. Operating margins were strong at 38%, which included some increased R&D investments.
In AGS, orders of $631 million reflected continuing demand for 200-millimeter systems. Net sales were up 10%, in line with expectations. And operating margins continue to be impacted by supply chain issues around 200-millimeter systems. 
The Display group concluded a cyclical growth year for LCD equipment, with its highest net sales quarter of the year at $281 million. As we expected, Display orders were down 27% in the quarter, signaling a period of reduced spending for LCD equipment as customers absorb the 2010 capacity additions. 
EES achieved record orders in revenues in the quarter. The SunFab sign-off and a 25% increase in crystalline silicon equipment were the primary drivers of higher sales. EES now has $861 million in backlog, 85% of which is for crystalline silicon solar equipment. EES became profitable in the quarter and achieved a 14% operating margin.
Next, I'll make a few comments about our 2010 fiscal year performance. 2010 orders and revenue book grew substantially from last year, driven by a recovery in semiconductor and display equipment and continued growth in Solar. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per share, which is equivalent to $1.03 per share when excluding the EES inventory related charges taken in Q2 and Q3. 
For the fiscal year, Silicon Systems Group net sales were up 170%, adding $3.3 billion. And operating profit increased over 800%, reaching almost $1.9 billion. AGS net sales improved 34% to $1.9 billion, in line with wafer starts, higher utilization rates and increased 200-millimeter equipment spending. 
Display net sales rebounded in 2010, up almost 80% year-over-year to $899 million. And during the year, we restructured EES to improve profitability and focus on a rapidly growing Crystalline Silicon business. 
In 2010, Applied generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations after investing more than $1.1 billion in research and development. We also brought back $350 million in shares, increased our dividend by 17% and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and investments.
Next, I'll turn to our revenue outlook for fiscal 2011. We currently expect our overall net sales to be flat to modestly higher and within a range of plus or minus 10% year-over-year. We expect SSG net sales to be up modestly in fiscal 2011, primarily due to share gains and within a range of plus or minus 10%. 
While this moderate growth assumes an environment of flat wafer fab equipment investment, our wide range reflects the dependency on continued foundry spending and a second half ramp in NAND capacity additions. We expect spending by DRAM customers to soften considerably during the year. AGS net sales in fiscal 2011 are expected to be up in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year. We expect the primary drivers to be growth in spare parts and services resulting from wafer start additions.
We expect Display net sales to be down between 20% and 25% versus 2010. This reflects a downcycle in the first half of the year for LCD equipment investment, partially offset by higher investment to support equipment related to OLED and touchscreen-related devices. Upside to our sales forecast is possible with an acceleration of the LCD build-out in China.
In EES, we expect 2011 net sales to be down in the range of 20% to 30%. The major factor in the decreased outlook is the absence of any material revenue related to thin film solar. We are entering fiscal 2011 with strong demand for crystalline silicon solar equipment in the first half of the year. At this level, we expect EES to achieve above the post-restructuring model of greater than 10% operating margin throughout the year.
We expect our effective tax rate to drop four to five points from our 2010 rate of 32.4% as a result of the continuing phase-in of our Asian supply chain. 
Now I will cover our targets for the first quarter of 2011. We expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat, with risk in upside relatively balanced. AGS net sales are expected to be up modestly despite softening utilization rates. In Display, we believe net sales will be down approximately 40% as customers pause in line with end market softness. The first half of fiscal 2011 is expected to be a relatively weak period for LCD investments. 
We expect EES net sales to be down approximately 30% from Q4, which benefited from $225 million in SunFab revenue. Sales of crystalline solar equipment are expected to be up more than 10% in the quarter as the investment ramp continues in that market. 
Overall, we expect our Q1 net sales to be down between 8% and 15%. The absence of the large SunFab sign-up has an 8% impact quarter-over-quarter, and the lower Display outlook is about a 4% incremental impact. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34. In short, we see Q1 being a solid start to what we expect will be a strong fiscal year for Applied Materials. 
Now, Mike, let's open the call for questions."

PC, it still drives a huge amount of the DRAM capacity. We cannot target -- our view of flat WFE at about a 7% growth in PCs. And the percent growth versus percent of WFE is almost a 1:1 kind of relationship. So if PCs were up in the 10% to 15% range, we'd expect WFE to be up. The other thing we're really looking closely at is tablets because tablets and smartphones drive NAND spending. We're expecting 50 million tablets and 350 million or 400 million smartphones. That's kind of our flat scenario, more than that would drive higher wafer fab equipment spending. As George talked about, we think Q1 SSG will be pretty strong modestly, flat to up.

But if you took your SSG kind of guidance for Q1, and it's a flat line throughout the year. You're looking at a fiscal 2011 that's up well above 10%, let's say more around 15%. So I'm just wondering where do you think the potential pitfalls are in terms of the SSG business, either near term are in the back half of 2011? And my second question is if we're looking at a NAND-heavy spending environment in 2011, I'm wondering if you could kind of take a quick stab at how well you guys could outperform the market in SSG give increasing market share, as you pointed out, and maybe just natural market share being higher for some of these NAND manufacturers?"

It's just we're in a bit of an uncertain environment. And the big deal in my mind on this, the big pitfall or potential upside is all around DRAM and PC-related demand. So we feel like relative to -- we feel we're pretty much on the industry consensus between 5% and 10% in our estimates, that there's obviously been a lot of discussion of bigger numbers from people who know this business well like Intel and AMD. So if WFE stays as strong as it is at the beginning of the year, we'll have a stronger year. But the market is volatile, and it's hard to predict we'll hit 10%, I think. That's the key area and potential pitfall. Our estimate on our share growth is based on both foundry and NAND going up kind of together. We're excited in particular about etch gains in flash memory, that should be a big positive for us, deposition gains of course, as double patterning becomes a bigger part of the process. And one of the areas in 2010 that positively surprised as I think from the beginning of the year was our CMP position. We won a lot of share back in CMP. We have a great new product there, Reflexion GT, that improves productivity as being adopted. And of course, I did want to say that rare earth element constraints in the market are not going to slow down CMP, at least we don't think so. But anyway, that's kind of the picture. I'm not sure I answered all your questions, but maybe you do have a quick follow-up."

I'm pleased to report that Applied ended our fiscal year with an outstanding fourth quarter, and enter 2011 with positive momentum. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue to $2.9 billion, generated $700 million in operating profit and delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our target.
Reflecting on the year as a whole, I'm pleased with the progress we've made against our strategic plan. Our goals for 2010 were clear, capitalize on the recovery in our markets, gain share on our core businesses and achieve a new level of operating performance and profitability. We delivered in all three of these areas. We took advantage of the recovery in semiconductor and display equipment with revenue growth and an expected 2 points of share gain in wafer fab equipment spending.
We took aggressive actions to restructure our solar business, which enabled EES to achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. In addition, we made operational improvements throughout the organization that make us more efficient. These changes included opening new operation centers in Singapore and Taiwan; they are already improving customer delivery and gross margins.
Before I comment on the upcoming year, I'd like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their outstanding achievements during 2010.
While we are mindful of the fragile state of the global economy, we have a positive view of the markets we serve and expect the fundamental drivers of 2010 to remain in place next year. We see demand for consumer electronics remaining strong, led by the emerging markets.
PCs sales are projected to grow 5% to 10%, smartphones are forecasted to approach 400 million units, LCD TVs reaching 215 million units and tablets are expected to grow to 50 million units or greater.
Tablets are also leading the transition to solid state storage, and as a result we expect NAND bit growth to be in the range of 80% to 90% next year. This was projected to support more than $6 billion of equipment spending and NAND investment will likely surpass DRAM for the first time. In semiconductor equipment, we see PCs as the biggest swing factor in our wafer fab equipment forecast for next year.
We also see continued strength in solar, where installations are on track to grow at 20% to 30% in 2011; this growth is being driven by solid project returns even as feed-in tariffs decline. Let me now turn to each of our segments.
In Semiconductor, we expect WFE spending to finish this calendar year in the range of $29 billion to $30 billion, which is above our previous view of $26 billion to $28 billion. We anticipate next year's spending to be in line with 2010 plus or minus 10%.
Looking further ahead, we are now tracking 17 new fabs and fab expansion projects that represent about $60 billion of equipment spending over the next 8 to 12 quarters. We expect next year's foundry and logic spending to remain solid with an acceleration in NAND, helping to offset a pause in DRAM investment. NAND provides a number of market inflections that Applied can leverage to win further share. These customers were the first to adopt double patterning, which has enabled us to gain positional wins with our mask and brightfield inspection products.
Recent double patterning Etch wins will also contribute to our anticipated share growth next year. Then as NAND makers transition to the 3X node, our flowable CVD solution will be a key enabler for their multi-level cell architectures. SSG exits 2010 with momentum and we are on track to increase share in every one of our served markets. We expect to gain two points of share on overall WFE spending, which equates to roughly $600 million of revenue. We are especially pleased with our traction in Etch where we won a number of strategic orders and expect four points of share gain this year.
In PVD, we're increasing our position across all applications including copper barrier/seed and we had key production wins in the rapid growing metal gate area. In addition CMP and Semitool achieved revenue records in the fourth quarter. Our share gains are being fueled by new product innovations including 12 new products introduced over the past 12 months, and next year we expect about 20% of our revenue to come from these products.
We are particularly excited about our leadership in the rapidly growing wafer level packaging market, where we have won over two-thirds of the advanced packaging decisions this year. In 2011, we anticipate wafer starts to increase by approximately 4% year-over-year, and our Global Services business to grow faster than wafer starts. We are earning a larger share of business in Asia, a region that has traditionally been a challenge for service penetration.
In Display, we expect CapEx for 2010 to be 75% to 80% higher than in 2009, and in Q4, our Display group delivered one of the best quarters in its history. As the holiday season approaches we are seeing weakness in the end markets. TV makers are cutting prices to reduce inventory levels and we expect LCD CapEx to be down more than 20% next year. However, we believe we can outperform this overall trend with continued share gains in PVD and revenue growth from touch panel and OLED products.
Touch panel equipment alone represents a $200 million market opportunity next year. In EES, the fourth quarter was a tremendous end to a record year for Baccini and PWS businesses. Both businesses surpassed their previous peaks for quarterly revenue and orders, and we expect this record performance to be eclipsed in the first quarter of 2011.
Demand in the solar market remains extremely robust. We now believe panel installations will reach 16 gigawatts for the calendar year and expect 2011 installations to be in the 19 gigawatt to 21 gigawatt range. The top panel manufacturers are running at full utilization and are still adding capacity. Following a year that exceeded our expectations, we are projecting solar CapEx for 2011 to be approximately flat year-over-year in the range of 13 to 15 gigawatts, with each gigawatt of capacity representing over $200 million of equipment opportunity for Applied Materials.
China and Taiwan drove three quarters of this year's crystalline silicon capacity addition and now constitute 65% of capacity worldwide. Applied has higher market share in China than in the rest of the world, so this trend bodes well for our business.
In summary, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to an excellent year for Applied Materials. We delivered on our objectives and gained market share. We have reached profitability in our Energy and Environmental business and made operational improvement across the Company. We increased our R&D spending to $1.1 billion and exit the year with a pipeline of innovative products. This sets the stage for us to outperform our markets again in 2011. We enter the new year with a strong balance sheet that allows us to fund our innovation, maintain strategic flexibility and returning cash to stockholders.
Now, let me hand the call over to George, who will provide additional details about our performance and our outlook. George?

I also want to thank the employees of Applied Materials for their efforts to drive a very strong quarter and year for the Company. After a most difficult 2009, our employees around the world rallied to meet the challenges of a 90% ramp in revenue, while accelerating new product development, growing market share and improving the operating performance in all our businesses.
Now I'll start with a brief summary of our results for the fourth quarter. Orders were up 11% over Q3, driven by solar and semi equipment demand. This is our sixth consecutive growth quarter and our highest order level in almost 10 years. It is worth noting that China accounted for 32% of the orders led by our crystalline silicon customer.
Net sales grew 15%, well above our target range, with stronger than expected results in our solar, display and semiconductor equipment businesses. A SunFab sign-off of $225 million was the largest single contributor to higher than expected revenue growth in the quarter.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up 8 points on higher revenue and the absence of the inventory charge taken last quarter. The SunFab signoff lowered overall gross margin by 2 points.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $516 million were favorable to our target range due to an accelerated reduction of EES thin film related spending and the favorable impact of some discrete items.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $500 million to $520 million per quarter during the first half of fiscal 2011, down from our recent quarterly run rate of between $530 million and $540 million.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.36 per share, exceeding the high end of our range by $0.04. The increase was driven primarily by higher net sales and lower spending. The SunFab sign-off contributed approximately $0.02 of incremental earnings per share.
Operating cash flow was $525 million or 18% of sales. During the quarter, we increased our buyback to $150 million and used $93 million to pay a dividend of $0.07 per share.
The Silicon Systems Group had order growth in the quarter of 9% and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1%. Net sales increased 2% to $1.5 billion. Foundry customers once again led investment with growth in logic offsetting a decline in DRAM spending. We see this mix pattern continuing into the first half of 2011. Operating margins were strong at 38%, which included some increased R&D investments.
In AGS orders of $631 million reflected continuing demand for 200 millimeter systems. Net sales were up 10% in line with expectations and operating margins continued to be impacted by supply chain issues around 200 millimeter systems.
The Display Group concluded a cyclical growth year for LCD equipment with its highest net sales quarter of the year at $281 million. As we expected, Display orders were down 27% in the quarter, signaling a period of reduced spending for LCD equipment as customers absorb the 2010 capacity additions.
EES achieved record orders and revenues in the quarter. The SunFab sign-off and a 25% increase in crystalline silicon equipment were the primary drivers of higher sales. EES now has $861 million in backlog, 85% of which is for crystalline silicon solar equipment. EES became profitable in the quarter and achieved a 14% operating margin.
Next I'll make a few comments about our 2010 fiscal year performance. 2010 orders and revenue both grew substantially from last year driven by a recovery in semiconductor and display equipment and continued growth in solar. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per share, which is equivalent to $1.03 per share, when excluding the EES inventory related charges taken in Q2 and Q3. For the fiscal year, Silicon Systems Group net sales were up 170% adding $3.3 billion, and operating profit increased over 800% reaching almost $1.9 billion.
AGS net sales improved 34% to $1.9 billion in line with wafer starts, higher utilization rates, and increased 200 millimeter equipment spending. Display net sales rebounded in 2010, up almost 80% year-over-year to $899 million. During the year, we restructured EES to improve profitability and focus on our rapidly growing crystalline silicon business.
In 2010, Applied generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations after investing more than $1.1 billion in research and development. We also bought back $350 million in shares, increased our dividend by 17%, and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and investments.
Next I'll turn to our revenue outlook for fiscal 2011. We currently expect our overall net sales to be flat to modestly higher, and within a range of plus or minus 10% year-over-year. We expect SSG net sales to be up modestly in fiscal 2011 primarily due to share gains, and within a range of plus or minus 10%. While this moderate growth assumes an environment of flat wafer fab equipment investment, our wide range reflects the dependency on continued foundry spending and a second half ramp in NAND capacity additions. We expect spending by DRAM customers to soften considerably during the year.
AGS net sales in fiscal 2011 are expected to be up in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year. We expect the primary drivers to be growth in spare parts and services resulting from wafer start additions. We expect Display net sales to be down between 20% and 25% versus 2010. This reflects a down cycle in the first half of the year for LCD equipment investment, partially offset by higher investment to support equipment related to OLED and touch screen related devices.
Upside to our sales forecast is possible with an acceleration of the LCD build-out in China. In EES, we expect 2011 net sales to be down in the range of 20% to 30%. The major factor in the decreased outlook is the absence of any material revenue related to thin film solar. We are entering fiscal 2011 with strong demand for crystalline silicon solar equipment in the first half of the year. At this level, we expect EES to achieve above the post-restructuring model of greater than 10% operating margin throughout the year. We expect our effective tax rate to drop four to five points from our 2010 rate of 32.4% as a result of the continuing phase in of our Asian supply chain.
Now I will cover our targets for the first quarter of 2011. We expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat, with risk and upside relatively balanced.
AGS net sales were expected to be up modestly despite softening utilization rates. In Display, we believe net sales will be down approximately 40% as customers pause in line with end market softness. The first half of fiscal 2011 is expected to be a relatively weak period for LCD investment.
We expect EES net sales to be down approximately 30% from Q4, which benefited from $225 million in SunFab revenue. Sales of crystalline solar equipment are expected to be up more than 10% in the quarter as the investment ramp continues in that market.
Overall, we expect our Q1 net sales to be down between 8% and 15%. The absence of the large SunFab sign-off has an 8% impact quarter-over-quarter and the lower Display outlook is about a 4% incremental impact. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34.
In short, we see Q1 being a solid start to what we expect will be a strong fiscal year for Applied Materials.
Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.

PCs still drive a huge amount of the DRAM capacity. We've targeted our view of flat WFE at about 7% growth in PCs, and percent growth versus percent of WFE is almost one-to-one kind of relationship. So, if PCs were up in the 10% to 15% range, we'd expect WFE to be up. The other thing we're really looking closely out is tablets, because tablets and smartphones drive NAND spending. We're expecting 50 million tablets and 400 million smartphones. That's kind of our flat scenario, so more than that would drive higher wafer fab equipment spending. As George talked about, we think Q1 SSG will be pretty strong modestly, flat to up and so that kind of tells you how we see the start of the year, at least January start of the year in WFE.

My second question is, if we're looking at NAND heavy spending environment in 2011, I'm wondering if you could take a quick stab at how well you guys could outperform the market in SSG, given increasing market share as you pointed out and maybe just natural market share being higher for some of these NAND manufacturers. You can call it a follow-up.

It's just, we're in a bit of an uncertain environment and the big deal in my mind on this - the big pitfall or potential upside is all around DRAM and PC-related demand. We feel we're pretty much on the industry consensus between 5% and 10% in our estimate, but there has obviously been a lot of discussion of bigger numbers from people who know this business well like Intel and AMD. If WFE stays as strong as it is at the beginning of the year we'll have a stronger year, but the market is volatile and it’s hard to predict within 10% I think. That's the key area and potential pitfall. Our estimate on our share growth is based on both foundry and NAND going up together. We're excited in particular about Etch gains and Flash memory that should be a big positive for us. Deposition gains, of course, as double patterning becomes a bigger part of the process. The just one of the areas in 2010 that positively surprised us, I think from the beginning of the year, it was our CMP position; we won a lot of share back. In CMP, we have a great new product there Reflexion GT that improves productivity is being adopted, and of course, I did want to say that rare earth element constraints in the market are not going to slow down CMP. At least we don't think so. But anyway that's kind of the picture. I am not sure I answered all your questions, but maybe you do have a quick follow-up.

Then the third area is the movement towards wafer level packaging, where we've been able to put together a suite of products there that really helped the customers see how the integration of the various processes go together and we're quite bullish. We kind of added up all the wins in that space over the year, and there is - were some - we won basically over 60% of those decisions in our markets, and I think, there were some 65 decisions across the industry that we counted up this year, so that one - while that market isn't big yet, it really I think is a harbinger for positive future for our SSG products.

I'm pleased to report that Applied ended our fiscal year with an outstanding fourth quarter and enter 2011 with positive momentum. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue to $2.9 billion, generated $700 million in operating profit and delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our target.
Reflecting on the year as a whole, I'm pleased with the progress we've made against our strategic plan. Our goals for 2010 were clear: capitalize on the recovery in our markets, gain share in our core businesses and achieve a new level of operating performance and profitability. We delivered in all three of these areas.
We took advantage of the recovery in semiconductor and display equipment, with revenue growth and an expected two points of share gain in wafer fab equipment spending. We took aggressive actions to restructure our Solar Business, which enabled EES to achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. In addition, we made operational improvements throughout the organization that make us more efficient. These changes included opening new operation centers in Singapore and Taiwan that are already improving customer delivery and gross margins. 
Before I comment on the upcoming year, I'd like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their outstanding achievements during 2010.
While we are mindful of the fragile state of the global economy, we have a positive view of the markets we serve and expect the fundamental drivers of 2010 to remain in place next year. We see demand for consumer electronics remaining strong, led by the emerging markets. PC sales are projected to grow 5% to 10%, smartphones are forecast to approach 400 million units, LCD TVs reaching 215 million units and tablets are expected to grow to 50 million units or greater. 
Tablets are also leading the transition to solid-state storage. And as a result, we expect NAND bit growth to be in the range of 80% to 90% next year. This is projected to support more than $6 billion of equipment spending, and NAND investment will likely suppress DRAM for the first time. 
In semiconductor equipment, we see PCs as the biggest swing factor in our wafer fab equipment forecast for next year. 
We also see continued strength in Solar, where installations are on track to grow at 20% to 30% in 2011. This growth is being driven by solid project returns even as feed-in tariffs decline.
Let me now turn to each of our segments. In Semiconductor, we expect WFE spending to finish this calendar year in the range of $29 billion to $30 billion, which is above our previous view of $26 billion to $28 billion. We anticipate next year's spending to be in line with 2010, plus or minus 10%. 
Looking further ahead, we are now tracking 17 new fabs and fab expansion projects that represent about $60 billion of equipment spending over the next eight to 12 quarters. We expect next year's foundry and logic spending to remain solid, with an acceleration in NAND helping to offset a pause in DRAM investment. 
NAND provides a number of market inflections that Applied can leverage to win further share. These customers were the first to adopt double patterning, which has enabled us to gain positional wins with our mask and Brightfield inspection products. Recent double patterning etch wins would also contribute to our anticipated share growth next year. And as NAND makers transitioning to the 3x node, our flowable CVD solution will be a key enabler for their multilevel cell architectures. 
SSG exits 2010 with momentum, and we are on track to increase share in every one of our served markets. We expect to gain two points of share in overall WFE spending, which equates to roughly $600 million of revenue.
We are especially pleased with our traction in Etch, where we won a number of strategic orders and expect four points of share gain this year. In PVD, we're increasing our position across all applications, including copper barrier/seed. And we had key production wins in the rapid growing metal gate area. 
In addition, CMP and Semitool achieved revenue records in the fourth quarter. Our share gains are being fueled by new product innovations, including 12 new products introduced over the past 12 months. And next year, we expect about 20% of our revenue to come from these products.
We are particularly excited about our leadership in the rapidly growing wafer-level packaging market, where we have won over 2/3 of the advanced packaging decisions this year. In 2011, we anticipate wafer starts to increase by approximately 4% year-over-year and our global services business to grow faster when wafer starts. We are earning a larger share of business in Asia, a region that has traditionally been a challenge for service penetration. 
In Display, we expect CapEx for 2010 to be 75% to 80% higher than in 2009. And in Q4, our Display group delivered one of the best quarters in its history.
As the holiday season approaches, we are seeing weakness in the end markets. TV makers are cutting prices to reduce inventory levels. And we expect LCD CapEx to be down more than 20% next year. However, we believe we can outperform this overall trend with continued share gains in PVD and revenue growth from touch panel and OLED products. Touch panel equipment alone represents a $200 million market opportunity next year.
In EES, the fourth quarter was a tremendous end to a record year for our Baccini and PWS businesses. Both businesses surpassed their previous peaks for quarterly revenues and orders, and we expect this record performance to be eclipsed in the first quarter of 2011. 
Demand in the solar market remains extremely robust. We now believe panel installations will reach 16 gigawatts for the calendar year and expect 2011 installations to be in the 19 to 21-gigawatt range. The top panel manufacturers are running at full utilization and are still adding capacity. 
Following a year that exceeded our expectations, we are projecting Solar CapEx for 2011 to be approximately flat year-over-year, in the range of 13 to 15 gigawatts, with each gigawatt of capacity representing over $200 million of equipment opportunity for Applied Materials.
China and Taiwan drove three quarters of this year's crystalline silicon capacity addition and now constitutes 65% of capacity worldwide. Applied has higher market share in China than in the rest of the world. Service trend bodes well for our business. 
In summary, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to an excellent year for Applied Materials. We delivered on our objectives and gained market share. We have reached profitability in our Energy and Environmental business and made operational improvements across the company. We increased our R&D spending to $1.1 billion through the year with a pipeline of innovative products. This sets the stage for us to outperform our markets again in 2011. We enter the new year with a strong balance sheet that allows us to fund our innovation, maintain strategic flexibility and return cash to stockholders.
Now let me hand the call over to George who will provide additional details about our performance and our outlook. George?"

I also want to thank the employees of Applied Materials for their efforts to drive a very strong quarter and year for the company. After a most difficult 2009, our employees around the world rallied to meet the challenges of a 90% ramp in revenue, while accelerating new product developments, growing market share and improving the operating performance in all of our businesses.
Now I'll start with a brief summary of our results for the fourth quarter. 
Orders were up 11% over Q3, driven by solar and semi equipment demand. This is our sixth consecutive growth quarter and our highest order level in almost 10 years. It is worth noting that China accounted for 32% of the orders, led by our crystalline silicon customers. 
Net sales grew 15%, well above our target range, with stronger-than-expected results in our Solar, Display and Semiconductor Equipment businesses. A SunFab sign-up of $225 million was the largest single contributor to higher-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up eight points on higher revenue in the absence of the inventory charge taken last quarter. The SunFab sign-up lowered overall gross margin by two points. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $516 million were favorable to our target range due to an accelerated reduction of EES thin film-related spending and the favorable impact of some discrete items. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $500 million to $520 million per quarter during the first half of fiscal 2011, down from our recent quarterly run rate of between $530 million and $540 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.36 per share, exceeding the high end of our range by $0.04. The increase was driven primarily by higher net sales and lower spending. The SunFab sign-up contributed approximately $0.02 of incremental earnings per share. 
Operating cash flow was $525 million or 18% of sales. During the quarter, we increased our buyback to $150 million and used $93 million to pay a dividend of $0.07 per share.
The Silicon Systems Group had order growth in the quarter of 9% and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Net sales increased 2% to $1.5 billion. Foundry customers once again led investments, with growth in logic offsetting a decline in DRAM spending. We see this mixed pattern continuing into the first half of 2011. Operating margins were strong at 38%, which included some increased R&D investments.
In AGS, orders of $631 million reflected continuing demand for 200-millimeter systems. Net sales were up 10%, in line with expectations and operating margins continue to be impacted by supply chain issues around 200-millimeter systems. 
The Display group concluded a cyclical growth year for LCD equipment, with its highest net sales quarter of the year at $281 million. As we expected, Display orders were down 27% in the quarter, signaling a period of reduced spending for LCD equipment as customers absorb the 2010 capacity additions. 
EES achieved record orders in revenues in the quarter. The SunFab sign-off and a 25% increase in crystalline silicon equipment were the primary drivers of higher sales. EES now has $861 million in backlog, 85% of which is for crystalline silicon solar equipment. EES became profitable in the quarter and achieved a 14% operating margin.
Next, I'll make a few comments about our 2010 fiscal year performance. 2010 orders and revenue book grew substantially from last year, driven by a recovery in semiconductor and display equipment and continued growth in Solar. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per share, which is equivalent to $1.03 per share when excluding the EES inventory related charges taken in Q2 and Q3. 
For the fiscal year, Silicon Systems Group net sales were up 170%, adding $3.3 billion. And operating profit increased over 800%, reaching almost $1.9 billion. AGS net sales improved 34% to $1.9 billion, in line with wafer starts, higher utilization rates and increased 200-millimeter equipment spending. 
Display net sales rebounded in 2010, up almost 80% year-over-year to $899 million. And during the year, we restructured EES to improve profitability and focus on a rapidly growing Crystalline Silicon business. 
In 2010, Applied generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations after investing more than $1.1 billion in research and development. We also brought back $350 million in shares, increased our dividend by 17% and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and investments.
Next, I'll turn to our revenue outlook for fiscal 2011. We currently expect our overall net sales to be flat to modestly higher and within a range of plus or minus 10% year-over-year. We expect SSG net sales to be up modestly in fiscal 2011, primarily due to share gains and within a range of plus or minus 10%. 
While this moderate growth assumes an environment of flat wafer fab equipment investment, our wide range reflects the dependency on continued foundry spending and a second half ramp in NAND capacity additions. We expect spending by DRAM customers to soften considerably during the year. AGS net sales in fiscal 2011 are expected to be up in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year. We expect the primary drivers to be growth in spare parts and services resulting from wafer start additions.
We expect Display net sales to be down between 20% and 25% versus 2010. This reflects a downcycle in the first half of the year for LCD equipment investment, partially offset by higher investment to support equipment related to OLED and touchscreen-related devices. Upside to our sales forecast is possible with an acceleration of the LCD build-out in China.
In EES, we expect 2011 net sales to be down in the range of 20% to 30%. The major factor in the decreased outlook is the absence of any material revenue related to thin film solar. We are entering fiscal 2011 with strong demand for crystalline silicon solar equipment in the first half of the year. At this level, we expect EES to achieve above the post-restructuring model of greater than 10% operating margin throughout the year.
We expect our effective tax rate to drop four to five points from our 2010 rate of 32.4% as a result of the continuing phase-in of our Asian supply chain. 
Now I will cover our targets for the first quarter of 2011. We expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat, with risk in upside relatively balanced. AGS net sales are expected to be up modestly despite softening utilization rates. In Display, we believe net sales will be down approximately 40% as customers pause in line with end market softness. The first half of fiscal 2011 is expected to be a relatively weak period for LCD investments. 
We expect EES net sales to be down approximately 30% from Q4, which benefited from $225 million in SunFab revenue. Sales of crystalline solar equipment are expected to be up more than 10% in the quarter as the investment ramp continues in that market. 
Overall, we expect our Q1 net sales to be down between 8% and 15%. The absence of the large SunFab sign-up has an 8% impact quarter-over-quarter, and the lower Display outlook is about a 4% incremental impact. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34. In short, we see Q1 being a solid start to what we expect will be a strong fiscal year for Applied Materials.

But I think the things to look for, and I'll just tell you how we're looking at it and kind of the indicators we're looking at, the first one really is PCs. PCs still drive a huge amount of the DRAM capacity. We kind of targeted our view of flat WFE at about a 7% growth in PCs. And the percent growth versus percent of WFE is almost a 1:1 kind of relationship. So if PCs were up in the 10% to 15% range, we'd expect WFE to be up. The other thing we're really looking closely at is tablets, because tablets and smartphones drive NAND spending. We're expecting 50 million tablets and 350 million or 400 million smartphones. That's kind of our flat scenario, more than that would drive higher wafer fab equipment spending. As George talked about, we think Q1 SSG will be pretty strong modestly, flat to up.

That's the key area and potential pitfall. Our estimate on our share growth is based on both foundry and NAND going up kind of together. We're excited in particular about etch gains in flash memory, that should be a big positive for us, deposition gains of course, as double patterning becomes a bigger part of the process. And one of the areas in 2010 that positively surprised us I think from the beginning of the year was our CMP position. We won a lot of share back in CMP. We have a great new product there, Reflexion GT that improves productivity as being adopted.

The second one is conversion to copper in the memory companies. Semitool has done very well in that market, certainly won more than their standard share by a wide margin. And then the third area is the movement towards wafer-level packaging where we've been able to put together a suite of products there that really help the customers see how the integration of the various processes go together. And we're quite bullish. We kind of added up all the wins in that space over the year. And there were some -- we won basically over 60% of those decisions in our market, so I think there was some 65 decisions across the industry that we counted up this year. So while that market isn't big yet, it really, I think, is a harbinger for positive future for our SSG products."

I'm pleased to report that Applied ended our fiscal year with an outstanding fourth quarter and enter 2011 with positive momentum. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue to $2.9 billion, generated $700 million in operating profit and delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our target.
Reflecting on the year as a whole, I'm pleased with the progress we've made against our strategic plan. Our goals for 2010 were clear: capitalize on the recovery in our markets, gain share in our core businesses and achieve a new level of operating performance and profitability. We delivered in all three of these areas.
We took advantage of the recovery in semiconductor and display equipment, with revenue growth and an expected two points of share gain in wafer fab equipment spending. We took aggressive actions to restructure our Solar Business, which enabled EES to achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. In addition, we made operational improvements throughout the organization that make us more efficient. These changes included opening new operation centers in Singapore and Taiwan that are already improving customer delivery and gross margins. 
Before I comment on the upcoming year, I'd like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their outstanding achievements during 2010.
While we are mindful of the fragile state of the global economy, we have a positive view of the markets we serve and expect the fundamental drivers of 2010 to remain in place next year. We see demand for consumer electronics remaining strong, led by the emerging markets. PC sales are projected to grow 5% to 10%, smartphones are forecast to approach 400 million units, LCD TVs reaching 215 million units and tablets are expected to grow to 50 million units or greater. 
Tablets are also leading the transition to solid-state storage. And as a result, we expect NAND bit growth to be in the range of 80% to 90% next year. This is projected to support more than $6 billion of equipment spending, and NAND investment will likely suppress DRAM for the first time. 
In semiconductor equipment, we see PCs as the biggest swing factor in our wafer fab equipment forecast for next year. 
We also see continued strength in Solar, where installations are on track to grow at 20% to 30% in 2011. This growth is being driven by solid project returns even as feed-in tariffs decline.
Let me now turn to each of our segments. In Semiconductor, we expect WFE spending to finish this calendar year in the range of $29 billion to $30 billion, which is above our previous view of $26 billion to $28 billion. We anticipate next year's spending to be in line with 2010, plus or minus 10%. 
Looking further ahead, we are now tracking 17 new fabs and fab expansion projects that represent about $60 billion of equipment spending over the next eight to 12 quarters. We expect next year's foundry and logic spending to remain solid, with an acceleration in NAND helping to offset a pause in DRAM investment. 
NAND provides a number of market inflections that Applied can leverage to win further share. These customers were the first to adopt double patterning, which has enabled us to gain positional wins with our mask and Brightfield inspection products. Recent double patterning etch wins would also contribute to our anticipated share growth next year. And as NAND makers transitioning to the 3x node, our flowable CVD solution will be a key enabler for their multilevel cell architectures. 
SSG exits 2010 with momentum, and we are on track to increase share in every one of our served markets. We expect to gain two points of share in overall WFE spending, which equates to roughly $600 million of revenue.
We are especially pleased with our traction in Etch, where we won a number of strategic orders and expect four points of share gain this year. In PVD, we're increasing our position across all applications, including copper barrier/seed. And we had key production wins in the rapid growing metal gate area. 
In addition, CMP and Semitool achieved revenue records in the fourth quarter. Our share gains are being fueled by new product innovations, including 12 new products introduced over the past 12 months. And next year, we expect about 20% of our revenue to come from these products.
We are particularly excited about our leadership in the rapidly growing wafer-level packaging market, where we have won over 2/3 of the advanced packaging decisions this year. In 2011, we anticipate wafer starts to increase by approximately 4% year-over-year and our global services business to grow faster when wafer starts. We are earning a larger share of business in Asia, a region that has traditionally been a challenge for service penetration. 
In Display, we expect CapEx for 2010 to be 75% to 80% higher than in 2009. And in Q4, our Display group delivered one of the best quarters in its history.
As the holiday season approaches, we are seeing weakness in the end markets. TV makers are cutting prices to reduce inventory levels. And we expect LCD CapEx to be down more than 20% next year. However, we believe we can outperform this overall trend with continued share gains in PVD and revenue growth from touch panel and OLED products. Touch panel equipment alone represents a $200 million market opportunity next year.
In EES, the fourth quarter was a tremendous end to a record year for our Baccini and PWS businesses. Both businesses surpassed their previous peaks for quarterly revenues and orders, and we expect this record performance to be eclipsed in the first quarter of 2011. 
Demand in the solar market remains extremely robust. We now believe panel installations will reach 16 gigawatts for the calendar year and expect 2011 installations to be in the 19 to 21-gigawatt range. The top panel manufacturers are running at full utilization and are still adding capacity. 
Following a year that exceeded our expectations, we are projecting Solar CapEx for 2011 to be approximately flat year-over-year, in the range of 13 to 15 gigawatts, with each gigawatt of capacity representing over $200 million of equipment opportunity for Applied Materials.
China and Taiwan drove three quarters of this year's crystalline silicon capacity addition and now constitutes 65% of capacity worldwide. Applied has higher market share in China than in the rest of the world. Service trend bodes well for our business. 
In summary, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to an excellent year for Applied Materials. We delivered on our objectives and gained market share. We have reached profitability in our Energy and Environmental business and made operational improvements across the company. We increased our R&D spending to $1.1 billion through the year with a pipeline of innovative products. This sets the stage for us to outperform our markets again in 2011. We enter the new year with a strong balance sheet that allows us to fund our innovation, maintain strategic flexibility and return cash to stockholders.
Now let me hand the call over to George who will provide additional details about our performance and our outlook. George?"

I also want to thank the employees of Applied Materials for their efforts to drive a very strong quarter and year for the company. After a most difficult 2009, our employees around the world rallied to meet the challenges of a 90% ramp in revenue, while accelerating new product developments, growing market share and improving the operating performance in all of our businesses.
Now I'll start with a brief summary of our results for the fourth quarter. 
Orders were up 11% over Q3, driven by solar and semi equipment demand. This is our sixth consecutive growth quarter and our highest order level in almost 10 years. It is worth noting that China accounted for 32% of the orders, led by our crystalline silicon customers. 
Net sales grew 15%, well above our target range, with stronger-than-expected results in our Solar, Display and Semiconductor Equipment businesses. A SunFab sign-up of $225 million was the largest single contributor to higher-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, up eight points on higher revenue in the absence of the inventory charge taken last quarter. The SunFab sign-up lowered overall gross margin by two points. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $516 million were favorable to our target range due to an accelerated reduction of EES thin film-related spending and the favorable impact of some discrete items. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $500 million to $520 million per quarter during the first half of fiscal 2011, down from our recent quarterly run rate of between $530 million and $540 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.36 per share, exceeding the high end of our range by $0.04. The increase was driven primarily by higher net sales and lower spending. The SunFab sign-up contributed approximately $0.02 of incremental earnings per share. 
Operating cash flow was $525 million or 18% of sales. During the quarter, we increased our buyback to $150 million and used $93 million to pay a dividend of $0.07 per share.
The Silicon Systems Group had order growth in the quarter of 9% and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Net sales increased 2% to $1.5 billion. Foundry customers once again led investments, with growth in logic offsetting a decline in DRAM spending. We see this mixed pattern continuing into the first half of 2011. Operating margins were strong at 38%, which included some increased R&D investments.
In AGS, orders of $631 million reflected continuing demand for 200-millimeter systems. Net sales were up 10%, in line with expectations and operating margins continue to be impacted by supply chain issues around 200-millimeter systems. 
The Display group concluded a cyclical growth year for LCD equipment, with its highest net sales quarter of the year at $281 million. As we expected, Display orders were down 27% in the quarter, signaling a period of reduced spending for LCD equipment as customers absorb the 2010 capacity additions. 
EES achieved record orders in revenues in the quarter. The SunFab sign-off and a 25% increase in crystalline silicon equipment were the primary drivers of higher sales. EES now has $861 million in backlog, 85% of which is for crystalline silicon solar equipment. EES became profitable in the quarter and achieved a 14% operating margin.
Next, I'll make a few comments about our 2010 fiscal year performance. 2010 orders and revenue book grew substantially from last year, driven by a recovery in semiconductor and display equipment and continued growth in Solar. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per share, which is equivalent to $1.03 per share when excluding the EES inventory related charges taken in Q2 and Q3. 
For the fiscal year, Silicon Systems Group net sales were up 170%, adding $3.3 billion. And operating profit increased over 800%, reaching almost $1.9 billion. AGS net sales improved 34% to $1.9 billion, in line with wafer starts, higher utilization rates and increased 200-millimeter equipment spending. 
Display net sales rebounded in 2010, up almost 80% year-over-year to $899 million. And during the year, we restructured EES to improve profitability and focus on a rapidly growing Crystalline Silicon business. 
In 2010, Applied generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations after investing more than $1.1 billion in research and development. We also brought back $350 million in shares, increased our dividend by 17% and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and investments.
Next, I'll turn to our revenue outlook for fiscal 2011. We currently expect our overall net sales to be flat to modestly higher and within a range of plus or minus 10% year-over-year. We expect SSG net sales to be up modestly in fiscal 2011, primarily due to share gains and within a range of plus or minus 10%. 
While this moderate growth assumes an environment of flat wafer fab equipment investment, our wide range reflects the dependency on continued foundry spending and a second half ramp in NAND capacity additions. We expect spending by DRAM customers to soften considerably during the year. AGS net sales in fiscal 2011 are expected to be up in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year. We expect the primary drivers to be growth in spare parts and services resulting from wafer start additions.
We expect Display net sales to be down between 20% and 25% versus 2010. This reflects a downcycle in the first half of the year for LCD equipment investment, partially offset by higher investment to support equipment related to OLED and touchscreen-related devices. Upside to our sales forecast is possible with an acceleration of the LCD build-out in China.
In EES, we expect 2011 net sales to be down in the range of 20% to 30%. The major factor in the decreased outlook is the absence of any material revenue related to thin film solar. We are entering fiscal 2011 with strong demand for crystalline silicon solar equipment in the first half of the year. At this level, we expect EES to achieve above the post-restructuring model of greater than 10% operating margin throughout the year.
We expect our effective tax rate to drop four to five points from our 2010 rate of 32.4% as a result of the continuing phase-in of our Asian supply chain. 
Now I will cover our targets for the first quarter of 2011. We expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat, with risk in upside relatively balanced. AGS net sales are expected to be up modestly despite softening utilization rates. In Display, we believe net sales will be down approximately 40% as customers pause in line with end market softness. The first half of fiscal 2011 is expected to be a relatively weak period for LCD investments. 
We expect EES net sales to be down approximately 30% from Q4, which benefited from $225 million in SunFab revenue. Sales of crystalline solar equipment are expected to be up more than 10% in the quarter as the investment ramp continues in that market. 
Overall, we expect our Q1 net sales to be down between 8% and 15%. The absence of the large SunFab sign-up has an 8% impact quarter-over-quarter, and the lower Display outlook is about a 4% incremental impact. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34. In short, we see Q1 being a solid start to what we expect will be a strong fiscal year for Applied Materials.

But I think the things to look for, and I'll just tell you how we're looking at it and kind of the indicators we're looking at, the first one really is PCs. PCs still drive a huge amount of the DRAM capacity. We kind of targeted our view of flat WFE at about a 7% growth in PCs. And the percent growth versus percent of WFE is almost a 1:1 kind of relationship. So if PCs were up in the 10% to 15% range, we'd expect WFE to be up. The other thing we're really looking closely at is tablets, because tablets and smartphones drive NAND spending. We're expecting 50 million tablets and 350 million or 400 million smartphones. That's kind of our flat scenario, more than that would drive higher wafer fab equipment spending. As George talked about, we think Q1 SSG will be pretty strong modestly, flat to up.

That's the key area and potential pitfall. Our estimate on our share growth is based on both foundry and NAND going up kind of together. We're excited in particular about etch gains in flash memory, that should be a big positive for us, deposition gains of course, as double patterning becomes a bigger part of the process. And one of the areas in 2010 that positively surprised us I think from the beginning of the year was our CMP position. We won a lot of share back in CMP. We have a great new product there, Reflexion GT that improves productivity as being adopted.
