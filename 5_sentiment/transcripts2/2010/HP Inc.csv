In the first quarter, Hewlett-Packard achieved solid growth, gained market share in key markets and delivered good operating leverage. Year-over-year, HP grew revenue by 8% or 5% in constant currency, adding more than $2 billion to the top line. We expanded non-GAAP operating margins for the 19th quarter in a row. We generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations and repurchased $2.7 billion of stock this quarter.  We also executed on our cost initiatives and reinvested in the business. The net result of these efforts are non-GAAP EPS of $1.10. In 2009, despite the recession, digital content continued to grow at an explosive rate and in HP, we continued to innovate. We delivered new high-performing products with compelling value for customers. In Q1 as the server, PC and printer markets returned to growth, HP was positioned to capitalize and gain share in each of these markets. ESS [Enterprise Storage & Servers] grew 11% this quarter, fueled by 27% growth in industry-standard service. Our G6 servers give customers a short payback period and are being adopted more quickly than any previous generation, yet still only a fraction of the install base has been upgraded. Average selling prices continue to move up and we delivered over 30% operating leverage in this segment.PSG [Personal Systems Group] grew 20% over the prior year. Our innovative lineup of notebooks and TouchSmart PCs continue to push our share gains and ASPs higher as customers vote [ph] with their wallet. U.S. PC market grew more than 20% in the recent quarter and we've gained roughly four points of share in this market with expected gains in both consumer and commercial.In IPG [Imaging & Printing Group], consumer and commercial printer shipments grew 18% and 11% respectively this quarter. The printing market is improving and IPG is on the attack, focused on aggressively placing units with high page consumption. In Q1, wireless printers roughly doubled and ink-in-the-office products roughly tripled. Supplies revenue was up 40% in local currency over the previous year and 1% as reported. We expect supplies growth this year of low- to mid-single digits despite currency headwinds.We continue to execute our strategy in Managed Print Services, Retail Publishing and Digital Press. These businesses are strategic to us, given their growth profile and a very high attach rate to supplies. We saw continued stability in our Services business, which was down a modest 1% last year. The EDS integration remains ahead of plan. We have a large funnel and had key signings in the quarter. Services operating profits grew 21% over the previous year.Our Software business, which was flat from the previous year, had a healthy margin expansion of over three points from the prior year period. Financing grew 13% and delivered double-digit return on equity.Before I turn the call over to Cathy to review the financials, let me make just a few comments about the three areas where we are devoting a lot of effort. First our portfolio. I believe HP has the best and the broadest portfolio in the industry. We are number one or number two in virtually every category where we compete. We will continue to invest heavily to ensure that we maintain our technology advantage and align our portfolio to lead the evolution of the marketplace. The next-generation data center will be delivered by the company that can best leverage scale industry-standard hardware that is differentiated with software and financed and delivered via global services. Printed pages will be awarded to the company that can deliver the best quality, usability, speed and affordability. The PC business will be won by the company with scale, innovation, brand and global reach. As I consider the market trends and survey the competitive marketplace, I like HP's chances to win.Second, our market coverage. We address a $1.3 trillion IT market. The enterprise market represents roughly half of that. And even though HP sales force is roughly 50% larger than when I joined the company, we want to increase that number. We also have work to do to address the small and medium business customers both domestically and abroad, particularly in emerging markets. We are hiring now and will continue to invest in direct sales and channel partners to better reach these customers.Third, our cost initiatives. We have made substantial progress in leaning our cost structure and improving productivity with revenue per employee up double digits over the previous year. But there is still enormous opportunities in areas such as supply chain, overhead and service and support. We remain focused on rooting out these costs and will reinvest a portion of these savings to further increase our competitiveness and to build for the future. I am proud of what we achieved, I'm convinced that HP's best days lie ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Cathy."

We increased revenue, expanded margin, strengthened our balance sheet and generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. At the same time, we executed on our efficiency initiatives and invested for growth. Our results demonstrate the strength of our operating model, both the operating leverage from strong hardware growth and the resiliency of our recurring revenue. Compared with a year ago, total revenue in the first quarter was up 8% or up 5% in constant currency to $31.2 billion. On a regional basis, the Americas and Asia-Pacific showed strong year-on-year growth with revenue increasing 9% and 26%, respectively. In EMEA, revenue increased 1% from the prior year.Gross margins for the quarter were 22.8%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. The decline was due to strong growth in PC and printer hardware revenue partially offset by rate improvement in services.We continue to improve our cost structure, reducing non-GAAP operating expenses as a percent of revenue by one point year-over-year to 11.6% of revenue. The structural changes that yield these lower cost drive sustainable improvement and enable us to reinvest back into the business to fund innovation and expand our sales coverage.Non-GAAP operating profit increased 13% year-on-year to $3.5 billion with operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Non-GAAP net income increased almost $400 million to $2.7 billion or $1.10 per share.Looking at the details of our performance by business. During the first quarter, revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 4% to $6.2 billion. Supplies revenue grew 1% in dollars and 4% in local currency, and we saw the convergence of sell-in and sellout on a constant currency basis. Consumer hardware revenue increased 21%, and commercial hardware revenue grew 4% compared with the prior year quarter.Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue while driving double-digit hardware unit growth. Total printer unit shipments grew 16%, the largest increase in three years with consumer and commercial printer units growing 18% and 11%, respectively.We are reinvigorating the core business. The strong growth in our wireless and OfficeJet products shows that customers value innovation. In addition to placing more units, we are driving growth in long-term, high value annuity businesses such as Managed Print Services and Digital Press, which experienced double-digit growth this quarter.Operationally, IPG has made great progress in the last year and is well-positioned to grow share in 2010. We will continue to invest for growth and profitability through our commitment to innovation, targeted share gains and a focus on high-usage categories and high-value annuity businesses.At the same, we are focused on improving efficiency through initiatives to streamline our supply chain and lower product cost. These improvements create capacity to invest in unit placements while maintaining industry-leading profitability. While laser printer availability will be constrained through the second quarter, we do expect to achieve double-digit unit growth for the full fiscal year in both ink and laser hardware.Services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Within Services, the IT Outsourcing business grew at 2%, Application Services declined 8%, BPO declined 3% and Technology Services declined 2%. We have a solid funnel of deals and continue to deliver strong customer satisfaction.  The EDS integration is going well and this has significantly enhanced our competitive position. Segment operating profit in the quarter increased $240 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion or 15.8% of revenue, driven by synergies from the EDS acquisition. We remain focused on driving operational improvement in the business via efficiency initiative, process standardizations and automation. Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11% compared with the prior year and up 4% sequentially, well ahead of normal seasonality.The ESS results were driven by strong performance in ISS which increased its revenue by 27% from the prior year. The strength in ISS was partially offset by Storage and Business Critical Systems which experienced year on year declines of 3% and 22%, respectively.The latest generation ISS platform continues to deliver a compelling value proposition for customers with over 3/4 of server shipment volumes now coming from G6. Blades also delivered strong revenue growth increasing 24% from the prior year and revenue for our innovative Virtual Connect product grew more than 100% this quarter. With improved performance in the business, we are seeing positive operating leverage in the ESS model. This quarter, the business delivered over $500 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.6%, an increase of 230 basis points from the prior year.  HP software revenue was $878 million, flat compared with the prior year. On the bottom line, the Software business expanded its margins 310 basis points, delivering 19 points of operating margin in the first quarter.Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 20% from the prior year to $10.6 billion. The U.S. and emerging countries all delivered strong year-on-year growth and we saw balanced growth across each of our product categories with particular strength in consumer demand during the holidays.Total unit shipments increased 26% year-on-year with notebook unit growth of 37% and desktop systems growth of 13%. Average selling prices declined at a more normalized rate of 5% compared with the prior year.Segment operating profit totaled $530 million or 5% of revenue as PSG continues to deliver solid performance and share gains, driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach.Rounding out the segments. HP's Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the first quarter, financing revenue grew 13% to $719 million and generated operating margin of 9.3%, up 290 basis points from the prior year.Now onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong and we made solid improvements in working capital management year-over-year. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $13.7 billion. Our Q1 cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down 13 days from a year ago and our channel inventory is in good shape. Compared with a year ago, we more than doubled our cash flow generating $2.4 billion in cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion in free cash flow during Q1. We continue to actively repurchase share, returning to $.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend.  And now a few comments on our outlook. For the second fiscal quarter, we expect revenue to be approximately $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.03 to $1.05. Included in these estimates for Q2 is approximately $0.04 of OI&E expense, a tax rate of approximately 22% and an expectation for a modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding.Turning to the full fiscal year, we are raising our revenue and earnings outlook. We now anticipate revenue of approximately $121.5 billion to $122.5 billion, representing roughly 6% to 7% growth, up from our prior outlook of 3% to 4% revenue growth.Non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $4.37 to $4.44, representing an increase of 14% to 15% over the prior year.In summary, we are winning in the marketplace, executing on our cost initiatives and investing for growth. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

We didn't have anything from a sequential perspective that was particularly different from normal seasonality. The year-over-year improvement, of course, is off of Q1 which was obviously a high point last year. In terms of the commodity environment, we definitely saw tightness and pricing pressure in commodities particularly in memory. To be frank, we expected that I think we've called that out actually in our Q4 earnings call. We were able to increase some prices to adjust for that. And you did see sequential ASP improvement in PCs as an example and also in industry-standard servers. In terms of commodities going forward, we expect that to continue to have upward pressure. But will remind you that in tight supply environments, we actually tend to do pretty well. In fact, we gained more share in these types of environments simply because we've got a real competency around managing our supply. We've got great relationships with suppliers and we've got the scale that matters. And so we anticipate the uptick for the rest of the year. But we're well able to manage it."

And sort of in a strange way, I think 2009 was a blessing for us. It really got us operationally focused. And obviously, as you see by the unit growth, probably our best unit growth number in a long time. To be blunt, I wish we had more stuff. We could have placed more lasers, we could have placed more ink units in the quarter. We did our best to handle the demand that we saw. Demand was linear and was good across the quarter. I would tell you that supplies, as you've seen on a sell out basis. Now this is local currency, make sure I'm clear, Ben. Local currency sellout was also the best number we've seen in the long time. So we got to mid-single digits there. It's a bit complicated because you have the local currency 4% growth. And then because of our hedging, you get to a 1% reported growth. It's important to note that in what we've said today, we are actually raising that 1% in reported dollars higher, even with that currency headwinds. So unit places placements are a part of that. And frankly, the fact that we are able to deliver at the high-end of our profit range in the context of being able to deliver the set of 16% unit growth is something that very bluntly two years ago we couldn't have done. And I think it shows the kind of strategic work we've done to get the segment in the position we've had. We had tremendous demand in the Wireless segment. The Wireless segment roughly doubled. And I think importantly, with some of the laser issues that you've heard, our OfficeJet business tripled. So our ability to put ink into the office has been a really pleasant thing for us overall. So when you look at the whole market, the supply sellout on the local currency basis, you look at the demand on the printing units, you look at our ability to perform from an operating profit perspective relative to all that, we feel IPG is in strong shape."

And the outputs in R&D really are helping to give a win in the marketplace. The innovation that we see. Whether that's around the G6 Blade, the slate products that we've announced the web-connected printer, kind of on and on, we've got good new products coming out that are helping us win in the market and our market share gains frankly prove that. But then there are also the inputs into R&D, and you want to make sure that you're investing in the most efficient way that you can. And what we have found is that there are real opportunities to think about R&D as a series of processes and make sure that we're doing those processes in an efficient way. For example, if you think about lab, if you've got a bunch of little ones all over the world with a bunch of equipment in, and you've basically got depreciation expenses in, that's one kind of flow. If you go to a more virtualized environment, that's going to be a much more efficient flow. It didn't change the amount of innovation that the R&D engineers are doing. It just simply changed the process and the dollars associated with the process. So you got those types of savings that you get in R&D. And then you also -- R&D gets allocated both real estate and IT expenses. And as those have come down at the total company level, obviously R&D benefits from that. The key here is that we've got good roadmaps going forward. We continue to put in the right level of investment into the innovation in our R&D spend."

R&D was one of the biggest consumers of overhead in the company. That's sort of one point. Second point, we're in a mode to look for processes that we can standardize. Simple things like testing and QA. How many development tools we've got. All of these have been because of acquisitions very random and very unique and very, if you will, siloed. So our ability to get standardized on those processes, give us an opportunity to take out cost and the way we look at R&D, is we don't look to Cathy's point, we look at R&D in a context of overhead, maintenance and innovation. What we're trying to do is get the innovation dollars up. So when you look at the total R&D spend, it's down and yet the yield to the product roadmap is up. So when you look at the number of introductions of products that have had meaningful change in share positions. That number is actually up for us and that's what we want to measure. We want to get more innovative products into the market sooner. So I think the way you should think about it, is just like somebody asking me if more field selling cost, means more sales people and the answer is no. Because you have to break down all of the costs that sit in the R&D bucket or the field selling cost bucket. We've had times in the company historically where field selling cost goes up but sales headcount doesn't. And you have to peel back these numbers to understand. So I'll give you a long answer to just simply say we feel good about our opportunity in R&D to get innovative, exciting products to the market like what we've seen this year that have gained share. As we talked about salespeople, we have a lot of opportunity to get our great portfolio in front of more customers. And that's why it's important to us and you may actually have seen parts of field selling costs go down. At same time, sales headcount go up. And it's the same phenomena of us making sure we're as effective as we can be and we have our money in the right place."

Hewlitt-Packard had an exceptional quarter. Year over year we added $3.5 billion of growth and over $500 million of net earnings. Revenue of $30.8 billion was up 13% over the prior year.

Year over year we added $3.5 billion of growth and over $500 million of net earnings. Revenue of $30.8 billion was up 13% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 was up 27% and operating margins of 11.2% were up 80 basis points over the prior year.
Our growth this quarter was broad based. America’s and Asia Pacific each posted solid double-digit growth. Europe also grew double digits, performing better than historical seasonality. After many customer deferred hardware purchases in 2009, we are seeing strong growth in a number of our businesses.
Industry standard service grew 54%, Core growth, 31%, EC’s 21%, Storage 16%, Consumer printer hardware 16% and commercial printer hardware growth 13%. We achieved this growth while investing in sales coverage and R&D, executing our transformation initiatives and absorbing 3Com.
Our Enterprise business had solid growth this quarter fueled by ESS, which grew 31% over the prior year. We have built and acquired many assets over the recent years to serve our enterprise customers. We now have the industry’s premier personal hardware, Software and global services to deliver converged infrastructure and to manage and transform customer’s IT environments.
A good example of converged infrastructure is our Blade platform, which is the industry leader, with over 50% share. An HP Blade chassis can accommodate industry standard blades, mission critical blades, storage blades, even TC blades, all designed to maximize computing density and minimizing wiring and power consumption.
We then can virtualize the networking ports with virtual connect and for all the ports that are needed, we have cache HP networking gear, which has been significantly broadened and enhanced with the acquisition of 3Com. Add to that the Software to automate the data center and global services, and it’s clear we’re uniquely positioned to win. 
Our Services business has made great progress integrating EDS and we see the results both in our pipeline of opportunities and improved margins. That being said, we still have more work to fully capture the enormous opportunity.
The Imaging and Printing group delivered a solid 8% growth with double digit revenue growth in consumer and commercial hardware, and 6% growth in supplies. IPG continues to make significant progress in placing units with high page consumption, which is ink in the office, wireless and graphics, each of which grew more than 30%.
We installed roughly 2,400 retail photo kiosks this quarter and expect roughly 7,000 placements by year-end. Managed print services had strong signings and indigo press pages grew 26%. We continue to make significant investments in this business while delivering 17.2% operating margin.
The Personal Systems group had another solid quarter, balancing revenue and profitability. We grew revenues 21% and expanded the operating margins. In Q2, we announced our intent to acquire Palm in order to enhance our intellectual property in the fast growing and profitable connected mobility space.
After closing the acquisition, we expect to leverage Web OS and the apps store beyond smart phones into form factors such as slates and web connected printers.
Before I turn the call over to Cathy to review the financials, let me reiterate the three reasons why I’m so confident in HP’s future. First, our broad market portfolio. HP is the only company with significant IP, global scale and market leadership in servers, storage, networking, Software and services, to deliver the next generation data center. HP is winning in the market, investing in innovation and moving deeper into high growth segments like networking and mobility. 
Second, our ability to leverage scale and global reach. The global demographics are rapidly changing with the fast growing middle class population migrating to large cities in emerging markets. In fact, over the next 20 years, the pace of urbanization is estimated to be at the rate of about 60 million people a year.
This class of people will expect to be seamlessly and securely connected to the global community with mobile devices and the underlying infrastructure. As the largest IT Company in the world delivering products and services in over 170 countries, we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.
Third, our track record of successfully transforming ourselves. Over the past five years, numerous transformational initiatives have helped HP better serve our customers and profitably grow our business. The results speak for themselves.
However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and that’s good news. Ongoing transformations in areas like supply chain, sales coverage and service delivery offer outstanding opportunities for growth and for margin expansion.
We’re proud of what we’ve achieved. We’re investing aggressively in the future to create a meaningful competitive advantage for years to come.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Cathy.

HP delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter. We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthened our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow.
At the same time, we executed on our transformational initiatives and invested for growth. Our results demonstrate the strength of our operating model and the consistency of execution. Compared with a year ago, total revenue in the second quarter was $30.8 billion, up 13% including four point of favorable currency impact.
On a geographical basis, we delivered double-digit growth in every region with the Americas and EMEA each growing 11% and Asia Pacific increasing 19%. On a constant currency basis, the America’s, EMEA and Asia Pacific were up 9%, 7% and 10% respectively.
The second quarter gross margin was 23.5% flat with the prior year. Sequentially the gross margin increased 70 basis points, in line with normal seasonality.
Turning to expenses, we are investing in a number of strategic initiatives to expand our sales and go to market capabilities while continuing to drive productivity. Operating expenses increased 5% to $3.8 billion, demonstrating both our operating leverage and the acceleration of our investments to drive long-term growth including building out our enterprise sales force and further strengthening our product portfolio.
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 22% year over year to $3.5 billion with operating margin expansion of 80 basis points. Non-GAAP net income increased over $500 million to $2.6 billion or $1.09 per share.
Looking at the details of our performance by business; during the second quarter revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 8% to $6.4 billion. Consumer hardware revenue increased 16%, commercial hardware revenue grew 13% compared with the prior year quarter, and Supplies posted solid 6% growth.
Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17.2% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments grew 9% with consumer printer units up 15%. Commercial printer units declined 8% reflecting constrained product availability.
During the quarter, laser printer average selling prices increased as we focused on placing high value units. We expect laser jet system availability to improve significantly in Q3 with more than 30% year over year unit growth next quarter. For the year, we still expect double-digit unit growth for both in ink jet and laser jet printers.
We continue to gain significant traction in our growth initiatives with management services, retail publishing and commercial graphics, each delivering double-digit growth. Management services had multi-million dollar wins in every geography across diverse industries including Financial Services, telecommunications and transportation.
HP’s management service offering is being recognized by customers and industry analysts for its industry leading management tools and infrastructure and its ability to deliver focused solutions for customers. 
Retail publishing has had several large wins, installing approximately 2,400 systems this quarter. In our commercial graphics business, growth accelerated across the portfolio with digital press impressions up 26% from prior year.
Services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Within services, the IT outsourcing business grew 6% with strength in the government and Financial Services sectors. In addition, we continue to see a significant increase in the level of product pull through into our accounts.
Revenue in both technology services and business process outsourcing was flat compared with prior year and applications services declined 2%. That said, both application services and BPO saw solid signings in the quarter.
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased $208 million year over year to $1.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue driven by synergies from the EDS acquisition. 
Over the last 18 months, we have made significant progress with EDS integration. We have extended our customer relationships, improved utilization and expanded our operating margins. That said, we have more opportunity to transform this business.
We will continue to invest in delivering innovative service offerings for our customers while at the same time, driving efficiency, process standardization and automation to further enhance our competitiveness.
Enterprise storage and server revenue was $4.5 billion, up 31% compared with the prior year with balanced growth across every region. The ESS results were driven by exception performance in IASA, which increased its revenue by 54% from the prior year. This was partially offset by the business critical systems revenue decline of 17%.
ESS blades delivered strong revenue growth, increasing 45% from the prior year and the virtual connect revenue more than doubled. We continue to be the market leader in servers with 37% market share in X86 servers, in share again year over year.
Our G6 platforms delivered strong performance and we recently launched our G7 platform as customers continue to demand a differentiated performance based on industry standards that HP is uniquely positioned to provide.
Storage revenue increased 16% from the prior year driven by solid growth in high end and entry storage arrays and significant growth in our scale out I Skuzzy products based on technology acquired from Left-hand Networks.
With improved performance in the business, we are seeing positive operating leverage in ESS model. This quarter, the business delivered $571 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.6%, an increase of 540 basis points from the prior year.
With the close of 3Com this quarter, we are accelerating our investments in networking. HP networking, which is reported in the corporate investment segment recorded organic growth of 31% or 58% growth including a partial quarter of 3Com results.
HP Software revenue was $871 million, down 1% compared with the prior year. License growth improved this quarter with particular strength in the BTO applications portfolio. On the bottom line, the profitable business expanded its margins 80 basis points, delivering 18.6 points of operating margin in the second quarter.
Turning to Personal Systems, TSG revenue increased 21% from the prior year to $10 billion with Notebook and desktop revenue up 17% and 27% respectively and work station revenue up 47%. Regionally, we saw balanced growth across every geography. Total unit shipments increased 20% year over year with notebook unit growth of 19% and desktop systems growth of 23%. 
We entered in several new consumer and business products this quarter including a new consumer all in one desktop with 12 core Z200 work stations and our lightest elite book commercial note book to date.
Segment operating profit totaled $465 million or 4.7% of revenue as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach.
Rounding out the segments, HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong, consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $755 million and generated operating margin of 9.1%, up 190 basis points from the prior year.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow; our balance sheet remains strong and we made solid improvements in working capital management year over year. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.3 billion. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down seven days from a year ago, and our channel inventory is in good shape.
We generated solid cash flow in the quarter with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. We continue to actively repurchase shares returning $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. Finally, we paid a quarterly dividend totaling $196 million.
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. The currency markets have been volatile and we are assuming that exchange rates stay roughly where they were last week with the Euro in the mid 120’s. Taking into consideration our hedging strategies and exposure to a wide basket of currencies, we now expect third quarter revenue of $29.7 billion to $30 billion and a full year revenue growth of 8% to 9%.
Included in this outlook are unfavorable sequential currency impacts of approximately 2% from Q2 to Q3 and approximately 1% from Q3 to Q4.
Regarding earnings, our outlook includes both the absorption of the $0.03 incremental legal settlement recorded in the first quarter but not previously included in our full  year outlook and the diluted associated with the 3Com acquisition. While we have not included the revenue impact of 3Com in our outlook we expect t be able to absorb the dilution associated with the acquisition in our full year non-GAAP earnings. 
The other variables to consider in our earnings outlook are; an expected expense of about $0.04 per quarter, a tax rate of approximately 22% and weighted average shares outstanding to decline slightly in the second half of fiscal ’10.
With that in mind, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.50 representing growth of 16% to 17% for the year.
With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

I think it’s important to note we saw the demand picture improve in Europe across countries. It wasn’t four or five countries. It was across countries and it was across segment, product segment. So it was very broad based for us and so we went in also, and ended the quarter in a very attractive channel position in Europe as well.
So I think overall we felt good about it and I can tell you when I haven’t felt good about Europe, which is over the past several quarters in terms of its behavior relative to what we’ve seen in the America’s and Asia, so I think we feel good about that.

But again, like we’ve said before, all of our acquisitions regardless of where they are, have a pretty extensive filter in terms of making they’re strategically sensible, financially sensible, and that we can actually operate and get some incremental leverage in operating performance out of it.
So it’s got to get all three filters. I think in this case of Palm, and our planned acquisition of Palm, it really has more to do with the intellectual property and in the fact that when you look across the HP ecosystem of interconnected devices, it is a large family of devices.
When we think of printers, you’ve now got a whole series of web-connected printers that as they connect to the web, need an OS. We prefer to have that OS in our case to be our IP where we can control the customer experience as we always have in the printing business, and that’s a big deal to us.
You could certainly make the same case for smaller form factor products in the mobile world like Slate and some other products. And again, I don’t want to tell you that we’re not going to have - Microsoft is probably one of the best relationships we’ve got in our company, and they’re still extremely important.
There are a couple of form factors though that are very attractive for us and small form factors where we think the IT can be very additive to us. So it isn’t precisely built a smart phone play. I’ve seen some people that clearly it’s a $45 billion total available market that is growing, so that is an attractive market.
But it is for us strategically broader in the context of the number of HP interconnected devices where we can leverage the IP, and that’s what we plan to do.

Again, we have a continuation of strong performance in what we call pro curve HP networking. Edge products, wireless products saw 31% in the quarter. That’s organic, obviously very strong for us.
Simultaneously, it’s important to note that we’ve been building software capabilities in ESN. We talk about this product call Virtual Connect. It is nothing more complicated that - most of the networking market is sold by number of ports. Those ports aren’t always fully utilized. Virtual Connect actually virtualizes those ports.
So as a rudimentary example, if a customer is usually buying 10 ports, we can virtualize them and perhaps reduce that by 30% to 40% so they now need six ports. Our strategy is then to come in with the best performing products and the best TCO in the industry to then actually work with the customer on those ports.
Historically, we’ve been on the edge of wireless. Now with 3Com, we can do the exact same thing in the data center. So for us, we’ve had a very good start with 3Com. We have been aggressive in hiring, hiring has started, and hiring is ramping.
In the quarter, 3Com, we closed two fortune logo accounts with 3Com products in the data center. We also had a number of very significant wins on what you would think of as the traditional pro curve line, and had a very strong virtual connect quarter as well.
So the reason I bring that up to you is to give you context that our networking strategy isn’t a 3Com strategy. It’s not a pro curve strategy. It’s not a virtual connect strategy. It’s an all of those capabilities brought together across the HP portfolio and it’s why we talk about this converged infrastructure; that the ability to leverage IT from the server family, the storage family and the networking family became so integral to our overall story.
So we think a very good start, we’re very excited about it. We’ve installed products. The 3Com technology is now in our data centers and is now performing our networking tasks. We plan to do more and more of that and so we feel very excited about it, and specialist hiring is ramping.

I’m not thrilled with the Q2 unit numbers, but I am pretty pleased with the types of units we put in the market. The ASP’s were up significantly in lasers, so the units we could get, we got the right units from a printer placement perspective.
So I think you should expect a very strong back half in laser and a very strong Q3 and we have good line of sight and good visibility of that going into the quarter. Demand has continued to be strong.
I think when you talk about the broader printing business, a very strong quarter for us. Obviously in placements again. We felt very good about our ink lineup of products. The growth in wireless printing and web-connected printers continues to be very strong. So I think IPG very strong in ink.
As we mentioned in our script, and our opening messages, the position in retail photo kiosks is a big deal. We installed as many retail photo kiosks in the quarter as we had for the entire life of the product, so for us this was a doubling of that base. We plan to exit at over 7,000 as we exit the year.
Managed print services had another very significant quarter, and again, the importance of those two businesses for us are, those are long-term businesses. Management services, five-year contracts, retail photo kiosks nine to ten years, 100% connect of supplies for those products and they are becoming, beginning to be a meaningful part of our portfolio.
So I think across IPG, when you look at the supplies growth we reported which is the dollar number as opposed to the local number, and the local number would have been yet higher. Overall, we felt very good about the IPG quarter. 
We’ve worked hard to get the business in a position to be able to do what we’ve just reported. The one thing we really want to the get done is what you opened with. We want to get the laser printer number into a position where we’re driving unit growth and the demand is there.

We feel really good about the services business. Now, remembering that you’ve got a blend of technology services and what you would think of more as outsourcing services around absent ITO in the same bucket there. The maintenance piece of the business does react more to the hardware sales and there’s a lagging affect on hardware sales as a result in terms of growth. So that’s sort of one point.
Second, we’ve been spending a lot of time getting the business right. We have seen very strong improvement in our pipeline. We exited the year with very strong signings. We expect to have a very strong signings year this year, so when you look at our pipeline and you look at where we’re at, we feel very good about the position of the business.
Let me go further just to give you a little bit more color. We have spent a lot of time over the past year and a half really operationalizing the business, getting underneath issues in the business, opportunities in the business. And I think the team for the most part has done a very good job. We certainly improved our profitability, improved our cost structure, and better aligned our costs with our revenue.
That said, as what happens in most things, as we’ve gotten deeper into details, the opportunity we think is even better, and we’re in a process of working through this right now. These are things like how we automate and drive forward on our data centers, how we align and drive our tools strategy going forward.
And I won’t go into too much detail because of the time on the call, but I will at a future period of time. There are material opportunities for us in the business to improve it and we will invest into that to get that right, and we think that plays along with our opportunity to grow the business and our opportunity to scale the business. 
So don’t take anything away from this other than we think we’ve got a major opportunity in the business and we feel very good about the position. And I think you are right, in your analytic. I wouldn’t necessarily ascribe it to this hardware result in terms of driving the services business and those kind of growth rates, but we certainly expect it to grow at and above market.

We obviously had very strong workstation growth in the quarter. We had very strong desktop business, desktop growth in the quarter.
When we look at what’s coming up from a data perspective, we gained eight points of share in the U.S. enterprise in the last quarter. That’s the second or third quarter that we’ve seen very large gains in terms of enterprise share, and that puts us in a pretty good position we think that if this corporate refresh accelerates, this will be very good news for us.
What we modeled is more of the same. We have not modeled some big corporate refresh coming that’s sort of sequentially better than what we’ve seen. What we have seen though is some improvements in our funnel, some improvements in our performance in the areas that I’ve described, some quicker times to decisions. That’s a very important thing, and the fact that decisions seem to be getting made a little bit faster than they were a year ago.
But if there is a spike, obviously given the share position and the things that we’re describing, this certainly would be good news.

Some of that is frankly the commodity environment and the commodity environment as you can imagine in 2009, many of the commodity providers particularly memory providers, really clamped down on CapEx.
So when you look at their capacity today, their capacity is well as demand is increasing. That of course increases the price in some of the commodity areas. Typically, as you know, we do very well in environments like this from a procurement perspective and alignment of supply. That said, there is a passing through of those commodity prices which you’ve seen across the board from those companies in the industry and that is having some effect on ASP’s.
In addition to your point, some of this better performance you’re seeing in some areas like business desktops and work stations, that mix is also affecting the aggregate ASP as well, so that is also a benefit that you’re seeing going on in the quarter and what’s transpiring.
In terms of margins, we’ll continue to balance growth and profitability and make sure we hit the right optimal point within it. Remember for us, we think about the PC business more broadly than we do the PC business just in isolation. The PC business really is the procurement arm for almost the entire company from a product perspective.
We leverage the common parts across almost all of our infrastructure, so for us we think about it not just in the context of operating performance, but the leverage and the position it gives to the entire company.
So I think it’s generally good news in terms of the growth that you’re seeing in the market, the ASP improvements that you’re seeing. There is a tighter commodity environment and we’ll continue to balance it as we go forward in terms of optimizing growth and profitability.

Cathy mentioned earlier Tipping Point on the data intrusion side, but its security on the product level, on the services level, on the architectural level. So we continue to focus in these areas. 
Some of the acquisitions that you’ve described, and I won’t go into them, are frankly not that intriguing to us and are not that relevant to our strategy, which really is around this whole automation management place where we think, directly affects our converged infrastructure business on side, and also helps automate our services on the other.
So our software business has three strategic objectives for HP. We try to sell them as individual products and data center transformation. We try to integrate them with our converged infrastructure. At the same time, we try to use them as the baseline for our tools capability to automate our services.
We try to do all three at the same time and will continue to look for organic ways and other ways to continue to improve our capabilities in those areas, and that’s what we’re thinking about.

So I want to make sure this is not trivial issue, that we’ve been able to absorb the start up of the management print services businesses. We’ve been able to install these retail photo kiosks, which are very similar to the printer model, but bigger units. We forecast a growth of, take the unit growth ink jet.

To your point about supplies, it’s been strong. It’s good news. And I think it’s also not just the unit placement. As we’ve talked before, getting the right units placed is actually more important than the number of units that get placed and to some degree, I think you saw that show up in Q as well. 
When you look at the ASP’s in the laser business, let me flip it around. What we were able to focus on, was getting the right units out and that did pay dividends within the context of the number that we just clearly wish was better.
Okay, let me wrap it up here. I think the conclusion of it for us is we feel very good about the broad based growth in the quarter. 13% growth we think for us is a good result. Not only the fact that we grew 13% but the fact that it was contributed to across regions and across our businesses, we think was extremely positive.
We are a stronger company today, and I want to emphasize that based on our portfolio, our scale and our consistent execution. At the same time, we have more work to do to transform ourselves to reach our potential, so as good as we feel in some respects about what we’ve done, we are still not to our full potential, and we feel good about our position which gives us the confidence as we’ve described to raise our outlook from where we previously had it.

Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 was up 27%, and operating margins of 11.2% were up 80 basis points over the prior year. 
Our growth this quarter was broad-based. Americas and Asia-Pacific each posted solid double-digit growth. Europe also grew double digits, performing better than historical seasonality. After many customers deferred hardware purchases in 2009, we are seeing strong growth in the number of our businesses. Industry Standard Servers grew 54%; ProCurve grow 31%; PCs, 21%; Storage, 16%; consumer printer hardware, 16%; and commercial printer hardware, grow 13%. 
We achieved this growth while investing in sales coverage and R&D, executing our transformation initiatives and absorbing 3Com. Our Enterprise business had solid growth this quarter, fueled by ESS which grew 31% over the prior year. We have built and acquired many assets over the recent years to serve our Enterprise customers. We now have the industry's premier arsenal of hardware, software and global services to deliver Converged Infrastructure and to manage and transform customers IT environments. 
A good example of Converged Infrastructure is our Blade platform, which is the industry leader, with over 50% share. An HP blade chassis can accommodate industry-standard blades, mission-critical blades, storage blades, even PC blades. Older design can maximize computing density and minimize wiring and power consumption. We then can virtualize the networking ports with Virtual Connect and for all the ports that are needed, we attach HP networking gear which has been significantly broadened and enhanced with the acquisition of 3Com. 
Add to that, the software to automate the data center and global services and it's clear we're uniquely positioned to win. Our Services business has made great progress integrating EDS, and we see the results both in our pipeline of opportunities and the improved margins. That being said, we still have more work to do to fully capture the enormous opportunity. 
The Imaging and Printing Group delivered a solid 8% growth with double-digit revenue growth in consumer and commercial hardware, and 6% growth in supplies. IPG continues to make significant progress in placing units with high-page consumption such as ink in the office, wireless and graphics, each of which grew more than 30%. We installed roughly 2,400 retail photo kiosks this quarter, and expect roughly 7,000 placements by year end. 
Managed Print Services had strong signings and Indigo Press pages grew 26%. We continue to make significant investments in this business while delivering 17.2% operating margins. 
The Personal Systems Group had another solid quarter, balancing revenue and profitability. We grew revenues 21% and expanded operating margins. In Q2, we announce our intent to acquire Palm, in order to enhance our intellectual property in the fast-growing and profitable connected mobility space. After closing the acquisition, we expect to leverage webOS and the app store beyond smartphones in the Form Factor such as slates and Web-connected printers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, who'll review the financials, let me reiterate the three reasons why I'm so confident in HP's future. First, our broad market leading portfolio. HP is the only company with significant IP, global scale and market leadership in servers, storage, networking, software and services to deliver the next-generation data center. HP is winning in the market, investing in innovation and moving deeper into Hardware segments, like networking and mobility. 
Second, our ability to leverage scale and global range. The global demographics are rapidly changing with the fast-growing middle class population migrating to large cities in emerging markets. In fact, over the next 20 years, the pace of urbanization is estimated to be at the rate of above 60 million people a year. This class of people will expect to be seamlessly and securely connected to the global community, with mobile devices in the underlying infrastructure.  As the largest IT company in the world delivering products and services in over 170 countries, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
Third, our track record have successfully transforming ourselves. Over the past five years, numerous transformational initiatives have helped HP better serve our customers and profitably grow our business. The results speak for themselves. However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us and that's good news. Ongoing transformations in areas like supply chain, sales coverage and service delivery offer outstanding opportunities for growth and for margin expansion. 
We were proud of what we've achieved. We're investing aggressively in the future to create a meaningful competitive advantage for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy."

HP delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter.  We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthen our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. At the same t",1449,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.  HP delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter.  We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthen our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. At the same time, we executed on our transformation initiatives and invested for growth. Our results demonstrate the strength of our operating models and the consistency of execution.  Compared with the year ago, total revenue in the second quarter was $30.8 billion, up 13%, including four points of favorable currency impact. 
On a geographical basis, we delivered double-digit growth in every region, with the Americas and EMEA each growing 11%, and Asia-Pacific increasing 19%. On a constant-currency basis, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 9%, 7% and 10% respectively. 
The second quarter gross margin was 23.5%, flat with the prior year. Sequentially, the gross margin increased 70 basis points, in line with normal seasonality. 
Turning to expenses, we are investing in a number of strategic initiatives to expand our sales and go to market capabilities while continuing to drive productivity. Operating expenses increased 5% to $3.8 billion, demonstrating both our operating leverage and the acceleration of our investments to drive long-term growth, including building out our enterprise sales force, and for restrengthening our product portfolio. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 22% year-on-year to $3.5 billion with operating margin expansion of 80 basis points. Non-GAAP net income increased over $500 million to $2.6 billion, or $1.09 per share. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. During the second quarter, revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 8% to $6.4 billion. Consumer hardware revenue increased 16% and commercial hardware revenue grew 13%, compared with the prior-year quarter, and supplies posted solid 6% growth. 
Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17.2% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments grew 9% with consumer printer units up 15%. Commercial printer units declined 8%, reflecting constrained product availability. 
During the quarter, laser printer average selling prices increased  as we've focused on placing high-value units. We expect LaserJet system availability to improve significantly in Q3, with more than 30% year-over-year unit growth next quarter. 
For the year, we still expect double-digit unit growth for both inkjet and LaserJet printers. We continue to gain significant traction in our growth initiatives with Managed Print Services, Retail Publishing and Commercial Graphics, each delivering double-digit growth. 
Managed Print Services had multimillion dollar wins in every geography across diverse industries, including financial services, telecommunication and transportation. HP's Managed Print Service offering is being recognized by customers and industry analysts for its industry-leading management tools and infrastructure and its ability to deliver a focused solutions for customers.  Retail Publishing has had several large wins, installing approximately 2,400 systems this quarter. 
In our Commercial Graphics business, growth accelerated across the portfolio, with Digital Press impressions up 26% from prior year. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Within Services, the IT Outsourcing business grew 6%, with strength in the government and financial services sector. 
In addition, we continue to see a significant increase in the level of product pull-through into our account. Revenue in both Technology Services and Business Process Outsourcing was flat compared with the prior year, and Application Services declined 2%. 
That said, both Application Services and BPO saw solid signings in the quarter.  
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased $208 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion, or 15.9% of revenue, driven by synergies from the EDS acquisition. 
Over the last 18 months, we have made significant progress with the EDS integration. We have extended our customer relationships, improved utilization and expanded our operating margins. That said, we have more opportunities to transform this business. We will continue to invest in delivering innovative service offerings for our customers while at the same time, driving efficiency, process standardization and automations to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.5 billion, up 31% compared with the prior year with balance growth across every region. The ESS results were driven by exceptional performance in ISS which increases revenue by 54% from the prior-year. This was partially offset by the Business Critical Systems revenue decline of 17%. 
ESS blades delivered strong revenue growth, increasing 45% from the prior year, and the Virtual Connect revenue more than doubled. We continue to be the market leader in servers, with 37% market share in x86 servers, gaining share again year-over-year.  Our G6 platforms delivered strong performance, and we recently launched our G7 platform as customers continue to demand the differentiated performance based on industry standards that HP is uniquely positioned to provide. 
Storage revenue increased 16% from the prior year, driven by solid growth in high-end and entry-storage arrays and significant growth in our scalar iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Network. 
With the improved performance in the business, we are seeing positive operating leverage in the ESS model. This quarter, the business delivered $571 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.6%, an increase of 540 basis points from the prior-year. 
With the close of 3Com this quarter, we are accelerating our investments in networking. HP networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investment segment, recorded organic growth of 31%, or 58% growth including a partial quarter of 3Com results. 
HP software revenue was $871 million, down 1% compared with the prior year. License growth improved this quarter with particular strength in the BTO application portfolio.  On the bottom-line, the Software business expanded its margins 80 basis points, delivering 18.6 points of operating margins in the second quarter. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG revenue increased 21% from the prior-year to $10 billion with notebook and desktop revenue up 17% and 27% respectively, and workstation revenue up 47%. Regionally, we saw a balanced growth across every geography. 
Total unit shipments increased 20% year-on-year, with notebook unit growth of 19% and desktop systems growth of 23%. We introduced several new consumer and business products this quarter, including a new consumer all-in-one desktop, the 12-core Z200 workstation and our lightest EliteBook commercial notebook to date. 
Segment operating profit totaled $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. 
Rounding out the segments, HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $755 million and generated operating margin of 9.1%, up 190 basis points from the prior-year. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong and we made solid improvements in working capital management year-over-year. We close the quarter with total growth cash of $14.3 billion. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down seven days from a year ago, and our channel inventory is in good shape. 
We generated solid cash flow in the quarter with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. We continue to actively repurchase shares, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases.  Finally, we paid our quarterly dividends totaling $196 million. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. The currency markets have been volatile and we are assuming that exchange rate stay roughly where they were last week, with the euro in the mid-120.
Taking into consideration our hedging strategies and exposure to a wide basket of currencies, we now expect third quarter revenue of $29.7 billion to $30 billion, and a full-year revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Included in this outlook are unfavorable sequential currency impact of approximately two percentage points from Q2 to Q3 and approximately one point from Q3 to Q4. 
Regarding earnings, our outlook includes both the absorption of the $0.03 incremental legal settlement recorded in the first quarter, but not previously included in our full-year outlook and the dilution associated with the 3Com acquisition. While we have not included the revenue impact of Palm in our outlook, we expect to be able to absorb the dilution associated with the acquisition in our full-year non-GAAP earnings. 
The other variables to consider in our earnings outlook are: An expected OI&E expense of about $0.04 per quarter, a tax rate of approximately 22% and weighted average shares outstanding to decline slightly in the second half of fiscal '10. With that in mind, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.50, representing growth of 16% to 17% for the year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

But again, Bill, like we've said before, all of our acquisitions, regardless of where they are, go through a pretty extensive filter in terms of making sure they're strategically sensible, financially sensible, and that we can actually operate and get some incremental leverage and operating performance out of it. So it's got to hit all three filters. I think in this case, of Palm and our planned acquisition of Palm, it really has more to do with the intellectual property. And in the fact that when you look across the HP ecosystem of interconnected devices, it is a large family of devices. And when you think of printers, you've now got a whole series of Web-connected printers, that as they connect to the Web, need an OS. We prefer to have that OS to, in our case, to be our IP where we can control the customer experience, as we always have in the Printing business, and that's a big deal to us. We can certainly make the same case or smaller Form Factor products in the mobile world like a slate and some other products. And again, I don't want to tell you that we're not going to have -- Microsoft is probably one of the best relationships we've got in our company and they are still extremely important to us. There are a couple of Form Factors though that are very attractive for us, and the small Form Factors where we think the IP can be very additive to us. So it even precisely build a smartphone play. I've seen some people like -- clearly that's a $45 billion total available market that is growing. And so that is an attractive market. But it is for us strategically broader, in the context that the number of HP interconnected devices where we can leverage the IP. And that's what we plan to do."

Again, we had a continuation of strong performance in what we call ProCurve, now HP Networking, edge products, wireless products, obviously, 31% growth in the quarter. That's organic. Obviously, very strong for us. Simultaneously, which is important to note, that we've been building software capabilities in ESN. We talked about this product called Virtual Connect. It is nothing more complicated than -- most of the networking market is sold by number of ports. Those ports aren't always fully utilized. Virtual Connect actually virtualizes those ports, so it's a rudimentary example of a customer usually buying 10 ports. We can virtualize and perhaps reduce that by 30%, 40%, so they now six ports. Our strategy is then to come in with the best performing products and the best TCO in the industry that then actually work with the customer on those ports. Historically, we've been on the edge and wireless. Now with 3Com, we can do the exact same thing in the data center. And so for us, we've had a very good start with 3Com. We have been aggressive in hiring and hiring has started, and hiring is ramping. In the quarter, 3Com, we closed two Fortune logo accounts with 3Com products in the data center. We also had a number of very significant wins on it, where you would think of ProCurve line and had a very strong Virtual Connect quarter as well. So the reason I bring that up to you, Rich, is to give you a context that our networking strategy isn't a 3Com strategy, it's not a ProCurve strategy, it's not a Virtual Connect strategy, it's an all of those capabilities brought together across the HP portfolio. And it's why when we talk about this Converged Infrastructure, that the ability to leverage IP from the server family, the storage family and the networking family, became so integral to our overall story. So we think a very good start, we're very excited about it, we've installed products. The 3Com technology is now in our data centers, and it's now performing our networking tasks. We plan to do more and more of that. And so we feel very excited about it. And to your original question, specialist's hiring is ramping."

I think, Ben, when you talk about the broader printing business, a very strong quarter for us, obviously, in ink placements. Again, we felt very good about our ink lineup of products, the growth in wireless printing and then web connected printers continues to be very strong. So I think IPG, very strong at ink. As we mentioned in our script and in our opening messages, the position in retail photo kiosk now, Ben, is a big deal. We installed as many retail photo kiosks in the quarter as we had for the entire life of the product. So for us, this was a doubling of that base. We plan to exit at over 7,000 as we exit the year. Managed Print Services had another very significant quarter. And again, the importance of those two businesses for us are, those are long-term businesses. Managed Print Services, five-year contracts. Retail photo kiosk, they installed nine and 10 years, 100% connect of supplies to those products and they are beginning to be a meaningful part of our portfolio. So I think across IPG, when you look at the supplies growth we reported which is the dollar number as opposed to the local number, and the local number would've been yet higher, overall, we felt very good about the IPG quarter. We've worked hard to get the business in a position to be able to do what we just reported. The one thing we really want to get done is what you open with.

Now remember, you've got a blend of technology services and what you would think of is more outsourcing services around apps and ITO in the same bucket there. And the maintenance piece of the business does react more of a hardware sales and has a lagging effect on hardware sales in terms of growth, so that's sort of one point. Second, we've been spending a lot of time getting the business right. We have seen very strong improvement in our pipeline. We exited the year with very strong signings. We expect to have a very strong signings here this year, Toni. So when you look at our pipeline and you look at where we're at, we feel very good about the position of the business. Now let me go further just to give you a little bit more color. We have spent a lot of time over the past year and a half, really operationalizing the business, getting underneath issues in the business, opportunities in the business. And I think the team, for the most part, has done a very good job. We certainly improved our profitability, improved our cost structure, better aligned our costs with our revenue. That said, as what happens in most things, as we've gotten deeper into details, the opportunity we think to be very open with you is even better. And we're in the process working through this right now. These are things like how we automate and drive forward our data centers. How we align our job our tool strategy going forward. And I won't go into too much details because of the time on the call, but I will in the future period of time. There are immaterial opportunities for us in the business to improve it, and we will invest into that to get that right and we think that plays long run to our opportunity to grow the business and our opportunity to scale the business. So don't take anything away from this other than we think we got a major opportunity in the business. We feel very good about the position of it, Toni, and I think, you are right in your analytic. I wouldn't necessarily drive it to this hardware result in terms of driving the Services businesses or those kind of growth rates, but we certainly expected to grow at and above market."

But I agree with your conclusion that ASPs have improved. Some of that is frankly the commodity environment. And the commodity environment, as you can imagine in 2009, many of the commodity providers, particularly memory providers, really clamped down on CapEx. And so when you look at their capacity today, their capacity is low as demand is increasing. That, of course, increases the price in some of the commodity areas. Typically, as you know, Keith, we do very well in environments like this from a procurement perspective and alignment of supply. That said, there is a passing through of those commodity prices, which you've seen sort of across the board for most companies in the industry, and that is having some effect on ASPs. In addition to your point, some of these sort of better performance you're seeing in some areas like business desktops and workstations, that mix is also affecting the aggregate ASP as well, so that is also a benefit that you're seeing going on in the quarter and what's transpiring. In terms of margins, we'll continue to balance growth and profitability, and make sure we hit the right optimal point within it. Remember, for us, Keith, we think about the PC business more broadly than we do the PC business just an isolation. The PC business really is the procurement arm for almost the entire company from a product perspective. We leverage the common parts across almost all of our infrastructure, so for us, we think about it not just in the context of PSG operating performance but the leverage in the position that gives to the entire company. So I think it's generally good news in terms of the growth that you're seeing in the market, the ASP improvement you're seeing. There is a tighter commodity environment and we'll continue to balance it as we go forward in terms of optimizing growth and profitability."

One is, demand has picked up and improve more than what we have expected. That's good news and it's also a bad news, because we haven't been able to get the capacity. We have a very strong backlog coming out of Q2. And like I said earlier, what happened in Q2 in terms of the laser unit decline is not really a surprise to us. It's materially what we had expected going into Q2. This was always going to be a back half, very strong back half unit placement for lasers in order to get to the double digits for the year that we believe is very doable."

There was no sort of surprise to us. I would characterize it differently. We would like to have had more. That's probably the better way to think about it. And let me make sure I'm clear with you,",439,"Brad, this is where we expect it to be, roughly speaking. There was no sort of surprise to us. I would characterize it differently. We would like to have had more. That's probably the better way to think about it. And let me make sure I'm clear with you, no, we did not do any hold back, because the price points quite the opposite. We were pushing as hard as we could towards the end of the quarter and we're pushing as hard as we can right now. The demand is strong. So to Cathy's point, that's the good news. The bad news is, we haven't been able to fulfill as much as customers want. The brand loyalty to HP is just -- unless you're here feeling it, you wouldn't to get it. I mean, it is just amazing how our partners and our customers stick with us on this, and we're going to get better at this. And I'm telling you, I think, Q3 will be turn on it. To your point about supplies, yes, supplies have been strong. I mean, it's good news and I think it's also not just the unit placements as we've talked before, Brian. Getting the right units placed is actually more important than the unit number of units to get placed. And to some degree, I think you saw that show up in Q2 as well. When you look at the ASPs in the Laser business, let me flip it around. What we were able to focus on was getting the right units out. And that did pay dividends within the context of a number that clearly, we just wish was better. 
Let me wrap it up here. Listen, I think the conclusion of it, for us, is we feel very good about the broad-based growth in the quarter. 13%, for us, is we think a good result, not only the fact that we grew 13%, but the fact that it was contributed through across regions and across our businesses we think was extremely positive. 
We are a stronger company today and I want to emphasize that based on our portfolio, our scale and our consistent execution. At the same time, we have more work to do to transform ourselves to reach our potentials. So as good as we feel in some respects about what we've done, we are still not to our full potential, and we feel good about our position which gives us the confidence as we described here, to raise our outlook from where we previously had it. So thank you all for joining us. We do appreciate it."

108856,104778531,62069,"Hewlett-Packard Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 18, 2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Hewlett-Packard has an exceptional quarter. Year-over-year, we had a $3.5 billion of growth and over $500 million of net earnings. Revenue of $30.8 billion was up 13% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09",784,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Hewlett-Packard has an exceptional quarter. Year-over-year, we had a $3.5 billion of growth and over $500 million of net earnings. Revenue of $30.8 billion was up 13% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 was up 27%, and operating margins of 11.2% were up 80 basis points over the prior year. 
Our growth this quarter was broad-based. Americas and Asia-Pacific each posted solid double-digit growth. Europe also grew double digits, performing better than historical seasonality. After many customers deferred hardware purchases in 2009, we are seeing strong growth in the number of our businesses. Industry Standard Servers grew 54%; ProCurve grow 31%; PCs, 21%; Storage, 16%; consumer printer hardware, 16%; and commercial printer hardware, grow 13%. 
We achieved this growth while investing in sales coverage and R&D, executing our transformation initiatives and absorbing 3Com. Our Enterprise business had solid growth this quarter, fueled by ESS which grew 31% over the prior year. We have built and acquired many assets over the recent years to serve our Enterprise customers. We now have the industry's premier arsenal of hardware, software and global services to deliver Converged Infrastructure and to manage and transform customers IT environments. 
A good example of Converged Infrastructure is our Blade platform, which is the industry leader, with over 50% share. An HP blade chassis can accommodate industry-standard blades, mission-critical blades, storage blades, even PC blades. Older design can maximize computing density and minimize wiring and power consumption. We then can virtualize the networking ports with Virtual Connect and for all the ports that are needed, we attach HP networking gear which has been significantly broadened and enhanced with the acquisition of 3Com. 
Add to that, the software to automate the data center and global services and it's clear we're uniquely positioned to win. Our Services business has made great progress integrating EDS, and we see the results both in our pipeline of opportunities and the improved margins. That being said, we still have more work to do to fully capture the enormous opportunity. 
The Imaging and Printing Group delivered a solid 8% growth with double-digit revenue growth in consumer and commercial hardware, and 6% growth in supplies. IPG continues to make significant progress in placing units with high-page consumption such as ink in the office, wireless and graphics, each of which grew more than 30%. We installed roughly 2,400 retail photo kiosks this quarter, and expect roughly 7,000 placements by year end. 
Managed Print Services had strong signings and Indigo Press pages grew 26%. We continue to make significant investments in this business while delivering 17.2% operating margins. 
The Personal Systems Group had another solid quarter, balancing revenue and profitability. We grew revenues 21% and expanded operating margins. In Q2, we announce our intent to acquire Palm, in order to enhance our intellectual property in the fast-growing and profitable connected mobility space. After closing the acquisition, we expect to leverage webOS and the app store beyond smartphones in the Form Factor such as slates and Web-connected printers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, who'll review the financials, let me reiterate the three reasons why I'm so confident in HP's future. First, our broad market leading portfolio. HP is the only company with significant IP, global scale and market leadership in servers, storage, networking, software and services to deliver the next-generation data center. HP is winning in the market, investing in innovation and moving deeper into Hardware segments, like networking and mobility. 
Second, our ability to leverage scale and global range. The global demographics are rapidly changing with the fast-growing middle class population migrating to large cities in emerging markets. In fact, over the next 20 years, the pace of urbanization is estimated to be at the rate of above 60 million people a year. This class of people will expect to be seamlessly and securely connected to the global community, with mobile devices in the underlying infrastructure.  As the largest IT company in the world delivering products and services in over 170 countries, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
Third, our track record have successfully transforming ourselves. Over the past five years, numerous transformational initiatives have helped HP better serve our customers and profitably grow our business. The results speak for themselves. However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us and that's good news. Ongoing transformations in areas like supply chain, sales coverage and service delivery offer outstanding opportunities for growth and for margin expansion. 
We were proud of what we've achieved. We're investing aggressively in the future to create a meaningful competitive advantage for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy."
108856,104778531,62069,"Hewlett-Packard Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 18, 2010",2010-05-18,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.

At the same t",1449,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.  HP delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter.  We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthen our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. At the same time, we executed on our transformation initiatives and invested for growth. Our results demonstrate the strength of our operating models and the consistency of execution.  Compared with the year ago, total revenue in the second quarter was $30.8 billion, up 13%, including four points of favorable currency impact. 
On a geographical basis, we delivered double-digit growth in every region, with the Americas and EMEA each growing 11%, and Asia-Pacific increasing 19%. On a constant-currency basis, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 9%, 7% and 10% respectively. 
The second quarter gross margin was 23.5%, flat with the prior year. Sequentially, the gross margin increased 70 basis points, in line with normal seasonality. 
Turning to expenses, we are investing in a number of strategic initiatives to expand our sales and go to market capabilities while continuing to drive productivity. Operating expenses increased 5% to $3.8 billion, demonstrating both our operating leverage and the acceleration of our investments to drive long-term growth, including building out our enterprise sales force, and for restrengthening our product portfolio. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 22% year-on-year to $3.5 billion with operating margin expansion of 80 basis points. Non-GAAP net income increased over $500 million to $2.6 billion, or $1.09 per share. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. During the second quarter, revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 8% to $6.4 billion. Consumer hardware revenue increased 16% and commercial hardware revenue grew 13%, compared with the prior-year quarter, and supplies posted solid 6% growth. 
Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17.2% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments grew 9% with consumer printer units up 15%. Commercial printer units declined 8%, reflecting constrained product availability. 
During the quarter, laser printer average selling prices increased  as we've focused on placing high-value units. We expect LaserJet system availability to improve significantly in Q3, with more than 30% year-over-year unit growth next quarter. 
For the year, we still expect double-digit unit growth for both inkjet and LaserJet printers. We continue to gain significant traction in our growth initiatives with Managed Print Services, Retail Publishing and Commercial Graphics, each delivering double-digit growth. 
Managed Print Services had multimillion dollar wins in every geography across diverse industries, including financial services, telecommunication and transportation. HP's Managed Print Service offering is being recognized by customers and industry analysts for its industry-leading management tools and infrastructure and its ability to deliver a focused solutions for customers.  Retail Publishing has had several large wins, installing approximately 2,400 systems this quarter. 
In our Commercial Graphics business, growth accelerated across the portfolio, with Digital Press impressions up 26% from prior year. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Within Services, the IT Outsourcing business grew 6%, with strength in the government and financial services sector. 
In addition, we continue to see a significant increase in the level of product pull-through into our account. Revenue in both Technology Services and Business Process Outsourcing was flat compared with the prior year, and Application Services declined 2%. 
That said, both Application Services and BPO saw solid signings in the quarter.  
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased $208 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion, or 15.9% of revenue, driven by synergies from the EDS acquisition. 
Over the last 18 months, we have made significant progress with the EDS integration. We have extended our customer relationships, improved utilization and expanded our operating margins. That said, we have more opportunities to transform this business. We will continue to invest in delivering innovative service offerings for our customers while at the same time, driving efficiency, process standardization and automations to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.5 billion, up 31% compared with the prior year with balance growth across every region. The ESS results were driven by exceptional performance in ISS which increases revenue by 54% from the prior-year. This was partially offset by the Business Critical Systems revenue decline of 17%. 
ESS blades delivered strong revenue growth, increasing 45% from the prior year, and the Virtual Connect revenue more than doubled. We continue to be the market leader in servers, with 37% market share in x86 servers, gaining share again year-over-year.  Our G6 platforms delivered strong performance, and we recently launched our G7 platform as customers continue to demand the differentiated performance based on industry standards that HP is uniquely positioned to provide. 
Storage revenue increased 16% from the prior year, driven by solid growth in high-end and entry-storage arrays and significant growth in our scalar iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Network. 
With the improved performance in the business, we are seeing positive operating leverage in the ESS model. This quarter, the business delivered $571 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.6%, an increase of 540 basis points from the prior-year. 
With the close of 3Com this quarter, we are accelerating our investments in networking. HP networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investment segment, recorded organic growth of 31%, or 58% growth including a partial quarter of 3Com results. 
HP software revenue was $871 million, down 1% compared with the prior year. License growth improved this quarter with particular strength in the BTO application portfolio.  On the bottom-line, the Software business expanded its margins 80 basis points, delivering 18.6 points of operating margins in the second quarter. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG revenue increased 21% from the prior-year to $10 billion with notebook and desktop revenue up 17% and 27% respectively, and workstation revenue up 47%. Regionally, we saw a balanced growth across every geography. 
Total unit shipments increased 20% year-on-year, with notebook unit growth of 19% and desktop systems growth of 23%. We introduced several new consumer and business products this quarter, including a new consumer all-in-one desktop, the 12-core Z200 workstation and our lightest EliteBook commercial notebook to date. 
Segment operating profit totaled $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. 
Rounding out the segments, HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $755 million and generated operating margin of 9.1%, up 190 basis points from the prior-year. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong and we made solid improvements in working capital management year-over-year. We close the quarter with total growth cash of $14.3 billion. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down seven days from a year ago, and our channel inventory is in good shape. 
We generated solid cash flow in the quarter with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. We continue to actively repurchase shares, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases.  Finally, we paid our quarterly dividends totaling $196 million. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. The currency markets have been volatile and we are assuming that exchange rate stay roughly where they were last week, with the euro in the mid-120.
Taking into consideration our hedging strategies and exposure to a wide basket of currencies, we now expect third quarter revenue of $29.7 billion to $30 billion, and a full-year revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Included in this outlook are unfavorable sequential currency impact of approximately two percentage points from Q2 to Q3 and approximately one point from Q3 to Q4. 
Regarding earnings, our outlook includes both the absorption of the $0.03 incremental legal settlement recorded in the first quarter, but not previously included in our full-year outlook and the dilution associated with the 3Com acquisition. While we have not included the revenue impact of Palm in our outlook, we expect to be able to absorb the dilution associated with the acquisition in our full-year non-GAAP earnings. 
The other variables to consider in our earnings outlook are: An expected OI&E expense of about $0.04 per quarter, a tax rate of approximately 22% and weighted average shares outstanding to decline slightly in the second half of fiscal '10. With that in mind, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.50, representing growth of 16% to 17% for the year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

So it's got to hit all three filters. I think in this case, of Palm and our planned acquisition of Palm, it really has more to do with the intellectual property. And in the fact that when you look across the HP ecosystem of interconnected devices, it is a large family of devices. And when you think of printers, you've now got a whole series of Web-connected printers, that as they connect to the Web, need an OS. We prefer to have that OS to, in our case, to be our IP where we can control the customer experience, as we always have in the Printing business, and that's a big deal to us. We can certainly make the same case or smaller Form Factor products in the mobile world like a slate and some other products. And again, I don't want to tell you that we're not going to have -- Microsoft is probably one of the best relationships we've got in our company and they are still extremely important to us. There are a couple of Form Factors though that are very attractive for us, and the small Form Factors where we think the IP can be very additive to us. So it even precisely build a smartphone play. I've seen some people like -- clearly that's a $45 billion total available market that is growing. And so that is an attractive market. But it is for us strategically broader, in the context that the number of HP interconnected devices where we can leverage the IP. And that's what we plan to do."

Again, we had a continuation of strong performance in what we call ProCurve, now HP Networking, edge products, wireless products, obviously, 31% growth in the quarter. That's organic. Obviously, very strong for us. Simultaneously, which is important to note, that we've been building software capabilities in ESN. We talked about this product called Virtual Connect. It is nothing more complicated than -- most of the networking market is sold by number of ports. Those ports aren't always fully utilized. Virtual Connect actually virtualizes those ports, so it's a rudimentary example of a customer usually buying 10 ports. We can virtualize and perhaps reduce that by 30%, 40%, so they now six ports. Our strategy is then to come in with the best performing products and the best TCO in the industry that then actually work with the customer on those ports. Historically, we've been on the edge and wireless. Now with 3Com, we can do the exact same thing in the data center. And so for us, we've had a very good start with 3Com. We have been aggressive in hiring and hiring has started, and hiring is ramping. In the quarter, 3Com, we closed two Fortune logo accounts with 3Com products in the data center. We also had a number of very significant wins on it, where you would think of ProCurve line and had a very strong Virtual Connect quarter as well. So the reason I bring that up to you, Rich, is to give you a context that our networking strategy isn't a 3Com strategy, it's not a ProCurve strategy, it's not a Virtual Connect strategy, it's an all of those capabilities brought together across the HP portfolio. And it's why when we talk about this Converged Infrastructure, that the ability to leverage IP from the server family, the storage family and the networking family, became so integral to our overall story. So we think a very good start, we're very excited about it, we've installed products. The 3Com technology is now in our data centers, and it's now performing our networking tasks. We plan to do more and more of that. And so we feel very excited about it. And to your original question, specialist's hiring is ramping."

I'm not thrilled with the Q2 unit numbers, but I am pretty pleased with the types of units we put in the market. The ASPs were up significantly in lasers, so the units we could get, we got the right units, if you will, from a printer placement perspective. So I think you should expect a very strong back half in laser and a very strong Q3, and we have good line sight and good visibility to that going into the quarter. Demand has continued to be strong. I think, Ben, when you talk about the broader printing business, a very strong quarter for us, obviously, in ink placements. Again, we felt very good about our ink lineup of products, the growth in wireless printing and then web connected printers continues to be very strong. So I think IPG, very strong at ink. As we mentioned in our script and in our opening messages, the position in retail photo kiosk now, Ben, is a big deal. We installed as many retail photo kiosks in the quarter as we had for the entire life of the product. So for us, this was a doubling of that base. We plan to exit at over 7,000 as we exit the year. Managed Print Services had another very significant quarter. And again, the importance of those two businesses for us are, those are long-term businesses. Managed Print Services, five-year contracts. Retail photo kiosk, they installed nine and 10 years, 100% connect of supplies to those products and they are beginning to be a meaningful part of our portfolio. So I think across IPG, when you look at the supplies growth we reported which is the dollar number as opposed to the local number, and the local number would've been yet higher, overall, we felt very good about the IPG quarter. We've worked hard to get the business in a position to be able to do what we just reported. The one thing we really want to get done is what you open with.

And the maintenance piece of the business does react more of a hardware sales and has a lagging effect on hardware sales in terms of growth, so that's sort of one point. Second, we've been spending a lot of time getting the business right. We have seen very strong improvement in our pipeline. We exited the year with very strong signings. We expect to have a very strong signings here this year, Toni. So when you look at our pipeline and you look at where we're at, we feel very good about the position of the business. Now let me go further just to give you a little bit more color. We have spent a lot of time over the past year and a half, really operationalizing the business, getting underneath issues in the business, opportunities in the business. And I think the team, for the most part, has done a very good job. We certainly improved our profitability, improved our cost structure, better aligned our costs with our revenue. That said, as what happens in most things, as we've gotten deeper into details, the opportunity we think to be very open with you is even better. And we're in the process working through this right now. These are things like how we automate and drive forward our data centers. How we align our job our tool strategy going forward. And I won't go into too much details because of the time on the call, but I will in the future period of time. There are immaterial opportunities for us in the business to improve it, and we will invest into that to get that right and we think that plays long run to our opportunity to grow the business and our opportunity to scale the business. So don't take anything away from this other than we think we got a major opportunity in the business. We feel very good about the position of it, Toni, and I think, you are right in your analytic. I wouldn't necessarily drive it to this hardware result in terms of driving the Services businesses or those kind of growth rates, but we certainly expected to grow at and above market."

But I agree with your conclusion that ASPs have improved. Some of that is frankly the commodity environment. And the commodity environment, as you can imagine in 2009, many of the commodity providers, particularly memory providers, really clamped down on CapEx. And so when you look at their capacity today, their capacity is low as demand is increasing. That, of course, increases the price in some of the commodity areas. Typically, as you know, Keith, we do very well in environments like this from a procurement perspective and alignment of supply. That said, there is a passing through of those commodity prices, which you've seen sort of across the board for most companies in the industry, and that is having some effect on ASPs. In addition to your point, some of these sort of better performance you're seeing in some areas like business desktops and workstations, that mix is also affecting the aggregate ASP as well, so that is also a benefit that you're seeing going on in the quarter and what's transpiring. In terms of margins, we'll continue to balance growth and profitability, and make sure we hit the right optimal point within it. Remember, for us, Keith, we think about the PC business more broadly than we do the PC business just an isolation. The PC business really is the procurement arm for almost the entire company from a product perspective. We leverage the common parts across almost all of our infrastructure, so for us, we think about it not just in the context of PSG operating performance but the leverage in the position that gives to the entire company. So I think it's generally good news in terms of the growth that you're seeing in the market, the ASP improvement you're seeing. There is a tighter commodity environment and we'll continue to balance it as we go forward in terms of optimizing growth and profitability."

Our ability now to deal with some of these issues has just given us more flexibility that we do the kind of unit performance that we talked about here. For the full year, forget this quarter, that quarter, but when you look at the full year unit performance and the opportunities we have in terms of placements. Again, understand, Scott, we've done this while investing and placing these retail photo kiosks. So I want to make sure this is no trivial issue that we've been able to absorb the start-up of the Managed Print Services businesses. We've been able to install these retail photo kiosks, which are very similar to the printer models, just bigger units. We've forecast the growth -- take the unit growth in inkjet, the forecast that we have in laser and do all that within a targeted margins that we've described. This has given us a level of flexibility. But frankly, if you went back three or four years, we simply couldn't have done this. And so this is a big deal for us."

There's also a transformation going on at Storage as I mentioned earlier. I mean, we've got very strong growth going on in iSCSI part of the market, which we think is a very attractive part of the market, where we've seen significant growth occurring. So I do think you're right. We feel very good about the new product release. That probably has more of an impact to us in the back half of the year than it does in Q3. But again, I think to Cathy's point, when you get 30% leverage like what we're seeing, ESN has done a lot of what we described in IPG, working hard. They're not quite to the same position that IPG is now, but they're on a same path to do more work in its operations and its supply chain that we can get more flexibility and more leverage, as we bring in assortment of products, we think the market are pretty darn excited."

We were pushing as hard as we could towards the end of the quarter and we're pushing as hard as we can right now. The demand is strong. So to Cathy's point, that's the good news. The bad news is, we haven't been able to fulfill as much as customers want. The brand loyalty to HP is just -- unless you're here feeling it, you wouldn't to get it. I mean, it is just amazing how our partners and our customers stick with us on this, and we're going to get better at this. And I'm telling you, I think, Q3 will be turn on it. To your point about supplies, yes, supplies have been strong. I mean, it's good news and I think it's also not just the unit placements as we've talked before, Brian. Getting the right units placed is actually more important than the unit number of units to get placed. And to some degree, I think you saw that show up in Q2 as well. When you look at the ASPs in the Laser business, let me flip it around. What we were able to focus on was getting the right units out. And that did pay dividends within the context of a number that clearly, we just wish was better. 
Let me wrap it up here. Listen, I think the conclusion of it, for us, is we feel very good about the broad-based growth in the quarter. 13%, for us, is we think a good result, not only the fact that we grew 13%, but the fact that it was contributed through across regions and across our businesses we think was extremely positive. 
We are a stronger company today and I want to emphasize that based on our portfolio, our scale and our consistent execution. At the same time, we have more work to do to transform ourselves to reach our potentials. So as good as we feel in some respects about what we've done, we are still not to our full potential, and we feel good about our position which gives us the confidence as we described here, to raise our outlook from where we previously had it.

Hewlett-Packard has an exceptional quarter. Year-over-year, we had a $3.5 billion of growth and over $500 million of net earnings. Revenue of $30.8 billion was up 13% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09",784,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Hewlett-Packard has an exceptional quarter. Year-over-year, we had a $3.5 billion of growth and over $500 million of net earnings. Revenue of $30.8 billion was up 13% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 was up 27%, and operating margins of 11.2% were up 80 basis points over the prior year. 
Our growth this quarter was broad-based. Americas and Asia-Pacific each posted solid double-digit growth. Europe also grew double digits, performing better than historical seasonality. After many customers deferred hardware purchases in 2009, we are seeing strong growth in the number of our businesses. Industry Standard Servers grew 54%; ProCurve grow 31%; PCs, 21%; Storage, 16%; consumer printer hardware, 16%; and commercial printer hardware, grow 13%. 
We achieved this growth while investing in sales coverage and R&D, executing our transformation initiatives and absorbing 3Com. Our Enterprise business had solid growth this quarter, fueled by ESS which grew 31% over the prior year. We have built and acquired many assets over the recent years to serve our Enterprise customers. We now have the industry's premier arsenal of hardware, software and global services to deliver Converged Infrastructure and to manage and transform customers IT environments. 
A good example of Converged Infrastructure is our Blade platform, which is the industry leader, with over 50% share. An HP blade chassis can accommodate industry-standard blades, mission-critical blades, storage blades, even PC blades. Older design can maximize computing density and minimize wiring and power consumption. We then can virtualize the networking ports with Virtual Connect and for all the ports that are needed, we attach HP networking gear which has been significantly broadened and enhanced with the acquisition of 3Com. 
Add to that, the software to automate the data center and global services and it's clear we're uniquely positioned to win. Our Services business has made great progress integrating EDS, and we see the results both in our pipeline of opportunities and the improved margins. That being said, we still have more work to do to fully capture the enormous opportunity. 
The Imaging and Printing Group delivered a solid 8% growth with double-digit revenue growth in consumer and commercial hardware, and 6% growth in supplies. IPG continues to make significant progress in placing units with high-page consumption such as ink in the office, wireless and graphics, each of which grew more than 30%. We installed roughly 2,400 retail photo kiosks this quarter, and expect roughly 7,000 placements by year end. 
Managed Print Services had strong signings and Indigo Press pages grew 26%. We continue to make significant investments in this business while delivering 17.2% operating margins. 
The Personal Systems Group had another solid quarter, balancing revenue and profitability. We grew revenues 21% and expanded operating margins. In Q2, we announce our intent to acquire Palm, in order to enhance our intellectual property in the fast-growing and profitable connected mobility space. After closing the acquisition, we expect to leverage webOS and the app store beyond smartphones in the Form Factor such as slates and Web-connected printers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathie, who'll review the financials, let me reiterate the three reasons why I'm so confident in HP's future. First, our broad market leading portfolio. HP is the only company with significant IP, global scale and market leadership in servers, storage, networking, software and services to deliver the next-generation data center. HP is winning in the market, investing in innovation and moving deeper into Hardware segments, like networking and mobility. 
Second, our ability to leverage scale and global range. The global demographics are rapidly changing with the fast-growing middle class population migrating to large cities in emerging markets. In fact, over the next 20 years, the pace of urbanization is estimated to be at the rate of above 60 million people a year. This class of people will expect to be seamlessly and securely connected to the global community, with mobile devices in the underlying infrastructure.  As the largest IT company in the world delivering products and services in over 170 countries, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
Third, our track record have successfully transforming ourselves. Over the past five years, numerous transformational initiatives have helped HP better serve our customers and profitably grow our business. The results speak for themselves. However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us and that's good news. Ongoing transformations in areas like supply chain, sales coverage and service delivery offer outstanding opportunities for growth and for margin expansion. 
We were proud of what we've achieved. We're investing aggressively in the future to create a meaningful competitive advantage for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cathie."

We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthen our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. At the same time, we executed on our transformation initiatives and invested for growth. Our results demonstrate the strength of our operating models and the consistency of execution.  Compared with the year ago, total revenue in the second quarter was $30.8 billion, up 13%, including four points of favorable currency impact. 
On a geographical basis, we delivered double-digit growth in every region, with the Americas and EMEA each growing 11%, and Asia-Pacific increasing 19%. On a constant-currency basis, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 9%, 7% and 10% respectively. 
The second quarter gross margin was 23.5%, flat with the prior year. Sequentially, the gross margin increased 70 basis points, in line with normal seasonality. 
Turning to expenses, we are investing in a number of strategic initiatives to expand our sales and go to market capabilities while continuing to drive productivity. Operating expenses increased 5% to $3.8 billion, demonstrating both our operating leverage and the acceleration of our investments to drive long-term growth, including building out our enterprise sales force, and for restrengthening our product portfolio. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 22% year-on-year to $3.5 billion with operating margin expansion of 80 basis points. Non-GAAP net income increased over $500 million to $2.6 billion, or $1.09 per share. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. During the second quarter, revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 8% to $6.4 billion. Consumer hardware revenue increased 16% and commercial hardware revenue grew 13%, compared with the prior-year quarter, and supplies posted solid 6% growth. 
Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17.2% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments grew 9% with consumer printer units up 15%. Commercial printer units declined 8%, reflecting constrained product availability. 
During the quarter, laser printer average selling prices increased as we focused on placing high-value units. We expect LaserJet system availability to improve significantly in Q3, with more than 30% year-over-year unit growth next quarter. 
For the year, we still expect double-digit unit growth for both inkjet and LaserJet printers. We continue to gain significant traction in our growth initiatives with Managed Print Services, Retail Publishing and Commercial Graphics, each delivering double-digit growth. 
Managed Print Services had multimillion dollar wins in every geography across diverse industries, including financial services, telecommunication and transportation. HP's Managed Print Service offering is being recognized by customers and industry analysts for its industry-leading management tools and infrastructure and its ability to deliver focused solutions for customers. Retail Publishing has had several large wins, installing approximately 2,400 systems this quarter. 
In our Commercial Graphics business, growth accelerated across the portfolio, with Digital Press impressions up 26% from prior year. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Within Services, the IT Outsourcing business grew 6%, with strength in the government and financial services sector. 
In addition, we continue to see a significant increase in the level of product pull-through into our account. Revenue in both Technology Services and Business Process Outsourcing was flat compared with the prior year, and Application Services declined 2%. That said, both Application Services and BPO saw solid signings in the quarter.  
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased $208 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion, or 15.9% of revenue, driven by synergies from the EDS acquisition. 
Over the last 18 months, we have made significant progress with the EDS integration. We have extended our customer relationships, improved utilization and expanded our operating margins. That said, we have more opportunities to transform this business. We will continue to invest in delivering innovative service offerings for our customers while at the same time, driving efficiency, process standardization and automation to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.5 billion, up 31% compared with the prior year with balanced growth across every region. The ESS results were driven by exceptional performance in ISS which increases revenue by 54% from the prior-year. This was partially offset by the Business Critical Systems revenue decline of 17%. 
ESS blades delivered strong revenue growth, increasing 45% from the prior year, and the Virtual Connect revenue more than doubled. We continue to be the market leader in servers, with 37% market share in x86 servers, gaining share again year-over-year.  Our G6 platforms delivered strong performance, and we recently launched our G7 platform as customers continue to demand the differentiated performance based on industry standards that HP is uniquely positioned to provide. 
Storage revenue increased 16% from the prior year, driven by solid growth in high-end and entry-storage arrays and significant growth in our scalar iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Network. 
With the improved performance in the business, we are seeing positive operating leverage in the ESS model. This quarter, the business delivered $571 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.6%, an increase of 540 basis points from the prior-year. 
With the close of 3Com this quarter, we are accelerating our investments in networking. HP networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investment segment, recorded organic growth of 31%, or 58% growth including a partial quarter of 3Com results. 
HP software revenue was $871 million, down 1% compared with the prior year. License growth improved this quarter with particular strength in the BTO applications portfolio.  On the bottom-line, the Software business expanded its margins 80 basis points, delivering 18.6 points of operating margin in the second quarter. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG revenue increased 21% from the prior-year to $10 billion with notebook and desktop revenue up 17% and 27% respectively, and workstation revenue up 47%. Regionally, we saw a balanced growth across every geography. 
Total unit shipments increased 20% year-on-year, with notebook unit growth of 19% and desktop systems growth of 23%. We introduced several new consumer and business products this quarter, including a new consumer all-in-one desktop, the 12-core Z200 workstation and our lightest EliteBook commercial notebook to date. 
Segment operating profit totaled $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. 
Rounding out the segments, HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $755 million and generated operating margin of 9.1%, up 190 basis points from the prior-year. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong and we made solid improvements in working capital management year-over-year. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.3 billion. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down seven days from a year ago, and our channel inventory is in good shape. 
We generated solid cash flow in the quarter with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. We continue to actively repurchase shares, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. Finally, we paid our quarterly dividends totaling $196 million. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. The currency markets have been volatile and we are assuming that exchange rate stay roughly where they were last week, with the euro in the mid-120.
Taking into consideration our hedging strategies and exposure to a wide basket of currencies, we now expect third quarter revenue of $29.7 billion to $30 billion, and a full-year revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Included in this outlook are unfavorable sequential currency impact of approximately two percentage points from Q2 to Q3 and approximately one point from Q3 to Q4. 
Regarding earnings, our outlook includes both the absorption of the $0.03 incremental legal settlement recorded in the first quarter, but not previously included in our full-year outlook and the dilution associated with the 3Com acquisition. While we have not included the revenue impact of Palm in our outlook, we expect to be able to absorb the dilution associated with the acquisition in our full-year non-GAAP earnings. 
The other variables to consider in our earnings outlook are: An expected OI&E expense of about $0.04 per quarter, a tax rate of approximately 22% and weighted average shares outstanding to decline slightly in the second half of fiscal '10. With that in mind, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.50, representing growth of 16% to 17% for the year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

But again, Bill, like we've said before, all of our acquisitions, regardless of where they are, go through a pretty extensive filter in terms of making sure they're strategically sensible, financially sensible, and that we can actually operate and get some incremental leverage and operating performance out of it. So it's got to hit all three filters. I think in this case, of Palm and our planned acquisition of Palm, it really has more to do with the intellectual property. And in the fact that when you look across the HP ecosystem of interconnected devices, it is a large family of devices. And when you think of printers, you've now got a whole series of Web-connected printers, that as they connect to the Web, need an OS. We prefer to have that OS to, in our case, to be our IP where we can control the customer experience, as we always have in the Printing business, and that's a big deal to us. We can certainly make the same case or smaller Form Factor products in the mobile world like a slate and some other products. And again, I don't want to tell you that we're not going to have -- Microsoft is probably one of the best relationships we've got in our company and they are still extremely important to us. There are a couple of Form Factors though that are very attractive for us, and the small Form Factors where we think the IP can be very additive to us. So it even precisely build a smartphone play. I've seen some people like -- clearly that's a $45 billion total available market that is growing. And so that is an attractive market. But it is for us strategically broader, in the context that the number of HP interconnected devices where we can leverage the IP. And that's what we plan to do."

Again, we had a continuation of strong performance in what we call ProCurve, now HP Networking, edge products, wireless products, obviously, 31% growth in the quarter. That's organic. Obviously, very strong for us. Simultaneously, which is important to note, that we've been building software capabilities in ESN. We talked about this product called Virtual Connect. It is nothing more complicated than -- most of the networking market is sold by number of ports. Those ports aren't always fully utilized. Virtual Connect actually virtualizes those ports, so it's a rudimentary example of a customer usually buying 10 ports. We can virtualize and perhaps reduce that by 30%, 40%, so they now six ports. Our strategy is then to come in with the best performing products and the best TCO in the industry that then actually work with the customer on those ports. Historically, we've been on the edge and wireless. Now with 3Com, we can do the exact same thing in the data center. And so for us, we've had a very good start with 3Com. We have been aggressive in hiring and hiring has started, and hiring is ramping. In the quarter, 3Com, we closed two Fortune logo accounts with 3Com products in the data center. We also had a number of very significant wins on it, where you would think of ProCurve line and had a very strong Virtual Connect quarter as well. So the reason I bring that up to you, Rich, is to give you a context that our networking strategy isn't a 3Com strategy, it's not a ProCurve strategy, it's not a Virtual Connect strategy, it's an all of those capabilities brought together across the HP portfolio. And it's why when we talk about this Converged Infrastructure, that the ability to leverage IP from the server family, the storage family and the networking family, became so integral to our overall story. So we think a very good start, we're very excited about it, we've installed products. The 3Com technology is now in our data centers, and it's now performing our networking tasks. We plan to do more and more of that. And so we feel very excited about it. And to your original question, specialist's hiring is ramping."

I'm not thrilled with the Q2 unit numbers, but I am pretty pleased with the types of units we put in the market. The ASPs were up significantly in lasers, so the units we could get, we got the right units, if you will, from a printer placement perspective. So I think you should expect a very strong back half in laser and a very strong Q3, and we have good line sight and good visibility to that going into the quarter. Demand has continued to be strong. I think, Ben, when you talk about the broader printing business, a very strong quarter for us, obviously, in ink placements. Again, we felt very good about our ink lineup of products, the growth in wireless printing and then web connected printers continues to be very strong. So I think IPG, very strong at ink. As we mentioned in our script and in our opening messages, the position in retail photo kiosk now, Ben, is a big deal. We installed as many retail photo kiosks in the quarter as we had for the entire life of the product. So for us, this was a doubling of that base. We plan to exit at over 7,000 as we exit the year. Managed Print Services had another very significant quarter. And again, the importance of those two businesses for us are, those are long-term businesses. Managed Print Services, five-year contracts. Retail photo kiosk, they installed nine and 10 years, 100% connect of supplies to those products and they are beginning to be a meaningful part of our portfolio. So I think across IPG, when you look at the supplies growth we reported which is the dollar number as opposed to the local number, and the local number would've been yet higher, overall, we felt very good about the IPG quarter. We've worked hard to get the business in a position to be able to do what we just reported. The one thing we really want to get done is what you open with.

We had very strong desktop business, desktop growth in the quarter. When we look at what's coming off from data perspective, we gained eight points of share in the U.S. enterprise in the last quarter. That's second or third quarter that we've seen very large gains in terms of enterprise share and that put us in a pretty good position. We think that if this corporate refresh accelerates, this will be a very good news for us. Now what we've modeled, frankly, David, is more of the same. We have not modeled some big corporate refresh coming that sort of sequentially better than what we've seen. What we have seen, though, is some improvements in our funnel, some improvements in our performance in the areas that I've described, some quicker times to decisions. That's a very important thing and the fact that decision seems to be getting made a little bit faster than they were a year ago. But there is a spike, obviously, given the share position and the things that we're describing, there certainly would be good news."

But I agree with your conclusion that ASPs have improved. Some of that is frankly the commodity environment. And the commodity environment, as you can imagine in 2009, many of the commodity providers, particularly memory providers, really clamped down on CapEx. And so when you look at their capacity today, their capacity is low as demand is increasing. That, of course, increases the price in some of the commodity areas. Typically, as you know, Keith, we do very well in environments like this from a procurement perspective and alignment of supply. That said, there is a passing through of those commodity prices, which you've seen sort of across the board for most companies in the industry, and that is having some effect on ASPs. In addition to your point, some of these sort of better performance you're seeing in some areas like business desktops and workstations, that mix is also affecting the aggregate ASP as well, so that is also a benefit that you're seeing going on in the quarter and what's transpiring. In terms of margins, we'll continue to balance growth and profitability, and make sure we hit the right optimal point within it. Remember, for us, Keith, we think about the PC business more broadly than we do the PC business just an isolation. The PC business really is the procurement arm for almost the entire company from a product perspective. We leverage the common parts across almost all of our infrastructure, so for us, we think about it not just in the context of PSG operating performance but the leverage in the position that gives to the entire company. So I think it's generally good news in terms of the growth that you're seeing in the market, the ASP improvement you're seeing. There is a tighter commodity environment and we'll continue to balance it as we go forward in terms of optimizing growth and profitability."

And so we continue to focus in these areas. Some of the acquisitions that you've described and I won't go into them are frankly not that intriguing to us and are not that relevant to our strategy, which really is around this whole automation management plays, that we think directly affects our Converged Infrastructure business on one side, and also helps automate our services on the other. And so our Software business has three strategic objectives for HP. We try to sell them as individual products in data center transformation. We try to integrate them with our Converged Infrastructure. At the same time, we try to use them as the baseline for our tools capability to automate our services.

For the full year, forget this quarter, that quarter, but when you look at the full year unit performance and the opportunities we have in terms of placements. Again, understand, Scott, we've done this while investing and placing these retail photo kiosks. So I want to make sure this is no trivial issue that we've been able to absorb the start-up of the Managed Print Services businesses. We've been able to install these retail photo kiosks, which are very similar to the printer models, just bigger units. We've forecast the growth -- take the unit growth in inkjet, the forecast that we have in laser and do all that within the targeted margins that we've described.

So I do think you're right. We feel very good about the new product release. That probably has more of an impact to us in the back half of the year than it does in Q3.

To your point about supplies, yes, supplies have been strong. I mean, it's good news and I think it's also not just the unit placements as we've talked before, Brian. Getting the right units placed is actually more important than the unit number of units to get placed. And to some degree, I think you saw that show up in Q2 as well. When you look at the ASPs in the Laser business, let me flip it around. What we were able to focus on was getting the right units out. And that did pay dividends within the context of a number that clearly, we just wish was better. 
Let me wrap it up here. Listen, I think the conclusion of it, for us, is we feel very good about the broad-based growth in the quarter. 13% growth for us, is we think a good result. Not only the fact that we grew 13%, but the fact that it was contributed through across regions and across our businesses we think was extremely positive. 
We are a stronger company today and I want to emphasize that based on our portfolio, our scale and our consistent execution. At the same time, we have more work to do to transform ourselves to reach our potentials. So as good as we feel in some respects about what we've done, we are still not to our full potential, and we feel good about our position which gives us the confidence as we've described here, to raise our outlook from where we previously had it.

Non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 was up 27%, and operating margins of 11.2% were up 80 basis points over the prior year. 
Our growth this quarter was broad-based. Americas and Asia-Pacific each posted solid double-digit growth. Europe also grew double digits, performing better than historical seasonality. After many customers deferred hardware purchases in 2009, we are seeing strong growth in the number of our businesses. Industry Standard Servers grew 54%; ProCurve grow 31%; PCs, 21%; Storage, 16%; consumer printer hardware, 16%; and commercial printer hardware, grow 13%. 
We achieved this growth while investing in sales coverage and R&D, executing our transformation initiatives and absorbing 3Com. Our Enterprise business had solid growth this quarter, fueled by ESS which grew 31% over the prior year. We have built and acquired many assets over the recent years to serve our Enterprise customers. We now have the industry's premier arsenal of hardware, software and global services to deliver Converged Infrastructure and to manage and transform customers IT environments. 
A good example of Converged Infrastructure is our Blade platform, which is the industry leader, with over 50% share. An HP blade chassis can accommodate industry-standard blades, mission-critical blades, storage blades, even PC blades. Older design can maximize computing density and minimize wiring and power consumption. We then can virtualize the networking ports with Virtual Connect and for all the ports that are needed, we attach HP networking gear which has been significantly broadened and enhanced with the acquisition of 3Com. 
Add to that, the software to automate the data center and global services and it's clear we're uniquely positioned to win. Our Services business has made great progress integrating EDS, and we see the results both in our pipeline of opportunities and the improved margins. That being said, we still have more work to do to fully capture the enormous opportunity. 
The Imaging and Printing Group delivered a solid 8% growth with double-digit revenue growth in consumer and commercial hardware, and 6% growth in supplies. IPG continues to make significant progress in placing units with high-page consumption such as ink in the office, wireless and graphics, each of which grew more than 30%. We installed roughly 2,400 retail photo kiosks this quarter, and expect roughly 7,000 placements by year end. 
Managed Print Services had strong signings and Indigo Press pages grew 26%. We continue to make significant investments in this business while delivering 17.2% operating margins. 
The Personal Systems Group had another solid quarter, balancing revenue and profitability. We grew revenues 21% and expanded operating margins. In Q2, we announce our intent to acquire Palm, in order to enhance our intellectual property in the fast-growing and profitable connected mobility space. After closing the acquisition, we expect to leverage webOS and the app store beyond smartphones in the Form Factor such as slates and Web-connected printers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathie, who'll review the financials, let me reiterate the three reasons why I'm so confident in HP's future. First, our broad market leading portfolio. HP is the only company with significant IP, global scale and market leadership in servers, storage, networking, software and services to deliver the next-generation data center. HP is winning in the market, investing in innovation and moving deeper into Hardware segments, like networking and mobility. 
Second, our ability to leverage scale and global range. The global demographics are rapidly changing with the fast-growing middle class population migrating to large cities in emerging markets. In fact, over the next 20 years, the pace of urbanization is estimated to be at the rate of above 60 million people a year. This class of people will expect to be seamlessly and securely connected to the global community, with mobile devices in the underlying infrastructure.  As the largest IT company in the world delivering products and services in over 170 countries, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
Third, our track record have successfully transforming ourselves. Over the past five years, numerous transformational initiatives have helped HP better serve our customers and profitably grow our business. The results speak for themselves. However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us and that's good news. Ongoing transformations in areas like supply chain, sales coverage and service delivery offer outstanding opportunities for growth and for margin expansion. 
We were proud of what we've achieved. We're investing aggressively in the future to create a meaningful competitive advantage for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cathie."

HP delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter.  We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthen our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. At the same t",1448,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.  HP delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter.  We increased revenue by $3.5 billion, expanded margins, strengthen our balance sheet and generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. At the same time, we executed on our transformation initiatives and invested for growth. Our results demonstrate the strength of our operating models and the consistency of execution.  Compared with the year ago, total revenue in the second quarter was $30.8 billion, up 13%, including four points of favorable currency impact. 
On a geographical basis, we delivered double-digit growth in every region, with the Americas and EMEA each growing 11%, and Asia-Pacific increasing 19%. On a constant-currency basis, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 9%, 7% and 10% respectively. 
The second quarter gross margin was 23.5%, flat with the prior year. Sequentially, the gross margin increased 70 basis points, in line with normal seasonality. 
Turning to expenses, we are investing in a number of strategic initiatives to expand our sales and go to market capabilities while continuing to drive productivity. Operating expenses increased 5% to $3.8 billion, demonstrating both our operating leverage and the acceleration of our investments to drive long-term growth, including building out our enterprise sales force, and for restrengthening our product portfolio. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 22% year-on-year to $3.5 billion with operating margin expansion of 80 basis points. Non-GAAP net income increased over $500 million to $2.6 billion, or $1.09 per share. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. During the second quarter, revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 8% to $6.4 billion. Consumer hardware revenue increased 16% and commercial hardware revenue grew 13%, compared with the prior-year quarter, and supplies posted solid 6% growth. 
Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17.2% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments grew 9% with consumer printer units up 15%. Commercial printer units declined 8%, reflecting constrained product availability. 
During the quarter, laser printer average selling prices increased as we focused on placing high-value units. We expect LaserJet system availability to improve significantly in Q3, with more than 30% year-over-year unit growth next quarter. 
For the year, we still expect double-digit unit growth for both inkjet and LaserJet printers. We continue to gain significant traction in our growth initiatives with Managed Print Services, Retail Publishing and Commercial Graphics, each delivering double-digit growth. 
Managed Print Services had multimillion dollar wins in every geography across diverse industries, including financial services, telecommunication and transportation. HP's Managed Print Service offering is being recognized by customers and industry analysts for its industry-leading management tools and infrastructure and its ability to deliver focused solutions for customers. Retail Publishing has had several large wins, installing approximately 2,400 systems this quarter. 
In our Commercial Graphics business, growth accelerated across the portfolio, with Digital Press impressions up 26% from prior year. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Within Services, the IT Outsourcing business grew 6%, with strength in the government and financial services sector. 
In addition, we continue to see a significant increase in the level of product pull-through into our account. Revenue in both Technology Services and Business Process Outsourcing was flat compared with the prior year, and Application Services declined 2%. That said, both Application Services and BPO saw solid signings in the quarter.  
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased $208 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion, or 15.9% of revenue, driven by synergies from the EDS acquisition. 
Over the last 18 months, we have made significant progress with the EDS integration. We have extended our customer relationships, improved utilization and expanded our operating margins. That said, we have more opportunities to transform this business. We will continue to invest in delivering innovative service offerings for our customers while at the same time, driving efficiency, process standardization and automation to further enhance our competitiveness. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.5 billion, up 31% compared with the prior year with balanced growth across every region. The ESS results were driven by exceptional performance in ISS which increases revenue by 54% from the prior-year. This was partially offset by the Business Critical Systems revenue decline of 17%. 
ESS blades delivered strong revenue growth, increasing 45% from the prior year, and the Virtual Connect revenue more than doubled. We continue to be the market leader in servers, with 37% market share in x86 servers, gaining share again year-over-year.  Our G6 platforms delivered strong performance, and we recently launched our G7 platform as customers continue to demand the differentiated performance based on industry standards that HP is uniquely positioned to provide. 
Storage revenue increased 16% from the prior year, driven by solid growth in high-end and entry-storage arrays and significant growth in our scalar iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Network. 
With the improved performance in the business, we are seeing positive operating leverage in the ESS model. This quarter, the business delivered $571 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.6%, an increase of 540 basis points from the prior-year. 
With the close of 3Com this quarter, we are accelerating our investments in networking. HP networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investment segment, recorded organic growth of 31%, or 58% growth including a partial quarter of 3Com results. 
HP software revenue was $871 million, down 1% compared with the prior year. License growth improved this quarter with particular strength in the BTO applications portfolio.  On the bottom-line, the Software business expanded its margins 80 basis points, delivering 18.6 points of operating margin in the second quarter. 
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG revenue increased 21% from the prior-year to $10 billion with notebook and desktop revenue up 17% and 27% respectively, and workstation revenue up 47%. Regionally, we saw a balanced growth across every geography. 
Total unit shipments increased 20% year-on-year, with notebook unit growth of 19% and desktop systems growth of 23%. We introduced several new consumer and business products this quarter, including a new consumer all-in-one desktop, the 12-core Z200 workstation and our lightest EliteBook commercial notebook to date. 
Segment operating profit totaled $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. 
Rounding out the segments, HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 18% to $755 million and generated operating margin of 9.1%, up 190 basis points from the prior-year. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong and we made solid improvements in working capital management year-over-year. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.3 billion. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down seven days from a year ago, and our channel inventory is in good shape. 
We generated solid cash flow in the quarter with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. We continue to actively repurchase shares, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. Finally, we paid our quarterly dividends totaling $196 million. 
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. The currency markets have been volatile and we are assuming that exchange rate stay roughly where they were last week, with the euro in the mid-120.
Taking into consideration our hedging strategies and exposure to a wide basket of currencies, we now expect third quarter revenue of $29.7 billion to $30 billion, and a full-year revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Included in this outlook are unfavorable sequential currency impact of approximately two percentage points from Q2 to Q3 and approximately one point from Q3 to Q4. 
Regarding earnings, our outlook includes both the absorption of the $0.03 incremental legal settlement recorded in the first quarter, but not previously included in our full-year outlook and the dilution associated with the 3Com acquisition. While we have not included the revenue impact of Palm in our outlook, we expect to be able to absorb the dilution associated with the acquisition in our full-year non-GAAP earnings. 
The other variables to consider in our earnings outlook are: An expected OI&E expense of about $0.04 per quarter, a tax rate of approximately 22% and weighted average shares outstanding to decline slightly in the second half of fiscal '10. With that in mind, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.50, representing growth of 16% to 17% for the year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

But again, Bill, like we've said before, all of our acquisitions, regardless of where they are, go through a pretty extensive filter in terms of making sure they're strategically sensible, financially sensible, and that we can actually operate and get some incremental leverage and operating performance out of it. So it's got to hit all three filters. I think in this case, of Palm and our planned acquisition of Palm, it really has more to do with the intellectual property. And in the fact that when you look across the HP ecosystem of interconnected devices, it is a large family of devices. And when you think of printers, you've now got a whole series of Web-connected printers, that as they connect to the Web, need an OS. We prefer to have that OS to, in our case, to be our IP where we can control the customer experience, as we always have in the Printing business, and that's a big deal to us. We can certainly make the same case or smaller Form Factor products in the mobile world like a slate and some other products. And again, I don't want to tell you that we're not going to have -- Microsoft is probably one of the best relationships we've got in our company and they are still extremely important to us. There are a couple of Form Factors though that are very attractive for us, and the small Form Factors where we think the IP can be very additive to us. So it even precisely build a smartphone play. I've seen some people like -- clearly that's a $45 billion total available market that is growing. And so that is an attractive market. But it is for us strategically broader, in the context that the number of HP interconnected devices where we can leverage the IP. And that's what we plan to do."

Again, we had a continuation of strong performance in what we call ProCurve, now HP Networking, edge products, wireless products, obviously, 31% growth in the quarter. That's organic. Obviously, very strong for us. Simultaneously, which is important to note, that we've been building software capabilities in ESN. We talked about this product called Virtual Connect. It is nothing more complicated than -- most of the networking market is sold by number of ports. Those ports aren't always fully utilized. Virtual Connect actually virtualizes those ports, so it's a rudimentary example of a customer usually buying 10 ports. We can virtualize and perhaps reduce that by 30%, 40%, so they now six ports. Our strategy is then to come in with the best performing products and the best TCO in the industry that then actually work with the customer on those ports. Historically, we've been on the edge and wireless. Now with 3Com, we can do the exact same thing in the data center. And so for us, we've had a very good start with 3Com. We have been aggressive in hiring and hiring has started, and hiring is ramping. In the quarter, 3Com, we closed two Fortune logo accounts with 3Com products in the data center. We also had a number of very significant wins on it, where you would think of ProCurve line and had a very strong Virtual Connect quarter as well. So the reason I bring that up to you, Rich, is to give you a context that our networking strategy isn't a 3Com strategy, it's not a ProCurve strategy, it's not a Virtual Connect strategy, it's an all of those capabilities brought together across the HP portfolio. And it's why when we talk about this Converged Infrastructure, that the ability to leverage IP from the server family, the storage family and the networking family, became so integral to our overall story. So we think a very good start, we're very excited about it, we've installed products. The 3Com technology is now in our data centers, and it's now performing our networking tasks. We plan to do more and more of that. And so we feel very excited about it. And to your original question, specialist's hiring is ramping."

I think, Ben, when you talk about the broader printing business, a very strong quarter for us, obviously, in ink placements. Again, we felt very good about our ink lineup of products, the growth in wireless printing and then web connected printers continues to be very strong. So I think IPG, very strong at ink. As we mentioned in our script and in our opening messages, the position in retail photo kiosk now, Ben, is a big deal. We installed as many retail photo kiosks in the quarter as we had for the entire life of the product. So for us, this was a doubling of that base. We plan to exit at over 7,000 as we exit the year. Managed Print Services had another very significant quarter. And again, the importance of those two businesses for us are, those are long-term businesses. Managed Print Services, five-year contracts. Retail photo kiosk, they installed nine and 10 years, 100% connect of supplies to those products and they are beginning to be a meaningful part of our portfolio. So I think across IPG, when you look at the supplies growth we reported which is the dollar number as opposed to the local number, and the local number would've been yet higher, overall, we felt very good about the IPG quarter. We've worked hard to get the business in a position to be able to do what we just reported. The one thing we really want to get done is what you open with.

And I understand there's a cyclical part of services, but much of your Services business, namely your Support and your Outsourcing businesses, are backlog driven, and so they don't really change very quickly.

Now remember, you've got a blend of technology services and what you would think of is more outsourcing services around apps and ITO in the same bucket there. And the maintenance piece of the business does react more of a hardware sales and has a lagging effect on hardware sales in terms of growth, so that's sort of one point. Second, we've been spending a lot of time getting the business right. We have seen very strong improvement in our pipeline. We exited the year with very strong signings. We expect to have a very strong signings here this year, Toni. So when you look at our pipeline and you look at where we're at, we feel very good about the position of the business. Now let me go further just to give you a little bit more color. We have spent a lot of time over the past year and a half, really operationalizing the business, getting underneath issues in the business, opportunities in the business. And I think the team, for the most part, has done a very good job. We certainly improved our profitability, improved our cost structure, better aligned our costs with our revenue. That said, as what happens in most things, as we've gotten deeper into details, the opportunity we think to be very open with you is even better. And we're in the process working through this right now. These are things like how we automate and drive forward our data centers. How we align our job our tool strategy going forward. And I won't go into too much details because of the time on the call, but I will in the future period of time. There are immaterial opportunities for us in the business to improve it, and we will invest into that to get that right and we think that plays long run to our opportunity to grow the business and our opportunity to scale the business. So don't take anything away from this other than we think we got a major opportunity in the business. We feel very good about the position of it, Toni, and I think, you are right in your analytic. I wouldn't necessarily drive it to this hardware result in terms of driving the Services businesses or those kind of growth rates, but we certainly expected to grow at and above market."

But I agree with your conclusion that ASPs have improved. Some of that is frankly the commodity environment. And the commodity environment, as you can imagine in 2009, many of the commodity providers, particularly memory providers, really clamped down on CapEx. And so when you look at their capacity today, their capacity is low as demand is increasing. That, of course, increases the price in some of the commodity areas. Typically, as you know, Keith, we do very well in environments like this from a procurement perspective and alignment of supply. That said, there is a passing through of those commodity prices, which you've seen sort of across the board for most companies in the industry, and that is having some effect on ASPs. In addition to your point, some of these sort of better performance you're seeing in some areas like business desktops and workstations, that mix is also affecting the aggregate ASP as well, so that is also a benefit that you're seeing going on in the quarter and what's transpiring. In terms of margins, we'll continue to balance growth and profitability, and make sure we hit the right optimal point within it. Remember, for us, Keith, we think about the PC business more broadly than we do the PC business just an isolation. The PC business really is the procurement arm for almost the entire company from a product perspective. We leverage the common parts across almost all of our infrastructure, so for us, we think about it not just in the context of PSG operating performance but the leverage in the position that gives to the entire company. So I think it's generally good news in terms of the growth that you're seeing in the market, the ASP improvement you're seeing. There is a tighter commodity environment and we'll continue to balance it as we go forward in terms of optimizing growth and profitability."

I guess, what specifically needs to improve? It seems like the product constraints have been prevalent for multiple quarters, so is any of these intentional seeding of market share, due to low price points by competitors? And then if you could just comment on supplies, did the growth in local currency accelerate in line with your expectations, and do you think that'll continue for the balance of the year as placements for lasers pickup?"

One is, demand has picked up and improved more than what we have expected. That's good news and it's also a bad news, because we haven't been able to get the capacity. We have a very strong backlog coming out of Q2. And like I said earlier, what happened in Q2 in terms of the laser unit decline is not really a surprise to us. It's materially what we had expected going into Q2. This was always going to be a back half, very strong back half unit placement for lasers in order to get to the double digits for the year that we believe is very doable."

We would like to have had more. That's probably the better way to think about it. And let me make sure I'm clear with you, no, we did not do any hold back, because the price points quite the opposite. We were pushing as hard as we could towards the end of the quarter and we're pushing as hard as we can right now. The demand is strong. So to Cathie's point, that's the good news. The bad news is, we haven't been able to fulfill as much as customers want. The brand loyalty to HP is just -- unless you're here feeling it, you wouldn't get it. I mean, it is just amazing how our partners and our customers stick with us on this, and we're going to get better at this. And I'm telling you, I think, Q3 will be turn on it. To your point about supplies, yes, supplies have been strong. I mean, it's good news and I think it's also not just the unit placements as we've talked before, Brian. Getting the right units placed is actually more important than the unit number of units to get placed. And to some degree, I think you saw that show up in Q2 as well. When you look at the ASPs in the Laser business, let me flip it around. What we were able to focus on was getting the right units out. And that did pay dividends within the context of a number that clearly, we just wish was better. 
Let me wrap it up here. Listen, I think the conclusion of it, for us, is we feel very good about the broad-based growth in the quarter. 13% growth for us, is we think a good result. Not only the fact that we grew 13%, but the fact that it was contributed through across regions and across our businesses we think was extremely positive. 
We are a stronger company today and I want to emphasize that based on our portfolio, our scale and our consistent execution. At the same time, we have more work to do to transform ourselves to reach our potentials. So as good as we feel in some respects about what we've done, we are still not to our full potential, and we feel good about our position which gives us the confidence as we've described here, to raise our outlook from where we previously had it. So thank you all for joining us. We do appreciate it."

Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth for Hewlett-Packard that highlights our consistent broad-based performance. We grew revenue 11%, expanded operating margins 30 basis points versus the prior year and grew non-GAAP EPS by 17% to $1.08.
HP is a trusted partner with strong relationships across its customer base. Our portfolio, made up of hardware, software and services, is winning today. But more importantly, our customers recognize HP's position for the future in the data center and converged infrastructure, in connected and mobile devices, in our imaging portfolio and in the breadth of our services offerings.
In Q3, we had balanced geographic performance with revenue in each region growing faster than normal seasonality. Americas was up 12%, EMEA up 9%, and Asia Pacific grew 14%. We saw solid growth across both developed and developing economies.
Our Q3 results also demonstrate good balanced growth across IPG, PSG and our Enterprise Business with solid double-digit growth in our hardware businesses. We are capitalizing on commercial spending with ISS revenue of 31%, storage up 10%, core growth about 42%, IPG commercial up 28% and PSG commercial up 25%. Additionally, we experienced strong services signings in the quarter and increased Enterprise services hardware revenue pull-through by over 50%.
On the expense side, we continue to aggressively improve our productivity. We have significant savings still to be captured in our services, supply chain and real estate initiative. At the same time, we are increasing our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. We see attractive opportunities to take our portfolio to the next level and are focused on increasing our coverage of the $1.3 trillion market.
Before discussing our detailed financial results, let me just summarize our unique position in the market and our sustainable competitive advantages. As our results demonstrate, we continue to leverage our scale and reach to serve customers around the world and drive increased productivity. We are using our financial strength to make balanced investments in growth, efficiency and in effective capital structure.
We are delivering leading technology, products and solutions to our customers. And we will continue to leverage our talented management team to deliver consistent execution.
Now let's take a deeper dive into our numbers, beginning with the P&L. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $30.7 billion. We added $3.1 billion to the topline, delivering 11% growth, including almost a point of favorable currency impact. This was the strongest constant currency growth since 2008.
The third quarter gross margin was 23.8%, up slightly from the prior year and up 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses increased 10% to $3.9 billion, as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth, including increases in R&D and building out our Enterprise sales force. Excluding the impact of the DOJ legal settlement, operating expenses increased 8%.
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 14% year-on-year to $3.4 billion, with operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $135 million due primarily to currency losses.
Non-GAAP net income improved to $2.6 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.08, including the charge of approximately $0.02 relating to the previously announced Department of Justice settlement.
Let's look at the details of our performance by business. Revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 9% to $6.2 billion, fueled by year-over-year unit shipment growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 5%. Commercial hardware revenue increased 28%, while consumer hardware revenue grew 4% compared with the prior-year quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $1 billion or 16.9% of revenue.
We continue to lead the market with innovative new products. In June, we launched the ePrint platform and the ePrintCenter and announced we were expanding our portfolio of web-connected printers to include all printers above $99. This strategy is driving success with third quarter consumer inkjet hardware shipments up 9% year-over-year, led by 64% growth in wireless printers and Officejet growth of 16%.
In addition, our retail publishing footprint continues to expand both in the U.S. and across the world. Commercial printer unit shipments grew 44% with stronger mono and color laser shipments, as hardware availability improved significantly from the prior quarter.
We continue to see strong momentum in our growth initiatives in the Enterprise and commercial print markets. Both graphic arts and managed print services grew double digits. Multi-function printer shipments increased 47% over the prior-year period, and HP Indigo digital presses page volume was up 22%. We will continue to aggressively target these markets, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing.
Turning to Personal Systems, PSG revenue increased 17% from the prior year to $9.9 billion with total unit shipments growing 12%. Segment operating profit totaled $469 million or 4.7% of revenue, as PSG continues to deliver solid performance, driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach.
Notebook and desktop revenues were up 10% and 27% respectively, and workstation revenue increased 54%. This strong workstation performance was driven by our new products with their attractive price performance. PSG average unit prices increased 5% from the prior year and 1% sequentially.
Our initiatives to extend our position in the commercial segment are paying off, with commercial client revenue increasing 25%. Our market leadership in commercial PCs and continued share gains in the U.S. Enterprise segment position us well for the PC refresh cycle that we're seeing in both SMB and corporate enterprise.
Finally, we are pleased to have closed the Palm acquisition at the beginning of July, which gives us the ability to leverage the webOS in a variety of connected mobile devices.
Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Within services, application services increased 4% with growth coming from both new customer accounts and the install base. IT outsourcing and business process outsourcing each increased 1%, and the technology services business declined 1%.
We have strong growth in signings due to renewals by some of our largest customers, and the trailing 12-month book-to-bill remains comfortably greater than 1. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are also seeing more HP products pull through into our enterprise service accounts, and we expect this trend to continue.
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue, up 60 basis points from the prior year, driven by improvements in service delivery.
HP software revenue was $853 million, up 2% when compared with the prior year. BTO increased 3%, led by growth in license revenues. The software business expanded its operating margins by 310 basis points to 21.2%.
On Tuesday of this week, we announced an agreement to acquire Fortify Software. This addition to HPs portfolio complements our existing dynamic application security solution, and strengthens our leadership position in application and information security.
Enterprise storage and server revenue was $4.4 billion, up 19% compared with the prior year with balanced double digit growth across every region. This quarter, the business delivered $549 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.3%, an increase of 210 basis points from the prior year.
The ESS results were driven by strong performance in ISS and ESS blades, which grew 31% and 29% respectively. Storage revenue increased 10% from the prior year, with triple-digit growth in our scale out ICSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Networks.
Business critical systems revenue declined 15% ahead of our new Superdome products which starts shipping in Q4. This quarter, we launched several new products in ESS. I June, we introduced new ProLiant G7 servers, significant enhancements to blade system offerings and our new smart grid technologies which increased the energy benefits for customers by making the datacenter more efficient.
Finally, in July we expanded our storage offerings with the launch of our StoreOnce deduplication products developed by HP Labs.
Turning to our networking business. With the close of 3Com in Q2, we are accelerating our investments in networking. HP Networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investments segment, recorded organic growth of 42%, or total growth of 198% including 3Com, which was ahead of plans.
In the last 90 days, we have seen significant interest in our HP Networking datacenter solutions. Three hundred of our top 1000 customers have initiated proof of concept. Among the customers deploying HP Networking solutions this quarter are Marriott, DreamWorks and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 14% to $764 million and generated operating margins of 9.4%, up 150 basis points from the prior year.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remained strong with solid working capital management. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.8 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down a day from a year ago with day sales outstanding down two days, inventories up three days and days payable up two days.
Channel inventories in ESS and IPG are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is a few days higher than we'd like, and we expect to bring it down in Q4.
We generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion.
During the third quarter we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by $30 million sequentially. And the end of the quarter we had roughly $4.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization, and we expect to remain active in our shares through the end of the fiscal year.
Finally, we paid dividends totaling $205 million.
And now, a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect Q4 fiscal 2010 revenues to be $32.5 billion to $32.7 billion. Included in this outlook is approximately 1 point of negative currency impact compared with the prior year.
For the full year, we are raising our outlook to $125.3 billion to $125.5 billion, up approximately 9.5% from the prior year. Regarding earnings, there are few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long term growth initiatives. We expect O&E expense of about $0.05 per share, a tax rate of approximately 22% and a sequential decline in weighted average shares outstanding similar to what we drove in the third quarter.
With that in mind, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.49 to $4.51, representing growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year.
In summary, we feel good about our broad-based performance in Q3. We are well positioned in the market, and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute.
With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

It seems like quite a few investors believe that the next CEO might decide to noticeably step up the pace of investment as they assume the company has systematically underinvested in recent quarters. So the concern is this would create near term margin pressure and perhaps even a reset of earnings expectations.
So I'm just wondering if you could address the premise that HP's been under-investing, and do you plan to reflect what the possibility of the next CEO investing more aggressively when you provide the FY11 outlook at your analysts day?

But I think what is important is to think about the fact that we've got three year plans out there. Three year plans that are supported by the board that include acceleration in both R&D and sales to drive growth, and those investments are funded through the vast number of productivity initiatives that we've got kind of in flight already. Plus those that are still to come, that give us a real opportunity to not only have health growth, but also grow EPS even faster than revenue growth.
So I don't think that there is an issue there at all. And maybe I'll ask again, Ann and VJ to comment on some of the R&D investments that we've made and the success we've had there over the last few years.

So we announced in June or launched in June the G7 server for a new offering in our ProLiant family. We had significant enhancements that were made to our BladeSystem's offerings. And you also saw a whole new smart grid technology that we introduced. This is focused on helping clients be able to improve the energy efficiency of their data centers.
On top of all that, we also launched StoreOnce, which is the deduplication product that was created in HP labs and then brought through my product development team. This offering is twice as good as anything else in the market from a price performance perspective for deduplication.
And then just to crown it all off, we had our networking business with HP ProCurve, which we've been investing from an R&D perspective, growing 42%. So I think all those things are trying to see R&D that we've been doing and will certainly continue to do.

The other point I'd make, just to repeat what I had said to Ben's comment was, we solved strength in our commercial markets. We gained eight points of share in the U.S. Enterprise where we're seeing very, very good pull-through from our Enterprise Services, our ASPs were up 5%, demonstrating customers willingness to pay for both innovative products and high quality products.

So we feel good about the pipeline that we have; we feel good about the record signings that we had this quarter, that was driven both by a good renewals as well as some new signings. And then when we look at the trailing 12 month signing, and also the book-to-bill ratios, we feel that both of those are healthy numbers. So we feel good about all those things.
As we are finishing up with the first phase of the integration of EDS and HP, what we're doing now is increasing some of our sales resources, and also seeing a very nice improvement in the pull-through. So we care about our overall product position and our ability to sell more products as well as the ultimate growth of the Services business itself.
We do expect that we're going to be able to have this business at a point where it can outgrow the market, and that's going to be based on the sales coverage, improvements we're making as well as some offering adjustments that we are making.
When you look at the margin part of your question, we've performed right at the midpoint of what we said our guidance was of 15% to 17%. So with 15.9 we were right at that midpoint. We were up 60 basis points year-over-year. And yet we feel like even though we're at that range already, there's still a lot more work for us to do.
Back in June, at the beginning of the month we announced a new transformation initiative that we believe can take enterprise services to the next level. And what we communicated to you then that those activities that we are doing around consolidating datacenters, doing more tools deployment, driving more automation, reducing layers, that all these things could generate $500 million to $700 million of net savings by the end of FY '13. So we still feel very optimistic about those numbers that we gave you.
And then on top of it all, as you know having great costs allow you to bite more aggressively and at the same time deliver good margins. So we are always going to be working on the costs to achieve that. So we feel good about where we are at this point, and believe there is a lot of improvement still yet to do in the business.

The importance of that, of course, is that the cost of maintaining zero dilution and offsetting dilution from employee benefit plans has come down very significantly. And therefore, when you spend $2.6 billion in the quarter, it goes heavily to getting shares off the table.

Well, we're at market now. We expect the market to uptick a bit. But we expect to be at market in 2011 as well. And we'll talk more about that at the security analyst meeting.
In terms of seasonality, from a revenue perspective, one of the big adjustments that you need to make on quarterly seasonality is the addition of the EDS to the portfolio. So a number of you are running around with models that say that the normal sequential increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4 is double digit. So when you layer in EDS, that significantly dampens that normal seasonality. So there is more in the range of 8.5 points.
When we put our guidance together, we basically looked at half-two over half-one. And if you look at it on that basis, we have roughly normal seasonality, half-two over half-one. We had a great start in Q3. We are of course, as our usual-self, prudent in Q4. And if we do better than assumptions that we've modeled, we'll have upside in revenue and EPS in Q4.

In the softer economy, what we saw was a more resilient consumer and a commercial side of the business across the company that puts more of the brakes on spending. And now what we are seeing pick up faster is the commercial side of the business.
So we've seen improved growth there and good margins, and we saw also strong performance within the PC business, in the consumer desktop and in commercial and workstations particularly. That obviously helped offset some of the growth changes on the consumer side.

Now, if we look particularly at this quarter, we had an exceptionally strong quarter with our scale out ISCSI products. And that's the technology and product basis that we acquired with LeftHand. So we had triple-digit growth. So it's just a great quarter in customer reception there.
We've also been very pleased with our Ibrix acquisition, which gave us a file based storage offering. And then as well this quarter, we introduced our StoreOnce deduplication product as I mentioned earlier. And the customer reception to this has just been fantastic. So we feel good about all those things.
When you talk about applications and the cloud movement and the things happening there, the other thing that we announced this week which is very pertinent for that space is our acquisition of Fortify Software. And as customers are moving more and more applications to the cloud, they are even more intensely concerned about testing for the security associated with applications. And so that's a move that we made in that space that's very aligned with moving applications to the cloud and the whole security related to it.

You can think about it in two parts, as we solution the new deal, we have an opportunity to build HP technology into those solutions.
And then as customers get to upgrade points in the services contracts that we have with them, that's another opportunity for us to bring our technology into the solution. So it's both those areas.
Another data point that we have is, we know that in every client, when we look at the customers where we have a $50 million services relationship or larger, our share of wallet with the rest of HP's portfolio is higher in those clients than in the rest of our customer base. So those are all good points.
We'll have to think about how we can perhaps give you some view around how to model it, but you should be confident that a big part of our strategy is going to be to use our Services business to bring customers the best technology, and in most case we think that's HP.

Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth for Hewlett-Packard that highlights our consistent broad-based performance. We grew revenue 11%, expanded operating margins 30 basis points versus the prior year and grew non-GAAP EPS by 17% to $1.08. 
HP is a trusted partner with strong relationships across its customer base. Our portfolio made up of hardware, software and services, is winning today. But more importantly, our customers recognize HP's position for the future in the Data Center and Converged Infrastructure, in connected and mobile devices, in our Imaging portfolio and in the breadth of our services offerings. 
In Q3, we had solid geographic performance with revenue in each region growing faster-than-normal seasonality. Americas was up 12%, EMEA up 9% and Asia-Pacific grew 14%. We saw solid growth across both developed and developing economies. 
Our Q3 results also demonstrate good balanced growth across IPG, PSG and our Enterprise business, with solid double-digit growth in our Hardware businesses. We are capitalizing on commercial spending with ISS revenue up 31%, Storage up 10%, ProCurve up 42%, IPG Commercial up 28% and PSG Commercial up 25%. Additionally, we experienced strong services signings in the quarter and increased Enterprise Services hardware revenue pull-through by over 50%. 
On the expense side, we continue to aggressively improve our productivity. We have significant savings still to be captured in our services, supply chain and real estate initiatives. At the same time, we are increasing our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. We see attractive opportunities to take our portfolio to the next level and are focused on increasing our coverage of the $1.3 trillion market. 
Before discussing our detailed financial results, let me just summarize our unique position in the market and our sustainable competitive advantages. As our results demonstrate, we continue to leverage our scale and reach to serve customers around the world and drive increased productivity. We are using our financial strength to make balance investments in growth, efficiency and an effective capital structure. We are delivering leading technologies, products and solutions to our customers, and we will continue to leverage our talented management team to deliver consistent execution. 
Now let's take a deeper dive into our numbers beginning with the P&L. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $30.7 billion. We added $3.1 billion to the top line, delivering 11% growth, including almost a point of favorable currency impact. This was the strongest constant currency growth since 2008. The third quarter gross margin was 23.8%, up slightly from the prior year and up 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses increased 10% to $3.9 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth including increases in R&D and building out our Enterprise sales force. Excluding the impact of the DOJ legal settlement, operating expenses increased 8%. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 14% year-on-year to $3.4 billion, with operating margin expansion up 30 basis points. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $135 million due primarily to currency losses. Non-GAAP net income improved to $2.6 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.08, including the charge of approximately $0.02 relating to the previously announced Department of Justice settlement. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. Revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 9% to $6.2 billion fueled by year-over-year unit shipment growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 5%. Commercial Hardware revenue increased 28%, while Consumer Hardware revenue grew 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $1 billion or 16.9% of revenue. 
We continue to lead the market with innovative new products. In June, we launched the ePrint platform and the ePrintCenter, and announced we were expanding our portfolio of web-connected printers to include all printers above $99. This strategy is driving success with third quarter Consumer Inkjet hardware shipments up 9% year-over-year led by 64% growth in wireless printers and OfficeJet growth of 16%. In addition, our Retail Publishing footprint continues to expand both in the U.S. and across the world. 
Commercial printer unit shipments grew 44% with strong Mono and Color Laser shipments as hardware availability improved significantly from the prior quarter. We continue to see strong momentum in our growth initiatives in the enterprise and commercial print markets, both graphic arts and management services grew double digits. Multifunction Printer shipments increased 47% over the prior year period, and HP Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 22%. We will continue to aggressively target these markets, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing. 
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 17% from the prior year to $9.9 billion, with total unit shipments growing 12%. Segment operating profit totaled $469 million or 4.7% of revenue as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. Notebook and Desktop revenue were up 10% and 27%, respectively, and Workstation revenue increased 54%. This strong Workstation performance was driven by our new products with their attractive price performance. PSG average unit prices increased 5% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. 
Our initiatives to extend our position in the Commercial segment are paying off, with Commercial client revenue increasing 25%. Our market leadership in commercial PCs and continued share gains in the U.S. Enterprise segment position us well for the PC refresh cycle that we are seeing in both SMB and Corporate Enterprise. Finally, we are pleased to have closed the Palm acquisition at the beginning of July, which gives us the ability to leverage the webOS in a variety of connected mobile devices. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Within Services, Application Services increased 4%, with growth coming from both new customer accounts and the installed-base. IT Outsourcing and Business Process Outsourcing each increased 1%, and the Technology Services business declined 1%. We had strong growth in signings due to renewals by some of our largest customers, and the trailing 12-month book to bill remains comfortably greater than 1. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are also seeing more HP product pull-through into our Enterprise Service accounts, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue, up 60 basis points from the prior year driven by improvements in service delivery. HP Software revenue was $863 million, up 2% when compared with the prior year. BTO increased 3% led by growth in licensed revenue. The Software business expanded its operating margin by 310 basis points to 21.2%. 
On Tuesday of this week, we announced an agreement to acquire Fortify Software. This addition to HP's portfolio compliments our existing dynamic Application Security solution, and strengthens our leadership position in application and information security. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.4 billion, up 19% compared with the prior year with balance double-digit growth across every region. This quarter, the business delivered $549 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.3%, an increase of 210 basis points from the prior year. The ESS results were driven by strong performance in ISS and ESS Blades, which grew 31% and 29%, respectively. Storage revenue increased 10% from the prior year with triple digit growth in our scale-out iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Networks. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 15% ahead of our new Superdome product, which starts shipping in Q4. 
This quarter, we launched several new products in ESS. In June, we introduced new ProLiant G7 servers, significant enhancements to BladeSystem offerings and our new Smart Grid technology, which increased the energy benefit for customers by making their data center more efficient. Finally, in July, we expanded our Storage offerings with the launch of our StoreOnce deduplication product developed by HP Labs. 
Turning to our Networking business. With the close of 3Com in Q2, we are accelerating our investments in Networking. HP Networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investments segment, recorded organic growth of 42% or total growth of 198% including 3Com, which was ahead of plan. In the last 90 days, we have seen significant interest in our HP Networking Data Center solutions. 300 of our top 1,000 customers have initiated proof of concept. Among the customers supporting HP Networking solutions this quarter are Marriott, DreamWorks and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 14% to $764 million and generated operating margin of 9.4%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. 
Now onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with solid working capital management. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.8 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down a day from a year ago with days sales outstanding down two days. inventories up three days and days payable up two days. 
Channel inventories in ESS and IPG are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is a few days higher than we'd like, and we expect to bring it down in Q4. We generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the third quarter, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by $30 million sequentially. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $4.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization, and we expect to remain active in our shares through the end of the fiscal year. Finally, we paid dividends totaling $205 million. 
And now a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect Q4 fiscal 2010 revenue to be $32.5 billion to $32.7 billion. Included in this outlook is approximately one point of negative currency impact compared with the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our outlook to $125.3 billion to $125.5 billion, up approximately 9.5% from the prior year. 
Regarding earnings, there are few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth initiatives. We expect O&E expense of about $0.05 per share, a tax rate of approximately 22% and a sequential decline in weighted average shares outstanding similar to what we drove in the third quarter. With that in mind, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.49 to $4.51, representing growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year. 
In summary, we feel good about our broad-based performance in Q3. We are well positioned in the market, and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

It seems like quite a few investors believe that the next CEO might decide to noticeably step up the pace of investment as they assume the company has systematically under invested in recent quarters. So the concern is this would create near-term margin pressure and perhaps even a reset of earnings expectations. So I'm just wondering if you could address the premise that HP's been under investing, and do you plan to reflect the possibility of the next CEO investing more aggressively when you provide the FY '11 outlook at your analyst day."

Well, if you look at Q3, just during the quarter, we had a set of product introductions for the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business that was the largest quarter ever, and this was the result of R&D investments that have been made quarters and years in advance. We announced in June or launched in June the G7 server for a new offering in our ProLiant family. We had significant enhancements that were made to our BladeSystem offering, and you also saw a whole new Smart Grid technology that we introduced and this is focused on helping clients be able to improve the energy efficiency of their data centers.  On top of all of that, we also launched StoreOnce, which is a deduplication product that was created in HP Labs and then brought through my product development team. And this offering is twice as good as anything else in the market from a price-performance perspective for deduplication. And then just to crown it all off, we had our Networking business with HP ProCurve, which we've been investing in from an R&D perspective, growing 42%. So I think all those things are a sign of the R&D that we've been doing and will certainly continue to do."

We were up 60 basis points year-over-year. And yet, we feel like even though we're at that range already, there's still a lot more work for us to do. Back in June, at the beginning of the month, we announced a new transformation initiative that we believe can take Enterprise services to the next level. And what we communicated to you then that those activities that we're doing around consolidating data centers, doing more tools deployment, driving more automation, reducing layers, that all these things could generate $500 million to $700 million of net savings by the end of FY '13. So we still feel very optimistic about those numbers that we gave you. And then on top of it all, as you know, having great cost allow you to price more aggressively and at the same time, deliver good margins.

We spent $2.6 billion in share repurchase in Q3, up from $1.8 billion in the previous quarter. And we do expect to continue to be active in our shares. And I think it's also important to note that our option overhang has come down very significantly. And it now represents roughly 6% of the shares outstanding, which is about half of what it was three years ago. The importance of that, of course, is that the cost of maintaining zero dilution and offsetting dilution from employee benefit plans has come down very significantly. And therefore, when you spend $2.6 billion in the quarter, it goes heavily, they're getting shares off the table. And we do expect, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that you should model about a 30 million share decline from Q3 to Q4, which is about what we saw from Q2 to Q3."

And once you get your cost structure right, you have that opportunity to bid much more competitively, and we're starting to see that in the strong signings and the pipeline. So given those cost-structure improvements, coupled with the investments we have been making in sales coverage as well as innovative services offerings, we expect to outgrow the market in the long term and be closer to the market. Well, we're at market now. We expect the market to uptick a bit, but to be at market in 2011 as well. And we'll talk more about that at the Security Analyst meeting. In terms of seasonality, from a revenue perspective, one of the big adjustments that you need to make on quarterly seasonality is the addition of the EDS to the portfolio. So a number of you are running around these models that say that the normal sequential increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4 is double digits. But when you layer in EDS, that significantly dampens that normal seasonality. So that's more in the range of 8.5 points. When we put our guidance together, we basically looked at half two over half one. And if you look at it on that basis, we have roughly normal seasonality half two over half one. We had a great start in Q3. We are, of course as our usual selves, prudent in Q4. And if we do better than assumptions that we've modeled, we'll have upside in revenue and EPS in Q4."

Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth for Hewlett-Packard that highlights our consistent broad-based performance. We grew revenue 11%, expanded operating margins 30 basis points versus the prior year and grew non-GAAP EPS by 17% to $1.08. 
HP is a trusted partner with strong relationships across its customer base. Our portfolio made up of hardware, software and services, is winning today. But more importantly, our customers recognize HP's position for the future in the Data Center and Converged Infrastructure, in connected and mobile devices, in our Imaging portfolio and in the breadth of our services offerings. 
In Q3, we had solid geographic performance with revenue in each region growing faster-than-normal seasonality. Americas was up 12%, EMEA up 9% and Asia-Pacific grew 14%. We saw solid growth across both developed and developing economies. 
Our Q3 results also demonstrate good balanced growth across IPG, PSG and our Enterprise business, with solid double-digit growth in our Hardware businesses. We are capitalizing on commercial spending with ISS revenue up 31%, Storage up 10%, ProCurve up 42%, IPG Commercial up 28% and PSG Commercial up 25%. Additionally, we experienced strong services signings in the quarter and increased Enterprise Services hardware revenue pull-through by over 50%. 
On the expense side, we continue to aggressively improve our productivity. We have significant savings still to be captured in our services, supply chain and real estate initiatives. At the same time, we are increasing our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. We see attractive opportunities to take our portfolio to the next level and are focused on increasing our coverage of the $1.3 trillion market. 
Before discussing our detailed financial results, let me just summarize our unique position in the market and our sustainable competitive advantages. As our results demonstrate, we continue to leverage our scale and reach to serve customers around the world and drive increased productivity. We are using our financial strength to make balance investments in growth, efficiency and an effective capital structure. We are delivering leading technologies, products and solutions to our customers, and we will continue to leverage our talented management team to deliver consistent execution. 
Now let's take a deeper dive into our numbers beginning with the P&L. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $30.7 billion. We added $3.1 billion to the top line, delivering 11% growth, including almost a point of favorable currency impact. This was the strongest constant currency growth since 2008. The third quarter gross margin was 23.8%, up slightly from the prior year and up 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses increased 10% to $3.9 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth including increases in R&D and building out our Enterprise sales force. Excluding the impact of the DOJ legal settlement, operating expenses increased 8%. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 14% year-on-year to $3.4 billion, with operating margin expansion up 30 basis points. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $135 million due primarily to currency losses. Non-GAAP net income improved to $2.6 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.08, including the charge of approximately $0.02 relating to the previously announced Department of Justice settlement. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. Revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 9% to $6.2 billion fueled by year-over-year unit shipment growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 5%. Commercial Hardware revenue increased 28%, while Consumer Hardware revenue grew 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $1 billion or 16.9% of revenue. 
We continue to lead the market with innovative new products. In June, we launched the ePrint platform and the ePrintCenter, and announced we were expanding our portfolio of web-connected printers to include all printers above $99. This strategy is driving success with third quarter Consumer Inkjet hardware shipments up 9% year-over-year led by 64% growth in wireless printers and OfficeJet growth of 16%. In addition, our Retail Publishing footprint continues to expand both in the U.S. and across the world. 
Commercial printer unit shipments grew 44% with strong Mono and Color Laser shipments as hardware availability improved significantly from the prior quarter. We continue to see strong momentum in our growth initiatives in the enterprise and commercial print markets, both graphic arts and management services grew double digits. Multifunction Printer shipments increased 47% over the prior year period, and HP Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 22%. We will continue to aggressively target these markets, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing. 
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 17% from the prior year to $9.9 billion, with total unit shipments growing 12%. Segment operating profit totaled $469 million or 4.7% of revenue as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. Notebook and Desktop revenue were up 10% and 27%, respectively, and Workstation revenue increased 54%. This strong Workstation performance was driven by our new products with their attractive price performance. PSG average unit prices increased 5% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. 
Our initiatives to extend our position in the Commercial segment are paying off, with Commercial client revenue increasing 25%. Our market leadership in commercial PCs and continued share gains in the U.S. Enterprise segment position us well for the PC refresh cycle that we are seeing in both SMB and Corporate Enterprise. Finally, we are pleased to have closed the Palm acquisition at the beginning of July, which gives us the ability to leverage the webOS in a variety of connected mobile devices. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Within Services, Application Services increased 4%, with growth coming from both new customer accounts and the installed-base. IT Outsourcing and Business Process Outsourcing each increased 1%, and the Technology Services business declined 1%. We had strong growth in signings due to renewals by some of our largest customers, and the trailing 12-month book to bill remains comfortably greater than 1. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are also seeing more HP product pull-through into our Enterprise Service accounts, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue, up 60 basis points from the prior year driven by improvements in service delivery. HP Software revenue was $863 million, up 2% when compared with the prior year. BTO increased 3% led by growth in licensed revenue. The Software business expanded its operating margin by 310 basis points to 21.2%. 
On Tuesday of this week, we announced an agreement to acquire Fortify Software. This addition to HP's portfolio compliments our existing dynamic Application Security solution, and strengthens our leadership position in application and information security. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.4 billion, up 19% compared with the prior year with balance double-digit growth across every region. This quarter, the business delivered $549 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.3%, an increase of 210 basis points from the prior year. The ESS results were driven by strong performance in ISS and ESS Blades, which grew 31% and 29%, respectively. Storage revenue increased 10% from the prior year with triple digit growth in our scale-out iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Networks. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 15% ahead of our new Superdome product, which starts shipping in Q4. 
This quarter, we launched several new products in ESS. In June, we introduced new ProLiant G7 servers, significant enhancements to BladeSystem offerings and our new Smart Grid technology, which increased the energy benefit for customers by making their data center more efficient. Finally, in July, we expanded our Storage offerings with the launch of our StoreOnce deduplication product developed by HP Labs. 
Turning to our Networking business. With the close of 3Com in Q2, we are accelerating our investments in Networking. HP Networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investments segment, recorded organic growth of 42% or total growth of 198% including 3Com, which was ahead of plan. In the last 90 days, we have seen significant interest in our HP Networking Data Center solutions. 300 of our top 1,000 customers have initiated proof of concept. Among the customers supporting HP Networking solutions this quarter are Marriott, DreamWorks and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 14% to $764 million and generated operating margin of 9.4%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. 
Now onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with solid working capital management. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.8 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down a day from a year ago with days sales outstanding down two days. inventories up three days and days payable up two days. 
Channel inventories in ESS and IPG are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is a few days higher than we'd like, and we expect to bring it down in Q4. We generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the third quarter, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by $30 million sequentially. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $4.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization, and we expect to remain active in our shares through the end of the fiscal year. Finally, we paid dividends totaling $205 million. 
And now a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect Q4 fiscal 2010 revenue to be $32.5 billion to $32.7 billion. Included in this outlook is approximately one point of negative currency impact compared with the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our outlook to $125.3 billion to $125.5 billion, up approximately 9.5% from the prior year. 
Regarding earnings, there are few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth initiatives. We expect O&E expense of about $0.05 per share, a tax rate of approximately 22% and a sequential decline in weighted average shares outstanding similar to what we drove in the third quarter. With that in mind, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.49 to $4.51, representing growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year. 
In summary, we feel good about our broad-based performance in Q3. We are well positioned in the market, and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

It seems like quite a few investors believe that the next CEO might decide to noticeably step up the pace of investment as they assume the company has systematically under invested in recent quarters. So the concern is this would create near-term margin pressure and perhaps even a reset of earnings expectations. So I'm just wondering if you could address the premise that HP's been under investing, and do you plan to reflect the possibility of the next CEO investing more aggressively when you provide the FY '11 outlook at your analyst day."

But I think what's important is that to think about the fact that we've got three-year plans out there, three-year plans that are supported by the board, that include acceleration in both R&D and sales to drive growth. And those investments are funded through the vast number of productivity initiatives that we've got kind of in flight already plus those that are still to come. They give us real opportunity, not only have healthy growth, but also grow EPS even faster than revenue growth. So I don't think that there's an issue there at all, and maybe I'll ask, again, Ann and VJ to comment on some of the R&D investments that we've made and the success we've had there over the last few years."

Well, if you look at Q3, just during the quarter, we had a set of product introductions for the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business that was the largest quarter ever, and this was the result of R&D investments that have been made quarters and years in advance. We announced in June or launched in June the G7 server for a new offering in our ProLiant family. We had significant enhancements that were made to our BladeSystem offering, and you also saw a whole new Smart Grid technology that we introduced, and this is focused on helping clients be able to improve the energy efficiency of their data centers.  On top of all of that, we also launched StoreOnce, which is a deduplication product that was created in HP Labs and then brought through my product development team. And this offering is twice as good as anything else in the market from a price-performance perspective for deduplication. And then just to crown it all up, we had our Networking business with HP ProCurve, which we've been investing in from an R&D perspective, growing 42%. So I think all those things are a sign of the R&D that we've been doing and will certainly continue to do."

There is bad business to chase in the PC market if market share is your primary and your only goal. That's not what we're working on. Our scale, our global footprint, frankly, the flexibility in this business will continue to be competitive differentiators for PSG and for HP overall. I think the other point I'd make, just to repeat what I'd said to Ben's comment, was we saw strength in our commercial markets. We gained eight points of share in the U.S. Enterprise where we're seeing very, very good pull-through from our Enterprise Services. Our ASPs were up 5%, demonstrating customers' willingness to pay for both innovative products and high-quality products."

And as you know, this business is driven by having solid pipelines that have quality deals, as well as good quantity of deals. So we feel good about the pipeline that we have. We feel good about the record signings that we had this quarter. That was driven both by good renewals, as well as some new signings. And then when we look at the trailing 12-month signings and also the book-to-bill ratios, we feel that both of those are healthy numbers. So we feel good about all those things. As we're finishing up with the first phase of the integration of EDS into HP, what we're doing now is increasing some of our sales resources and also, seeing a very nice improvement in the pull-through. So we care about our overall product position and our ability to sell more products, as well as the ultimate growth of the Services business itself. We do expect that we're going to be able to have this business to the point where it can outgrow the market. And that's going to be based on the sales coverage improvements we're making, as well as some offering adjustments that we're making. When you look at the margins part of your question, we performed right at the midpoint of what we said our guidance was, 15% to 17%. So it's 15.9%, we were right at that midpoint. We were up 60 basis points year-over-year. And yet, we feel like even though we're at that range already, there's still a lot more work for us to do. Back in June, at the beginning of the month, we announced a new transformation initiative that we believe can take Enterprise services to the next level. And what we communicated to you then that those activities that we're doing around consolidating data centers, doing more tools deployment, driving more automation, reducing layers, that all these things could generate $500 million to $700 million of net savings by the end of FY '13. So we still feel very optimistic about those numbers that we gave you. And then on top of it all, as you know, having great cost allow you to price more aggressively and at the same time, deliver good margins. So we're always going to be working on the cost to achieve that. So we feel good about where we are at this point and believe there's a lot of improvements still yet to do in the business."

In terms of seasonality, from a revenue perspective, one of the big adjustments that you need to make on quarterly seasonality is the addition of the EDS to the portfolio. So a number of you are running around with models that say that the normal sequential increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4 is double digits. But when you layer in EDS, that significantly dampens that normal seasonality. So that's more in the range of 8.5 points. When we put our guidance together, we basically looked at half two over half one. And if you look at it on that basis, we have roughly normal seasonality half two over half one. We had a great start in Q3. We are, of course, as our usual selves, prudent in Q4. And if we do better than assumptions that we've modeled, we'll have upside in revenue and EPS in Q4."

Another data point that we have is we know that in every client, when we look at the customers where we have a $50 million Services relationship or larger, our share of wallet with the rest of HP's portfolio is higher in those clients than in the rest of our customer base. So those are all good points. We'll have to think about how we can, perhaps, give you some view around how to model it.

Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth for Hewlett-Packard that highlights our consistent broad-based performance. We grew revenue 11%, expanded operating margins 30 basis points versus the prior year and grew non-GAAP EPS by 17% to $1.08. 
HP is a trusted partner with strong relationships across its customer base. Our portfolio made up of hardware, software and services, is winning today. But more importantly, our customers recognize HP's position for the future in the Data Center and Converged Infrastructure, in connected and mobile devices, in our Imaging portfolio and in the breadth of our services offerings. 
In Q3, we had solid geographic performance with revenue in each region growing faster-than-normal seasonality. Americas was up 12%, EMEA up 9% and Asia-Pacific grew 14%. We saw solid growth across both developed and developing economies. 
Our Q3 results also demonstrate good balanced growth across IPG, PSG and our Enterprise business, with solid double-digit growth in our Hardware businesses. We are capitalizing on commercial spending with ISS revenue up 31%, Storage up 10%, ProCurve up 42%, IPG Commercial up 28% and PSG Commercial up 25%. Additionally, we experienced strong services signings in the quarter and increased Enterprise Services hardware revenue pull-through by over 50%. 
On the expense side, we continue to aggressively improve our productivity. We have significant savings still to be captured in our services, supply chain and real estate initiatives. At the same time, we are increasing our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. We see attractive opportunities to take our portfolio to the next level and are focused on increasing our coverage of the $1.3 trillion market. 
Before discussing our detailed financial results, let me just summarize our unique position in the market and our sustainable competitive advantages. As our results demonstrate, we continue to leverage our scale and reach to serve customers around the world and drive increased productivity. We are using our financial strength to make balance investments in growth, efficiency and an effective capital structure. We are delivering leading technologies, products and solutions to our customers, and we will continue to leverage our talented management team to deliver consistent execution. 
Now let's take a deeper dive into our numbers beginning with the P&L. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $30.7 billion. We added $3.1 billion to the top line, delivering 11% growth, including almost a point of favorable currency impact. This was the strongest constant currency growth since 2008. The third quarter gross margin was 23.8%, up slightly from the prior year and up 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses increased 10% to $3.9 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth including increases in R&D and building out our Enterprise sales force. Excluding the impact of the DOJ legal settlement, operating expenses increased 8%. 
Non-GAAP operating profit increased 14% year-on-year to $3.4 billion, with operating margin expansion up 30 basis points. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $135 million due primarily to currency losses. Non-GAAP net income improved to $2.6 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.08, including the charge of approximately $0.02 relating to the previously announced Department of Justice settlement. 
Looking at the details of our performance by business. Revenue in the Imaging and Printing business grew 9% to $6.2 billion fueled by year-over-year unit shipment growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 5%. Commercial Hardware revenue increased 28%, while Consumer Hardware revenue grew 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $1 billion or 16.9% of revenue. 
We continue to lead the market with innovative new products. In June, we launched the ePrint platform and the ePrintCenter, and announced we were expanding our portfolio of web-connected printers to include all printers above $99. This strategy is driving success with third quarter Consumer Inkjet hardware shipments up 9% year-over-year led by 64% growth in wireless printers and OfficeJet growth of 16%. In addition, our Retail Publishing footprint continues to expand both in the U.S. and across the world. 
Commercial printer unit shipments grew 44% with strong Mono and Color Laser shipments as hardware availability improved significantly from the prior quarter. We continue to see strong momentum in our growth initiatives in the enterprise and commercial print markets, both graphic arts and management services grew double digits. Multifunction Printer shipments increased 47% over the prior year period, and HP Indigo Digital Press page volume was up 22%. We will continue to aggressively target these markets, leveraging our technology leadership to drive the shift from analog to digital printing. 
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 17% from the prior year to $9.9 billion, with total unit shipments growing 12%. Segment operating profit totaled $469 million or 4.7% of revenue as PSG continues to deliver solid performance driven by our innovative product portfolio, scale and global reach. Notebook and Desktop revenue were up 10% and 27%, respectively, and Workstation revenue increased 54%. This strong Workstation performance was driven by our new products with their attractive price performance. PSG average unit prices increased 5% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. 
Our initiatives to extend our position in the Commercial segment are paying off, with Commercial client revenue increasing 25%. Our market leadership in commercial PCs and continued share gains in the U.S. Enterprise segment position us well for the PC refresh cycle that we are seeing in both SMB and Corporate Enterprise. Finally, we are pleased to have closed the Palm acquisition at the beginning of July, which gives us the ability to leverage the webOS in a variety of connected mobile devices. 
Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Within Services, Application Services increased 4%, with growth coming from both new customer accounts and the installed-base. IT Outsourcing and Business Process Outsourcing each increased 1%, and the Technology Services business declined 1%. We had strong growth in signings due to renewals by some of our largest customers, and the trailing 12-month book to bill remains comfortably greater than 1. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, we are also seeing more HP product pull-through into our Enterprise Service accounts, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue, up 60 basis points from the prior year driven by improvements in service delivery. HP Software revenue was $863 million, up 2% when compared with the prior year. BTO increased 3% led by growth in licensed revenue. The Software business expanded its operating margin by 310 basis points to 21.2%. 
On Tuesday of this week, we announced an agreement to acquire Fortify Software. This addition to HP's portfolio compliments our existing dynamic Application Security solution, and strengthens our leadership position in application and information security. 
Enterprise Storage and Server revenue was $4.4 billion, up 19% compared with the prior year with balance double-digit growth across every region. This quarter, the business delivered $549 million in operating profit and an operating margin of 12.3%, an increase of 210 basis points from the prior year. The ESS results were driven by strong performance in ISS and ESS Blades, which grew 31% and 29%, respectively. Storage revenue increased 10% from the prior year with triple digit growth in our scale-out iSCSI products based on technology acquired from LeftHand Networks. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 15% ahead of our new Superdome product, which starts shipping in Q4. 
This quarter, we launched several new products in ESS. In June, we introduced new ProLiant G7 servers, significant enhancements to BladeSystem offerings and our new Smart Grid technology, which increased the energy benefit for customers by making their data center more efficient. Finally, in July, we expanded our Storage offerings with the launch of our StoreOnce deduplication product developed by HP Labs. 
Turning to our Networking business. With the close of 3Com in Q2, we are accelerating our investments in Networking. HP Networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investments segment, recorded organic growth of 42% or total growth of 198% including 3Com, which was ahead of plan. In the last 90 days, we have seen significant interest in our HP Networking Data Center solutions. 300 of our top 1,000 customers have initiated proof of concept. Among the customers supporting HP Networking solutions this quarter are Marriott, DreamWorks and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver very strong consistent results. In the third quarter, financing revenue grew 14% to $764 million and generated operating margin of 9.4%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. 
Now onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with solid working capital management. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.8 billion. Our third quarter cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down a day from a year ago with days sales outstanding down two days. inventories up three days and days payable up two days. 
Channel inventories in ESS and IPG are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is a few days higher than we'd like, and we expect to bring it down in Q4. We generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the third quarter, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by $30 million sequentially. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $4.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization, and we expect to remain active in our shares through the end of the fiscal year. Finally, we paid dividends totaling $205 million. 
And now a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect Q4 fiscal 2010 revenue to be $32.5 billion to $32.7 billion. Included in this outlook is approximately one point of negative currency impact compared with the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our outlook to $125.3 billion to $125.5 billion, up approximately 9.5% from the prior year. 
Regarding earnings, there are few variables to keep in mind. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth initiatives. We expect O&E expense of about $0.05 per share, a tax rate of approximately 22% and a sequential decline in weighted average shares outstanding similar to what we drove in the third quarter. With that in mind, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. For the full year, we are raising our outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.49 to $4.51, representing growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year. 
In summary, we feel good about our broad-based performance in Q3. We are well positioned in the market, and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

It seems like quite a few investors believe that the next CEO might decide to noticeably step up the pace of investment as they assume the company has systematically under invested in recent quarters. So the concern is this would create near-term margin pressure and perhaps even a reset of earnings expectations. So I'm just wondering if you could address the premise that HP's been under investing, and do you plan to reflect the possibility of the next CEO investing more aggressively when you provide the FY '11 outlook at your analyst day."

They give us real opportunity, not only have healthy growth, but also grow EPS even faster than revenue growth.

Well, if you look at Q3, just during the quarter, we had a set of product introductions for the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business that was the largest quarter ever, and this was the result of R&D investments that have been made quarters and years in advance. We announced in June or launched in June the G7 server for a new offering in our ProLiant family. We had significant enhancements that were made to our BladeSystem offering, and you also saw a whole new Smart Grid technology that we introduced, and this is focused on helping clients be able to improve the energy efficiency of their data centers.  On top of all of that, we also launched StoreOnce, which is a deduplication product that was created in HP Labs and then brought through my product development team. And this offering is twice as good as anything else in the market from a price-performance perspective for deduplication. And then just to crown it all up, we had our Networking business with HP ProCurve, which we've been investing in from an R&D perspective, growing 42%. So I think all those things are a sign of the R&D that we've been doing and will certainly continue to do."

When you look at the margin part of your question, we performed right at the midpoint of what we said our guidance was, 15% to 17%. So it's 15.9%, we were right at that midpoint. We were up 60 basis points year-over-year. And yet, we feel like even though we're at that range already, there's still a lot more work for us to do. Back in June, at the beginning of the month, we announced a new transformation initiative that we believe can take Enterprise services to the next level. And what we communicated to you then that those activities that we're doing around consolidating data centers, doing more tools deployment, driving more automation, reducing layers, that all these things could generate $500 million to $700 million of net savings by the end of FY '13.

And then on top of it all, as you know, having great cost allow you to price more aggressively and at the same time, deliver good margins.

And once you get your cost structure right, you have that opportunity to bid much more competitively, and we're starting to see that in the strong signings and the pipeline. So given those cost-structure improvements, coupled with the investments we have been making in sales coverage as well as innovative services offerings, we expect to outgrow the market in the long term and be closer to the market. Well, we're at market now. We expect the market to uptick a bit, but to be at market in 2011 as well. And we'll talk more about that at the Security Analyst meeting. In terms of seasonality, from a revenue perspective, one of the big adjustments that you need to make on quarterly seasonality is the addition of the EDS to the portfolio. So a number of you are running around with models that say that the normal sequential increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4 is double digits. But when you layer in EDS, that significantly dampens that normal seasonality. So that's more in the range of 8.5 points. When we put our guidance together, we basically looked at half two over half one. And if you look at it on that basis, we have roughly normal seasonality half two over half one. We had a great start in Q3. We are, of course, as our usual selves, prudent in Q4. And if we do better than assumptions that we've modeled, we'll have upside in revenue and EPS in Q4."

Since the last time we spoke, I have been meeting with our customers and partners as well as thousands of employees around the world. I joked on today of the announcement that I might set world record for travel and I think I might have actually done it. I have been listening, I have been learning and I have been immersing this over the business and today I'm even more excited and honored to be HP CEO.
HP is a Company with great momentum incredibly committed in terms of people, deep customer relationships and strong core businesses. I'm confident in our future and energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. When I look at our Q4 results, what's clear is that HP is winning in the market and we have an impressive ability to execute. I'm proud of our leadership team and our people for their continued focus doing what has been extraordinary time for the Company.
We finished our fiscal year with $126 billion in revenues. It's a 10% year-over-year increase or an incremental $11.5 billion of growth. We grew nearly $1 billion per month last year. During the same time, we expanded our non-GAAP operating profit faster than revenue, up 14% year-over-year and our non-GAAP EPS grew even faster at 19% for the full year. It is evidence of our strong operating leverage, our leadership positions, our ability to grow in higher margin categories and our strong balance sheet. We are carrying this momentum into FY'11.We have the ability to drive continued growth and at the same time, I remain committed to driving operational efficiencies into the years ahead. I'm confident in our updated FY'11 outlook, which Cathie will share with you in a moment.
Before Cathie provides more financial detail, however, I would like to share some of my initial observations about HP, our potential, and also errors where we need to do things better. Now bear in mind, these are just my initial thoughts. I have been on the job for just about three weeks now and I still have good amount of listening and data gathering to do. I intend to provide the more robust perspective in the next few months.
Well, now I will share three observations; one about customers, the second is about our employees, and third about our technologies. I have received great feedback from our customers thus far. They are asking for solution partner who have hardware and software technology, and business challenges. They want to access to information instantly no matter where they are and they want choice not proprietary logins.
The great majority are telling me that they want to do more business with HP. They are like our openness, our price performance, our industry-leading technologies, and our focus on manageability and security.
Look at ISS share gains in revenue which was up 32% year-over-year. ProCurve Networking, another good example, was up 50% organically year-over-year. PSG continues to be the worldwide leader in PCs. Our enterprise customers want the ability to work in hybrid environments both cloud and traditional, and this is HP's long-term opportunity and leverage.
What they are mostly hearing that we need to make it easier for customers to work with HP. We need to have the right coverage model that meets their needs and we must be even more focused on bringing our customers product and solutions that deliver the promise of Instant-On [ph] across the consumer, SMB and enterprise segments.
I have also enjoyed talking with our employees all over the world. They are very focused on our customers and growing our business. They have terrific ideas and also know how to derive operation efficiency. We welcome new employees from 3PAR outside 45 in SATA VIA [ph] in the fourth quarter and I am excited about these additions and integrations as starting of well.
HP employees are highly competitive group who wants to win. They also want to be rewarded for their performance. This is consistent across the globe. I believe in the performance-driven culture and our employees have been performing. Therefore, I am pleased that we will be reinstituting salary increases in FY '11 as part of our normal annual review process. It's well deserve.
Also, we are creating more sustainable collaborative and productive workspaces for all employees. As part of this ongoing workspace initiative, we (inaudible) our global headquarters in Palo Alto and we just completed the sale of our Cupertino campus and with the consolidated HP Cupertino's side into Palo Alto over the next three years.
Now let me switch to technology. As Cathie described to you at the Securities Analyst Meeting in September, we have been increasing our investment in R&D. In the fourth quarter, R&D was up more than revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially. We should expect this trend to continue. We have a strong product portfolio with innovation across the Company. In the fourth quarter, we began shipping our Superdome 2 and our BCS business was up 10%. IPG achieved another strong quarter including share gains in both laser and ink and we continue to innovate around ePrint and web-connected printers. I am very excited about the opportunity available to us to shape the planet at mobile instant arm platform.
Moving forward, I am excited to spend more time digging into our technology. We have so much opportunity, unique opportunity as a Company and it’s not simply about spending in R&D, rather it’s about driving more leverage from our existing portfolio and resources to crease HP Solutions. It is about adding more agility to our scale and accelerating our innovation cycles.
We are in a unique position to drive better, more consistent and unified user experiences across our portfolio like with our converse infrastructure offerings and we can leverage even more technologies to create integrated value added solutions in addition to our point products. Just as we have our customers knock down their technologies titles, we have the opportunity to knock down a few of our own.
HP has already been moving in this direction but we can do more. We need to enhance our software IP across the Company to create more differentiation with our products this includes strengthening our core software business segment as well as adding value added IP and services that cut across all segments.
As an example HP has the leading software, a unique IP called Metavante, an interchange to administer health plans and pose as (inaudible) healthcare organizations. This is an HP platform that leverages software IP and infrastructure along with value added services to provide the fully integrated vertical solution. To-date HP’s processes over a billion claims in U.S. annually where about one in every four themes. HP now runs Medicaid in 22 states. We're improving quality of care and reducing operational costs for our healthcare customers and ultimately serving both their technology and business challenges together.
In the next weeks and months ahead, I will continue engaging with our customers, partners, employees, senior leaders and investors while I still have more listening to do as you think already very evident to me. HP is a strong company. We have a significant opportunity in front of us and we will continue to lead the market presence and create value for our customers and shareholders.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie.

Hewlett-Packard delivered strong balance growth in the fourth quarter across all regions and market segments. In Q4, we added $2.5 billion of new revenue, expanded gross margins and operating margins and grew earnings per share by 17% year-on-year. We continue to execute our strategy moving up the stack and increasing our mix of higher margin businesses to drive sustainable gross margin improvement.
In Q4, we saw a strong growth in margin accretive solutions such as Virtual Connect and Blade System Matrix as well as the contribution from strategic acquisitions such as 3Com. These benefits combined with disciplined pricing and promotion activity drove gross margin expansion of 110 basis points versus the prior year to 24.8%.
We are investing for growth and augmenting our global sales force to improve the coverage of our $1.6 trillion addressable market. Our solution portfolio and technology offerings are strong and we're encouraged by the initial results of our enterprise sales force deployment. Looking into the details of the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $33.3 billion, up 8% from the prior year or 9% adjusting for currency.
We continue to see momentum in the commercial sectors led by strength in converged infrastructure, managed print services, and commercial printers and PCs.
We posted solid double digit revenue growth across our hardware businesses with enterprise server and storage growing 25% and ProCurve networking up 50%. Commercial printer hardware and PSG commercial revenue grew 22% and 20%, respectively. Additionally in Services, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 12-month remained comfortably greater than one.
Looking at revenue by geography, we had balanced performance with revenues in the Americas and EMEA increasing 10% and 6%, respectively. In Asia-Pacific, revenue grew 8% with strong growth across the region, partially offset by some ongoing HP challenges in the China PC business. Excluding China, Asia Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth.
Turning to the expense side, operating expenses increased to $4.2 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth, including increases in R&D and expansion of our sales force. We are strengthening R&D both through incremental investments and the addition of strong technical talent from the acquisitions that we made in fiscal 2010.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 10% year-on-year to $4 billion as growth margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales and R&D. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income improved to $3.1 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.33.
Looking at the full year, we delivered revenue of $126 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $14.4 billion or 11.4% of revenue, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 19% to $4.58.
As Leo mentioned, HP is focused on creating value for our customers. In the Enterprise business this means driving our vision by delivering converged infrastructure, modernizing application, picturing the enterprise and managing information. This quarter demonstrates another proof point that HP is winning.
The enterprise storage and server business produced record revenue of $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year with balanced double-digit growth across each business unit and every region. Operating profit for the business was up 52% on a year-over-year basis with $730 million with operating margin of 13.9%, an increase of 250 basis points from the prior year demonstrating the operating leverage in the model.
Our Industry Standard Server business achieved the number one market share position in all three regions with growth of 32% and ESS Blades far outpaced the market with 51% growth year-over-year.
Within the Business critical systems group, we successful launch the integrity Superdome 2 as the flagship solution of the mission critical converged infrastructure. Superdome 2 delivers best-in-class system level performance and scalability, while improving resiliency more than four times over the original Superdome.
Business critical systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year with strong growth in the telecom sector in the Americas and more balanced growth across verticals in other regions.
In Storage, revenue increased 14% from the prior year with balanced growth across our broad portfolio. We are investing in the most attractive high growth segment and our strategy is working.
In Q4, we delivered triple-digit growth in our scale-out iSCSI product. Our enterprise NAS and our StoreOnce data de-duplication technology. We are also over very pleased with the traction and buzz around the 3PAR acquisition which closed on September 27. We are already seeing accelerating interest in these products from our existing and new customers and expect to extend three parts of routes to market by leveraging HP’s broad channel and enterprise sales force.
HP Networking, which is reported in the Corporate Investment continues to build on its worldwide momentum while executing ahead of plan. Revenue in HP Networking grew 227% with ProCurve revenues up 50%. A tipping point security portfolio also delivered strong growth. In the Americas region, historically one of the most competitive markets HP ProCurve more than doubled. We see strong demand for our networking solutions as our value proposition of better performance, improved security, simple pain of glass manageability and lower cost of ownership is resonating with our customers.
Enterprise customers continue to demonstrate interest in our Networking product portfolio with over 400 of HP’s top global accounts enrolling in the HP Networking proof-of-concept program which we closed 3Com in April. We had a good quarter in state and local government accounts as well as new wins with the BMW Group and Underwriters Laboratories.
Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and technology services revenues each grew roughly 1%. Outsourcing saw strength in the U.S. public sector with renewals and new Medicaid business. Business processing outsourcing was down 11% including a 7% negative impact due to the divestiture of accelerate HRO.
Our pipeline of Enterprise Services opportunities remains robust and we are actively investing in the field to build out our addressable market coverage.
We continue to see healthy HP product pull-through in our Enterprise Service accounts and we expect this trend to continue.
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.5 billion or 16.7% of revenue, up 50 basis points from the prior year, driven by improvements in service delivery. For the full year, Services delivered $5.6 billion in operating profit and expanded operating margins by 160 basis points even as we continued to invest in sales coverage, transformation and on boarding new deals.
HP Software revenue was $974 million, up 1% compared with the prior year. Business Technology Optimization revenue increased 4% and Other Software revenue declined 6%. We are excited about expanding our security presence with the recent acquisitions of Fortify and ArcSight in the quarter. The Software business expanded its operating margins by 120 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit was $247 million or 25.4% of revenue, up from $234 million or 24.2% of revenue in the prior year period.
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 4% from the prior year to $10.3 billion with total unit shipments growing 2%. Segment operating profit totaled $568 million or 5.5% of revenue, up 80 basis points year-over-year as PSG benefitted from favorable component pricing and disciplined pricing and promotion programs.
The commercial refresh continues. In SMB, we are launching new call centers internationally, building on the success we have seen with the call centers in the U.S. We maintained our market leadership position in commercial PCs and once again expanded our share in the U.S. enterprise segment by winning new accounts from competitors and investing in channel program. As a result, commercial client revenue grew 20%, workstations had another strong quarter with 55% growth, and commercial desktop revenue was up 23% year-over-year.
Total notebook revenue was down 3% reflecting softness in consumer notebooks. The consumer weakness was predominantly in low-end notebooks and largely impacted by our performance in China. The issues in China are well within HP's control and we are addressing them.
Our current focus is on rebuilding our brand and channel relationship, so that HP can regain this share loss as a result of late in quality issues this past spring. We spoke to you at our September Analyst meeting about our PC efforts in Brazil and I'm pleased to report that HP has taken the number one revenue share positions in Brazil.
Moving on to Palm which is reported in corporate investments. We continue to invest in the Palm assets, including the webOS in a variety of connected mobile devices. This quarter we released the webOS 2.0 and introduced the Palm Pre 2 smartphone.
Imaging and Printing had a strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% to $7 million fueled by year-over-year hardware revenue growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 6%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.2 billion or 17.4% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 14% and regained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher usage segments.
Commercial printer units increased to 43% with multifunction printer units up 83%. Business ink and wireless printer units were up 22% and 53%, respectively. In addition, we shipped almost two million web-connected printers in the quarter.
We continue to innovate across our portfolio. In September, we announced Cloud Print for businesses using HP printer as well as new software capabilities for enterprise printing. In our hardware portfolio, we introduced new products in our Inkjet, LaserJet and Designjet categories.
Finally, we are delivering on our growth initiatives and retail publishing and manage print services. During fiscal 2010, we more than doubled our retail publishing installed base and delivered very significant growth in managed print services signing.
HP Financial Services continues to delivery strong consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 11% to $809 million, financing volume increased 11% and net portfolio assets increased to 14%. Operating profit of $73 million compares to $66 million in the prior year. Return on equity for the fiscal year was 15%.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $11 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days up seven days from a year ago with day sales outstanding up two days, inventories flat and days payable down five days.
Channel inventories in each business are in good shape. TSG channel inventory is down from the prior quarter in line with our expectations. We generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion.
During the fourth quarter, we returned $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average share outstanding by 79 million shares sequentially. At the end of the quarter we had roughly $10.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
Finally, we paid dividend totaling a $181 million. For the full year, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, $8.4 billion in free cash flow and returned $11 billion to shareholder through share repurchases and dividends.
Before I discuss the outlook, I wanted to remind that we expect to pay a cash bonus based on our fiscal 2010 performance, which will impact Q1 cash flow.
Now, a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal '11. We expect Q1 fiscal 2011 revenue to be $32.8 billion to $33 billion. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $132 billion to $133.5 billion.
Regarding earnings, there are few variables to keep in mind. First, we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth and second, we expect OI&E expense of about $0.05 per share as a result of increased debt and more normalized foreign exchange currency losses.
We expect a tax rate of 22% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q3 to Q4. For the full year, we now expect weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 2.25 billion shares.
Thus on an operational basis, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26. In addition, in Q1 we expect to realize a one-time gain of approximately $0.04 per share primarily related to the disposition of real estate.
As a result, including this one-time $0.04 gain, we expect total first quarter EPS to be $1.28 to $1.30. For the full year, we are raising our earnings outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $5.16 to $5.26 including the one-time $0.04 gain representing growth of approximately 13% to 15% to the fiscal year.
In summary, we feel good about our broad based performance in Q4 and for the year, we achieved double-digit growth in revenue, gross profit, operating profit and earnings per share as well as demonstrated the operating leverage in the model.
As a Company, we are executing on the plans we have laid out and delivering on our commitments to customers, partners, employees and investors. We are effectively balancing our growth, investments and efficiency initiative. We are well-positioned in the market and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute.
With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

We also saw accelerated growth in emerging markets including Brazil, Russia and India. So that’s kind of a macro environment that we saw and then in terms of guidance for revenue and I will talk specifically about Q1, I think it's important to note A, for the year that we raised the midpoint of our revenue guidance and that the guidance now in Q1 shows revenue growth of 5% to 6% year-on-year, and you know us. We tend to be prudent and this quarter I think there are two good reasons for that. The first one is that we did see in Q4 uneven consumer performance across our geographies and our product categories. So that’s one element of prudent and then the other element is just that we are calling for a more modest increase in revenue in Industry Standard Service since we had seen significantly better than kind of normal seasonal growth in Industry Standard Servers for the past few quarters and so that kind of leads us to obviously the guidance that we have provided for Q1 revenue.

So those are all things that we feel good about. We also feel very good about the quality of the pipeline as well as the size of the pipeline when we look at the deals that are in the funnel. We also have inside the services business, as Leo mentioned at the very beginning, some new innovative services that are in the application space and also some of our industry solutions. 
On top of that, we're continuing to make investments in sales coverage specifically around growing our services business and that includes sales investments in terms of basic support services sold along with products. So, we feel great about all these things and these are all things that as you know build over time and so that's why we have given the guidance that we have. One more thing about the services growth is, it's also important to us in terms of our ability to pull together and integrate solutions and then also on top of that the product pull-through. We've seen our pull-through increase 50% year-over-year and that includes pulling through servers, storage, networking, software, printers and PCs. And since we closed the acquisition of EDS as new deals are solutioned, we have a higher percent of the content that is solutioned with HP. So, that's not specifically services growth, but it's another valuable aspect of services helping our overall portfolio growth.

HP has many trends and it's actually a formidable company. To name just a few of these trends, I'd like to say the best are our technology portfolio, our scale, our people, our customer relationships and our operational excellence. I do believe that our greatest strength is actually our opportunity. Given our size and breadth, we have a unique position in the market to expand to do way more business in emerging markets, to become more of a solution provider for our customers and to leverage our own technology better across the entire company. 
You should bear in mind that as technology trends are moving and are moving rapidly, we at HP have the opportunity to grow our leadership position. We are addressing the cloud in many ways. Example Converged Infrastructure and we are addressing mobility with webOS, so all of these are fantastic opportunities that we are looking at. Our opportunity is also to integrate more of our IP together because ultimately customers don’t actually want to by heart their software or services or whatever else, they want us to help them solve their problems in a more flexible, secure and cost-effective way, and we use our integrated hardware, software and services to do just that. Customers are also not looking just for cloud in exactly the same way as we discussed earlier on. We will continue to deliver solutions in a hybrid environment whether it's on-premise through the cloud or hosted. But with customers who really want a partner who can help them to be more productive, meeting their demand (inaudible) between the 24x7 connected world and you know that's why we launched our Instant-On Solution place [ph], which address exactly this particular need. So, to give you the short of it all and the net of it all, I believe we are extremely well positioned across all of our technologies. 
We have, if you want, a secret formula, a secret source that we can actually put to bear to our advantage. We're the only Company in this industry that is equally good on the consumer side and on the enterprise side. If we manage and we will work very hard to do this to leverage the rapid innovation cycle that occur on the consumer side back into the enterprise, become more robust, most scalable and then use it to our benefit, I think that was an immense competitive advantage which is one of the reasons why we need to spend a little bit more money on R&D and one of the reasons why we need to invest into our sales force, so we can bring all of this to bear in a various factors way to the market. So, net-net I'm very optimistic. Maybe actually closing this call - a few remarks just to close this call out. We are winning in the market and we have a significant opportunity in front of us. We had a very strong Q4 and are confidence that we'd execute Q1 and the years ahead and continue to be focused on our customers, process, and employees, and I look forward to meeting with investors in the coming months. For now, thank you for your time today and have a great day. Thank you.

Since the last time we spoke, I've been meeting with our customers and partners, as well as thousands of employees around the world. I joked on the date of the announcement that I might set a world record for travel, and I think I might have actually done it. I've been listening. I've been learning and I have been immersing myself in the business. And today, I'm even more excited and honored to be HP's CEO. HP is a company with great momentum, incredibly committed and talented people, deep customer relationships and strong core businesses. I am confident in our future and energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. When I look at our Q4 results, what's clear is that HP is winning in the markets and we have an impressive ability to execute. I am proud of our leadership team and our people for their continued focus during what has been an extraordinary time for the company. We finished our fiscal year with less than $26 billion in revenue. It's a 10% year-over-year increase or an incremental $11.5 billion of growth. We grew nearly $1 billion per month last year. During the same time, we expanded our non-GAAP operating profits faster than revenue, up 14% year-over-year and our non-GAAP EPS grew even faster at 19% for the full year. This is evidence of our strong operating leverage, our leadership position, our ability to grow in higher margin categories and our strong balance sheet. We are carrying this momentum into FY '11. We have the ability to drive continued growth and at the same time, I remain committed to driving operational efficiencies into the years ahead. I'm confident in our updated FY '11 outlook, which Cathie will share with you in a moment. 
Before Cathie provides more financial detail, however, I would like to share some of my initial observations about HP, our potential and also areas where we need to do things better. Now bear in mind, these are just my initial thoughts. I've been on the job for just about three weeks now, and I still have good amount of listening and data gathering to do. I intend to provide a more robust perspective in the next few months. For now, I will share three observations. One about customers, the second about our employees and the third about our technology. I've received great feedback from our customers as well. They are asking for a solution partner who'll help address and solve their technology and business challenges. They want access to information instantly, no matter where they are and they want choice, not proprietary bargains. The great majority are telling me that they want to do more business with HP. They like our openness, our quiet performance, our industry-leading technology and our focus on manageability and security. Look at ISS shares gains and revenue, which was up 32% year-over-year. Focused networking, another good example, was up 50% organically year-over-year. PSG continues to be the worldwide leader in PCs. Our enterprise customers want the ability to work in hybrid environments, both cloud and traditional, and this is HP's long-term opportunity and advantage. But they're mostly hearing that we need to make it easier for customers to work with HP. We need to have the right coverage model that meets their needs, and we must be even more focused on bringing our customers product and solutions that deliver the promise of instant across the consumer, SMB and enterprise segments. 
I have also enjoyed talking with our employees all over the world. They are very focused on our customers and growing our business. They have terrific ideas and also know how to drive operational efficiencies. We welcome new employees from [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter, and I'm excited about these additions and the integrations are starting off well. HP employees are a highly competitive group who want to win. They also want to be rewarded for their performance. This is consistent across the group. I believe in that performance -driven culture, and our employees have been performing. Therefore, I'm pleased that we will be reinstituting salary increases in FY '11 as part of our normal annual review process. It's well deserved. Also, we are creating more sustainable collaborative and productive work phases for our employees. As part of this ongoing workplace initiative, we'll be revitalizing our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, and we just completed the sale of our Cupertino campus and we'll be consolidating HP Cupertino's size into a Palo Alto over the next three years. 
Now let me switch to technology. As Cathie described to you at the Securities Analyst meeting in September, we have been increasing our investment in R&D. In the fourth quarter, R&D was up more than revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially. We should expect this trend to continue. We have a strong product portfolio, with innovation across the company. In the fourth quarter, we began shipping our Superdome 2 and our BCS business was up 10%. IPG achieved another strong quarter, including share gains in both laser and ink and we continue to innovate around ePrint and web-connected printers. I'm very excited about the opportunity available to us to shape the cloud at mobile Instant-On platform. And moving forward, I'm excited to spend more time digging into our new technology. We have so much opportunity, unique opportunity as a company. And it is not simply about spending more in R&D. Rather, it's about driving more leverage from our existing portfolio and resources to create HP solutions. It is about adding more agility to our scale and accelerating our innovation cycles. 
We are in a unique position to drive better, more consistent and unified user experiences across our portfolio, like with our conversion infrastructure offerings. And we can leverage even more technologies to create integrated value-added solutions in addition to our point products. Just as we have our customers knock down their technology side, we have the opportunity to knock down a few of our own. HP has already been moving in this direction, but we can do more. We need to enhance our software IT across the company to create more differentiation with our products. This includes strengthening our core software business segments as well as adding value-added IP and services that cut across our segments. As an example, HP has the leading software unique IP called MetaVance, an interchange to administer health plans and process management healthcare organizations. This is an HP platform that leverages software IP infrastructure along with value-added services to provide a fully integrated vertical solution. Today, HP processes over 1 billion claims in U.S. annually or about one in every four claims. HP now runs Medicaid in 22 states. We are improving quality of care and reducing operational costs for our healthcare customers and ultimately solving both their technology and business challenges together. In the next weeks and months ahead, I will continue engaging with our customers, partners, employees, senior leaders and investors. While I still have more listening to do, a few things are already very evident to me. HP is a strong company, and we have a significant opportunity in front of us, and we will continue to lead the marketplace and create value for our customers and shareholders. I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

Hewlett-Packard delivered strong balanced growth in the fourth quarter across all regions and market segments. In Q4, we added $2.5 billion of new revenue, expanded gross margins and operating margins and grew earnings per share by 17% year-o",2165,"Thanks, Leo. Hewlett-Packard delivered strong balanced growth in the fourth quarter across all regions and market segments. In Q4, we added $2.5 billion of new revenue, expanded gross margins and operating margins and grew earnings per share by 17% year-on-year. We continue to execute our strategy, moving up the stack and increasing our mix of higher margin businesses to drive sustainable gross margin improvement. In Q4, we saw strong growth in margin accretive solutions such as Virtual Connect and BladeSystem Matrix, as well as the contribution from strategic acquisitions such as 3Com. These benefits, combined with disciplined pricing and promotion activity, drove gross margin expansion of 110 basis points versus the prior year to 24.8%. We are investing for growth and augmenting our global sales force to improve the coverage of our $1.6 trillion addressable market. Our solution portfolio and technology offerings are strong, and we are encouraged by the initial results of our enterprise sales force deployment. 
Looking into the details of the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $33.3 billion, up 8% from the prior year or 9% adjusting for currency. We continued to see momentum in the commercial sector, led by strength in Converged Infrastructure, Managed Print Services and Commercial printers and PCs. We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across our Hardware businesses, with enterprise server and storage growing 25% and ProCurve networking up 50%. Commercial printer hardware and PSG Commercial revenue grew 22% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, in Services, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 12 months remained comfortably greater than one. 
Looking at revenue by geography, we had balanced performance with revenue in the Americas and EMEA, increasing 10% and 6%, respectively. In Asia-Pacific, revenue grew 8%, with strong growth across the region, partially offset by some ongoing HP challenges in the China PC business. Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth. Turning to the expense side, operating expenses increased to $4.2 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth, including increases in R&D and expansion of our sales force. We are strengthening R&D, both through incremental investments and the addition of strong technical talent from the acquisitions that we made in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP operating income increased 10% year-on-year to $4 billion as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales and R&D. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income improved to $3.1 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.33. Looking at the full year, we delivered revenue of $126 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $14.4 billion or 11.4% of revenue and grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 19% to $4.58. As Léo mentioned, HP is focused on creating value for our customers. In the Enterprise business, this means driving our vision by delivering Converged Infrastructure, modernizing applications, securing the enterprise and managing information. This quarter demonstrates another proof point that HP is winning. The Enterprise Storage and Server business produced record revenue of $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year, with balanced double-digit growth across each business unit and every region. Operating profit for the business was up 52% on a year-over-year basis to $730 million, with operating margin of 13.9%, an increase of 250 basis points from the prior year, demonstrating the operating leverage in the model. Our Industry Standard Server business achieved the number one market share position in all three regions, with growth of 32% and ESS blades far outpaced the market with 51% growth year-over-year. Within the Business Critical Systems group, we successfully launched the Integrity Superdome 2 as the flagship solution of the mission-critical Converged Infrastructure. Superdome 2 delivers best-in-class, system-level performance and scalability while improving resiliency more than 4x over the original Superdome. Business Critical Systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year, with strong growth in the telecom sector in the Americas and more balanced growth across verticals in other regions. 
In Storage, revenue increased 14% from the prior year, with balanced growth across our broad portfolio. We are investing in the most attractive high-growth segments and our strategy is working. In Q4, we delivered triple-digit growth in our scale out iSCSI products. Our Enterprise Net and our StoreOnce data deduplication technology. We are also very pleased with the traction and buzz around the 3PAR acquisition, which closed on September 27. We are already seeing accelerating interest in these products from our existing and new customers and expect to expand three parts routes to market by leveraging HP's broad channel and enterprise sales force. HP Networking, which is reported in Corporate Investments, continues to build on its worldwide momentum while executing ahead of plan. Revenue in HP Networking grew 227%, with ProCurve revenue up 50%. Our TippingPoint security portfolio also delivered strong growth. In the Americas region, historically one of the most competitive markets, HP ProCurve revenue more than doubled. We see strong demand for our networking solutions as our value proposition of better performance, improved security, single-pane-of-glass manageability and lower cost of ownership is resonating with our customers. Enterprise customers continue to demonstrate interest in our networking product portfolio, with over 400 of HP's top global accounts enrolling in the HP Networking proof of concept program since we closed 3Com in April. We had a good quarter in state and local government accounts, as well as new wins with the BMW Group and Underwriters Laboratories. Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Infrastructure technology outsourcing, Application Services and Technology Services revenue each grew roughly 1%. Outsourcing saw strength in the U.S. Public Sector, with renewals and new Medicaid business. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 11%, including a 7% negative impact due to the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. Our pipeline of Enterprise Services opportunities remains robust, and we are actively investing in the field to build out our addressable market coverage. We continue to see healthy HP product pull through in our enterprise service accounts, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.5 billion or 16.7% of revenue, up 50 basis points from the prior year, driven by improvements in service delivery. For the full year, services delivered $5.6 billion in operating profit and expanded operating margins by 160 basis points, even as we continue to invest in sales coverage, transformation and on boarding new deals. HP Software revenue was $974 million, up 1% compared with the prior year. Business Technology Optimization revenue increased 4% and other software revenue declined 6%. We are excited about expanding our security presence, with the recent acquisition of Fortify and ArcSight in the quarter. The Software business expanded its operating margins by 120 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit was $247 million or 25.4% of revenue, up from $234 million or 24.2% of revenue in the prior year period. 
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 4% from the prior year to $10.3 billion, with total unit shipments growing 2%. Segment operating profit totaled $568 million or 5.5% of revenue, up 80 basis points year-over-year, as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and disciplined pricing and promotion program. The commercial refresh continues. In SMB, we are launching new call centers internationally, building on the success we have seen with the call centers in the U.S. We maintained our market leadership position in commercial PCs and once again expanded our share in the U.S. Enterprise segment by winning new accounts from competitors and investing in channel programs. As a result, commercial client revenue grew 20%. Workstations had another strong quarter with 55% growth and commercial desktop revenue was up 23% year-over-year. Total notebook revenue was down 3%, reflecting softness in consumer notebooks. The consumer weakness was predominantly in low-end notebooks and largely impacted by our performance in China. The issues in China are well within HP's control and we are addressing them. Our current focus is on rebuilding our brand and channel relationships so that HP can regain the share loss as a result of latent quality issues this past spring. We spoke to you at our September analyst meeting about our PC efforts in Brazil, and I'm pleased to report that HP has taken the number one revenue share position in Brazil. 
Moving on to Palm, which is reported in Corporate Investments. We continue to invest in the Palm assets, including the webOS and a variety of connected mobile devices. This quarter, we released webOS 2.0 and introduced the Palm Pre 2 smartphones. Imaging and Printing had a strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% to $7 billion, fueled by year-over-year hardware revenue growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 6%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.2 billion or 17.4% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 14%, and we gained market share across all printing categories, with particular strength in higher usage segments. Commercial printer units increased to 43% with Multifunction Printer units up 83%. business ink and wireless printer units were up 22% and 53%, respectively. In addition, we shipped almost 2 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We continue to innovate across our portfolio. In September, we announced CloudPrint for businesses using HP print app, as well as new software capabilities for enterprise printing. In our hardware portfolio, we introduced new products in our Inkjet, LaserJet and DesignJet categories. Finally, we are delivering on our growth initiatives in Retail Publishing and Managed Print Services. During fiscal 2010, we more than doubled our Retail Publishing installed base and delivered very significant growth in Managed Print Services signings. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 11% to $809 million. Financing volume increased 11% and net portfolio assets increased to 14%. Operating profit of $73 million compares to $66 million in the prior-year period. Return on equity for the fiscal year was 15%. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $11 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days, up seven days from a year ago, with days sales outstanding up two days, inventories flat and days payable down five days. Channel inventories in each business are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is down from the prior quarter, in line with our expectations. We generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we returned $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by 79 million shares sequentially. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $10.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. Finally, we paid dividends totaling $181 million. For the full year, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, $8.4 billion in free cash flow and returned $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Before I discuss the outlook, I want to remind you that we expect to pay a cash bonus based on our fiscal 2010 performance, which will impact Q1 cash flow. And now a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal '11. We expect Q1 fiscal 2011 revenue to be $32.8 billion to $33 billion. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $132 billion to $133.5 billion. Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind. First, we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth. And second, we expect OI&E expense of about $0.05 per share as a result of increased debt and more normalized foreign exchange currency losses. We expect a tax rate of 22% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q3 to Q4. And for the full year, we now expect weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 2.25 billion shares. Thus, on an operational basis, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26. In addition, in Q1, we expect to realize a one-time gain of approximately $0.04 per share, primarily related to the disposition of real estate. As a result, including this one-time $0.04 gain, we expect total first quarter EPS to be $1.28 to $1.30. For the full year, we are raising our earnings outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $5.16 to $5.26, including the one-time $0.04 gain, representing growth of approximately 13% to 15% for the fiscal year. 
In summary, we feel good about our broad-based performance in Q4. And for the year, we achieved double-digit growth in revenue, gross profit, operating profit and earnings per share, as well as demonstrated the operating leverage in the model. As a company, we are executing on the plans we have laid out and delivering on our commitments to customers, partners, employees and investors. We are effectively balancing our growth, investments and efficiency initiatives. We are well-positioned in the market and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

On a constant-currency basis, we saw Americas grow 9.5%, EMEA was up 11% and excluding Japan, APJ grew several digits year-over-year. We also saw accelerated growth in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia and India. So that's kind of the macro environment that we saw. And then in terms of kind of our guidance for revenue, and I'll talk specifically about Q1, I think it's important to note a, for the year that we raised the midpoint of our revenue guidance and that the guidance now on Q1 shows revenue growth of 5% to 6% year-on-year. And you know, as we tend to be prudent. And this quarter, I think there are two good reasons for that. The first one is that we did see in Q4 uneven consumer performance across our geographies and our product categories. That's one element. And then the other elements just that we are calling for a more modest increase in revenue in the Industry Standard Server since we have seen significantly better than kind of normal seasonal growth in the Industry Standard Server for the past few quarters. And so that kind of leads us to obviously the guidance that we've provided for Q1 revenue."

And in those cases, what you see us is doing is putting together solutions that might be a combination of servers, storage, networking, power and cooling, management, software, security software and services associated with the buildout of the data center. So just a complete solution. And then we have other instances where we have customers who want to get started with a private cloud. And what we got is the service we call CloudStart and in CloudStart, what we can do is take our services capability, put together a design for our customer on a private cloud and using our BladeSystem Matrix software along with our services software and our management software actually get them up and running with the private cloud in 30 days. And just as one example, we had a bank in the U.S. that we provided this sort of project for. And what they saw was it used to take them months to be able to deploy additional server capacity.

We've seen our product pull through increase 50%, year-over-year, and that includes pulling through servers, storage, networking, software, printers and PCs.

HP has many strengths, and it's actually a formidable company. And to name just a few of these strengths, I'd like to say the breadth of our technology portfolio, our scale, our people, our customer relationships and our operational excellence. I do believe that our greatest strength is actually our opportunities. Given our size and breadth, I think we have a unique position to market the expense, to do way more business in emerging markets, to become more of a solution provider for our customers and to leverage our own technology better for the entire company. And you should bear in mind that as technology trends are morphing and they are morphing rapidly, we at HP have the opportunity to grow our leadership position. We are addressing the cloud in many ways. Example, convert infrastructure and we are addressing mobility with webOS. So all of these are fantastic opportunities that we are looking at. Our opportunities also to integrate more of our IP together. Because ultimately, customers don't actually want to buy hardware, software or services or whatever else. They want us to help and solve their problems in a more flexible, secure and cost-effective ways. And we'll use our integrated hardware, software and services to do just that. Customers are also not looking just for cloud in exactly the same way as we discussed early on. And we'll continue to deliver solutions in the hybrid environment, whether it's on printers, through the clouds or hosted. But what customers really want is a partner who can help them to be more productive, meeting their demands in a 24/7 connected world. And you know that's why we launched our Instant-On solution base, which addresses exactly that particular need. So to give you the short of it all and the net of it all, I believe we are extremely well positioned across all of our technologies. And we have, if you want, a secret formula, [indiscernible] to bear to our advantage. We are the only company in this industry that is equally good on the consumer side and on the enterprise side. And that we managed and we will work very hard to build that, to leverage the rapid innovation cycle that occur on the consumer side, especially to the enterprise. It was more robust, more scalable, and then use that to our benefit as it gives us an immense competitive advantage, which is one of the reasons why we need to spend a little bit more money on R&D and one of the reasons why we need to invest into our sales force. So we can bring all of these to bear in a very effective way to the market. So net-net, I'm very optimistic. And maybe as we are closing this call, a few remarks to give color. We are winning in the market, and we have a significant opportunity in front of us. We had a very strong Q4, and I'm confident that we'll execute in Q1 and the years ahead. I'll continue to be focused on our customers, partners and employees and I look forward to meeting with investors in the coming months.

Since the last time we spoke, I've been meeting with our customers and partners, as well as thousands of employees around the world. I joked on the date of the announcement that I might set a world record for travel, and I think I might have actually done it. I've been listening. I've been learning and I have been immersing myself in the business. And today, I'm even more excited and honored to be HP's CEO. HP is a company with great momentum, incredibly committed and talented people, deep customer relationships and strong core businesses. I am confident in our future and energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. When I look at our Q4 results, what's clear is that HP is winning in the markets and we have an impressive ability to execute. I am proud of our leadership team and our people for their continued focus during what has been an extraordinary time for the company. We finished our fiscal year with less than $26 billion in revenue. It's a 10% year-over-year increase or an incremental $11.5 billion of growth. We grew nearly $1 billion per month last year. During the same time, we expanded our non-GAAP operating profits faster than revenue, up 14% year-over-year and our non-GAAP EPS grew even faster at 19% for the full year. This is evidence of our strong operating leverage, our leadership position, our ability to grow in higher margin categories and our strong balance sheet. We are carrying this momentum into FY '11. We have the ability to drive continued growth and at the same time, I remain committed to driving operational efficiencies into the years ahead. I'm confident in our updated FY '11 outlook, which Cathie will share with you in a moment. 
Before Cathie provides more financial detail, however, I would like to share some of my initial observations about HP, our potential and also areas where we need to do things better. Now bear in mind, these are just my initial thoughts. I've been on the job for just about three weeks now, and I still have good amount of listening and data gathering to do. I intend to provide a more robust perspective in the next few months. For now, I will share three observations. One about customers, the second about our employees and the third about our technology. I've received great feedback from our customers as well. They are asking for a solution partner who'll help address and solve their technology and business challenges. They want access to information instantly, no matter where they are and they want choice, not proprietary bargains. The great majority are telling me that they want to do more business with HP. They like our openness, our quiet performance, our industry-leading technology and our focus on manageability and security. Look at ISS shares gains and revenue, which was up 32% year-over-year. Focused networking, another good example, was up 50% organically year-over-year. PSG continues to be the worldwide leader in PCs. Our enterprise customers want the ability to work in hybrid environments, both cloud and traditional, and this is HP's long-term opportunity and advantage. But we're mostly hearing that we need to make it easier for customers to work with HP. We need to have the right coverage model that meets their needs, and we must be even more focused on bringing our customers product and solutions that deliver the promise of instant across the consumer, SMB and enterprise segments. 
I have also enjoyed talking with our employees all over the world. They are very focused on our customers and growing our business. They have terrific ideas and also know how to drive operational efficiencies. We welcome new employees from [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter, and I'm excited about these additions and the integrations are starting off well. HP employees are a highly competitive group who want to win. They also want to be rewarded for their performance. This is consistent across the group. I believe in the performance-driven culture, and our employees have been performing. Therefore, I'm pleased that we will be reinstituting salary increases in FY '11 as part of our normal annual review process. It's well deserved. Also, we are creating more sustainable collaborative and productive work phases for our employees. As part of this ongoing workplace initiative, we'll be revitalizing our global headquarters in Palo Alto, and we just completed the sale of our Cupertino campus and we'll be consolidating HP Cupertino's size into Palo Alto over the next three years. 
Now let me switch to technology. As Cathie described to you at the Securities Analyst meeting in September, we have been increasing our investment in R&D. In the fourth quarter, R&D was up more than revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially. We should expect this trend to continue. We have a strong product portfolio, with innovation across the company. In the fourth quarter, we began shipping our Superdome 2 and our BCS business was up 10%. IPG achieved another strong quarter, including share gains in both laser and ink and we continue to innovate around ePrint and web-connected printers. I'm very excited about the opportunity available to us to shape the cloud at mobile Instant-On platform. And moving forward, I'm excited to spend more time digging into our technology. We have so much opportunity, unique opportunity as a company. And it is not simply about spending more in R&D. Rather, it's about driving more leverage from our existing portfolio and resources to create HP solutions. It is about adding more agility to our scale and accelerating our innovation cycles. 
We are in a unique position to drive better, more consistent and unified user experiences across our portfolio, like with our conversion infrastructure offerings. And we can leverage even more technologies to create integrated value-added solutions in addition to our point products. Just as we have our customers knock down their technology side, we have the opportunity to knock down a few of our own. HP has already been moving in this direction, but we can do more. We need to enhance our software IT across the company to create more differentiation with our products. This includes strengthening our core software business segments as well as adding value-added IP and services that cut across our segments. As an example, HP has the leading software unique IP called MetaVance, an interchange to administer health plans and process management healthcare organizations. This is an HP platform that leverages software IP infrastructure along with value-added services to provide a fully integrated vertical solution. Today, HP processes over 1 billion claims in U.S. annually or about one in every four claims. HP now runs Medicaid in 22 states. We are improving quality of care and reducing operational costs for our healthcare customers and ultimately solving both their technology and business challenges together. In the next weeks and months ahead, I will continue engaging with our customers, partners, employees, senior leaders and investors. While I still have more listening to do, a few things are already very evident to me. HP is a strong company, and we have a significant opportunity in front of us, and we will continue to lead the marketplace and create value for our customers and shareholders.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie."

Hewlett-Packard delivered strong balanced growth in the fourth quarter across all regions and market segments. In Q4, we added $2.5 billion of new revenue, expanded gross margins and operating margins and grew earnings per share by 17% year-on-year. We continue to execute our strategy, moving up the stack and increasing our mix of higher margin businesses to drive sustainable gross margin improvement. In Q4, we saw strong growth in margin accretive solutions such as Virtual Connect and BladeSystem Matrix, as well as the contribution from strategic acquisitions such as 3Com. These benefits, combined with disciplined pricing and promotion activity, drove gross margin expansion of 110 basis points versus the prior year to 24.8%. We are investing for growth and augmenting our global sales force to improve the coverage of our $1.6 trillion addressable market. Our solution portfolio and technology offerings are strong, and we are encouraged by the initial results of our enterprise sales force deployment. 
Looking into the details of the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $33.3 billion, up 8% from the prior year or 9% adjusting for currency. We continued to see momentum in the commercial sector, led by strength in Converged Infrastructure, Managed Print Services and Commercial printers and PCs. We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across our Hardware businesses, with Enterprise Server and Storage growing 25% and ProCurve networking up 50%. Commercial printer hardware and PSG Commercial revenue grew 22% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, in Services, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 12 months remained comfortably greater than one. 
Looking at revenue by geography, we had balanced performance with revenue in the Americas and EMEA, increasing 10% and 6%, respectively. In Asia-Pacific, revenue grew 8%, with strong growth across the region, partially offset by some ongoing HP challenges in the China PC business. Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth. Turning to the expense side, operating expenses increased to $4.2 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth, including increases in R&D and expansion of our sales force. We are strengthening R&D, both through incremental investments and the addition of strong technical talent from the acquisitions that we made in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP operating income increased 10% year-on-year to $4 billion as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales and R&D. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income improved to $3.1 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.33. Looking at the full year, we delivered revenue of $126 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $14.4 billion or 11.4% of revenue and grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 19% to $4.58. As Léo mentioned, HP is focused on creating value for our customers. In the Enterprise business, this means driving our vision by delivering Converged Infrastructure, modernizing applications, securing the enterprise and managing information. This quarter demonstrates another proof point that HP is winning. The Enterprise Storage and Server business produced record revenue of $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year, with balanced double-digit growth across each business unit and every region. Operating profit for the business was up 52% on a year-over-year basis to $730 million, with operating margin of 13.9%, an increase of 250 basis points from the prior year, demonstrating the operating leverage in the model. Our Industry Standard Server business achieved the number one market share position in all three regions, with growth of 32% and ESS blades far outpaced the market with 51% growth year-over-year. Within the Business Critical Systems group, we successfully launched the Integrity Superdome 2 as the flagship solution of the mission-critical Converged Infrastructure. Superdome 2 delivers best in class, system-level performance and scalability while improving resiliency more than 4x over the original Superdome. Business Critical Systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year, with strong growth in the telecom sector in the Americas and more balanced growth across verticals in other regions. 
In Storage, revenue increased 14% from the prior year, with balanced growth across our broad portfolio. We are investing in the most attractive high-growth segments and our strategy is working. In Q4, we delivered triple-digit growth in our scale out iSCSI products, our Enterprise Net and our StoreOnce data deduplication technology. We are also very pleased with the traction and buzz around the 3PAR acquisition, which closed on September 27. We are already seeing accelerating interest in these products from our existing and new customers and expect to expand three parts routes to market by leveraging HP's broad channel and enterprise sales force. HP Networking, which is reported in Corporate Investments, continues to build on its worldwide momentum, while executing ahead of plan. Revenue in HP Networking grew 227%, with ProCurve revenue up 50%. Our TippingPoint security portfolio also delivered strong growth. In the Americas region, historically one of the most competitive markets, HP ProCurve revenue more than doubled. We see strong demand for our networking solutions as our value proposition of better performance, improved security, single-pane-of-glass manageability and lower cost of ownership is resonating with our customers. Enterprise customers continue to demonstrate interest in our networking product portfolio, with over 400 of HP's top global accounts enrolling in the HP Networking proof of concept program since we closed 3Com in April. We had a good quarter in state and local government accounts, as well as new wins with the BMW Group and Underwriters Laboratories. Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Infrastructure technology outsourcing, Application Services and Technology Services revenue each grew roughly 1%. Outsourcing saw strength in the U.S. Public Sector, with renewals and new Medicaid business. Business Process Outsourcing revenue was down 11%, including a 7% negative impact due to the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO. Our pipeline of Enterprise Services opportunities remains robust, and we are actively investing in the field to build out our addressable market coverage. We continue to see healthy HP product pull through in our enterprise service accounts, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.5 billion or 16.7% of revenue, up 50 basis points from the prior year, driven by improvements in service delivery. For the full year, services delivered $5.6 billion in operating profit and expanded operating margins by 160 basis points, even as we continue to invest in sales coverage, transformation and onboarding new deals. HP Software revenue was $974 million, up 1% compared with the prior year. Business Technology Optimization revenue increased 4% and other software revenue declined 6%. We are excited about expanding our security presence with the recent acquisitions of Fortify and ArcSight in the quarter. The Software business expanded its operating margins by 120 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit was $247 million or 25.4% of revenue, up from $234 million or 24.2% of revenue in the prior year period. 
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 4% from the prior year to $10.3 billion, with total unit shipments growing 2%. Segment operating profit totaled $568 million or 5.5% of revenue, up 80 basis points year-over-year, as PSG benefited from favorable component pricing and disciplined pricing and promotion program. The commercial refresh continues. In SMB, we are launching new call centers internationally, building on the success we have seen with the call centers in the U.S. We maintained our market leadership position in commercial PCs and once again expanded our share in the U.S. Enterprise segment by winning new accounts from competitors and investing in channel programs. As a result, commercial client revenue grew 20%, workstations had another strong quarter with 55% growth and commercial desktop revenue was up 23% year-over-year. Total notebook revenue was down 3%, reflecting softness in consumer notebooks. The consumer weakness was predominantly in low-end notebooks and largely impacted by our performance in China. The issues in China are well within HP's control and we are addressing them. Our current focus is on rebuilding our brand and channel relationships so that HP can regain the share lost as a result of latent quality issues this past spring. We spoke to you at our September analyst meeting about our PC efforts in Brazil, and I'm pleased to report that HP has taken the number one revenue share position in Brazil. 
Moving on to Palm, which is reported in Corporate Investments. We continue to invest in the Palm assets, including the webOS and a variety of connected mobile devices. This quarter, we released webOS 2.0 and introduced the Palm Pre 2 smartphone. Imaging and Printing had a strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% to $7 billion, fueled by year-over-year hardware revenue growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 6%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.2 billion or 17.4% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 14%, and we gained market share across all printing categories, with particular strength in higher usage segments. Commercial printer units increased to 43% with Multifunction Printer units up 83%. Business ink and wireless printer units were up 22% and 53%, respectively. In addition, we shipped almost 2 million web-connected printers in the quarter. We continue to innovate across our portfolio. In September, we announced CloudPrint for businesses using HP print app, as well as new software capabilities for enterprise printing. In our hardware portfolio, we introduced new products in our Inkjet, LaserJet and DesignJet categories. Finally, we are delivering on our growth initiatives in Retail Publishing and Managed Print Services. During fiscal 2010, we more than doubled our Retail Publishing installed base and delivered very significant growth in Managed Print Services signings. 
HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 11% to $809 million. Financing volume increased 11% and net portfolio assets increased to 14%. Operating profit of $73 million compares to $66 million in the prior-year period. Return on equity for the fiscal year was 15%. 
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $11 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days, up seven days from a year ago, with day sales outstanding up two days, inventories flat and days payable down five days. Channel inventories in each business are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is down from the prior quarter, in line with our expectations. We generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we returned $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by 79 million shares sequentially. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $10.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. Finally, we paid dividends totaling $181 million. For the full year, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, $8.4 billion in free cash flow and returned $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Before I discuss the outlook, I wanted to remind you that we expect to pay a cash bonus based on our fiscal 2010 performance, which will impact Q1 cash flow. And now a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal '11. We expect Q1 fiscal 2011 revenue to be $32.8 billion to $33 billion. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $132 billion to $133.5 billion. Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind. First, we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth. And second, we expect OI&E expense of about $0.05 per share as a result of increased debt and more normalized foreign exchange currency losses. We expect a tax rate of 22% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q3 to Q4. And for the full year, we now expect weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 2.25 billion shares. Thus, on an operational basis, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26. In addition, in Q1, we expect to realize a one-time gain of approximately $0.04 per share, primarily related to the disposition of real estate. As a result, including this one-time $0.04 gain, we expect total first quarter EPS to be $1.28 to $1.30. For the full year, we are raising our earnings outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $5.16 to $5.26, including the one-time $0.04 gain, representing growth of approximately 13% to 15% for the fiscal year. 
In summary, we feel good about our broad-based performance in Q4. And for the year, we achieved double-digit growth in revenue, gross profit, operating profit and earnings per share, as well as demonstrated the operating leverage in the model. As a company, we are executing on the plans we have laid out and delivering on our commitments to customers, partners, employees and investors. We are effectively balancing our growth, investments and efficiency initiatives. We are well positioned in the market and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute. With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

On a constant-currency basis, we saw Americas grow 9.5%, EMEA was up 11% and excluding Japan, APJ grew several digits year-over-year. We also saw accelerated growth in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia and India. So that's kind of the macro environment that we saw. And then in terms of kind of our guidance for revenue, and I'll talk specifically about Q1, I think it's important to note a, for the year that we raised the midpoint of our revenue guidance and that the guidance now in Q1 shows revenue growth of 5% to 6% year-on-year. And you know us, we tend to be prudent. And this quarter, I think there are two good reasons for that. The first one is that we did see in Q4 uneven consumer performance across our geographies and our product categories. That's one element. And then the other element is just that we're calling for a more modest increase in revenue in Industry Standard Server since we have seen significantly better than kind of normal seasonal growth in Industry Standard Server for the past few quarters. And so that kind of leads us to obviously the guidance that we've provided for Q1 revenue."

So if the notion is we're going to invest to get higher gross margins and ultimately, that will translate into better operating margins, we actually didn't really see it this quarter.

And if you look at the last two quarters, we've been doing all three at once. In fact, to your point about the pricing, we've seen both revenue and margin be ahead of plans. And what we're seeing with 3Com is that, as Cathie said, we're certainly pleased with the integration and for the first two quarters that it's been part of HP, the revenue for 3Com has been ahead of plan as well. We look broadly at our networking capability and Virtual Connect was up 50% and ProCurve was up 50% too. And what we're really seeing is we've just got a value proposition that's very attractive to customers. This is a marketplace where over the last few years, the marketplace was characterized by high prices, proprietary technologies and just flat out not enough competition. And what HP has been able to bring to the market is something that customers just flat out really like. They like the fact that it's a new open architecture. They like the fact that we're using industry standards. They like the fact that we have a single management console, which makes the cost of operations lower. They like the fact that our products have better energy efficiency. And on top of all that, we can price and still make great margins at a significantly better value for them. So we're just very pleased at the market acceptance and reaction that we're seeing."

What you have to recognize is that the customers have different needs at different points. There's a very exciting thing happening out there, which is the trend towards cloud and customers want to get into the town, depending on where they're coming from, either in one shop or in gradual steps. They want to use public cloud or private clouds or they even want to stay in a hybrid environment. We are very well positioned to serve all of these markets, different price points and with various technologies. Customers don't want to be locked into a particular type of a standard. So we have been trying over many years to provide customers with open systems and industry standards. And the success that we can see in our Converged Infrastructure is driven among others because it provides openness to our customers. It doesn't mean that we cannot provide integrated solutions that contains both of some of our own IP software because we believe that bundling this together and providing this as solution and not existing industry products will give customers a higher value.

But we offer it with lots of different vendors. We offer these appliances with SAP, with Microsoft, with Oracle. And you will see us offer these integrated tuned appliances with lots of different software vendors. And our view on this is that when you're like HP and you've got the number one market share in x86 servers and we have a 38% unit share, and then you've got the power of the Converged Infrastructure solutions we have across networking and storage and servers and power and cooling, then what you can do is you can help the customer transform their data center and at the same time, doing that without locking them into one proprietary set.

So just a complete solution. And then we have other instances where we have customers who want to get started with a private cloud. And what we've got is a service we call CloudStart and in CloudStart what we can do is take our services capability, put together a design for our customer on a private cloud and using our BladeSystem Matrix software, along with our services software and our management software, actually get them up and running with the private cloud in 30 days. And just as one example, we had a bank in the U.S. that we provided this sort of project for. And what they saw was,  it used to take them months to be able to deploy additional server capacity.

So those are all things that we feel good about. We also feel very good about the quality of the pipeline, as well as the size of the pipeline, when we look at the deals that are in the funnel. We also have inside the Services business, as Léo mentioned, at the very beginning, some new innovative services that are in the application space and also some of our industry solutions. On top of that, we're continuing to make investments in sales coverage, specifically around growing our Services business. And that includes sales investments in terms of our basic support services sold along with products. So we feel great about all these things. And these are all things that as you know build over time. So that's why we've given the guidance that we have. One more thing about the Services growth is it's also important to us in terms of our ability to pull together and integrate solutions. And then also on top of that the product pull-through. We've seen our product pull-through increase 50%, year-over-year, and that includes pulling through servers, storage, networking, software, printers and PCs. And since we closed the acquisition of EDS as new deals or solutions, we have a higher percent of the content that is solutions with HP.

HP has many strengths, and it's actually a formidable company. And to name just a few of these strengths, I'd like to say the breadth of our technology portfolio, our scale, our people, our customer relationships and our operational excellence. I do believe that our greatest strength is actually our opportunities. Given our size and breadth, I think we have a unique position to market the expense, to do way more business in emerging markets, to become more of a solution provider for our customers and to leverage our own technology better for the entire company. And you should bear in mind that as technology trends are morphing and they are morphing rapidly, we at HP have the opportunity to grow our leadership position. We are addressing the cloud in many ways. Example, convert infrastructure and we are addressing mobility with webOS. So all of these are fantastic opportunities that we are looking at. Our opportunities also to integrate more of our IP together. Because ultimately, customers don't actually want to buy hardware, software or services or whatever else. They want us to help them solve their problems in a more flexible, secure and cost-effective ways. And we'll use our integrated hardware, software and services to do just that. Customers are also not looking just for cloud in exactly the same way as we discussed early on. And we'll continue to deliver solutions in the hybrid environment, whether it's on printers, through the clouds or hosted. But what customers really want is a partner who can help them to be more productive, meeting their demands instantaneously in a 24/7 connected world. And you know that's why we launched our Instant-On solution base, which addresses exactly that particular need. So to give you the short of it all and the net of it all, I believe we are extremely well positioned across all of our technologies. And we have, if you want, a secret formula, [indiscernible] to bear to our advantage. We are the only company in this industry that is equally good on the consumer side and on the enterprise side. And that we managed and we will work very hard to build that, to leverage the rapid innovation cycle that occur on the consumer side, especially to the enterprise. It was more robust, more scalable, and then use that to our benefit as it gives us an immense competitive advantage, which is one of the reasons why we need to spend a little bit more money on R&D and one of the reasons why we need to invest into our sales force. So we can bring all of these to bear in a very effective way to the market. So net-net, I'm very optimistic. And maybe as we are closing this call, a few remarks to give color. We are winning in the market, and we have a significant opportunity in front of us. We had a very strong Q4, and I'm confident that we'll execute in Q1 and the years ahead. I'll continue to be focused on our customers, partners and employees and I look forward to meeting with investors in the coming months. And for now, thank you for your time today and have a great day. Thank you."

Since the last time we spoke, I have been meeting with our customers and partners as well as thousands of employees around the world. I joked on the day of the announcement that I might set a world record for travel, and I think I might have actually done it. I have been listening, I have been learning and I have been immersing myself in the business, and today I'm even more excited and honored to be HP’s CEO.
HP is a company with great momentum incredibly committed and talented people, deep customer relationships and strong core businesses. I'm confident in our future and energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. When I look at our Q4 results, what's clear is that HP is winning in the market and we have an impressive ability to execute. I'm proud of our leadership team and our people for their continued focus during what has been extraordinary time for the company.
We finished our fiscal year with $126 billion in revenues. It's a 10% year-over-year increase or an incremental $11.5 billion of growth. We grew nearly $1 billion per month last year. During the same time, we expanded our non-GAAP operating profit faster than revenue, up 14% year-over-year and our non-GAAP EPS grew even faster at 19% for the full year. It is evidence of our strong operating leverage, our leadership positions, our ability to grow in higher margin categories and our strong balance sheet. We are carrying this momentum into FY'11.We have the ability to drive continued growth and at the same time, I remain committed to driving operational efficiencies into the years ahead. I'm confident in our updated FY'11 outlook, which Cathie will share with you in a moment.
Before Cathie provides more financial detail, however, I would like to share some of my initial observations about HP, our potential, and also areas where we need to do things better. Now bear in mind, these are just my initial thoughts. I have been on the job for just about three weeks now and I still have good amount of listening and data gathering to do. I intend to provide a more robust perspective in the next few months.
Well, now I will share three observations; one about customers, the second is about our employees, and third about our technology. I have received great feedback from our customers thus far. They are asking for a solution partner who helps address and solve their technology, and business challenges. They want to access to information instantly no matter where they are and they want choice not proprietary logins.
The great majority are telling me that they want to do more business with HP. They like our openness, our price performance, our industry-leading technologies, and our focus on manageability and security.
Look at ISS share gains in revenue which was up 32% year-over-year. ProCurve Networking, another good example, was up 50% organically year-over-year. PSG continues to be the worldwide leader in PCs. Our enterprise customers want the ability to work in hybrid environments both cloud and traditional, and this is HP's long-term opportunity and advantage.
But I am also hearing that we need to make it easier for customers to work with HP. We need to have the right coverage model that meets their needs, and we must be even more focused on bringing our customers product and solutions that deliver the promise of ‘Instant-On’ across the consumer, SMB and enterprise segments.
I have also enjoyed talking with our employees all over the world. They are very focused on our customers and growing our business. They have terrific ideas and also know how to drive operation efficiency. We welcome new employees from 3PAR, ArcSight, Fortify and Stratavia in the fourth quarter, and I am excited about these additions and integrations are starting off well.
HP employees are a highly competitive group who wants to win. They also want to be rewarded for their performance. This is consistent across the globe. I believe in the performance-driven culture and our employees have been performing. Therefore, I am pleased that we will be reinstituting salary increases in FY '11 as part of our normal annual review process. It's well deserved.
Also, we are creating more sustainable collaborative and productive work spaces for our employees. As part of this ongoing workplace initiative, we will be revitalizing our global headquarters in Palo Alto. And we just completed the sale of our Cupertino campus, and we will be consolidating HP Cupertino's side into Palo Alto over the next three years.
Now let me switch to technology. As Cathie described to you at the Securities Analyst Meeting in September, we have been increasing our investment in R&D. In the fourth quarter, R&D was up more than revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially. We should expect this trend to continue. We have a strong product portfolio with innovation across the company. In the fourth quarter, we began shipping our Superdome 2, and our BCS business was up 10%. IPG achieved another strong quarter including share gains in both laser and ink, and we continue to innovate around e-Print and web connected printers. I am very excited about the opportunity available to us to shape the cloud and mobile Instant-On platform.
Moving forward, I am excited to spend more time digging into our technology. We have so much opportunity, unique opportunity as a company and it’s not simply about spending more in R&D, rather it’s about driving more leverage from our existing portfolio and resources to create HP Solutions. It is about adding more agility to our scale and accelerating our innovation cycle.
We are in a unique position to drive better, more consistent and unified user experiences across our portfolio like with our converse infrastructure offerings, and we can leverage even more technologies to create and sell integrated value added solutions in addition to our point products. Just as we have our customers knock down their technologies titles, we have the opportunity to knock down a few of our own.
HP has already been moving in this direction but we can do more. We need to enhance our software IP across the company to create more differentiation with our products. This includes strengthening our core software business segment, as well as adding value added IP and services that cut across all segments.
As an example, HP has the leading software, a unique IP called MetaVance and interChange to administer health plans and process claims for healthcare organizations. This is an HP platform that leverages software IP and infrastructure along with value added services to provide the fully integrated vertical solution. To-date HP’s processes over a billion claims in U.S. annually, or about one in every four claims. HP now runs Medicaid in 22 states. We're improving quality of care and reducing operational costs for our healthcare customers, and ultimately solving both their technology and business challenges together.
In the next weeks and months ahead, I will continue engaging with our customers, partners, employees, senior leaders and investors, while I still have more listening to do a few things are already very evident to me. HP is a strong company. We have a significant opportunity in front of us and we will continue to lead the marketplace and create value for our customers and shareholders.
I'll now hand the call over to Cathie.

Hewlett-Packard delivered strong, balanced growth in the fourth quarter across all regions and market segments. In Q4, we added $2.5 billion of new revenue, expanded gross margins and operating margins and grew earnings per share by 17% year-o",2165,"Thank, Leo. Hewlett-Packard delivered strong, balanced growth in the fourth quarter across all regions and market segments. In Q4, we added $2.5 billion of new revenue, expanded gross margins and operating margins and grew earnings per share by 17% year-on-year. We continue to execute our strategy moving up the stack and increasing our mix of higher margin businesses to drive sustainable gross margin improvements.
In Q4, we saw a strong growth in margin accretive solutions such as Virtual Connect and BladeSystem Matrix, as well as the contribution from strategic acquisitions such as 3Com. These benefits combined with disciplined pricing and promotion activity drove gross margin expansion of 110 basis points versus the prior year to 24.8%.
We are investing for growth and augmenting our global sales force to improve the coverage of our $1.6 trillion addressable market. Our solution portfolio and technology offerings are strong and we're encouraged by the initial results of our enterprise sales force deployment. Looking into the details of the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $33.3 billion, up 8% from the prior year or 9% adjusting for currency.
We continue to see momentum in the commercial sectors led by strength in converged infrastructure, managed print services, and commercial printers and PCs.
We posted solid double digit revenue growth across our hardware businesses with enterprise server and storage growing 25% and ProCurve networking up 50%. Commercial printer hardware and PSG commercial revenue grew 22% and 20%, respectively. Additionally in Services, our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 12-months remained comfortably greater than one.
Looking at revenue by geography, we had balanced performance with revenues in the Americas and EMEA increasing 10% and 6%, respectively. In Asia-Pacific, revenue grew 8% with strong growth across the region, partially offset by some ongoing HP challenges in the China PC business. Excluding China, Asia Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth.
Turning to the expense side, operating expenses increased to $4.2 billion as we accelerated investments to drive long-term growth, including increases in R&D and expansion of our sales force. We are strengthening R&D both through incremental investments and the addition of strong technical talent from the acquisitions that we made in fiscal 2010.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 10% year-on-year to $4 billion as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investments in sales and R&D. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income improved to $3.1 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.33.
Looking at the full year, we delivered revenue of $126 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $14.4 billion or 11.4% of revenue, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 19% to $4.58.
As Leo mentioned, HP is focused on creating value for our customers. In the Enterprise business this means driving our vision by delivering converged infrastructure, modernizing application, securing the enterprise and managing information. This quarter demonstrates another proof point that HP is winning.
The enterprise storage and server business produced record revenue of $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year with balanced double-digit growth across each business unit and every region. Operating profit for the business was up 52% on a year-over-year basis with $730 million with operating margin of 13.9%, an increase of 250 basis points from the prior year demonstrating the operating leverage in the model.
Our Industry Standard Server business achieved the number one market share position in all three regions with growth of 32% and ESS Blades far outpaced the market with 51% growth year-over-year.
Within the Business Critical Systems group, we successfully launched the Integrity Superdome 2 as the flagship solution of the mission critical converged infrastructure. Superdome 2 delivers best-in-class system level performance and scalability, while improving resiliency more than four times over the original Superdome.
Business critical systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year with strong growth in the telecom sector in the Americas and more balanced growth across verticals in other regions.
In Storage, revenue increased 14% from the prior year with balanced growth across our broad portfolio. We are investing in the most attractive high growth segments and our strategy is working.
In Q4, we delivered triple-digit growth in our scale-out iSCSI products, our Enterprise NAS and our StoreOnce data deduplication technology. We are also very pleased with the traction and buzz around the 3PAR acquisition, which closed on September 27. We are already seeing accelerating interest in these products from our existing and new customers and expect to expand 3PAR’s routes to market by leveraging HP’s broad channel and enterprise sales force.
HP Networking, which is reported in Corporate Investments continues to build on its worldwide momentum while executing ahead of plan. Revenue in HP Networking grew 227% with ProCurve revenue up 50%. Our TippingPoint Security portfolio also delivered strong growth. In the Americas region, historically one of the most competitive markets, HP ProCurve revenue more than doubled. We see strong demand for our networking solutions as our value proposition of better performance, improved security, single pane-of-glass manageability and lower cost of ownership is resonating with our customers.
Enterprise customers continue to demonstrate interest in our Networking product portfolio with over 400 of HP’s top global accounts enrolling in the HP Networking proof-of-concept program, since we closed 3Com in April. We had a good quarter in state and local government accounts as well as new wins with the BMW Group and Underwriters Laboratories.
Services delivered revenue of $9 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and technology services revenue each grew roughly 1%. Outsourcing saw strength in the U.S. public sector with renewals and new Medicaid business. Business processing outsourcing revenue was down 11% including a 7% negative impact due to the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.
Our pipeline of Enterprise Services opportunities remains robust and we are actively investing in the field to build out our addressable market coverage.
We continue to see healthy HP product pull-through in our Enterprise Service accounts and we expect this trend to continue.
Services segment operating profit in the quarter increased to $1.5 billion or 16.7% of revenue, up 50 basis points from the prior year, driven by improvements in service delivery. For the full year, Services delivered $5.6 billion in operating profit and expanded operating margins by 160 basis points even as we continued to invest in sales coverage, transformation and on-boarding new deals.
HP Software revenue was $974 million, up 1% compared with the prior year. Business Technology Optimization revenue increased 4% and Other Software revenue declined 6%. We are excited about expanding our security presence with the recent acquisitions of Fortify and ArcSight in the quarter. The Software business expanded its operating margins by 120 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit was $247 million or 25.4% of revenue, up from $234 million or 24.2% of revenue in the prior year period.
Turning to Personal Systems. PSG revenue increased 4% from the prior year to $10.3 billion with total unit shipments growing 2%. Segment operating profit totaled $568 million or 5.5% of revenue, up 80 basis points year-over-year as PSG benefitted from favorable component pricing and disciplined pricing and promotion programs.
The commercial refresh continues. In SMB, we are launching new call centers internationally, building on the success we have seen with the call centers in the U.S. We maintained our market leadership position in commercial PCs and once again expanded our share in the U.S. enterprise segment by winning new accounts from competitors and investing in channel program. As a result, commercial client revenue grew 20%, workstations had another strong quarter with 55% growth, and commercial desktop revenue was up 23% year-over-year.
Total notebook revenue was down 3% reflecting softness in consumer notebooks. The consumer weakness was predominantly in low-end notebooks and largely impacted by our performance in China. The issues in China are well within HP's control and we are addressing them.
Our current focus is on rebuilding our brand and channel relationship, so that HP can regain the share loss as a result of latent quality issues this past spring. We spoke to you at our September Analyst meeting about our PC efforts in Brazil, and I'm pleased to report that HP has taken the number one revenue share position in Brazil.
Moving on to Palm, which is reported in corporate investments. We continue to invest in the Palm assets, including the webOS in a variety of connected mobile devices. This quarter we released webOS 2.0 and introduced the Palm Pre 2 smartphone.
Imaging and Printing had a strong quarter. Revenue grew 8% to $7 million fueled by year-over-year hardware revenue growth of 16% and supplies revenue growth of 6%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.2 billion or 17.4% of revenue. Total printer unit shipments increased 14% and we gained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher usage segments.
Commercial printer units increased to 43% with multifunction printer units up 83%. Business ink and wireless printer units were up 22% and 53%, respectively. In addition, we shipped almost two million web-connected printers in the quarter.
We continue to innovate across our portfolio. In September, we announced Cloud Print for businesses using HP Print Apps, as well as new software capabilities for enterprise printing. In our hardware portfolio, we introduced new products in our Inkjet, LaserJet and Designjet categories.
Finally, we are delivering on our growth initiatives in retail publishing and managed print services. During fiscal 2010, we more than doubled our retail publishing installed base and delivered very significant growth in managed print services signings.
HP Financial Services continues to delivery strong consistent results. In the fourth quarter, financing revenue grew 11% to $809 million, financing volume increased 11% and net portfolio assets increased to 14%. Operating profit of $73 million compares to $66 million in the prior year period. Return on equity for the fiscal year was 15%.
Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $11 billion. Our fourth quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days, up 7 days from a year ago with day sales outstanding up 2 days, inventories flat and days payable down 5 days.
Channel inventories in each business are in good shape. PSG channel inventory is down from the prior quarter in line with our expectations. We generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion.
During the fourth quarter, we returned $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by 79 million shares sequentially. At the end of the quarter we had roughly $10.9 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
Finally, we paid dividends totaling $181 million. For the full year, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, $8.4 billion in free cash flow and returned $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Before I discuss the outlook, I wanted to remind you that we expect to pay a cash bonus based on our fiscal 2010 performance, which will impact Q1 cash flow.
Now, a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and full year fiscal '11. We expect Q1 fiscal 2011 revenues to be $32.8 billion to $33 billion. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $132 billion to $133.5 billion.
Regarding earnings, there are few variables to keep in mind. First, we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth and second, we expect OI&E expense of about $0.05 per share as a result of increased debt and more normalized foreign exchange currency losses.
We expect a tax rate of 22% and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q3 to Q4. For the full year, we now expect weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 2.25 billion shares.
Thus on an operational basis, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26. In addition, in Q1 we expect to realize a one-time gain of approximately $0.04 per share primarily related to the disposition of real estate.
As a result, including this one-time $0.04 gain, we expect total first quarter EPS to be $1.28 to $1.30. For the full year, we are raising our earnings outlook and now expect non-GAAP EPS of $5.16 to $5.26, including the one-time $0.04 gain representing growth of approximately 13% to 15% for the fiscal year.
In summary, we feel good about our broad based performance in Q4 and for the year, we achieved double-digit growth in revenue, gross profit, operating profit and earnings per share as well as demonstrated the operating leverage in the model.
As a company, we are executing on the plans we have laid out and delivering on our commitments to customers, partners, employees and investors. We are effectively balancing our growth, investments and efficiency initiatives. We are well-positioned in the market and our full year outlook reflects our strength and ability to execute.
With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

Basically, from a macro perspective, what we saw was good balance performance across our regions. So, on a constant currency basis, we saw Americas grow 9.5%, EMEA was up 11%, and excluding Japan, APJ grew double digits year-on-year. We also saw accelerated growth in emerging markets including Brazil, Russia and India. So that’s kind of a macro environment that we saw and then in terms of kind of our guidance for revenues, and I will talk specifically about Q1, I think it's important to note A, for the year that we raised the midpoint of our revenue guidance, and that the guidance now in Q1 shows revenue growth of 5% to 6% year-on-year, and you know us.
We tend to be prudent, and this quarter I think there are two good reasons for that. The first one is that we did see in Q4 uneven consumer performance across our geographies and our product categories. So that’s one element of prudence, and then the other element is just that we are calling for a more modest increase in revenue in Industry Standard Servers since we had seen significantly better than kind of normal seasonal growth in Industry Standard Servers for the past few quarters, and so that kind of leads us to obviously the guidance that we have provided for Q1 revenue.

Are you front-loading OpEx at all, because my observation is, yes, you spent more on OpEx and you got higher gross margins? But if you look at operating margin, year-over-year your improvement in Q4 was actually the lowest it was in any quarter in 2010. So, if the notion is we are going to invest to get higher gross margins and ultimately that will translate into better operating margins, we actually didn’t really see it this quarter. And so sorry for the long-winded backdrop, I guess the question is, how do we think about OpEx growth relative to revenue growth and was there any frontloading this quarter and if not, how do we rationalize that sensible trade-off you are making.

I just had a question as far as the services growth trajectory here. The 4Q performance, was that kind of in line with what you expected when you kind of tempered the FY '11 forecast related to Services growth and how should we think about that getting jump started? Is it going to be inorganic or organic growth from here?

So those are all things that we feel good about. We also feel very good about the quality of the pipeline, as well as the size of the pipeline when we look at the deals that are in the funnel. We also have inside the services business, as Leo mentioned at the very beginning, some new innovative services that are in the application space, and also some of our industry solutions.
On top of that, we're continuing to make investments in sales coverage specifically around growing our services business and that includes sales investments in terms of our basic support services sold along with products. So, we feel great about all these things and these are all things as you know build over time, and so that's why we have given the guidance that we have. One more thing about the services growth is, it's also important to us in terms of our ability to pull together and integrate solutions and then also on top of that the product pull-through.
We've seen our pull-through increase 50% year-over-year and that includes pulling through servers, storage, networking, software, printers and PCs. And since we closed the acquisition of EDS as new deals are solutioned, we have a higher percent of the content that is solutioned with HP. So, that's not specifically services growth, but it's another valuable aspect of services helping our overall portfolio growth.

HP has many strengths, and it's actually a formidable company. To name just a few of these strengths, I'd like to say the breadth of our technology portfolio, our scale, our people, our customer relationships and our operational excellence. I do believe that our greatest strength is actually our opportunity. Given our size and breadth, we have a unique position in the market to expand to do way more business in emerging markets, to become more of a solution provider for our customers and to leverage our own technology better across the entire company.
You should bear in mind that as technology trends are morphing, and they are morphing rapidly. We at HP have the opportunity to grow our leadership position. We are addressing the cloud in many ways. Example, Converged Infrastructure and we are addressing mobility with webOS, so all of these are fantastic opportunities that we are looking at. Our opportunity is also to integrate more of our IP together because ultimately customers don’t actually want to buy hardware, or software or services or whatever else, they want us to help them solve their problems in a more flexible, secure and cost-effective way, and we use our integrated hardware, software and services to do just that.
Customers are also not looking just for cloud in exactly the same way as we discussed earlier on. We will continue to deliver solutions in a hybrid environment whether it's on-premise through the cloud or hosted. But what customers really want is a partner who can help them to be more productive, meeting their demands instantaneously in a 24x7 connected world, and you know that's why we launched our Instant-On Solution phase [ph], which address exactly this particular need. So, to give you the short of it all and the net of it all, I believe we are extremely well positioned across all of our technologies.
We have, if you want, a secret formula, a secret source that we can actually put to bear to our advantage. We're the only company in this industry that is equally good on the consumer side and on the enterprise side. If we manage and we will work very hard to do this to leverage the rapid innovation cycle that occur on the consumer side back into the enterprise, become more robust, most scalable and then use it to our benefit, I think that will give us a immense competitive advantage, which is one of the reasons why we need to spend a little bit more money on R&D and one of the reasons why we need to invest into our sales force, so we can bring all of this to bear in a very effective way to the market.
So, net-net I'm very optimistic. And maybe as we are closing this call a few remarks just to close this call out. We are winning in the market and we have a significant opportunity in front of us. We had a very strong Q4 and I am confident that we'd execute in Q1 and the years ahead. I will continue to be focused on our customers, process, and employees, and I look forward to meeting with investors in the coming months. And for now, thank you for your time today and have a great day. Thank you.
