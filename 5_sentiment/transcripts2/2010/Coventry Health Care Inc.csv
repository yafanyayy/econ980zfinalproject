Good morning from snow-bound Maryland and thank you for your interest in our company. As you saw in our press release this morning, we just reported a strong finish for 2009, both for the fourth quarter and the full year.  The results were a product of each of our seven major businesses performing at or in many cases, better than budget. I'm very pleased with the progress the company has made over the past year. And if you'll recall in prior calls, there were a number of initiatives and improvements we embarked on in January of 2009. And although we understand that you're interested in the future and that we're clearly focused on the future, I think it's instructive to go back and review the goals that we laid out for you and the accomplishments of the company during 2009 because they really set the foundation for the future and it's a strong future.First and foremost, we returned to the stable and predictable performance that you've come to expect from Coventry over the past decade. This is evident not only in our aggregate earnings performance but also in metrics, such as the commercial group, Medical Loss Ratio, which, as you can see, is better than our original and most recent guidance.  As you will recall, beginning in early 2009, we examined all of our businesses in terms of where we create the most value for our shareholders and where we provide the best value proposition for our customers. And as a result, we decided to place our focus on seven core businesses. And in that context, during 2009, we successfully divested First Health Services, a non-core asset which was effective in July of 2009. We also decided early in Q2 of 2009 to exit the private fee-for-service Medicare business, after evaluating the reimbursement pressures for 2010 and the legislation, which essentially eliminates the product in 2011. Our preparation for this exit went well as evidenced by the slight profitability of the product as we begin to wind it down. In the meantime, we repositioned our resources to focus on Medicare products where we provide a stronger value proposition to both our customers and the Federal government with the Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care product and Medicare Part D. As a result of exiting private fee-for-service, we should be able to dividend up to our parent, the $250 million or so of capital without -- was supporting this $3 billion revenue stream late this year or in early 2011.We'll also improve operational areas where necessary. The best example of this is the Medicare intake. Enrollment have been dramatically improved and improved our understanding of our SG&A expense attributed to each in all parts of the operations that support our business.  We also announced the acquisition of PHS, a locally based health plan in Wichita, Kansas with about 120,000 commercial risks and ASO members. We received all required federal and state approvals at the end of January, which allowed us to close a transaction in February 1. This not only added strength to our considerable Midwest regional presence, but allowed us to begin discussions on some interesting strategic initiatives with the Via Christi Health System.In terms of our balance sheet, we paid down over $300 million of debt for the full year and we still have a $500 million of free deployable cash on our balance sheet. And as promised, I reorganized and fortified the management team with an improved environment of accountability in focus.  The work outline and just mentioned resulted in the foundation which allowed us to achieve and exceed our EPS commitment to you for 2009. Let's move on to 2010. I agree with comments by many of my peers in our sector who have expressed their view that industry-wide headwinds will be evident this year. Some of these headwinds are obvious, such as pressure on the size of our commercial group insured pool, revenue reduction in Medicare and likely continuing pressure on Medicaid revenue.  Even so, we are forecasting EPS guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per share for this year. While John Stelben, our CFO, will elaborate additionally on guidance, I did want to say that I'm comfortable that our strong results in quarter 2 and quarter 4 position us very well for 2010 even in a challenging environment.I have some comments about our Commercial business. I'm pleased with the results of the pricing corrections that were started in 2008 and continued through 2009 and the stability that this action has created with the margins. However, volume, our membership count is still a challenge. We expect membership to be slightly down in 2010 but significantly less than what we experienced in 2009.  We can and we'll improve both new business sales and retention of existing business. I'm encouraged with the early returns on our sales process and some leadership changes we have made in our health plans as we work to mitigate this macro headwind. Although our health plans are well positioned today, we're never satisfied with our cost structure and want to be able to provide our customers with the best possible value proposition. Each of our health plans have very specific medical cost structures set of initiatives that gets worked daily and with clear accountability. You have the small and mid-sized insured market has been a core strength of our company for well over a decade and this will continue in 2010 and beyond.With regard to Medicare, I am pleased with the early volume reads on our Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care business. As you will likely see in the next CMS membership file, we're down only slightly from 2009 membership goals, that recall that we exited certain SNPs and small subscale expansion markets, totaling of about 13,000 members right out of the gate. We may even be even and with this know more about that when we know more about the terms, but I think the coordinated care membership will essentially be even with the end of last year. And I consider this a very good result considering the level of benefits that needed to be adjusted for 2010 and given the weak revenue picture for 2010.We're working on improving the cost structure and our capabilities that we believe will be necessary in a leaner revenue environment which looks inevitable in one way or another. And as we have shared with you previously, we must improve in five areas to have a long-term future in Medicare Advantage. And as a reminder these are: Carefully modifying benefit designs in premium. We think that we've hit the sweet spot there and we've done that well. The second is best business practices for achieving proper risk-adjusted revenue. We believe we've have made a large improvement there and that that's going very well. The third is improving unit cost. I believe that substantially more work needs to be done in this area and I'm not satisfied with our 2009 progress and we must and we'll do better in 2010. The fourth area is, we must do a better job in managing our members' chronic care needs. And to that end, we've embarked on several initiatives and put considerable resources to improve this area. It's difficult to do but we understand that providing better care and more effective care for our members is basic to stay in this business. And last, and certainly not least, is SG&A. And that's something we can largely control. Our own cost will absolutely have to come down because of Medicare and Medicaid revenue pressures. We're making progress in this front. This company knows how to control costs and we will. In the long run, we continue to believe that Medicare Advantage can be a viable product with a reasonable margin. And quite frankly, if bending the cost curve is really the goal of our customer, the Federal government, then managed care is the best way to accomplish this goal while providing an enhanced value proposition for the senior population. So comments on Medicare Part D. Couldn't be more pleased with the 80% growth in this business during 2009 while achieving target markets. Remember, this is our fourth year of growth and on target or better performance from this business. I'm looking in our positioning in early membership results. Our best guess is we'll end up at about 1.6 million members, down a little bit less than 100,000 members. With regard to Medicaid, early in 2009, we told you we liked the Medicaid market and we'll pursue growth opportunities beyond our existing Medicaid footprint. I'd like to update you on that front. During 2009, we were qualified as a bidder in Pennsylvania to participate in the Medicaid program in the South East, in Lehigh capital regions. And since then, we have been finalizing our networks and going through readiness reviews. With respect to Southeast, we're very close and are working on finalizing the contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a targeted entry in the second quarter of 2010. In the Lehigh capital area, we continue to work on building network toward readiness with the potential entry in the third quarter.  If we successfully enter these two regions, we would expect to build toward a 30,000 to 50,000 membership over the next 24 months. Sticking on the Medicaid subject, in Nebraska, you recall that we bid in the first half of 2009. And we were awarded, the RFP is one of the two entrants in the second quarter with an estimated 40,000 members. As we previously disclosed, the state decided to invalidate the RFP process, reject all proposals and restart the bidding process.  Although disappointing, it did give me some degree of confidence that our approach was professional and proper. And that we brought a value proposition to the business. We have therefore, since resubmitted our bid, present it to the state's rebid process and expect to hear the outcome very shortly.Given the penetration opportunities that, as I have stated, the long-term opportunity to help states better manage their cost, we will continue to devalue and selectively pursue growth opportunities in the Medicaid space. Some comments on our remaining businesses which is our Fee-based businesses. And that's our Workers’ Compensation Services, our rental network and the federal, the FEHBA business which are all stable with improving results, well positioned and produce a diversified revenue, earnings and cash flow stream, while capitalizing on our core managed care capabilities.  During 2009, we spent time addressing the administrative cost structure for these areas and improvement will continue during 2010. Well, I can't predict where changes in government involvement will go, there are certain things we can and must do everyday. We can better manage our cost structure, and we will. This includes both medical and SG&A. We're beginning to lay out the design of new products, particularly individual, that should work better in the long run by bringing a better value equation to our members.  At the end of the day, cost structure by market is likely going to be the major factor in our ability to compete. Just like it is today, just like it has been for the last decade. On an unrelated subject, we tentatively scheduled March 4 of this year as the day to host our Investor Day. And I have decided not to proceed with this meeting this year. Frankly, we would not be able to add much more of any substance or comments than we have today. And therefore, we'd like to not to host the conference. We will stick with our traditional Investor Relations activities in 2010. We'll remain visible and available at investor conferences, starting with the end of March. And in addition, through Asher, John Stelben and I will be visiting investors over the next few quarters, both on the road and hosting meetings here in our offices in Bethesda.In closing, 2010 will be a year of continuing to refine our existing business, reduce our cost structure, work on tomorrow's product, enhance our new IT, add new development capability, develop systems and resources to care for our chronic need members and work toward development of new profitable revenue sources.  We clearly recognizes -- that recognize our challenges and work to be done. That we're very positive about our future and believe that new opportunities in our business will occur for well-managed companies just as they always have. And this concludes my opening comments. And John Stelben, our CFO, will now present the financial report."

As you have seen in the earnings release, we reported $0.74 of EPS for the fourth quarter and $2.14 of EPS for the year from continuing operations. We are very pleased with this strong result as we finish 2009 and move into 2010.  First, let",1771,"Good morning. As you have seen in the earnings release, we reported $0.74 of EPS for the fourth quarter and $2.14 of EPS for the year from continuing operations. We are very pleased with this strong result as we finish 2009 and move into 2010.  First, let me provide some details behind the favorable result to '09 guidance. Midpoint of our previous guidance implied a fourth quarter guidance midpoint of $0.56. While there are always a few moving parts, I will address the primary drivers of the $0.18 favorable variance. The Q4 commercial group loss ratio of 82.9% was better than previous guidance, primarily due to a much more moderate flu impact than expected and a leveling off of COBRA enrollment at 1.7% of commercial group enrollment versus the 2% we have built into guidance. And consistent with the prior quarters, we continue to see positive signs from our actions to set appropriate pricing. The net result of all these items is about $0.08 of favorability versus guidance in the quarter.In our Medicaid business, the Q4 loss ratio of 85.8% was also better than expected, primarily due once again to a much weaker than expected flu result. In guidance, we provided for a sequential quarterly flu impact of 300 basis points, the majority of which did not materialize. The Medicaid performance was worth about $0.05 of favorability versus guidance in the quarter.  Private fee added $0.06 in the quarter, as the MLR continue to run slightly favorable to plan in the first half of the year. As you may recall, last quarter, private fee produced $0.07. So the total for 2009 is $0.13 of EPS.  In summary, the $0.18 of outperformance is driven by the $0.06 of private fee, $0.05 in Medicaid due to better than expected flu results and $0.08 in commercial risk due to a better than expected flu and COBRA result, slightly offset by other normal activity including tax rate.Let me turn to balance sheet and cash flows. Total cash and investments stand at $3.85 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position at the end of the quarter. And the quality and diversity of our investments has never been stronger.  GAAP cash flow from operations for the year was strong at $882 million, fueled by the topline Medicare growth in '09. Health plan and private fee days and claims payable are 53.5, a decrease of about 1.3 days versus Q3. The decrease is about evenly split between health plan and private fee. In Q4, we worked our claim inventories down to create capacity in our customer service operations to handle expected increases in call volumes for the Medicare open enrollment season, as well as our transition to Medco, as a PBM for our Commercial businesses. Remember that our CSO personnel are cross trained so they can work claims as well as customer service calls.With respect to capital. We paid down $110 million on our revolving credit facility in the quarter and our debt to cap ratio now sits at 30.1%, that's 30.1%. Total deployable free cash at the parent is approximately $510 million. Aggregate RBC level is approximately 400%, consistent with prior periods.Turning to 2010 guidance, we are estimating EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.25. To give some perspective, we had 2009 EPS of $2.14 from continuing ops, of which $0.13 was for 2009 private fee.  Our guidance range in 2010 then assumes an increase in EPS year-over-year. Consistent with our historical guidance, the low end of the range assumes no deployment of cash for share repurchase. And the high end of the range assumes use of free cash generated in 2010, continued progress on reducing administrative cost and results at the higher end of operating metrics. While there are clearly headwinds in the macro environment we operate in today, we are very pleased to forecast growth in operating earnings and EPS compared to 2009. The guidance and ranges in the press release do incorporate the PHS acquisition effective February 1, 2010, which we are still forecasting to be neutral to EPS and 2010. So let me provide a few more highlights on the guidance.  In the Commercial Risk business, we expect membership to be down for the year in the low- to mid- single digit range, excluding the addition of PHS commercial risk membership of about 100,000. This is a much better result than we experienced in '09.  The improvement is primarily due to improved sales execution in small group, coupled with better underwriting execution to attract or retain better risk. Our small group sales engine is performing fine, with small group sales in January, up slightly over January 2009. In terms of pricing, we are pricing the trend with our usual margin for error. We do not see any pervasive aggressive pricing across our markets. Consistent with our history, we will work to maintain margin and membership growth will be the variable.  The Commercial group loss ratio is expected to be flat to slightly down on a same-store basis. We are providing for a flu impact in the zone of slightly up year-over-year. We expect the COBRA impact to be higher in 2010 due to the annualization impact of our Q4 COBRA membership level, extension of the eligibility provisions and potential membership increase of up to 2% of group membership. These pressures are expected to be offset by the finalization of the pricing actions we began taking in 2008. Forecasted health plan group loss ratio is expected then to be in the range of 81.5% to 82% on a same-store basis, compared to the 81.9% result in '09. Although the 2010 impact from PHS is expected to be neutral to overall EPS, the addition of PHS, effective February 1, is forecasted to mathematically push the aggregate 2010 commercial MLR up by about 75 basis points. Therefore, we are forecasting the Commercial group MLR at a range of 82.25% to 82.75%. Our fundamental view of trend is that it is stable. While stability is positive, the absolute level of trend in the 8.5% to 9% range is not an acceptable result to us. We are executing on a number of national and local initiatives to reduce the trend line. But consistent with our prudent nature, we are not building these projected savings into our forward pricing until we can count to savings and believe they will be sustained.While our network-based Medicare health plan membership looks to be about flat compared to '09, it is important to remember that we exited several small underperforming markets that produced a 13,000 member drag going into 2010. This means we have positive growth in our same-store businesses. Given that we emphasized margin over growth in our 2010 bids, this is a nice early result. We expect the 2010 Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the mid-80s. On Medicaid, we expect continued modest membership growth, primarily due to economic conditions. Premium yield will be slightly lower than '09, driven by nominal rate increases, more than offset by the carve out of the pharmacy benefit in our Missouri plan that became effective October 1, 2009. Loss ratio is expected to be consistent with 2009 in the mid- to high-80s.On Part D, revenues grew 82% in 2009. And you will recall that we were certainly cautious about our outlook for '09 given this large increase in membership. So we approach the 2010 bids, emphasizing margin over growth.  As you may also recall, on the Q3 call, we discussed that we would lose some auto-assign regions along with some SPAP membership in those regions, roughly 100,000 members in total. Our retail sales appear to be tracking well so far. And coupled with growth in our remaining auto-assign regions, we expect to partially offset the aforementioned loss and end up with membership around 1.6 million, slightly down from '09.  Our margin expectations for '10 are consistent with the performance we saw in '09 with an MLR expected in the mid-80s. Given our very large growth in '09 and the pricing actions we took in the '10 bids, we are pleased with the these initial outcomes we are seeing in membership. On SG&A, the midpoint of 2010 guidance is $1.94 billion. Our total SG&A from continuing ops in '09 was $2.15 billion, which indicates a reduction of $210 million year-over-year. We previously expected total private fee, direct and indirect, to be about $180 million. The actual member for the year was closer to 200 million, given growth and allocation of overhead. There are other puts and takes, but we are pleased to be able to fully adjust our cost structure for the exit of private fee as promised without missing a beat.  Excluding private fee, SG&A percent of revenue is about flat year-over-year, which means we have been able to avoid negative leverage on the G&A given volume pressures. That being said, we need make more progress on SG&A cost and we can and we'll get better.As stated earlier, we ended the year with $510 million of deployable capital. We expect to generate approximately $250 million in free deployable corporate cash at the midpoint of guidance from 2010. We completed and paid for the PHS acquisition last week. And assuming we do not retire any debt or repurchase any shares, we would end 2010 with almost $700 million of deployable capital.  In addition, we anticipate freeing up an additional $250 million of capital as we run out the Private Fee business. That capital should free up by early '11 but we will certainly try to begin the dividend process to access that capital in late 2010.Our priorities for deployable cash are the same as they has always been, M&A opportunities and investing in tomorrow followed by opportunistic share repurchase and deleveraging.  So to conclude, so can expect that we will maintain our pricing discipline, focus on improving our medical and administrative cost structures and look for opportunistic ways to grow.  When I look at 2009 in the rearview mirror, I see many positives. In no particular order, I would recognize a renewed focus on our seven core businesses, improvement in our service operations with special kudos to the progress made in our Medicare enrollment operations, the addition of new management, proven talent and experience leaders to help navigate the waters ahead. And last but not least, a solid financial result in a tough environment. Given the progress we have made in 2009, we certainly have a better foundation to support profitable growth.  Allen do you have anything to add? Or would you like to turn the call over to questions?"

One, I probably have mentioned in the past, but I think our enrollment loss in 2009 was about 50% attributable to the environment, layoffs, people dropping benefits because of personal financials, and some Chapter 11s in small business, at least a half of it was really self-imposed. Sometime in 2007 and early 2008, we got a dysfunctional process between actuarial, and underwriting and our health plans had some weak leadership in some of the health plans. So clearly, half of it was self-induced and we have adjusted and corrected that. And I'm very pleased that we have, I think, the best leadership in the history of our company in the health plans. The person that runs those health plans ran our Utah business for eight years, is an underwriter and an actuary by training, and along with some new people in the health plans, it's just brought day and night better execution. So I'm comfortable that in doing a postmortem of business that we lost with the financial staff here, at least half of it was just our own fault. With regard to what's on people's mind, it hasn't changed. If they possibly can, employers still compete in spite of the unemployment numbers, they still compete for high quality workforce, just the way we do here. And that it's one of the last things that they drop, they are creative, and in terms of deductibles and co-pays, and benefit reductions, and I don't see that, that has changed a lot in the last 12 months. Clearly, the pool is challenging and clearly, we can and will do a better job. I don't think the environment itself has changed that much."

And in many of the cases, that didn't work, but we've returned to that. I mentioned our association with Via Christi, which is an integrated system in central Kansas with a couple of thousand beds in six or eight hospitals. We will begin discussions for a Medicare product limited to their network. They have a lot resources in terms of medicine at home, monitoring at home, intermediate facilities between skilled nursing and inpatient. And I'd like to start with Via Christi and other organizations, doing something where we could offer a better value equation to the members; more benefits at resources that they have and then do some type of profit sharing with the facilities so that we're not fighting over per diems or not fighting over rates, but doing something that we're collaboratively together in. So that system is the first initiative. Our Medicaid leadership has much better numbers for getting what the cost per confinement or the cost per day, or on the total cost for different diagnosis is for inpa -- we've got a lot better information on the true cost, and where we need to direct traffic to get the best results. And we didn't do much for a long time. If you go back to eight or nine years ago, there was sort of an anti-managed care backlash, everyone wanted to see every provider. And I think that, that cycle has kind of run its course, and we'll do more with more limited, more efficient providers in more collaborative ways. Easy to talk about, it takes a long time, it's hard to do, but we're going to get started this year."

One, we want to get a stronger regional presence across state lines. We have a very strong Midwestern. It was basically Insured business, which I like better than ASO business. And more than that, it's a really innovative system with innovative leadership.

But it's someone that's philosophically attuned that the world is changing, and they need to change and their tired of fighting over a nickel, so to speak.

We’ll follow our normal agenda. I’ll start off by providing some brief comments.

We’ll follow our normal agenda. I’ll start off by providing some brief comments. John Stelben will provide more details on the financials and that will be followed by some time for some brief questions.
My comments will cover three areas this morning. The first is on Q1, then our outlook for the remainder of 2010, and finally I’ll provide some brief remarks on the post reform future of our company. 
With regard to the first quarter, this morning we announced EPS of $0.66. As we look beyond Q1 to the remainder of the year, we are providing full year guidance of $2.35 to $2.50 per share. Q1 was obviously a very strong start to 2010 for our company, and while our management group believes that our business is improving rapidly, the strength of the quarter was a bit unexpected.
I believe that Q1 results can best be explained with two to three comments. First and most important is the sharper focus on business fundamentals over the last 18 months. Our SG&A, our medical unit costs worked towards improving our members’ quality of healthcare, much better integration between our actuarial, underwriting and sales team, our government program execution, and the many areas I have discussed in my prior four quarters of conference calls. Simple stated, we are actually getting better on the basics of our business and we will continue to do so. 
I think the second area to describe Q1 results, is that we have some favorable, for lack of a better word, tailwind. There was little impact from the flu; and I think two, it cannot be quantified, severe weather in many of our markets undoubtedly influenced utilization to some extent. And the third factor explaining our results is very positive reserve development.
Under the subject of quarterly highlights, I have a few comments. We closed our preferred health system acquisition in Kansas on February 1. This property has further strengthened our mid west regional presence, and will allow us to improve care for our members with a very high quality delivery system. 
We are working and plan on completing a proprietary Medicare advantage product with the Via Christi healthcare system, which we hope we’ll be able to market later this year, with January 1, 2011 effective dates. Within this product we’ll provide excellent coverage and improved care for the Kansas senior population.
Staying with quarterly highlights, we were once again awarded a contract to provide care for Medicaid members in Nebraska, with an effective date of August 1. We completed a very orderly and positive Medicare private fee for service exit. We took a number of successful steps in the last step of 2009, to neutralize the SG&A impact. 
We are experiencing positive reserves developments, which at a minimum will create additional statutory capital and ultimately free cash flow. On April 1, we began enrolling Medicaid members in Pennsylvania. 

Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2010, I’d like to address our core businesses. Commercial business, I believe that you’ll see a merchant proved membership progression during the first quarter. Including the close of our strategic preferred health acquisition during the first quarter, we grew commercial risk membership by 83,000 members. 
On a same store basis we were down approximately 20,000 members, and although we would certainly prefer to grow the same store membership and plan to do in the future, this is the best Q1 sequential result that our company has reported since Q1 of 2006. Much of this improvement is just plain better execution. 
I think during last year, during 2009 where there was substantial membership erosion, that I previously told people and told all of you that half of it was the economy and the diminishing size of the block of business, but atleast half of it was internal. We have addressed the internal issues and our new business sales show that and have exceeded plan. The number of personnel and process improvements that we made during 2009 are beginning to pay off in 2010.
We are still vigilant in pricing to underwriting costs, our costs of goods sold if you will. This is evidenced by our financial metrics in the press release. As all of you know, the key to long term success in this business is managing the cost of goods sold or the medical cost, along with SG&A, on behalf of our employer and individual customers. 
While we made improvement in patient care and the underlying cost structure in the past few quarters, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do in this area, and it will remain an area of focus. It’s especially necessary to have this focus as we navigate reform and prepare for the many new requirements there.
Moving from the commercial block to Medicare, the membership in our Medicare advantaged coordinated care plan reached 190,000 members, up from 186,000 at years end. This is 2% better than our flat forecast, but beyond that a very good result considering that we exit from a number of S&P plans and subscale markets which totaled about 13,000 members. 
Our medical loss ratio of 85.7 was 120 basis points improvement from the full year in 2009, and while this trend is positive, it was undoubtedly helped by a mild flu season and we recognize there’s a lot of work to be done, heading into the post reform payment environment. In short, we can do better in this business and we will. 
I’m pleased to report that new initiatives are underway to improve care coordination for the chronically ill, and are on target to be continually rolled out through the balance of the year. These are initiatives that began in 2009 regarding the frail elderly and they are showing some early promise. 
As explained earlier in my comments about Via Christi, we have developed a new model of care. We believe that more innovative reimbursement arrangements that align incentives to improve patient care with better outcomes are increasingly necessary in tomorrow’s environment, and a substantial amount of resources will be directed towards models in that end.
As you all know too, I am sure that we’re preparing our bids on the Medicare front for 2011, and given the recently announced and anticipated fact or revenue raise, and the reform related reductions that began in 2012, we must continue to intensify our focus there. We will continue to make progress on medical costs and contracting efficiencies along with other areas. These obviously include intelligent plan design, best practices for risk-adjusted revenue, SG&A improvement. 
Proving the quality of care for members is basic and fundamental for all of our efforts. Overall we are please with Q1 results for this business and we feel that we are doing the right things to prepare for changes in 2011 and 2012. In fact we anticipated the revenue environment, regardless of the reform movement, and spent a lot of time and energy and resources working on this effort beginning in 2009.
With regard to Medicare Part D, we have a solid stable business. We knew that quarter of 1.6 million Part D members are on track with our guidance. Once again I feel this is a good results because of our exit from nine auto assigned regions. From a pharmacy cost perspective, Q1 results are inline or slightly better than our expectations.
Moving to Medicaid, our Medicaid business is demonstrating very significant progress, both in terms of growth and better management of our members. From a growth view we’ve added two new areas of business in Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Our Nebraska as I announced earlier is scheduled to commence in August this year, and should result in 30,000 to 40,000 new members. 
As discussed in our last call, we qualify to enter southeastern Pennsylvania and began receiving auto assigned members at the beginning of this month. We are continuing our efforts to finish our medical delivery system in central PA and hope to qualify in that region in the near future. We see opportunities to service this population and will continue to seek new opportunities in this space, especially given the long-term expansion of the population. 
With regard to our fee-based businesses, network rental, FEHP and the workers compensation, we are performing at or better than expectations. This business has provided predictable and consistent results. While the soft economy and the employment market has provided some headwinds for our workers compensation business, our strong sales execution and SG&A control has largely offset this headwind.
Let me give you some few comments about the post reform environment. What bout the environment? Well, we understand that regulations here have to be finalized, it will determine much of the future, but nevertheless the less the broad outlines are known and consistent with how we positioned our company during the past year. 
Our commercial group business, our $5 billion business is about evenly split, with about 50% of our enrolment below 100 subscribers and about 50% over 100. With a little progress in broker costs, which needed to be addressed regardless of reform, the weighted medical loss ratio average on our book of business should be in the low 80’s. Assuming a reasonable set of regulations, this positions us decently for the new rules and should allow a fair margin, and especially so we can find the 100 basis points of SG&A from a variety of sources.
The Medicare advantage coordinated care product is one that we’ve always believed in. If you follow our company’s history back to the balance budget in the mid to late 90’s, a lot of people in our space abandoned this line of business; we did not and we have always believed it’s the best way to provide care for seniors, and we are dedicated to put the effort and resources at best business practices in this line. 
As I previously announced in several calls, we have five ongoing initiatives to improve our results in this product line. We feel like the 2011 race announced early in April are manageable for us, and we are planning for the new payment system that starts getting payees down for 2012.
With regard to post reform, we have focused on Medicaid, again putting additional resources in that in 2009, both in improving our unit cost and caring better for our members. 
We understand that revenue will be a challenge as states struggle with their own revenue shortfalls, but low cost, both unit and SG&A along with better care for the member wins. Requirements for success, our skill sets that we have and that’s demonstrated in our recent medical loss rational progress. We are going to work hard to grow membership in Medicaid and this will continue to be a priority in our company. 
We are well aware of the many of the challenges in the post-reform environment and in shot we believe tomorrow’s environment will create plenty of challenges, and also opportunities. We believe that organizations that are thoughtful, nimble, creative and have the industry tools and cost structure will succeed. 
We feel we are entering the reform environment as a well diversified resource, with a capable manager group and that we are well prepared for the evolving landscape. What about the tools for the future? We should have about a $1 billion in per cash by the middle of next year if we don’t find other opportunities like preferred health. 
With regard to tools it’s our senior team. One of our most significant accomplished over the past year has been the formation of a senior management team, who have proven records of success and are exceeding capability in their areas of responsibilities. A lot of these have been announced in the past, but I’ll take them in a minute, and I will remind you of some of the additions that we’ve made to our organization. 
Staying with tools for the future to lower cost structure, its important to compete in the past and it’s going to be critical in the future, and where we have delivery systems we think that our cost structure will generally be second to no one. A diversified, well positioned business and the nimbus and know-how to adapt is the fourth tool for the future, and I think that in general that we have the tools and resources to run a better company in tomorrows environment. 
I want to stay on our management group a bit, and a few comments and their commitments to the company I believe is appropriate. We’ve had a lot of experienced individuals. All have demonstrated records of success. People have proven their skills well previously, and more importantly during the last 15 months. In the end it’s really about the quality of our management team in our business. 
In our operations and IT area, Harv DeMovick has been with the company for many years retuned a year ago and is committed to stay with our company through 2011. Our Medicare advantage in Part D is headed by Nancy Cocozza. She was with our company in the past, the best of what she does and is a building block that we need to do more of this business. 
Paul Conlin joined us this year. His responsibility is Medicaid. He’s added to our foundation for the future; has demonstrated early success both in unit cost and with new business during the last six months. 
Mick Bahr has been with our company for eight years and is part of our Altius and western operation and headed that up. Mike’s a underwriter and actuary, and he assumed the responsibility for all of our health plans about six months ago, and is uniquely qualified, to add a new group and individual business at the correct cost structure and revenue. 
Dr. Patricia Mueller, our senior medical officer joint us last year and is leading the efforts for better patient care. Matt Isles is our new addition in government policy and brings insights in the policy area that our company simply hasn’t had in the past. I can continue the list but my point is that the best management team is basic to tomorrow’s success and we’ve got a very solid team. As our company has always done previously, the search for additional talent will continue. 
My own commitment is at a minimum though 2011 and I’ve stated earlier that the search for best people will not end, and I need to add that this will include a through and very thoughtful search for my successor. 
Closing though. Well there is a lot left to play out in 2010, but our management group feels very good about the year. Lot of work to be done to prepare for 2011 and beyond, but I’m excited and positive about our progress. In my own view there is a very high likelihood of future consolidation in our business in the not too distant future, and we feel very positive about our ability to participate in that consolidation process. In the end, change almost always brings opportunity. 
With that, that concludes my comments. John Stelben is going to provide a financial report and then we’ll open the call for questions. John.

Good mornings. As Allen said, we are pleased to report EPS for the first quarter of $0.66. This is a strong result embedded in our plan for the quarter. In addition as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance to a range of $2.35 to $2.50, up from the previous guidance range of 210 to 225. 
First I am going to provide some highlights on the quarterly performance and then turn to the increase in guidance for the full year. At a macro level as Allan mentioned, we had some tailwind as we look back on the quarter. 
First, our Medicare advantage private key product line, which we exited January 1, produced $0.17 in the quarter, due primarily to prior period reserve development. While we set reserves with an expectation of favorable development, recall that we did not incorporate any private key run our earnings in our previous guidance. So this $0.17 is an upside to 2010 expectations. 
In our commercial risk business, membership was a little out of expectations due primarily to small group sales activity, which is ahead of Q1 2009 results. This is really the result of better sales execution, coupled with products that demonstrate better value. Our preferred health acquisition came online February 1 and that was a little over 100,000 commercial risk members. 
Premium yields our inline with expectations and are up 5.3% over the prior year quarter. The commercial group medical loss ratio of 80.2% is slightly better than expected, primarily due to lower than expected impact from flu. We previously guided to about 15 basis points of additional flue pressure on the 2010 full year group loss ratio, but it was front end loaded in Q1, and none of it really materialized during the quarter.
It maybe fair to say weather had some impact, but that’s pretty hard to quantify and it would be prudent to assume that elective procedures will get rescheduled at some future point. COBRA membership levels ticked up slightly to 1.8% from about 1.7% of total commercial group membership, which is consisted with our expectation that COBRA would climb to 2% during 2010. 
Our view of fundamental challenges continued stability in the 8.5% to 9% range. While our Q1 result was slightly better than expected, one quarter does not make a trend and while we are implementing unit cost in utilization of prudent initiatives across all our businesses, it is still too early to count the impact as I think about 2010. Our preferred health acquisition as Allan mention is performing as expected, both operationally and financially. 
Moving on to Medicare, the coordinated care results in Q1 are inline with our expectations for the quarter and the comments we made on the Q4 ’09 earnings call. Membership is up slightly above where we ended ’09 which is a very positive result given the 15,000 member blocks of business we exited coming into the year. Medicare Part D results as well were inline with our plan, and I’d like to provide a little more prospective on the loss ratio.
You will note in the last couple of years that Q1 loss ratios were generally in the range of 100%, higher than the 95.3% we reported this quarter. In 2010 we introduced deductibles on about 70% of the members, who had no deductible in 2009. The introduction of deductibles will alter the historical slope of earnings, but not the annual result. Given all the changes we made coming into 2010 with pricing and product design, we are very pleased with our membership results, and are on track for our full year Part D loss ratio guidance of mid 80’s.
Medicaid produced a very good Q1 loss ratio of 84%, to lead a better management of patient care, especially in-patient care and lower than expected flu. This result is several hundred basis points better than the annual loss ratio guidance. While we are very pleased with the results and the changeable progress we are making in patient management, we do see some late headwind that I will address later in my comments on guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, total cash in investments stand at $3.85 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position of $66 million at March 31, virtually unchanged from year-end. GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was a negative $187 million. This result includes a $297 million outflow for the run out of the private fee product line. As a reminder, we have cash and short-term liquid securities in our statutory entities matching private declines liability.
Adjusting for the private key run out in Q1, adjusted cash flow from operations would have been $110 million or over 150% of net income. More importantly, free deployable cash at the parent was $450 million versus $510 million at year-end, the main driver of the difference between the funds used for the preferred health acquisition net of some other ins and outs. Our normal statutory dividend process to parents starts in the second quarter.
Days in claims payable displayed in the press release exclude private key for service for all periods presented. The increase in DCP of 4.7 days over the prior quarter is due primarily to seasonal timing, timing of Part D subsidies and a small increase in claims inventory. Debt to cap ratio now stands at 29.5%, driven by the addition of Q1 earnings. We did not repay any debt in the quarter.
Turning to updated 2010 guidance, we are forecasting EPS in the range of 235 to 250. As a reminder, this includes the $0.17 of earnings generated by private gain in the first quarter, but does not assume any further private fee impact for the remainder of the year.
In summary, we are adding our view of Q1 out performance to the prior full year guidance, while essentially maintaining our prior aggregate view of Q2 through Q4, while recognizing some new facts we now know about. For simplicity, our work through the guidance changes using the mid point of the range for both prior and revised guidance. 
The mid point of prior guidance was $2.17 and the mid point of revised is $2.42 an increase of $0.25. As I just explained $0.17 of this increase was related to private fee, which leaves about $0.08 for our seven core businesses. Now, let me provide a few highlights on that. 
Starting with commercial risk, we still expect same store membership to be down for the year in the low single digit. When we include the addition of 100,000 preferred help commercial risk members total growth should be in the range of 4.5% to 5%. While our Q1 small group sales performance is better than expected, it is still early and the macro economic issue still exists. That being said we are very pleased with the same store sales results, and believe that volume will be slightly more favorable in the range than our previous expectation.
Forecasted commercial group risk MLR, including preferred health is expected to be in the range of 82% to 82.5%. This is a 25 basis point reduction from previous guidance, driven largely by the benign flue season. It also incorporates our fundamental view of forward trend stable. Together we believe these two items account for about $0.08 of the increased guidance. For Medicare CCP our view of guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect the0 Medicare Advantages loss ratio to be in the mid 80s.
Part D has also performed consisted with our expectations so far in 2010. As a result, our annual view of this business is unchanged from prior guidance. Membership is in the $1.6 million range and our loss ratio in the mid 80s. For Medicaid, from an earnings standpoint our annual view of this business is unchanged from prior guidance. While we had better expected Q1 results and we see improvement in patient management, we see raised headwinds in the second half of the year.
In our Missouri based health care US subsidiary, which accounts for almost half our Medicaid membership, we will be receiving a rate increase just under 1% in July, and this is around two points lower than expected. While our Medicaid team has multiple networking utilization initiatives underway to mitigate trend, we don’t count things until we can physically count them. I would not be surprised given state revenue challenges of other rate actions in other space, and I have nothing definitive at this point and time. 
Our guidance has been adjusted to incorporate the addition of the Southeast PA and Nebraska market. We are underway in Southeast PA with auto-assignments beginning in April, and as Allen said, in Nebraska the contract begins August 1, with an expectation to reach 30,000 to 40,000 members by year-end. We expect a mutual impact over our earnings in 2010 for these new Medicaid markets. Our fee-based businesses will be up about $0.02 based on stronger than expected revenues. 
On SG&A, midpoint of the 2010 guidance is $1.96 billion. The new midpoint is up about $20 million to recognize volume related SG&A for our better commercial membership and the addition of the southeast PA, Nebraska Medicaid businesses. Note that at the midpoint of SG&A guidance, the percent of revenue is 17.3% down slightly from the 17.5% previous guidance. Given we have not repurchased any shares year-to-date, we have adjusted the share count in our 2010 guidance to reflect deployment in the back half of the year. 
So, let me just re-summarize those points. Private fee Q1 earnings of $0.17 growth grew for the full year. Commercial group risk out performance, both our improved unit loss ratio as well as higher expected volume drives about 8%, $0.08 of the increase. 
Medicare CCP and Part D are unchanged from an earnings perspective. Medicaid earnings are unchanged for the year. Q1 out performance will be offset by lower than expected rating increases in Missouri. Fee-based businesses will be up about $0.02 based on stronger than expected revenues, and lastly our more conservative view of share repurchase has an impact of negative $0.02. 
On free cash and capital, as stated earlier, we have $450 million of deployable cash on hand, and expect to generate over $250 million of free cash from our seven core businesses in 2010. In addition, we expect to dividend out the capital supporting the private fee product line, which during Q1 results would be approximately $275 million. 
We will seek to partially dividend this up in late 2010, with the remainder in the first half of 2011. Assuming no additional deployment of cash, we could end 2010 with $700 million to $800 million of deployable capital. In adding to that the remainder of the private fee dividend in 2011, we could have total deployable capital of approximately $1 billion by mid 2011. Our priorities for deployable cash are the same as always, growing the business through acquisition followed by opportunistic share repurchase and delevering. 
To conclude, Q1 was a strong but early result. We see changeable progress and better sales execution, and in managing all of our expenses better. While we all know the challenges ahead, we continue to focus on improving our overall cost structure. A low cost structure will be the key differentiator in succeeding in the reform world, really as it had always been in this business. 
Allen, do you have anything else to add?

If you get out too far in front of all that and don’t do it in a reasonable and thoughtful way, and consistent with the competition, you are going to lose some of your profitable book, but regardless of reform, the amount of commissions have continued to creep in the commercial arena, with a decreasing block of business out there and people increasingly eager to preserve market share. So its just going in the wrong direction and that has to change. 
We have not made much progress and will be redoubling our efforts to go with the people that are most helpful to us and to their clients.

We are not national, not going to be national and can’t be. Where we have health plans, where we have HMO type networks, our cost structure has always been competitive with the best, and let’s say competitive means within 500 basis points of the best, and that hasn’t changed. 
I think that we have to be better in selecting maybe something. Networks are not as broad as they once where, in return for picking a delivery system with good outcomes and high quality care for the members, which always means usually a better-cost structure. I think that within the places that we do business there will be a narrower products. 
The one that we are working on with Via Christi on Medicare Advantage, and the Central Kansas area will be a product for the Via Christi system only. They have a huge amount of resources including 26 primary care physicians that are employees of the system and I think that will just allow us to get better benefits, better resources to help those physicians manage the care better, and I think that is going to happen on the commercial side as well. 
Just the problem with our product is no one can afford it, and I’m talking about our sector, our investment, so we are going to have to do a better job on the cost front. So I think its going to get tougher for everybody, and if you don’t have best business practices and a good balance sheet, and the information and the insights it takes to manage the patients; that people are going to opt out, but we’ll see. I have no evidence of that at this stage, but maybe in a quarter or two.

Its accretive, it helps our presence in the marketplace, and we did that for a long time, but consolidation kind of stopped and I believe that its likely on all those fronts we talked about, the Medicare advantage and registered with a small private Medicaid plans, but sort of into commercial I think that that will return. 
One of the reasons that we didn’t do any share repurchases in Q1 is just to your point. I want to keep our powder dry and I think that buying businesses that we understand and no one make it better, and can make a fairer margin is good use of capital.

We'll follow our normal agenda. I'll start off by providing some brief comments. John Stelben, will provide more details on the financials and that will be followed by some time for some brief questions. My comm",2518,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll follow our normal agenda. I'll start off by providing some brief comments. John Stelben, will provide more details on the financials and that will be followed by some time for some brief questions. My comments will cover three areas this morning. The first is on Q1, then our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And finally, I'll provide some brief remarks on the post-reform future of our company.
With regard to the first quarter, this morning we announced an EPS of $0.66. And as we look beyond Q1 to the remainder of the year, we're providing full year guidance of $2.35 to $2.50 per share. Q1 was obviously a very strong start 2010 for our company. And while our management group believes that our business is improving rapidly, the strength of the quarter was a bit unexpected. 
I believe that Q1 results can best be explained with two or three comments. First and most important is the sharper focus on business fundamentals over the last 18 months. Our SG&A, our medical unit cost work toward improving our members' quality of healthcare, much better integration between our actuarial, underwriting and sales team, our government program execution and the many areas I have discussed in my prior four quarters of conference calls. Simply stated, we're executing better in the basics of our business and we will continue to do so. 
I think the second area to describe Q1 results is that we have some favorable, for lack of a better word, tailwind. There was little impact from the flu. And I think, too, while it cannot be quantified, severe weather in many of our markets undoubtedly influenced utilization to some extent. And the third factor explaining our results is a very positive reserve development.
Under the subject of quarterly highlights, I have a few comments. We closed our Preferred Health Systems acquisition in Kansas on February 1. This property has further strengthened our Midwest regional presence and will allow us to improve care for our members with a very high quality delivery system. We're working and planning on completing a proprietary Medicare Advantage product with the Via Christi Healthcare System, which we hope we'll be able to market later this year with January 1, 2011, effective dates. We believe this product will provide excellent coverage and improved care for the Kansas senior population.
On staying with quarterly highlights, we were once again awarded the contract to provide care for Medicaid members in Nebraska with an effective date of August 1. We completed a very orderly and positive Medicare Private Fee-For-Service exit. We took a number of successful steps in the last step of 2009 to neutralize the SG&A impact. We're experiencing positive reserves developments, which at a minimum will create additional statutory capital and ultimately, free cash flow. On April 1, we began enrolling Medicaid members in Pennsylvania.
Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2010, I'd like to address our core businesses. Commercial business, I believe, that you'll see a much improved membership progression during the first quarter, including the close of our strategic Preferred Health acquisitions during the first quarter. We grew commercial risk membership by 83,000 members. 
On a same-store basis, we were down approximately 20,000 members. And although we would certainly prefer to grow same-store membership and plan to do in the future, this is the best Q1 sequential result that our company has reported since Q1 of 2006. Much of this improvement is just plain better execution. I think during last year, during 2009, where there was substantial membership erosion that I've previously told people and told all of you that half of it was the economy and the diminishing size of the lack of business, but at least half of it was internal. And we have addressed the internal issues and our new business sales showed that and have exceeded plan. And the number of personnel in process of improvements that we made during 2009 are beginning to pay off in 2010.
We're still vigilant in pricing to underlying cost, our cost of goods sold, if you will. This is evidenced by our financial metrics in the press release. As all of you know, the key to long-term success in this business is managing the cost of goods sold or the medical costs along with SG&A on behalf of our employer and individual customers. While we've made improvement in patient care and underlying cost structure in the past few quarters, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do in this area and that it will remain an area of focus.
It's especially necessary have this focus as we navigate reform and prepare for the many new requirements there. 
Moving from the commercial block to Medicare, the membership in our Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care Plan reached 190,000 members, up from 186,000 at years end. This was 2% better than our flat forecast but beyond that, a very good result considering that we exit from a number of SNP [Special Needs Plans] plans and subscale markets, which totaled about 13,000 members. 
Our medical loss ratio of 85.7 was 120 basis points improvement from the full year in 2009. And while this trend is positive, it was an undoubtedly helped by a mild flu season and we recognize there's a lot of work to be done heading into the post-reform payment environment. In short, we can do better in this business and we will. 
I'm pleased to report the new initiatives are underway to improve care coordination for the chronically ill, and are on target to be continually rolled out through the balance of the year. These are initiatives that began in 2009 regarding the frail elderly and they are showing some early promise. 
As explained earlier in my comments about Via Christi, we have developed a new model of care. We believe that more innovative reimbursement arrangements that align incentives to improve patient care with better outcomes are increasingly necessary in tomorrow's environment, and a substantial amount of resources will be directed toward models in that end. 
As you all know too, I'm sure that we are preparing our bids on the Medicare front for 2011. And given the recently announced, an anticipated VAT revenue raise and the reform-related reductions that began in 2012, we must continue to intensify our focus there. We will continue to make progress on medical cost and contracting efficiencies along with other areas. These obviously include intelligent plan design, best practices for risk-adjusted revenue, SG&A improvement.
Proving the quality of care for members is basic and fundamental to all of our efforts. Overall, we're pleased with Q1 results for this business and we feel that we are doing the right things to prepare for changes in 2011 and 2012. In fact, we anticipated the revenue environment regardless of the reform movement, and spent a lot of time and energy and resources working on these efforts beginning in 2009. 
With regard to Medicare Part D, we have a solid stable business. We ended the quarter at $1.6 million Part D members, on track with our guidance. Once again, we feel this was a good result because of our exit from nine auto-assigned regions. From the pharmacy cost perspective, Q1 results are in-line or slightly better than our expectations. 
Moving to Medicaid, our Medicaid business is demonstrating very significant progress both in terms of growth and better management of our members. From a growth view, we've added two new areas of business in Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Our Nebraska business, as announced earlier, is scheduled to commence in August of this year and should result in 30,000 to 40,000 new members. 
As discussed in our last call, we qualified to enter southeastern Pennsylvania and began receiving auto-assign members at the beginning of this month. We are continuing our efforts to finish the medical delivery system in central PA and hope to qualify in that region in the near future. We see opportunities to service this population and we'll continue to seek new opportunities in this space, especially given the long-term expansion of the population. 
With regard to our Fee-Based businesses, Network Rental, FEHB [Federal Employees Health Benefits]and the Workers' Compensation were performing at or better than expectations. These businesses provide predictable and consistent results. While the soft economy and the employment market has provided some headwinds for our Workers' Compensation business, our strong sales execution and SG&A control has largely offset this headwind. 
Maybe some few comments about the post-reform environment. What about the environment? Well, we understand that regulations yet to be finalized will determine much of the future, but nevertheless, the broad outlines are known and consistent with how we position our company during the past year. 
Our Commercial Group business, a $5 billion business is about evenly split with about 50% of our enrollment below 100 subscribers and about 50% over 100. With a little progress in broker cost, which needed to be addressed regardless of reform, the weighted medical loss ratio average on our book of business should be in the low 80s. Assuming a reasonable set of regulations, this positions us decently for the new rules and should allow a fair margin, and as basically so, we can find 100 basis points of SG&A from a variety of sources.
The Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care product is one that we've always believed in. You follow our company's history back to the balanced budget in the mid-to-late '90s, a lot of people in our space abandoned this line of business, we did not. And we have always believed it's the best way to provide care for seniors, and we're dedicated to put the effort and resources to have best business practices in this line. 
And as I previously announced in several calls, we have five ongoing initiatives to improve our results in this product line. We feel like the 2011 race announced early in April are manageable for us, and we're planning for the new payment system that starts getting payees down for 2012.
With regard to post reform, we have focused on Medicaid, began putting additional resources in that in 2009 both in improving our unit cost and caring better for our members. We understand that revenue will be a challenge as states struggle with their own revenue shortfalls. That low cost, both unit and SG&A, along with better care for the member, wins. Requirements for success our skill sets that we have and that's demonstrated in our recent medical loss ratio progress. We're going to work hard to grow membership in Medicaid and this will continue to be a priority in our company.
We're well aware of many of the challenges in the post-reform environment and in short, we believe tomorrow's environment will create plenty of challenges and also opportunities. We believe that organizations that are thoughtful, nimble, creative and have the industry tools and cost structure will succeed. And we feel we're entering the reform environment as a well-diversified, resourceful, with a capable manager group and that we're well prepared for the evolving landscape. But what about the tools for the future? Well, we should have about $1 billion in free cash by the middle of next year if we don't find the other opportunities like Preferred Health. 
And with regard to tools, it's our senior team. One of our most significant accomplishment over the past year has been the formulation of our senior management team, who have proven records of success and are exceedingly capable in their areas of responsibilities. A lot of these have been announced in the past, but I'll take them in a minute, I will remind you of some of the additions that we've made to our organization. 
Staying with tools for the future to low cost structure, it's important to compete in the past and it's going to be critical in the future. And where we have delivery systems, we think that our cost structure will generally be second to no one's.
A diversified, well-positioned business and the nimbleness and know-how to adapt is the fourth tool for the future. And I think that in general, that we have the tools and resources to run a better company in tomorrow's environment.
I want to stay on our management group a bit, and a few comments in their commitments to the company, I believe, is appropriate. We've had a lot of experienced individuals, all have demonstrated records of success, people have proven their skills well previously, and more importantly, during the last 15 months. In the end, it's really about the quality of your management team and our business.  
In our operations on IT area, Harv DeMovick has been with the company for many years, returned a year ago and is committed to stay with our company through 2011. Our Medicare Advantage and Part D is headed by Nancy Cocozza. She was with our company in the past, the best of what she does and is a building block that we need to do more of this business. Paul Conlin joined us this year. His responsibility  is Medicaid. He's added to our foundation for the future and has demonstrated early success both in unit cost and with new business during the last six months. Mike Bahr has been with our company for eight years and was part of our Altius and Western operation or headed that up. Mike's an underwriter and actuary, and he assumed the responsibility for all of our health plans about six months ago and is uniquely qualified to add new group and individual business at the correct cost structure and revenue. Dr. Patricia Mueller, our Senior Medical Officer, joined us last year and is leading the efforts for better patient care. And Matt Eyles is a new addition in government policy and bring insights in the policy area that our company simply hasn't had in the past. I could continue the list but my point is that the best management team is basic for tomorrow success and we've got a very solid team. And as our company has always done previously, the search for additional talent will continue. 
My own commitment is at minimum through 2011, and I have stated earlier that the search for best people were not end, and I need to add that this will include a thorough and very thoughtful search for my successor. 
Closing thought. Well there's a lot left to play out in 2010 but our management group feels very good about the year. A lot of work to be done to prepare for 2011 and beyond, but I'm excited and positive about our progress. In my own view, there's a very high likelihood of future consolidation in our business in the not-too-distant future, and we feel very positive about our ability to participate in that consolidation process. In the end, change almost always brings opportunity. 
With that, that concludes my comments. John Stelben is going to provide a financial report and then we'll open the call for questions. John?"
27133,100327066,58949,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-30-2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As Allen said, we are pleased to report EPS for the first quarter of $0.66. This is a strong result and better than our plan for the quarter. In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance to",1899,"Good morning. As Allen said, we are pleased to report EPS for the first quarter of $0.66. This is a strong result and better than our plan for the quarter. In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance to a range of $2.35 to $2.50, up from the previous guidance range of $2.10 to $2.25. First I'm going to provide some highlights on the quarterly performance, and then turn to the increase in guidance for the full year.
At a macro level, as Allen mentioned, we had some tailwind as we look back in the quarter. First, our Medicare Advantage Private Fee product line, which we exited January 1, produced $0.17 in the quarter due primarily to prior period reserve development. While we set reserves with an expectation of favorable development, recall that we did not incorporate any Private Fee run out earnings in our previous guidance. So this $0.17 is an upside to 2010 expectations.
In our Commercial Risk business, membership was a little ahead of expectations due primarily to small group sales activity, which is ahead of Q1 2009 results. This is really the result of better sales execution, coupled with products that demonstrate better value. Our Preferred Health acquisition came on line February 1 and added a little over 100,000 Commercial Risk members. 
Premium yields are in-line with expectations and are a 5.3% over the prior year quarter. The commercial group medical loss ratio of 80.2% is slightly better than expected primarily due to lower than expected impact from flu. We previously guided to about 15 basis points of additional flu pressure on the 2010 full year group loss ratio, but it was front-end loaded in Q1 and none of it really materialized during the quarter. 
It may be fair to say weather had some impact, but that's pretty hard to quantify and it would be prudent to assume that elective procedures will get rescheduled at some future point. COBRA membership levels ticked up slightly to 1.8% from about 1.7% of total Commercial Group membership, which is consistent with our expectation that COBRA would climb to 2% during 2010. 
Our view of fundamental trend has continued stability in the 8.5% to 9% range. While our Q1 result was slightly better than expected, one quarter does not make a trend. And while we are implementing unit cost and utilization improvement initiatives across all our businesses, it is still too early to count the impact as I think about 2010. Our Preferred Health acquisition, as Allen mentioned, is performing as expected both operationally and financially. 
Moving on to Medicare, the coordinated care results in Q1 were in line with our expectations for the quarter and the comments we made on the Q4 '09 earnings call. Membership is now slightly above where we ended '09, which is a very positive result given the 13,000 member blocks of business we exited coming into the year. 
Medicare Part D results as well were in-line with our plan and I'd like to provide a little more perspective on the loss ratio. You will note in the last couple of years that Q1 loss ratios were generally in the range of 100%, higher than the 95.3% we reported this quarter.
In 2010, we introduced deductibles on about 70% of the members who had no deductible in 2009. The introduction of deductibles will alter the historical slope of earnings but not the annual result. Given all the changes we made coming into 2010 with pricing and product design, we are very pleased with our membership results and are on track for our full year Part D loss ratio guidance of mid-80s.
Medicaid produced a very good Q1 loss ratio of 84% due to better management of patient care, especially in patient care, and lower than expected flu. This result is several hundred basis points better than the annual loss ratio guidance. While we are very pleased with the results and the tangible progress we are making in patient management, we do see some ray [ph](25:00) headwind that I will address later in my comments on guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. Total cash and investments stand at $3.85 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position of $66 million at March 31, virtually unchanged from year end. GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was a negative $187 million. This result includes a $297 million outflow for the run out of the Private Fee product line. As a reminder, we have cash and short-term liquid securities in our statutory entities, matching the Private Fee claims liability.
Adjusting for the Private Fee run out in Q1, adjusted cash flow from operations would've been $110 million or over 150% of net income. More importantly, free deployable cash at the parent was $450 million versus $510 million at year end, the main driver of the difference being the funds used for the Preferred Health acquisition, net of some other ins and outs. Our normal statutory dividend processed to parent starts in second quarter.
Days in claims payable displayed in the press release exclude Private Fee-For-Service for all periods presented. The increase in DCP [days in claims payable] of 4.7 days over prior quarter is due primarily to seasonal timing, timing of Part D subsidies and a small increase in claims inventory. Debt to cap ratio now stands at 29.5% driven by the addition of Q1 earnings. We did not repay any debt in the quarter.
Turning to updated 2010 guidance, we are forecasting EPS in the range of $2.35 to $2.50. As a reminder, this includes the $0.17 of earnings generated by Private Fee in the first quarter, but does not assume any further Private Fee impact for the remainder of the year. 
In summary, we are adding our review of Q1 outperformance to the prior full year guidance, while essentially maintaining our prior aggregate view of Q2 through Q4 while recognizing some new facts we now know about.
For simplicity, I will walk through the guidance changes using the midpoint of the range for both prior and revised guidance. The midpoint of prior guidance was $2.17,and the midpoint of revised is $2.42 or an increase of $0.25. As I just explained, $0.17 of this increase was related to Private Fee, which leaves about $0.08 for our seven core businesses. Let me provide a few highlights on that.
Starting with Commercial Risk, we still expect same-store membership to be down for the year in the low single digits. When we include the addition of 100,000 Preferred Health commercial risk members, total growth will be in the range of 4.5% to 5%. While our Q1 small group sales performance was better than expected, it is still early and the macroeconomic issue still exists. That being said, we are very pleased with the same-store sales results and believe that volume will be slightly more favorable in the range than our previous expectation.
Forecasted commercial group risk MLR, including Preferred Health is expected to be in the range of 82% to 82.1/2%. This is a 25 basis point reduction from previous guidance driven largely by the benign flu season. It also incorporates our fundamental view of forward trend stable. Together we believe these two items account for about $0.08 of the increased guidance. 
For Medicare CCP, our view of guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect the Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the mid-80s. Part D has also performed consistent with our expectations so far in 2010. As a result, our annual view of this business is unchanged from prior guidance, with a membership in the 1.6 million range and a loss ratio in the mid-80s.
For Medicaid, from an earnings standpoint, our annual view of this business is unchanged from prior guidance. While we had better-expected Q1 results and we see improvement patient management, we see raised headwinds in the second half of the year. 
In our Missouri-based HealthCare USA subsidiary, which accounts for almost half our Medicaid membership, we will be receiving a rate increase of just under 1% in July, and this is around two points lower than expected. While our Medicaid team has multiple networking utilization initiatives underway to mitigate trends, we don't count things until we can physically count them. I will not be surprised given state revenue challenges of other rate actions in other states, but I have nothing definitive at this point in time.
Our guidance has been adjusted to incorporate the additional of the Southeast PA and Nebraska markets. We are underway in Southeast PA with auto-assignments beginning in April. And as Allen said, in Nebraska, the contract begins August 1, with an expectation to reach 30,000 to 40,000 members by year end. We expect a neutral impact to overall earnings in 2010 for these new Medicaid markets.
Our Fee-Based businesses will be up about $0.02 based on stronger-than-expected revenues. On SG&A, the midpoint of the 2010 guidance is $1.96 billion. The new midpoint is up about $20 million to recognize volume-related SG&A for a better Commercial membership and the addition of the Southeast PA and Nebraska Medicaid businesses. Note that at the midpoint of SG&A guidance, the percent of revenue is 17.3%, down slightly from the 17.5% previous guidance. Given we have not repurchased any shares year-to-date, we have adjusted the share count in our 2010 guidance to reflect deployment in the back half of the year. 
So let me just re-summarize those points. Private Fee Q1 earnings of $0.17 flow through for the full year. Commercial Group Risk outperformance, both our improved view of loss ratio as well as higher expected volume, drives about $0.08 of the increase. Medicare CCP and Part D are unchanged from an earnings perspective. Medicaid earnings are unchanged for the year. Q1 outperformance will be offset by lower-than-expected rate increase in Missouri. Fee-Based businesses will be up about $0.02 based on stronger-than-expected revenues. And lastly, our more conservative view of share repurchase has an impact of negative $0.02.
On free cash and capital, as stated earlier, we have $450 million of deployable cash on hand, and expect to generate over $250 million of free cash from our seven core businesses in 2010. In addition, we expect to dividend out the capital supporting the Private Fee product line, which given Q1 results, would be approximately $275 million. We will seek to partially dividend this up in late 2010, with the remainder in the first half of 2011. 
Assuming no additional deployment of cash, we could end 2010 with $700 million to $800 million of deployable capital. And adding to that, the remainder of the Private Fee dividend in 2011, we could have total deployable capital of approximately $1 billion by mid-2011. Our priorities for deployable cash are the same as always: Growing the business through acquisition, followed by opportunistic share repurchase and delevering. 
To conclude, Q1 was a strong but early result. We see tangible progress in better sales execution and in managing all of our expenses better. While we all know the challenges ahead, we continue to focus on improving our overall cost structure. Our low cost structure will be the key differentiator in succeeding in the reform world, really, as it has always been in this business. Allen, do you have anything else to add, or..."

We are a regional company or a multi-regional company. We are not national, not going to be national, and can't be. Where we have health plans, where we have HMO-type networks, our cost structure has always been competitive with the best. And let's say, competitive means within 500 basis points of the best, and that hasn't changed. I think that we have to be better at selecting maybe something -- networks that aren't as broad as they once were, and return for picking a delivery system with good outcomes and high-quality care for the members, which always mean usually a better cost structure. So I think that within the places that we do business, there will be narrower products. The one that we are working on with Via Christi, on Medicare Advantage in the Central Kansas area will be a product that fits for the Via Christi System only. They have a huge amount of resources, including 26 primary care physicians that are employees of the system. And I think that will just allow us to get better benefits, put better resources to help those physicians manage the care better. So I think that's going to happen on the Commercial side as well. Just the problem with our product is no one can afford it. And I am talking about our sector, our industry. So we're going to have to do a better job on the cost front. So I think it's going to get tougher for everybody. And if you don't have best business practices and a good balance sheet and the information and the insights it takes to manage the patients, that people are going to opt out, but we'll see. I have no evidence of that at this stage, but maybe in a quarter or two."

We'll follow our normal agenda. I'll start off by providing some brief comments. John Stelben, will provide more details on the financials and that will be followed by some time for some brief questions. My comm",2522,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll follow our normal agenda. I'll start off by providing some brief comments. John Stelben, will provide more details on the financials and that will be followed by some time for some brief questions. My comments will cover three areas this morning. The first is on Q1, then our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And finally, I'll provide some brief remarks on the post-reform future of our company.
With regard to the first quarter, this morning we announced an EPS of $0.66. And as we look beyond Q1 to the remainder of the year, we're providing full year guidance of $2.35 to $2.50 per share. Q1 was obviously a very strong start 2010 for our company. And while our management group believes that our business is improving rapidly, the strength of the quarter was a bit unexpected. 
I believe that Q1 results can best be explained with two or three comments. First and most important is the sharper focus on business fundamentals over the last 18 months. Our SG&A, our medical unit cost work toward improving our members' quality of healthcare, much better integration between our actuarial, underwriting and sales team, our government program execution and the many areas I have discussed in my prior four quarters of conference calls. Simply stated, we're executing better in the basics of our business and we will continue to do so. 
I think the second area to describe Q1 results is that we have some favorable, for lack of a better word, tailwind. There was little impact from the flu. And I think, too, while it cannot be quantified, severe weather in many of our markets undoubtedly influenced utilization to some extent. And the third factor explaining our results is a very positive reserve development.
Under the subject of quarterly highlights, I have a few comments. We closed our Preferred Health Systems acquisition in Kansas on February 1. This property has further strengthened our Midwest regional presence and will allow us to improve care for our members with a very high quality delivery system. We're working and planning on completing a proprietary Medicare Advantage product with the Via Christi Healthcare System, which we hope we'll be able to market later this year with January 1, 2011, effective dates. We believe this product will provide excellent coverage and improved care for the Kansas senior population.
On staying with quarterly highlights, we were once again awarded the contract to provide care for Medicaid members in Nebraska with an effective date of August 1. We completed a very orderly and positive Medicare Private Fee-For-Service exit. We took a number of successful steps in the last step of 2009 to neutralize the SG&A impact. We're experiencing positive reserves developments, which at a minimum will create additional statutory capital and ultimately, free cash flow. On April 1, we began enrolling Medicaid members in Pennsylvania.
Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2010, I'd like to address our core businesses. Commercial business, I believe, that you'll see a much improved membership progression during the first quarter, including the close of our strategic Preferred Health acquisitions during the first quarter. We grew commercial risk membership by 83,000 members. 
On a same-store basis, we were down approximately 20,000 members. And although we would certainly prefer to grow same-store membership and plan to do in the future, this is the best Q1 sequential result that our company has reported since Q1 of 2006. Much of this improvement is just plain better execution. I think during last year, during 2009, where there was substantial membership erosion that I've previously told people and told all of you that half of it was the economy and the diminishing size of the lack of business, but at least half of it was internal. And we have addressed the internal issues and our new business sales showed that and have exceeded plan. And the number of personnel in process of improvements that we made during 2009 are beginning to pay off in 2010.
We're still vigilant in pricing to underlying cost, our cost of goods sold, if you will. This is evidenced by our financial metrics in the press release. As all of you know, the key to long-term success in this business is managing the cost of goods sold or the medical costs along with SG&A on behalf of our employer and individual customers. While we've made improvement in patient care and underlying cost structure in the past few quarters, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do in this area and that it will remain an area of focus.
It's especially necessary have this focus as we navigate reform and prepare for the many new requirements there. 
Moving from the commercial block to Medicare, the membership in our Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care Plan reached 190,000 members, up from 186,000 at years end. This was 2% better than our flat forecast but beyond that, a very good result considering that we exit from a number of SNP [Special Needs Plans] plans and subscale markets, which totaled about 13,000 members. 
Our medical loss ratio of 85.7 was 120 basis points improvement from the full year in 2009. And while this trend is positive, it was an undoubtedly helped by a mild flu season and we recognize there's a lot of work to be done heading into the post-reform payment environment. In short, we can do better in this business and we will. 
I'm pleased to report the new initiatives are underway to improve care coordination for the chronically ill, and are on target to be continually rolled out through the balance of the year. These are initiatives that began in 2009 regarding the frail elderly and they are showing some early promise. 
As explained earlier in my comments about Via Christi, we have developed a new model of care. We believe that more innovative reimbursement arrangements that align incentives to improve patient care with better outcomes are increasingly necessary in tomorrow's environment, and a substantial amount of resources will be directed toward models in that end. 
As you all know too, I'm sure that we are preparing our bids on the Medicare front for 2011. And given the recently announced, an anticipated VAT revenue raise and the reform-related reductions that began in 2012, we must continue to intensify our focus there. We will continue to make progress on medical cost and contracting efficiencies along with other areas. These obviously include intelligent plan design, best practices for risk-adjusted revenue, SG&A improvement.
Improving the quality of care for members is basic and fundamental to all of our efforts. Overall, we're pleased with Q1 results for this business and we feel that we are doing the right things to prepare for changes in 2011 and 2012. In fact, we anticipated the revenue environment regardless of the reform movement and spent a lot of time and energy and resources working on these efforts beginning in 2009. 
With regard to Medicare Part D, we have a solid stable business. We ended the quarter at 1.6 million Part D members, on track with our guidance. Once again, we feel this was a good result because of our exit from nine auto-assigned regions. From a pharmacy cost perspective, Q1 results are in-line or slightly better than our expectations. 
Moving to Medicaid, our Medicaid business is demonstrating very significant progress both in terms of growth and better management of our members. From a growth view, we've added two new areas of business in Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Our Nebraska business, as I announced early, is scheduled to commence in August of this year and should result in 30,000 to 40,000 new members. 
As discussed in our last call, we qualified to enter southeastern Pennsylvania and began receiving auto-assign members at the beginning of this month. We are continuing our efforts to finish the medical delivery system in central PA and hope to qualify in that region in the near future. We see opportunities to service this population, and we'll continue to seek new opportunities in this space, especially given the long-term expansion of the population. 
With regard to our Fee-Based businesses, Network Rental, FEHB [Federal Employees Health Benefits] and the Workers' Compensation were performing at or better than expectations. These businesses provide predictable and consistent results. While the soft economy and the employment market has provided some headwinds for our Workers' Compensation business, our strong sales execution and SG&A control has largely offset this headwind. 
Maybe some few comments about the post-reform environment. What about the environment? Well, we understand that regulations yet to be finalized will determine much of the future, but nevertheless, the broad outlines are known and consistent with how we position our company during the past year. 
Our Commercial Group business, a $5 billion business is about evenly split with about 50% of our enrollment below 100 subscribers and about 50% over 100. With a little progress in broker cost, which needed to be addressed regardless of reform, the weighted medical loss ratio average on our book of business should be in the low 80s. Assuming a reasonable set of regulations, this positions us decently for the new rules and should allow a fair margin, and as basically so, we can find 100 basis points of SG&A from a variety of sources.
The Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care product is one that we've always believed in. If you follow our company's history back to the balanced budget in the mid-to-late '90s, a lot of people in our space abandoned this line of business, we did not. And we have always believed it's the best way to provide care for seniors, and we're dedicated to put the effort and resources to have best business practices in this line. 
And as I previously announced in several calls, we have five ongoing initiatives to improve our results in this product line. We feel like the 2011 race announced early in April are manageable for us, and we're planning for the new payment system that starts getting payees down for 2012.
With regard to post reform, we have focused on Medicaid, began putting additional resources in that in 2009 both in improving our unit cost and caring better for our members. We understand that revenue will be a challenge as states struggle with their own revenue shortfalls. That low cost, both unit and SG&A, along with better care for the member, wins. Requirements for success our skill sets that we have and that's demonstrated in our recent medical loss ratio progress. We're going to work hard to grow membership in Medicaid and this will continue to be a priority in our company.
We're well aware of many of the challenges in the post-reform environment and in short, we believe tomorrow's environment will create plenty of challenges and also opportunities. We believe that organizations that are thoughtful, nimble, creative and have the industry tools and cost structure will succeed. And we feel we're entering the reform environment as a well-diversified, resourceful, with a capable management group and that we're well prepared for the evolving landscape. But what about the tools for the future? Well, we should have about $1 billion in free cash by the middle of next year if we don't find the other opportunities like Preferred Health. 
And with regard to tools, it's our senior team. One of our most significant accomplishment over the past year has been the formulation of our senior management team, who have proven records of success and are exceedingly capable in their areas of responsibilities. A lot of these have been announced in the past, but I'll take them in a minute, I will remind you of some of the additions that we've made to our organization. 
Staying with tools for the future to low cost structure, it's important to compete in the past and it's going to be critical in the future. And where we have delivery systems, we think that our cost structure will generally be second to no one's.
A diversified, well-positioned business and the nimbleness and know-how to adapt is the fourth tool for the future. And I think that in general, that we have the tools and resources to run a better company in tomorrow's environment.
I want to stay on our management group a bit, and a few comments in their commitments to the company, I believe, is appropriate. We've had a lot of experienced individuals, all have demonstrated records of success, people have proven their skills well previously, and more importantly, during the last 15 months. In the end, it's really about the quality of your management team and our business.  
In our operations on IT area, Harv DeMovick has been with the company for many years, returned a year ago and is committed to stay with our company through 2011. Our Medicare Advantage and Part D is headed by Nancy Cocozza. She was with our company in the past, the best of what she does and is a building block that we need to do more of this business. Paul Conlin joined us this year. His responsibility  is Medicaid. He's added to our foundation for the future and has demonstrated early success both in unit cost and with new business during the last six months. Mike Bahr has been with our company for eight years and was part of our Altius and Western operation or headed that up. Mike's an underwriter and actuary, and he assumed the responsibility for all of our health plans about six months ago and is uniquely qualified to add new group and individual business at the correct cost structure and revenue. Dr. Patricia Mueller, our Senior Medical Officer, joined us last year and is leading the efforts for better patient care. And Matt Eyles is a new addition in government policy and bring insights in the policy area that our company simply hasn't had in the past. I could continue the list but my point is that the best management team is basic for tomorrow success and we've got a very solid team. And as our company has always done previously, the search for additional talent will continue. 
My own commitment is at a minimum through 2011, and I have stated earlier that the search for best people will not end, and I need to add that this will include a thorough and very thoughtful search for my successor. 
Closing thought. Well there's a lot left to play out in 2010 but our management group feels very good about the year. A lot of work to be done to prepare for 2011 and beyond, but I'm excited and positive about our progress. In my own view, there's a very high likelihood of future consolidation in our business in the not-too-distant future, and we feel very positive about our ability to participate in that consolidation process. In the end, change almost always brings opportunity. 
With that, that concludes my comments. John Stelben is going to provide a financial report and then we'll open the call for questions. John?"
27133,100327066,60681,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-30-2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As Allen said, we are pleased to report EPS for the first quarter of $0.66. This is a strong result and better than our plan for the quarter. In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance to",1899,"Good morning. As Allen said, we are pleased to report EPS for the first quarter of $0.66. This is a strong result and better than our plan for the quarter. In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance to a range of $2.35 to $2.50, up from the previous guidance range of $2.10 to $2.25. First I'm going to provide some highlights on the quarterly performance, and then turn to the increase in guidance for the full year.
At a macro level, as Allen mentioned, we had some tailwind as we look back in the quarter. First, our Medicare Advantage Private Fee product line, which we exited January 1, produced $0.17 in the quarter due primarily to prior period reserve development. While we set reserves with an expectation of favorable development, recall that we did not incorporate any Private Fee run out earnings in our previous guidance. So this $0.17 is an upside to 2010 expectations.
In our Commercial Risk business, membership was a little ahead of expectations due primarily to small group sales activity, which is ahead of Q1 2009 results. This is really the result of better sales execution, coupled with products that demonstrate better value. Our Preferred Health acquisition came on line February 1 and added a little over 100,000 Commercial Risk members. 
Premium yields are in-line with expectations and are a 5.3% over the prior year quarter. The commercial group medical loss ratio of 80.2% is slightly better than expected primarily due to lower than expected impact from flu. We previously guided to about 15 basis points of additional flu pressure on the 2010 full year group loss ratio, but it was front-end loaded in Q1 and none of it really materialized during the quarter. 
It may be fair to say weather had some impact, but that's pretty hard to quantify and it would be prudent to assume that elective procedures will get rescheduled at some future point. COBRA membership levels ticked up slightly to 1.8% from about 1.7% of total Commercial Group membership, which is consistent with our expectation that COBRA would climb to 2% during 2010. 
Our view of fundamental trend has continued stability in the 8.5% to 9% range. While our Q1 result was slightly better than expected, one quarter does not make a trend. And while we are implementing unit cost and utilization improvement initiatives across all our businesses, it is still too early to count the impact as I think about 2010. Our Preferred Health acquisition, as Allen mentioned, is performing as expected both operationally and financially. 
Moving on to Medicare, the coordinated care results in Q1 were in line with our expectations for the quarter and the comments we made on the Q4 '09 earnings call. Membership is now slightly above where we ended '09, which is a very positive result given the 13,000 member blocks of business we exited coming into the year. 
Medicare Part D results as well were in-line with our plan and I'd like to provide a little more perspective on the loss ratio. You will note in the last couple of years that Q1 loss ratios were generally in the range of 100%, higher than the 95.3% we reported this quarter.
In 2010, we introduced deductibles on about 70% of the members who had no deductible in 2009. The introduction of deductibles will alter the historical slope of earnings but not the annual result. Given all the changes we made coming into 2010 with pricing and product design, we are very pleased with our membership results and are on track for our full year Part D loss ratio guidance of mid-80s.
Medicaid produced a very good Q1 loss ratio of 84% due to better management of patient care, especially in patient care, and lower than expected flu. This result is several hundred basis points better than the annual loss ratio guidance. While we are very pleased with the results and the tangible progress we are making in patient management, we do see some ray [ph](25:00) headwind that I will address later in my comments on guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. Total cash and investments stand at $3.85 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position of $66 million at March 31, virtually unchanged from year end. GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was a negative $187 million. This result includes a $297 million outflow for the run out of the Private Fee product line. As a reminder, we have cash and short-term liquid securities in our statutory entities, matching the Private Fee claims liability.
Adjusting for the Private Fee run out in Q1, adjusted cash flow from operations would've been $110 million or over 150% of net income. More importantly, free deployable cash at the parent was $450 million versus $510 million at year end, the main driver of the difference being the funds used for the Preferred Health acquisition, net of some other ins and outs. Our normal statutory dividend processed to parent starts in second quarter.
Days in claims payable displayed in the press release exclude Private Fee-For-Service for all periods presented. The increase in DCP [days in claims payable] of 4.7 days over prior quarter is due primarily to seasonal timing, timing of Part D subsidies and a small increase in claims inventory. Debt to cap ratio now stands at 29.5% driven by the addition of Q1 earnings. We did not repay any debt in the quarter.
Turning to updated 2010 guidance, we are forecasting EPS in the range of $2.35 to $2.50. As a reminder, this includes the $0.17 of earnings generated by Private Fee in the first quarter, but does not assume any further Private Fee impact for the remainder of the year. 
In summary, we are adding our review of Q1 outperformance to the prior full year guidance, while essentially maintaining our prior aggregate view of Q2 through Q4 while recognizing some new facts we now know about.
For simplicity, I will walk through the guidance changes using the midpoint of the range for both prior and revised guidance. The midpoint of prior guidance was $2.17,and the midpoint of revised is $2.42 or an increase of $0.25. As I just explained, $0.17 of this increase was related to Private Fee, which leaves about $0.08 for our seven core businesses. Let me provide a few highlights on that.
Starting with Commercial Risk, we still expect same-store membership to be down for the year in the low single digits. When we include the addition of 100,000 Preferred Health commercial risk members, total growth will be in the range of 4.5% to 5%. While our Q1 small group sales performance was better than expected, it is still early and the macroeconomic issue still exists. That being said, we are very pleased with the same-store sales results and believe that volume will be slightly more favorable in the range than our previous expectation.
Forecasted commercial group risk MLR, including Preferred Health is expected to be in the range of 82% to 82.1/2%. This is a 25 basis point reduction from previous guidance driven largely by the benign flu season. It also incorporates our fundamental view of forward trend stable. Together we believe these two items account for about $0.08 of the increased guidance. 
For Medicare CCP, our view of guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect the Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the mid-80s. Part D has also performed consistent with our expectations so far in 2010. As a result, our annual view of this business is unchanged from prior guidance, with a membership in the 1.6 million range and a loss ratio in the mid-80s.
For Medicaid, from an earnings standpoint, our annual view of this business is unchanged from prior guidance. While we had better-expected Q1 results and we see improvement patient management, we see raised headwinds in the second half of the year. 
In our Missouri-based HealthCare USA subsidiary, which accounts for almost half our Medicaid membership, we will be receiving a rate increase of just under 1% in July, and this is around two points lower than expected. While our Medicaid team has multiple networking utilization initiatives underway to mitigate trends, we don't count things until we can physically count them. I will not be surprised given state revenue challenges of other rate actions in other states, but I have nothing definitive at this point in time.
Our guidance has been adjusted to incorporate the addition of the Southeast PA and Nebraska markets. We are underway in Southeast PA with auto-assignments beginning in April. And as Allen said, in Nebraska, the contract begins August 1, with an expectation to reach 30,000 to 40,000 members by year end. We expect a neutral impact to overall earnings in 2010 for these new Medicaid markets.
Our Fee-Based businesses will be up about $0.02 based on stronger-than-expected revenues. On SG&A, the midpoint of the 2010 guidance is $1.96 billion. The new midpoint is up about $20 million to recognize volume-related SG&A for a better Commercial membership and the addition of the Southeast PA and Nebraska Medicaid businesses. Note that at the midpoint of SG&A guidance, the percent of revenue is 17.3%, down slightly from the 17.5% previous guidance. Given we have not repurchased any shares year-to-date, we have adjusted the share count in our 2010 guidance to reflect deployment in the back half of the year. 
So let me just re-summarize those points. Private Fee Q1 earnings of $0.17 flow through for the full year. Commercial Group Risk outperformance, both our improved view of loss ratio as well as higher expected volume, drives about $0.08 of the increase. Medicare CCP and Part D are unchanged from an earnings perspective. Medicaid earnings are unchanged for the year. Q1 outperformance will be offset by lower-than-expected rate increase in Missouri. Fee-Based businesses will be up about $0.02 based on stronger-than-expected revenues. And lastly, our more conservative view of share repurchase has an impact of negative $0.02.
On free cash and capital, as stated earlier, we have $450 million of deployable cash on hand, and expect to generate over $250 million of free cash from our seven core businesses in 2010. In addition, we expect to dividend out the capital supporting the Private Fee product line, which given Q1 results, would be approximately $275 million. We will seek to partially dividend this up in late 2010, with the remainder in the first half of 2011. 
Assuming no additional deployment of cash, we could end 2010 with $700 million to $800 million of deployable capital. And adding to that the remainder of the Private Fee dividend in 2011, we could have total deployable capital of approximately $1 billion by mid-2011. Our priorities for deployable cash are the same as always: Growing the business through acquisition, followed by opportunistic share repurchase and delevering. 
To conclude, Q1 was a strong but early result. We see tangible progress in better sales execution and in managing all of our expenses better. While we all know the challenges ahead, we continue to focus on improving our overall cost structure. Our low cost structure will be the key differentiator in succeeding in the reform world, really, as it has always been in this business. Allen, do you have anything else to add, or..."

Our legal and regulatory people are reviewing now whether or not for the remainder of the year that we would want to go to a third party to also review the rescissions. But we have fairly arduous process within our company. 100% of rescissions go to a legal team. They review the facts, the information, and so -- we don't do that many right now, only in extreme cases of beyond misrepresentation of fraud, so not a huge impact. And the question has always been, with anything less than universal coverage, what kind of product that you're going to be able to have if you can't do any underwriting, and we just have to wait and see what the details and see where are the niches there. If we can't do that in a business, likely we won't do the product. But I think a lot of what's coming is going to come out in the Regs and may vary by state, and the devil is going to be in the details.

We are a regional company or a multi-regional company. We are not national, not going to be national, and can't be. Where we have health plans, where we have HMO-type networks, our cost structure has always been competitive with the best. And let's say, competitive means within 500 basis points of the best, and that hasn't changed. I think that we have to be better at selecting maybe something -- networks that aren't as broad as they once were, and return for picking a delivery system with good outcomes and high-quality care for the members, which always mean usually a better cost structure. So I think that within the places that we do business, there will be narrower products. The one that we are working on with Via Christi, on Medicare Advantage in the Central Kansas area will be a product that fits for the Via Christi System only. They have a huge amount of resources, including 26 primary care physicians that are employees of the system. And I think that will just allow us to get better benefits, put better resources to help those physicians manage the care better. So I think that's going to happen on the Commercial side as well. Just the problem with our product is no one can afford it. And I am talking about our sector, our industry. So we're going to have to do a better job on the cost front. So I think it's going to get tougher for everybody. And if you don't have best business practices and a good balance sheet and the information and the insights it takes to manage the patients, that people are going to opt out, but we'll see.

As you saw in our press release, the Company’s core operations produced another very strong quarter.

As you saw in our press release, the Company’s core operations produced another very strong quarter. My comments today will center around what I will call the adjusted results, excluding the one-time litigation charge that we communicated to you on our July 2 press release.
We are still working hard and pursuing all avenues of appeal for the Louisiana court decision, which we believe is not supported by either the law or the facts, and you should refer to our SEC disclosures for the background on this case.
Importantly, the fundamentals of our business are very, very strong. We’ve had sharper focus over the past 18 months and the fruits of our labor have certainly been evident during the past couple of quarters.
These strong results are Companywide across our seven core businesses, and I’ll cover that in a minute. I believe we can best explain the extraordinarily strong results for the last six months in three ways.
First and most important is our focus on making our seven businesses better over the last 18 months. The last few quarters for our business were essentially better in most every way; sales, SG&A, unit cost, patient management, and all the fundamental building blocks that make a good business.
The second piece of the description is the positive reserve run-out in our Private Fee-for-Service business. It’s not every day that we close down a $3 billion block of business and when we did so, we wanted to make certain that our reserve was adequate. The result of making certain left us with a significant prior-period positive development.
Third way to explain this is medical utilization, which appears to be favorable across most, if not all, of our markets. We’ve analyzed this carefully and have some theories, but to be honest, we simply do not know why this is occurring. Some of the decreased utilization can be attributed to our focus on taking better care of our members but certainly not all of it. Unfortunately, I don’t know what the last half of this year will bring on this subject.
My comments will cover the quarter and our businesses and then I’ll provide some perspective on the remainder of 2010 and positioning for the future as we prepare for Phase I of health care reform.
In Q2, the adjusted earnings of our businesses, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.19 per diluted share and $1.01 per share when you exclude the Private Fee-For-Service contribution. This is an outstanding result and it is typical. It’s a product of many factors including medical cost management, SG&A focus and profitable growth.
Last quarter, I spoke about my satisfaction with the performance of the management team on executing and delivering the basics of the business and that certainly continued into this quarter.
More importantly, I expect this focus and execution to continue prospectively. Overall, all of our seven core businesses are performing at or ahead of plan. As you can see in press release, we experienced sequential organic growth in all of our core businesses. Our Fee-For-Service business grew as well with the exception of the fee-based business which was stable.
Turning to commercial risk, which is our largest business at about $5.4 billion in revenue. In Q2, we posted organic growth in the group risk business for the first time since Q4 2007. Our total commercial risk business grew 21,000 members or 1.4% sequentially.
As you may recall, we worked in 2009 to get the right managers in the right position. On important example was the appointment of a long-term employee Mike Bahr as the single leader and Executive Vice President of our Commercial Health business. In addition, we made the necessary internal process improvements and have much better integration and coordination between actuarial, underwriting and sales as entered into 2010.
As you would expect, we’ve continued our relentless focus on a low cost structure to provide our customers with the best possible value proposition. Overall, on all metrics, our commercial risk business produced an outstanding result for the quarter.
Story is similar in Medicaid and Medicare, important businesses and as a part of our diversified portfolio as we look to the future. Some comments on Medicaid. Our Medicaid leadership put in place less than a year ago, has implemented a more thoughtful and effective cost structure and care management mindset which is absolutely critical in a current rate and state legit environment and certainly necessary to provide our state customers the cost and care management capabilities to produce the results they are seeking.
Our medical loss ratio has certainly outperformed than the past two quarters. As we look ahead, we are certainly a little more cautious here as the states are resting the budgetary pressure but that does not diminish how pleased we are with our internal accomplishments.
Despite the state-by-state challenges that are well known today, there is certainly a significantly longer term penetration opportunity, particularly for serving those segments of the population that are most in need of care management services.
We believe that opportunities exist for Coventry to provide state superior value proposition and we will continue to seek new opportunities in the Medicaid space. Along those lines, while we’re better managing our existing business, we’ve also been working on implementing our recent new market lengths. We went live in Southeastern Pennsylvania during Q2 and at this point, we already have 5,000 members.
Nebraska will go live August 1 and appears that we have enrolled at a minimum between 35,000 and 40,000 new members.
Turning the comments to Medicare; our Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care business and our Medicare Part D business both grew sequentially and performed very well in the quarter. I recall that we have HMO and PPO network-based product serving 192,000 members across 18 markets which are aligned with our locally-based health plans.
Our Company has been in this business for well over a decade and we strongly believe that it’s the best way to care for seniors and we’re dedicated to serving this population prospectively.
As outlined on previous calls, our initiatives to improve the cost structure, care management and value equation for the federal government and for seniors are on track and should serve us well as we recognize the tightening revenue reimbursement levels.
Immediately after we closed our Preferred Health System transaction in Kansas, we began developing a new Medicare Advantage product, which will be limited to the Preferred Health System.
The design included increased incentives for preferred employed to primary care physicians so that they can spend more time and resources with these Medicare patients along with us providing more information in other resources to help better care of the members.
While the approval is currently pending with CMS, we believe that a smaller, tighter network with significantly more resource is devoted to the care and management of the senior population is a direction that we will work toward with high-quality health care systems in the future.
Turning to Part D, we are at number-four in the national market position with a little more than 1.6 million members. Part D has performed well in each year since inception in 2006 and 2010 year-to-date performance is no exception. Both, Medicare Advantage in Part D are on track to produce our targeted margins for 2010.
Our fee business through which is three core businesses are workers’ compensation service, rental network, and FEHBPs continue to produce very good results. As you can see, we ticked up the full-year management services or fee-based revenue guidance to a midpoint of $1.16 billion on the strength of the quarter.
While our fee business represents only about 10% of our companywide revenue, the margins as you might suspect are much more attractive, relative to the Company’s core risk businesses. We believe these businesses are well-positioned and it’s important to remember they are non-insurance, non-risk, unregulated sources of revenue, earnings and cash flow.
We’re able to use our core network management, cost management and operational skills to provide our customers with an excellent value proposition in these businesses. These businesses are and will be an important part of a diversified portfolio.
Turning our attention to 2010 and forward, given the results for the first two quarters and the momentum we have on profitable growth, medical cost management, and SG&A management, we are pleased to provide increased EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.05, excluding the litigation charge.
As you can see in the table in our press release, this includes $0.35 of EPS contribution from the run-out of our Private Fee-For-Service business, which we exited at the end of 2009. Our CFO, John Stelben will walk you through the guidance elements in more details, but once again, the improving performance spans all seven businesses.
This is now only been a year about improving the operations as evidenced by the first half of 2010 results. It’s been a year about investing for the future. In February 2010, we closed a transaction with Via Christi, an innovative Kansas-based health system, where we not only acquired their 120,000 member health plan, PHS, but also entered into a long-term contractual partnership.
Since we closed the transaction, we’ve had ongoing dialog in collaboration on new products and method to align incentives around outcomes in care management such as the previously mentioned Medicare product in Wichita. We think this collaboration will be the norm not the exception as we look ahead and form product, contractual and financial alliances with health care systems.
At the end of the second quarter, announced the transaction with The Sisters of Mercy, a sophisticated health system spanning multiple Midwestern states with more than acute care hospitals, over 1,000 employed physicians and 35,000 employees in total. We entered into a definitive agreement to acquire their 180,000 member health plan, Mercy Health Plans and at equal importance to expand our relationship.
I met with their Chairman and with their CEO and it’s obvious that we share a common view on the need for a closer alignments of health plans and providers as we both approach tomorrow’s arena of health care reform. We’re going through the typical regulatory approval process and expect the transaction to close in Q4.
Mercy Health Plans is diversified across markets and products and has approximately 90,000 commercial risk members, 60,000 ASO members which is largely the system employees and over 30,000 Medicare Advantage network-based members in Springfield St. Louis and Northwest Arkansas.
As we indicated in our June 30 press release, this transaction builds on our core business competencies and we look forward to expanding the relationship with The Sisters of Mercy Health System.
In addition to using our capital in the M&A area to improve our business and positioning for the future, we are in discussions across many of our markets with key providers regarding accountable care organizations, medical homes and other models that better align incentives. This is where our Health Plan business and nimbleness should service very well in the future.
We’re in the process of redesigning products and making IT investments as well as we look to the future. We continue to recruit talented executives that will lead us through the winding road ahead and seizing opportunities presented in the health care reform arena. Our businesses are very sound and well positioned. We spend every day trying to improve our cost structure to provide the best value proposition for our members and customers.
You see some of these results in the past two quarters and we believe there is more to come in the next couple of years. Looking ahead to 2014 in a state-based exchange model, our low cost structure should service well as it has over the past decade.
Clearly, many of the regulations are yet to be written and as Drew Asher, who leads our M&A and Investor Relations area of the Company if following the same and there’s a lot of wood left to chop between now and 2014. Even so, I like the portfolio of well-positioned businesses that we have and really like the nimbleness of our management team and infrastructure to cease opportunities, which will be presented.
In fact, this is not an easy business and actually I don’t know if there is such a thing, but managing the details and operational blocking and tackling while positioning the business for the future has really been the strength of this Company for most of the past 12 years. Believe we have the tools to succeed in the future, including personnel, capital, cost structure and a diversified state of well positioned businesses with an energized and thoughtful culture with the ability to adapt and execute.
Certainly, we take nothing for granted and come to work every day with the thought of improving our business and the Company will continue to operate in that way.
That concludes my comments, and our CFO, John Stelben, will now walk you through the financial details for the quarter. John?

Our GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.01, which includes the previously disclosed non-recurring charge of $1.18 that we announced on July 2. Excluding the charge, EPS was $1.19. It’s a very strong result and better t",2250,"Thanks, Allen, and good morning. Our GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.01, which includes the previously disclosed non-recurring charge of $1.18 that we announced on July 2. Excluding the charge, EPS was $1.19. It’s a very strong result and better than our plan for the quarter.
In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full-year guidance, excluding the charge, to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 from the previous guidance range communicated July 2 of $2.75 to $2.90.
With that, I’ll provide some highlights on the quarter and some details on guidance for the full year. First, our Medicare Advantage Private Fee product line, which we exited January 1, produced $0.18 in the quarter and $0.35 for the year due primarily to prior-period reserve development.
While we set reserves with an expectation of favorable development, we did not and still do not incorporate any perspective private fee run out earnings and guidance. So the Q2 $0.18 is upside to the quarter and full-year expectations compared to the guidance provided on the Q1 call.
We experienced strong performance across all our core businesses. Equally important, the performance was pretty uniform across all our health plans. Whether it was membership revenue, clinical results, or SG&A, we were able to see improvements in all of these areas, which certainly bodes well for our ability to compete in the future.
While I would like to chalk all of this up to better focus and execution, there are some industry tailwinds such as lower utilization and a muted flu season, similar to that discussed by our peers that have also contributed to performance.
The Commercial Risk business had an excellent quarter in all fronts. Commercial Risk membership grew sequentially by 21,000 or 1.4% from Q1. Small group sales were more than 20% ahead of Q2, 2009 year-to-date results. This is really a result of focused sales execution and competitive products.
Group premium yields are in line with expectations and they are up 4.7% over the prior-year quarter. The commercial group medical loss ratio of 78.3% is also better than expected. Again, while there are the aforementioned tailwinds, this is not the whole story, as it still takes disciplined execution on product design, sales, and patient management, and so on to produce this strong result. The year-to-date MLR now stands at 79.3%.
COBRA results seem to plateau and were flat to prior quarter at about 1.8% of total commercial group membership. We are updating our view of fundamental trend to a range of 8.0% to 8.5% versus our previous view of 8.5% to 9%. The change is primarily due to reduced utilization in outpatient and physician services.
Medicare CCP results in Q2 were also better than expected. Recall that we exited certain products in markets which produced a 13,000 member drag coming into the year. We had an excellent sales result thus far and made up that drag plus an extra 6,000 members.
In establishing our initial incurred estimates in Q1 2010, we made adjustments for the 2010 benefit changes, but took a prudent approach in reflecting the demographic changes for our guess of the mix impact of these market and product exits on Q1 incurred estimates.
As Q1 IBNR completed during Q2, we saw higher level of restatement. This is really a long winded way of saying that the year-to-date loss ratio of 83.5 is more indicative of the true performance of this business along with some of the real improvements we are seeing in management our patients better. We are still forecasting full year MLR results in the mid 80s, which will enable us to withstand some back half of the year seasonality.
Medicare Part D results continue to run in line with expectations and remain on track with full year guidance of 1.6 million members in the mid 80s loss ratio. As Allen said, Medicaid produced another very good quarter with a loss ratio of 84.2% and a year-to-date result of 84.1%. The story here is pretty simple. Revenue PMPMs are in line with our expectations, so this is all a medical cost management story.
We have been in this business a long time but our patient care model has never been better. This is particularly important as we open our new Nebraska and Pennsylvania markets and bring our tool box so to speak to bear in those markets.
While there will be volume opportunity in this business post-reform, you have to assume revenues will always be tight, so carefully managing cost will be a key to success.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, total cash and investments stand at $3.8 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position of $89 million at June 30, up from $66 million at March 31 and this is really primarily due to changes in treasury rates.
GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was $121 million. This result includes a $21 million outflow for the run-out of the Private-Fee product line. Adjusting for the Private-Fee run out, adjusted cash flow would have been $142 million of 94% of net income excluding the one-time charge. Remember that in Q2 we made two federal tax payments.
Year-to-date core cash flow from operations is 114% of net income, but more importantly free deployable cash at parent was $670 million versus $450 million at March 31, the main driver of the increase being receipt of dividends from our regulated subsidiaries.
Days in claims payable displayed in the press release exclude Private-Fee for all periods presented. The increase in DCP of 1.3 days of a prior quarter is due primarily to an increase in claims inventories related to the conversion of our Florida commercial business to our IDX platform at the beginning of June.
Debt-to-cap ratio now stands at 29.4%, down slightly from prior quarter and we did not repay any debt in the quarter.
Turning to 2010 guidance, we are forecasting GAAP EPS in the range of $1.72 to $1.87 including the class action charge of $1.18. Excluding the charge, guidance is in the range of $2.90 to $3.05, including $0.35 of year-to-date earnings generated by Private Fee, but again does not assume any further Private Fee earnings for the remainder of the year.
Our core view of EPS then is in the range of $2.55 to $2.70. Basically, we are adding our view of Q2 outperformance to the prior full-year guidance while adjusting for some revised use of the business in the back half of the year.
We’ve provided a table in the press release to roll forward our guidance changes. I’ll try to walk you through the table. When we announced the one-time charge in July 2, we increased our guidance, excluding the charge, to $2.75 to $2.90 from the previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.50. As outlined in the press release, we are increasing guidance, again based on June results, an additional $0.15.
Given that we did not provide the details to help you understand the July 2 guidance increase, we’ll provide details of the current guidance versus the Q1 earnings call guidance, and hopefully this will be a little simpler to track.
I’ll walk through the guidance excluding the class action charge using the mid-point of the range for both prior and revised guidance. The mid-point of guidance given on the Q1 earnings call was $2.43, which included $0.17 of Private Fee earnings. So core earnings guidance would have been $2.26. The current guidance of $2.98 less the year-to-date Private Fee of $0.35 leaves $2.63 for the core, or an increase of $0.37 versus the April guidance.
You can think of the increase in three main buckets. Commercial Risk worth about $0.27, Medicaid worth about $0.02, and SG&A worth about $0.08. So let me provide a little more detail on those.
Starting with the Commercial Risk business, given our better-than-expected results to-date and sales momentum, we now expect same-store membership to be about flat to prior year. When we include the addition of approximately 100,000 Preferred Health Commercial Risk members, total growth would be nearly 7%.
Forecasted commercial group risk MLR is now expected to be 81% plus or minus 25 basis points, down from our Q1 view of 82% to 82.5%. This is a 125 basis point reduction from the previous guidance mid-point driven by Q2 results, our more completed view of Q1 and late 2009, as well as our revised view of fundamental trend of 8 to 8.5.
Our current guidance would assume higher loss ratios in the back half of the year as compared to year-to-date Q2. We are not assuming some of the previously mentioned tailwinds continue, and remember that in the back half of the year, loss ratios are pushed higher due to the satisfaction of deductibles in the first half of the year and other seasonal factors. Again, this is $0.27 of the increase guidance.
For Medicare CCP, our view of guidance is unchanged. Continue to expect the 2010 Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the mid-80s. Medical cost trend will continue to march forward as the year progresses, while revenue yield should remain relatively flat.
So while the first-half result was a little better than we had expected, we’re still expecting a slightly higher MLR result in the back half of the year with the full year in the mid 80s.
Part D continues to perform in line with our expectation so far in 2010 and as a result, our annual view of this is unchanged from prior guidance with the membership in the 1.6 million and loss ratio in the mid 80s.
For Medicaid, our view of results for the back half of the year remain unchanged. Recall, the headwind we talked about previously in the second half of the year related to the less than expected rate increase in Missouri, which is worth about 2 points on almost half the business. While the Medicaid team continues to do an outstanding job in managing clinical care, we’ll take a prudent posture in forecasting the business for the second half and just let the Q2 outperform its role through guidance. Again, that impact is worth about $0.02.
Our guidance does include the addition of the Southeast Pennsylvania and Nebraska markets. We’ve been live in Southeast PA since April and have a little over 5,000 members. We go live in Nebraska August 1 with an expectation of 35,000 to 40,000 members by year end. We expect a neutral impact to overall earnings in 2010 for these new Medicaid markets.
On SG&A, the midpoint of the 2010 guidance range is $1.94 billion, a reduction of $20 million from the previous guidance due to better performance on reducing costs. We do expect expenses in the back half of the year to increase for normal activity such as open enrollment and also for expenses related to reform preparedness. Even with that, this is an excellent result, which is particularly critical to succeed in the health care reform environment and demonstrates Coventry’s ability to manage cost while growing the core businesses.
We’ve increased the midpoint of total revenue guidance to $260 million this year while guiding to lower SG&A. Full year SG&A guidance now sits at 17% of revenues, down 25 basis points from the prior guidance. This results in about $0.08 of improvement.
While we have not repurchased any shares year-to-date, our guidance at the high end of EPS would assume a modest amount of share repurchase. We are putting capital to use in the Preferred Health acquisition and the announced Mercy Health Plans transaction and have to take into account the uncertain resolution of the one-time charge.
So to recap the $0.37 change, $0.27 in Commercial Risk, $0.02 in Medicaid, $0.08 in SG&A, Medicare CCP Part D fee-based in all other items essentially net to zero.
As stated earlier, we have $670 million of deployable cash on hand. In addition, we expect the dividend out the capital supporting the Private Fee product which given year-to-date Q2 results would be approximately $275 million. We will seek to partially dividend this up in late ‘10 with the remainder in the first half of 2011.
We still have our sights on a total of approximately $1 billion of capital, free deployable cash by mid 2011 of which less than one-third would be used to pay for Mercy Health Plans and again the uncertain resolution of the one-time litigation charge.
Our priorities for deployable cash continues to be growing the business through acquisition followed by opportunistic share repurchase and delivering.
Really to conclude, core earnings were strong in Q2 and a continuation of what we experienced in Q1. While there are clearly some tailwinds, we can see evidence of better management of the details across all our businesses. I am particularly encouraged by the continued strength of our small group sales engine, clinical management efforts, and the results we are seeing in controlling administrative cost.
In the future we’ll have both challenges and opportunities, which are still being defined, and our comments will be limited in that regard. We believe the future success of Coventry, though, will always be determined by low cost and execution on the details as it has been in the past.
Fundamentals do matter and the takeaway for 2010 so far is that Coventry is executing better on improving its businesses, which ultimately provides a better competitive transition for the future.
We’ll open the call to questions.

Number one, we have a long-term contractual relationship, which improves our cost structure both for our existing business today, our Commercial business, our Medicaid business and our Medicare Advantage business.
Number two, we don’t think there’s enough money to deliver care like we have in the past. The BJC System in St. Louis has a cost structure that’s significantly more than other high-quality systems, and we think that our product offering in the past will be both broad, but also narrow our system with high quality care. They have a presence in south central part of Missouri, which Coventry has not typically had, helps our network, rental business in terms of our cost structure. They have a presence in Arkansas, which not unlikely that some of our customers from the aircraft industry in Kansas will be moving some operations in that direction.
Not unlike the Kansas acquisition, I think that we have to have more strategic long-term relationships originally and together with our skill set and their skill set in caring for patients, do a much better job managing the patients, caring for the patients and improving the quality of care, and we have to stop arguing over nickel, so to speak, on a purely unit cost basis.
So the Mercy system, which is just the last one on my mind, began since the 90s. It had a mission, well, before that, but certainly from the 90s, we’ve been looking for a partnership with health plan to execute on their mission to care for patients better. So, whether it’s cost structure, whether it’s plan design for the future, whether it’s care management for the patients, whether it’s a more competitive offering in terms of product and cost structure, and even with Mercy we’re third in town; the Blues are first; UnitedHealth is second or whichever we’re in.
So it helps us on all fronts. It helps earnings and helps us in offer what we think is going to be tomorrow’s product, which goes back to what I’ve been saying for the last two years. Firstly, back as the CEO, so we’re going to take better care of our members and better care means members are going to be better off and it means it’s going to be more cost effective. So it filled a lot of holes that we needed in that area.

As you saw in our press release, the company's core operations produced another very strong quarter.

As you saw in our press release, the company's core operations produced another very strong quarter. My comments today will center around what I will call the adjusted results, excluding the one-time litigation charge that we communicated to you on our July 2 press release. 
We're still working hard in pursuing all avenues of appeal for the Louisiana court decision, which we believe is not supported by either the law or the facts. And you should refer to our SEC disclosures for the background on this case. 
Importantly, the fundamentals of our business are very, very strong. We've had sharper focus over the past 18 months, and the fruits of our labor has certainly been evident during the past couple of quarters. These strong results are company-wide across our seven core businesses, and I'll cover that in a minute. 
I believe we can best explain the extraordinarily strong results for the last six months in three ways. First, and most important, is our focus on making our seven businesses better over the last 18 months. The last few quarters for our business are simply better in almost every way, sales, SG&A, unit cost, patient management and all the fundamental building blocks that make a good business. 
The second piece of the description is the positive reserve run out in our Private Fee-for-Service business. It's not everyday that we close down a $3 billion block of business, and when we did so, we wanted to make certain that our reserve was adequate. The result of making certain left us with a significant prior period positive development.
Third way to explain this is medical utilization, which appears to be favorable across most, if not all, of our markets. We've analyzed this carefully and have some theories, but to be honest, we simply do not know why this is occurring. Some of the decrease utilization can be to attributed to our focus on taking better care of our members, but certainly, not all of it. Unfortunately, I don't know what the last half of this year will bring on the subject. My comments will cover the quarter and our businesses, and then I will provide some perspective on the remainder of 2010 and positioning for the future as we prepare for Phase 1 of healthcare reform. 
In Q2, the adjusted earnings of our businesses, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.19 per diluted share and $1.01 per share when you exclude the Private Fee-for-Service contribution. This is an outstanding result, and as typical, it's a product of many factors including medical cost management, SG&A focus and profitable growth. 
Last quarter, I spoke about my satisfaction with the performance of the management team on executing and delivering the basics of the business, and that certainly continued into this quarter. And more importantly, I expect this focus and execution to continue prospectively. Overall, all of our seven core business are performing at or ahead of plan. And as you can see in our press release, we experienced sequential organic growth in all of our core businesses. Our Fee-for-Service business grew as well, with the exception of the FEHBA business which was stable.
Turning to Commercial Risk, which is our largest business at about $5.4 billion in revenue, in Q2, we posted organic growth in the Group Risk business for the first time since Q4 2007. Our total Commercial Risk business grew 21,000 members or 1.4% sequentially. As you may recall, we worked in 2009 to get the right managers in the right position. One important example was the appointment of a long-term employee, Mike Bahr, as the single leader and Executive Vice President of our Commercial Health business. 
In addition, we made the necessary internal process improvements and have much better integration and coordination between actuarial, underwriting and sales as we entered into 2010. And as you would expect, we've continued our relentless focus on a low-cost structure to provide our customers with the best possible value proposition. Overall, on all metrics, our Commercial Risk business produced an outstanding result for the quarter.
The story is similar in Medicaid and Medicare, important businesses, and is a part of our diversified portfolio as we look to the future. Some comments on Medicaid. Our Medicaid leadership put in place less than a year ago has implemented a more thoughtful and effective cost structure and care management mindset, which is absolutely critical in the current rate and state budget environment, and certainly necessary to provide our state customers the cost and care management capabilities to produce the results they are seeking.
Our medical loss ratio has certainly outperformed in the past two quarters. As we look ahead, we're certainly a little more cautious here as the states are resting with budgetary pressure, but that does not diminish how pleased I am with our internal accomplishments.
Despite the state-by-state challenges that are well known today, there is certainly a significantly longer-term penetration opportunity, particularly for serving those segments of the population that are most in need of care management services. We believe that opportunity to exist for Coventry to provide states superior value proposition, and we will continue to seek new opportunities in the Medicaid space. 
Along those lines, while we're better managing our existing business, we've also been working on implementing our recent new market wins. We went live in Southeastern Pennsylvania during Q2, and at this point, we already have 5,000 members. Nebraska will go live August 1, and appears that we have enrolled, at a minimum, between 35,000 and 40,000 new members. 
Now turning the comments to the Medicare. Our Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care business and our Medicare Part D business both do sequentially and performed very well in the quarter. I recall that we have HMO and PPO network-based products serving 192,000 members across 18 markets, that which are aligned with our locally-based health plans.
Our company's been in this business for well over a decade, and we strongly believe that it's the best way to care for seniors, and we're dedicated to serving this population prospectively. As outlined in previous calls, our initiatives to improve the cost structure, care management and value equation for the Federal government and for seniors are on track and should serve us well as we recognize the tightening revenue reimbursement levels. 
Immediately after we closed our Preferred Health System transaction in Kansas, we began developing a new Medicare Advantage product which will be limited to the Preferred Health System. The design included increased incentives for preferred employed primary care physicians, so they can spend more time in resources with these Medicare patients, along with us providing more information and other resources to help better care for the members. While the approval is currently pending with CMS, we believe that a smaller, tighter network with significantly more resources devoted to care and management of the senior population is the direction that we will work toward with high-quality healthcare systems in the future.
Turning to Part D. We are number four in the national market position with a little more than 1.6 million members. Part D has performed well in each year since inception in 2006, and 2010 year-to-date performance is no exception. Both Medicare Advantage and Part D are on track to produce our targeted margins for 2010.
Our Fee business, to which is three core businesses, our Workers Compensation Service, Rental Network and FEHBA continued to produce very good results. As you can see, we ticked up the full year management services or fee-based revenue guidance to a midpoint of $1.6 billion on the strength of the quarter. And while our Fee business represent only about 10% of our company-wide revenue, the margins, as you might suspect, are much more attractive relative to the company's core Risk businesses. 
We believe these businesses are well-positioned. And it's important to remember, they are non-insurance, non-risk unregulated sources of revenue, earnings and cash flow. We're able to use our core network management, cost management and operational skills to provide our customers with an excellent value proposition in these businesses. These businesses are and will be an important part of a diversified portfolio.
Turning your attention to 2010 and forward. Given the results for the first two quarters and the momentum we have on profitable growth, medical cost management and SG&A management, we're pleased to provide increased EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 excluding the litigation charge. And as you can see in the table in our press release, this includes $0.35 of EPS contribution from the run out of our Private Fee-for-Service business which we exited at the end of 2009. Our CFO, John Stelben, will walk you through the guidance elements in more details, but once again, the improving performance stands all seven businesses.
This has not only been a year about improving the operations, as evidenced by the first half of 2010 results, it's been a year about investing for the future. In February 2010, we closed a transaction with Via Christi, an innovative Kansas-based health system, where we not only acquired 120,000 member health plan PHS, but also entered into a long-term contractual partnership. 
Since we closed the transaction, we've had ongoing dialogue in collaboration of new products and method to align incentives around outcomes and care management, such as the previously mentioned Medicare product in Wichita. We think this collaboration will be the norm, not the exception, as we look ahead and form product, contractual and financial alliances with the healthcare systems. 
At the end of the second quarter, we announced the transaction with the Sisters of Mercy, a sophisticated health system spanning multiple Midwestern states with more than 20 acute care hospitals, over 1,000 employed physicians and 35,000 employees in total. 
We entered into a definite agreement to acquire their 180,000-member health plan, Mercy Health Plans, at an equal importance to expand our relationship. I have met with their Chairman and with their CEO, and it's obvious that we share a common view on the need for closer alignments of health plans and providers as we both approach tomorrow's arena of healthcare reform.  We're going through the typical regulatory approval process and expect the transaction to close in Q4. 
Mercy Health Plan is diversified across markets and products, and has approximately 90,000 commercial risk members, 60,000 ASO members, which is largely the system employees, and over 30,000 Medicare Advantage network-based members in Springfield, St. Louis and Northwest Arkansas. As we indicated in our June 30 press release, this transaction builds on our core business and competencies, and we look forward to the expanding the relationship with the Sisters of Mercy Health System. 
In addition to use of our capital in the M&A area to improve our business and positioning for the future, we are in discussions across many of our markets with key providers regarding accountable care organizations, medical homes and other models that better in-line incentives. This is where our Health Plan business and nimbleness should serve us very well in the future.
We're in the process of redesigning products and making IT investments as well, as we look to the future. We continue to recruit talented executives that will lead us to the winding road ahead and seizing opportunities presented in the health care reform arena. Our businesses are very sound and well-positioned. We spend every day trying to improve our cost structure, to provide the best value proposition for our members and customers. 
You see some of these results in the past two quarters, and we believe there's more to come in the next couple of years. Looking ahead to 2014, in a state-based exchange model, our low cost structures should serve us well as it has over the past decade. Clearly, many of the regulations are yet to be written. And as Drew Asher, who leads our M&A and Investor Relations area of the company's fond of saying, ""Allen, there's a lot of wood left to chop between now and 2014."" 
Even so, I'd like the portfolio of well-positioned businesses that we have, and I really like the nimbleness of our management team and in their structure to seize opportunities which will be presented. In fact, this is not an easy business and actually, I don't know if there's such a thing. But managing the details and operational blocking and tackling while positioning the business for the future really been the strength of this company for most of the past 12 years. Believe we have the tools to succeed in the future including personnel, capital, cost structure and a diversified stead of well-positioned businesses with an energized and thoughtful culture, with the ability to adapt and execute.
Certainly, we take nothing for granted and they come to work everyday with the thought of improving our business, and the company will continue to operate in that way. 
That concludes my comments, and our CFO, John Stelben, will now walk you through the financial details for the quarter. John?"

Our GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.01 which includes the previously disclosed non-recurring charge of $1.18 that we announced on July 2. Excluding the charge EPS of $1.19, it's a very strong result and better than our p",2242,"Thanks, Allen, good morning. Our GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.01 which includes the previously disclosed non-recurring charge of $1.18 that we announced on July 2. Excluding the charge EPS of $1.19, it's a very strong result and better than our plan for the quarter. In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance, excluding the charge, to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 from the previous guidance range communicated July 2 of $2.75 to $2.90. 
With that I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and some details on guidance for the full year. First, our Medicare Advantage Private Fee product line, which we exited January 1, produced $0.18 in the quarter and $0.35 for the year due primarily to prior period reserve development. While we set reserves with an expectation of favorable development, we did not and still do not incorporate any prospective Private Free run out earnings in guidance. So the Q2 $0.18 is upside to the quarter and full year expectations compared to the guidance provided on the Q1 call.
We experienced strong performance across all our core businesses. Equally important, the performance was pretty uniform across all our health plans. Whether it was membership, revenue, clinical results or SG&A, we were able to see improvement in all of these areas, which certainly bodes well for our ability to compete in the future. While I would like to chalk all of this up to better focus and execution, there are some industry tailwinds such as lower utilization and a muted flu season similar to that discussed by our peers that have also contributed to performance.
The Commercial Risk business had an excellent quarter on all fronts. Commercial Risk membership grew sequentially by 21,000 or 1.4% from Q1. Small group sales are more than 20% ahead of Q2 2009 year-to-date results. This is really a result of focused sales execution and competitive products. Group premium yields are in-line with expectations and are up 4.7% over the prior year quarter. 
The Commercial Group medical loss ratio of 78.3% is also better than expected. Again, while there are the aforementioned tailwinds, this is not the whole story, as it still takes disciplined execution on product design, sales, patient management and so on to produce this strong result. The year-to-date MLR now stands at 79.3%. COBRA results seem to plateau and were flat to prior quarter at about 1.8% of total Commercial Group membership. 
We are updating our view of fundamental trend to a range of 8.0% to 8.5% versus our previous yield of 8.5% to 9%. The change is primarily due to reduced utilization in outpatient and physician services.
Medicare CCP results in Q2 were also better-than-expected. Recall that we exited certain products and markets which produced a 13,000 member drag coming into the year. We have had an excellent sales result thus far, and made up that drag plus an extra 6,000 members. In establishing our initial incurred estimates in Q1 2010, we made adjustments for the 2010 benefit changes, but took a prudent approach in reflecting the demographic changes for our guess of the mixed impact of these market and product exits on Q1 incurred estimates.
As Q1 IBNR completed during Q2, we saw higher level of restatement. This is a really long-winded way of saying that the year-to-date loss ratio of 83.5% is more indicative of the true performance of this business, along with some of the real improvements we're seeing in managing our patients better. We are still forecasting full year MLR results in the mid-80s, which will enable us to withstand some back half of the year seasonality. Medicare Part D results continue to run in-line with expectations, and remain on track with full year guidance of 1.6 million members in the mid-80s loss ratio. 
As Allen said, Medicaid produced another very good quarter with a loss ratio of 84.2% and a year-to-date results of 84.1%. The story here is pretty simple. Revenue PMPMs are in line with our expectations, so this is all a medical cost management story. We have been in this business a long time, but our patient care model has never been better. This is particularly important as we open our new Nebraska and Pennsylvania markets and bring our toolbox, so to speak, to bear in those markets.  While there will be volume opportunity in this business post reform, you have to assume revenues will always be tight, so carefully managing costs will be a key to success.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, total cash and investments stand at $3.8 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position of $89 million at June 30, up from $66 million at March 31, and this is really primarily due to changes in treasury rates. 
GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was $121 million. This results include the $21 million outflow for the run out of the Private Fee product line. Adjusting for the Private Fee run out, adjusted cash flow would have been $142 million or 94% of net income excluding the one-time charge.  Remember that in Q2, we made two Federal tax payments. 
Year-to-date core cash flow from operations is 114% of net income, but more importantly, free deployable cash at parent was $670 million versus $450 million at March 31. The main driver of the increase being receipts of dividends from our regulated subsidiaries.
Days in Claims Payable displayed in the press release exclude Private Fee for all periods presented. The increase in DCP of 1.3 days over prior quarter is due primarily to an increase in claims inventories related to the conversion of our Florida Commercial business to our IDX platform at the beginning of June. Debt-to-cap ratio now stands at 29.4%, down slightly from prior quarter, and we did not repay any debt in the quarter. 
Turning to 2010 guidance, we are forecasting GAAP EPS in the range of $1.72 to $1.87, including the class-action charge of $1.18. Excluding the charge, guidance is in the range of $2.90 to $3.05, including $0.35 of year-to-date earnings generated by Private Fee, but again, does not assume any further Private Fee earnings for the remainder of the year. Our core view of EPS then is in the range of $2.55 to $2.70. Basically, we're adding our view of Q2 outperformance to the prior full year guidance while adjusting for some revised use of the business in the back half of the year.
We provided a table in the press release to roll forward our guidance changes. I'll try to walk you through the table. When we announced the one-time charge in July 2, we increased our guidance, excluding the charge, to $2.75 to $2.90 from the previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.50. As outlined in the press release, we're increasing guidance again based on June results an additional $0.15.
Given that we do not provide the details to help you understand the July 2 guidance increase, we'll provide details of the current guidance versus the Q1 earnings call guidance, and hopefully, this will be a little simpler to track. I will walk through the guidance excluding the class-action charge using the midpoint of the range for both prior and revised guidance. The midpoint of guidance given on the Q1 earnings call was $2.43, which included $0.17 of Private Fee earnings, so core earnings guidance would have been $2.26. The current guidance of $2.98, less the year-to-date Private Fee of $0.35, leaves $2.63 for the core or an increase of $0.37 versus the April guidance. You can think of the increase in three main buckets: Commercial Risk worth about $0.27, Medicaid worth about $0.02 and SG&A worth about $0.08. So let me provide a little more detail on those. 
Starting with the Commercial Risk business, given our better than expected results to date and sales momentum, we now expect same-store membership to be about flat to prior year. When we include the addition of approximately 100,000 Preferred Health Commercial Risk members, total growth would be nearly 7%. Forecasted Commercial Group Risk MLRs are now expected to be 81% plus or minus 25 basis points, down from our Q1 view of 82% to 82.5%. This is 125 basis point reduction from the previous guidance midpoint driven by Q2 results, our more completed view of Q1 in late 2009, as well as our revised yield fundamental trend of 8% to 8.5%. Our current guidance would assume higher loss ratios in the back half of the year as compared to year-to-date Q2. We are not assuming some of the previously mentioned tailwinds continue. And remember that in the back half of the year, loss ratios are pushed higher due to the satisfaction of deductibles in the first half of the year and other seasonal factors. Again, this is $0.27 of the increased guidance.
For Medicare CCP, our view of guidance has unchanged. Continue to expect the 2010 Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the mid-80s. Medical cost trend will continue to march forward as the year progresses while revenue yields should remain relatively flat. So while the first half result was a little better than we had expected, we're still expecting a slightly higher MLR result in the back half of the year, with the full year in the mid-80s.
Part D continues to perform in-line with our expectations so far in 2010, and as a result, our annual view of this has unchanged from prior guidance, with membership in the 1.6 million range and a loss ratio in the mid-80s.
For Medicaid, our view of results for the back half of the year remained unchanged. Recall, the headwind we talked about previously in the second half of the year related to the less than expected rate increase in Missouri which is worth about two points or almost half of the business. While the Medicaid team continues to do an outstanding job in managing clinical care, we'll take a prudent posture in forecasting the business for the second half and just let the Q2 outperformance roll through guidance. Again, that impact is worth about $0.02.
Our guidance does include the addition of the Southeast Pennsylvania and Nebraska markets. We've been live in Southeast PA since April and have a little over 5,000 members. We go live in Nebraska August 1, with an expectation of 35,000 to 40,000 members by the year. We expect a neutral impact to overall earnings in 2010 for these new Medicaid markets.
On SG&A, the midpoint of the 2010 guidance range is $1.94 billion, a reduction of $20 million from the previous guidance due to better performance on reducing costs. We do expect expenses in the back half of the year to increase for normal activities such as open enrollment and also for expenses related to reform preparedness. 
Even with that, this is an excellent result which is particularly critical to succeed in the health care reform environment, and demonstrates Coventry's ability to manage costs while growing the core businesses. We've increased the midpoint of total revenue guidance $260 million this year while guiding to lower SG&A. Full year SG&A guidance now sits at 17% of revenues, down 25 basis points from the prior guidance. This results in about $0.08 of improvement.
While we have not repurchased any shares year-to-date, our guidance at the high end of EPS would assume a modest amount of share repurchase. We are putting capital to use in the Preferred Health acquisition and the announced Mercy Health Plans transaction and have to take into account the uncertain resolution of the one-time charge. 
So to recap the $0.37 change, $0.27 in Commercial Risk, $0.02 in Medicaid, $0.08 in SG&A, Medicare CCP Part D fee-based and all other items essentially net to zero.
As stated earlier, we have $670 million of deployable cash on hand. In addition, we expect to dividend out the capital supporting the Private Fee product, which, given year-to-date Q2 results would be approximately $275 million. We will seek to partially dividend this up in late '10 with the remainder in the first half of 2011. 
We still have our sights on a total of approximately $1 billion of capital, free deployable cash by mid-2011, of which less than 1/3 would be used to pay for Mercy Health Plans, and again, the uncertain resolution of the one-time litigation charge.  Our priorities for deployable cash continued to be growing the business through acquisition, followed by opportunistic share repurchase and delevering.
Really, to conclude, core earnings were strong in Q2 and a continuation of what we experienced in Q1. While there are clearly some tailwinds, we can see evidence of better management of the details across all our businesses. I am particularly encouraged by the continued strength of our small group sales engine, clinical management efforts and the results we're seeing in controlling administrative costs.
The future will have both challenges and opportunities, which are still being defined, and our comments will be limited in that regard. We believe the future success of Coventry though, will always be determined by low cost and execution on the details as it has been in the past. Fundamentals do matter, and the take away for 2010 so far is that Coventry is executing better on improving its businesses, which ultimately provides a better competitive foundation for the future.
We'll open the call to questions."

Number one, we have a long-term contractual relationship, which improves our cost structure both for our existing business today, our Commercial business, our Medicaid business and our Medicare Advantage business. Number two, we don't think there's enough money to deliver care like we have in the past. The BJC [BJC HealthCare] system in St. Louis has a cost structure that's significantly more than other high-quality systems. And we think that our product offering in the past will be both broad, but also a narrower system with high-quality care. They have a presence in South Central part of Missouri, which Coventry has not typically had. It helps our Network Rental business in terms of our cost structure. They have a presence in Arkansas, which not unlikely that some of the aircraft of our customers from the aircraft industry in Kansas will be moving some operations in that direction. And we actually, not unlike the Kansas acquisition, think that we have to have more strategic long-term relationships, so we joined together with our skill set and their skill set in caring for patients, do a much better job managing the patients, caring for the patients and improving the quality of care. And that we have to stop arguing over nickel, so to speak, on a purely unit-cost basis. So the Mercy system, which is just the last one on my mind, have begun, since the 90s, had a mission before that, but certainly, from the 90s, we've been looking for a partnership with Health Plan to execute on their mission to care for patients better. And so whether its cost structure, whether its planned design for the future, whether it's care management for the patients, whether it's a more competitive offering in terms of product and cost structure -- even with Mercy, we're third in town. The Blues are first, United the second or whichever. So it helps us on all fronts. It helps earnings, it helps us in offer what we think is going to be tomorrow's product, which goes back to what I've been saying for the last two years. First week back as a CEO, we're going to take better care of our members. And better care means that members are going to be better off and it means it's going to be more cost-effective. So it fulfilled a lot of the holes that we needed in that area."

And the question then becomes in that marketplace, can we hold medical trend to 80 basis points. There's been a lot of work there and a lot of activities that I think that would mitigate a rate increase that's not consistent with trend. And exactly, Matt, whether how much we were able to absorb trend by better operations is a little bit unclear. I believe Missouri has been a really good partner of ours for a very long time, maybe 14 years or longer in the state. They have, like a lot of states, '09 over '08 a double-digit reduction in revenue. Like I say, they've been a good partner. I think that probably we got enough rate, where we got a little bit sloppy in my view in managing our own costs and managing the patients, and I think we're doing better. Exactly how much better, we're not going to be certain about. And I think it's a little bit naive and arrogant to think that we could hold trend to zero. So we're going to better than we have in the past, but it's still challenging."

27133,108966182,71000,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. As you saw in our press release, the company's core operations produced another very strong quarter. My comments today will center around what I will call the adjusted results, excludi",2173,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. As you saw in our press release, the company's core operations produced another very strong quarter. My comments today will center around what I will call the adjusted results, excluding the one-time litigation charge that we communicated to you on our July 2 press release. 
We're still working hard in pursuing all avenues of appeal for the Louisiana court decision, which we believe is not supported by either the law or the facts. And you should refer to our SEC disclosures for the background on this case. 
Importantly, the fundamentals of our business are very, very strong. We've had sharper focus over the past 18 months, and the fruits of our labor has certainly been evident during the past couple of quarters. These strong results are company-wide across our seven core businesses, and I'll cover that in a minute. 
I believe we can best explain the extraordinarily strong results for the last six months in three ways. First, and most important, is our focus on making our seven businesses better over the last 18 months. The last few quarters for our business are simply better in almost every way, sales, SG&A, unit cost, patient management and all the fundamental building blocks that make a good business. 
The second piece of the description is the positive reserve run out in our Private Fee-for-Service business. It's not everyday that we close down a $3 billion block of business, and when we did so, we wanted to make certain that our reserve was adequate. The result of making certain left us with a significant prior period positive development.
Third way to explain this is medical utilization, which appears to be favorable across most, if not all, of our markets. We've analyzed this carefully and have some theories, but to be honest, we simply do not know why this is occurring. Some of the decrease utilization can be to attributed to our focus on taking better care of our members, but certainly, not all of it. Unfortunately, I don't know what the last half of this year will bring on the subject. My comments will cover the quarter and our businesses, and then I will provide some perspective on the remainder of 2010 and positioning for the future as we prepare for Phase 1 of healthcare reform. 
In Q2, the adjusted earnings of our businesses, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.19 per diluted share and $1.01 per share when you exclude the Private Fee-for-Service contribution. This is an outstanding result, and as typical, it's a product of many factors including medical cost management, SG&A focus and profitable growth. 
Last quarter, I spoke about my satisfaction with the performance of the management team on executing and delivering the basics of the business, and that certainly continued into this quarter. And more importantly, I expect this focus and execution to continue prospectively. Overall, all of our seven core business are performing at or ahead of plan. And as you can see in our press release, we experienced sequential organic growth in all of our core businesses. Our Fee-for-Service business grew as well, with the exception of the FEHBA business which was stable.
Turning to Commercial Risk, which is our largest business at about $5.4 billion in revenue, in Q2, we posted organic growth in the Group Risk business for the first time since Q4 2007. Our total Commercial Risk business grew 21,000 members or 1.4% sequentially. As you may recall, we worked in 2009 to get the right managers in the right position. One important example was the appointment of a long-term employee, Mike Bahr, as the single leader and Executive Vice President of our Commercial Health business. 
In addition, we made the necessary internal process improvements and have much better integration and coordination between actuarial, underwriting and sales as we entered into 2010. And as you would expect, we've continued our relentless focus on a low-cost structure to provide our customers with the best possible value proposition. Overall, on all metrics, our Commercial Risk business produced an outstanding result for the quarter.
The story is similar in Medicaid and Medicare, important businesses, and is a part of our diversified portfolio as we look to the future. Some comments on Medicaid. Our Medicaid leadership put in place less than a year ago has implemented a more thoughtful and effective cost structure and care management mindset, which is absolutely critical in the current rate and state budget environment, and certainly necessary to provide our state customers the cost and care management capabilities to produce the results they are seeking.
Our medical loss ratio has certainly outperformed in the past two quarters. As we look ahead, we're certainly a little more cautious here as the states are resting with budgetary pressure, but that does not diminish how pleased I am with our internal accomplishments.
Despite the state-by-state challenges that are well known today, there is certainly a significantly longer-term penetration opportunity, particularly for serving those segments of the population that are most in need of care management services. We believe that opportunity to exist for Coventry to provide states superior value proposition, and we will continue to seek new opportunities in the Medicaid space. 
Along those lines, while we're better managing our existing business, we've also been working on implementing our recent new market wins. We went live in Southeastern Pennsylvania during Q2, and at this point, we already have 5,000 members. Nebraska will go live August 1, and appears that we have enrolled, at a minimum, between 35,000 and 40,000 new members. 
Now turning the comments to the Medicare. Our Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care business and our Medicare Part D business both do sequentially and performed very well in the quarter. I recall that we have HMO and PPO network-based products serving 192,000 members across 18 markets, that which are aligned with our locally-based health plans.
Our company's been in this business for well over a decade, and we strongly believe that it's the best way to care for seniors, and we're dedicated to serving this population prospectively. As outlined in previous calls, our initiatives to improve the cost structure, care management and value equation for the Federal government and for seniors are on track and should serve us well as we recognize the tightening revenue reimbursement levels. 
Immediately after we closed our Preferred Health System transaction in Kansas, we began developing a new Medicare Advantage product which will be limited to the Preferred Health System. The design included increased incentives for preferred employed primary care physicians, so they can spend more time in resources with these Medicare patients, along with us providing more information and other resources to help better care for the members. While the approval is currently pending with CMS, we believe that a smaller, tighter network with significantly more resources devoted to care and management of the senior population is the direction that we will work toward with high-quality healthcare systems in the future.
Turning to Part D. We are number four in the national market position with a little more than 1.6 million members. Part D has performed well in each year since inception in 2006, and 2010 year-to-date performance is no exception. Both Medicare Advantage and Part D are on track to produce our targeted margins for 2010.
Our Fee business, through which is three core businesses, our Workers Compensation Service, Rental Network and FEHBA continued to produce very good results. As you can see, we ticked up the full year management services or fee-based revenue guidance to a midpoint of $1.16 billion on the strength of the quarter. And while our Fee business represent only about 10% of our company-wide revenue, the margins, as you might suspect, are much more attractive relative to the company's core risk businesses. 
We believe these businesses are well-positioned. And it's important to remember, they are non-insurance, non-risk unregulated sources of revenue, earnings and cash flow. We're able to use our core network management, cost management and operational skills to provide our customers with an excellent value proposition in these businesses. These businesses are and will be an important part of a diversified portfolio.
Turning your attention to 2010 and forward. Given the results for the first two quarters and the momentum we have on profitable growth, medical cost management and SG&A management, we're pleased to provide increased EPS guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 excluding the litigation charge. And as you can see in the table in our press release, this includes $0.35 of EPS contribution from the run out of our Private Fee-for-Service business which we exited at the end of 2009. Our CFO, John Stelben, will walk you through the guidance elements in more details, but once again, the improving performance stands all seven businesses.
This has not only been a year about improving the operations, as evidenced by the first half of 2010 results, it's been a year about investing for the future. In February 2010, we closed a transaction with Via Christi, an innovative Kansas-based health system, where we not only acquired 120,000 member health plan PHS, but also entered into a long-term contractual partnership. 
Since we closed the transaction, we've had ongoing dialogue in collaboration on new products and method to align incentives around outcomes and care management, such as the previously mentioned Medicare product in Wichita. We think this collaboration will be the norm, not the exception, as we look ahead and form product, contractual and financial alliances with the healthcare systems. 
At the end of the second quarter, we announced the transaction with the Sisters of Mercy, a sophisticated health system spanning multiple Midwestern states with more than 20 acute care hospitals, over 1,000 employed physicians and 35,000 employees in total. 
We entered into a definite agreement to acquire their 180,000-member health plan, Mercy Health Plans, at an equal importance to expand our relationship. I've met with their Chairman and with their CEO, and it's obvious that we share a common view on the need for closer alignments of health plans and providers as we both approach tomorrow's arena of healthcare reform.  We're going through the typical regulatory approval process and expect the transaction to close in Q4. 
Mercy Health Plan is diversified across markets and products, and has approximately 90,000 commercial risk members, 60,000 ASO members, which is largely the system employees, and over 30,000 Medicare Advantage network-based members in Springfield, St. Louis and Northwest Arkansas. As we indicated in our June 30 press release, this transaction builds on our core business and competencies, and we look forward to the expanding the relationship with the Sisters of Mercy Health System. 
In addition to using our capital in the M&A area to improve our business and positioning for the future, we are in discussions across many of our markets with key providers regarding accountable care organizations, medical homes and other models that better in-line incentives. This is where our Health Plan business and nimbleness should serve us very well in the future.
We're in the process of redesigning products and making IT investments as well, as we look to the future. We continue to recruit talented executives that will lead us to the winding road ahead and seizing opportunities presented in the health care reform arena. Our businesses are very sound and well-positioned. We spend every day trying to improve our cost structure, to provide the best value proposition for our members and customers. 
You see some of these results in the past two quarters, and we believe there's more to come in the next couple of years. Looking ahead to 2014, in a state-based exchange model, our low cost structures should serve us well as it has over the past decade. Clearly, many of the regulations are yet to be written. And as Drew Asher, who leads our M&A and Investor Relations area of the company's fond of saying, ""Allen, there's a lot of wood left to chop between now and 2014."" 
Even so, I'd like the portfolio of well-positioned businesses that we have, and I really like the nimbleness of our management team and in their structure to seize opportunities which will be presented. In fact, this is not an easy business and actually, I don't know if there's such a thing. But managing the details and operational blocking and tackling while positioning the business for the future really been the strength of this company for most of the past 12 years. Believe we have the tools to succeed in the future including personnel, capital, cost structure and a diversified stead of well-positioned businesses with an energized and thoughtful culture, with the ability to adapt and execute.
Certainly, we take nothing for granted and they come to work everyday with the thought of improving our business, and the company will continue to operate in that way. 
That concludes my comments, and our CFO, John Stelben, will now walk you through the financial details for the quarter. John?"
27133,108966182,71000,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Allen, good morning. Our GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.01 which includes the previously disclosed non-recurring charge of $1.18 that we announced on July 2. Excluding the charge, EPS was $1.19. It's a very strong result and better than our",2242,"Thanks, Allen, good morning. Our GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.01 which includes the previously disclosed non-recurring charge of $1.18 that we announced on July 2. Excluding the charge, EPS was $1.19. It's a very strong result and better than our plan for the quarter. In addition, as you have seen in the earnings release, we are increasing our full year guidance, excluding the charge, to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 from the previous guidance range communicated July 2 of $2.75 to $2.90. 
With that, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and some details on guidance for the full year. First, our Medicare Advantage Private Fee product line, which we exited January 1, produced $0.18 in the quarter and $0.35 for the year due primarily to prior period reserve development. While we set reserves with an expectation of favorable development, we did not and still do not incorporate any prospective Private Free run out earnings in guidance. So the Q2 $0.18 is upside to the quarter and full year expectations compared to the guidance provided on the Q1 call.
We experienced strong performance across all our core businesses. Equally important, the performance was pretty uniform across all our health plans. Whether it was membership, revenue, clinical results or SG&A, we were able to see improvements in all of these areas, which certainly bodes well for our ability to compete in the future. While I would like to chalk all of this up to better focus and execution, there are some industry tailwinds such as lower utilization and a muted flu season similar to that discussed by our peers that have also contributed to performance.
The Commercial Risk business had an excellent quarter on all fronts. Commercial Risk membership grew sequentially by 21,000 or 1.4% from Q1. Small group sales are more than 20% ahead of Q2 2009 year-to-date results. This is really a result of focused sales execution and competitive products. Group premium yields are in-line with expectations and are up 4.7% over the prior year quarter. 
The Commercial Group medical loss ratio of 78.3% is also better than expected. Again, while there are the aforementioned tailwinds, this is not the whole story, as it still takes disciplined execution on product design, sales, patient management and so on to produce this strong result. The year-to-date MLR now stands at 79.3%. COBRA results seem to plateau and were flat to prior quarter at about 1.8% of total Commercial Group membership. 
We are updating our view of fundamental trend to a range of 8.0% to 8.5% versus our previous yield of 8.5% to 9%. The change is primarily due to reduced utilization in outpatient and physician services.
Medicare CCP results in Q2 were also better-than-expected. Recall that we exited certain products and markets which produced a 13,000 member drag coming into the year. We have had an excellent sales result thus far, and made up that drag plus an extra 6,000 members. In establishing our initial incurred estimates in Q1 2010, we made adjustments for the 2010 benefit changes, but took a prudent approach in reflecting the demographic changes for our guess of the mixed impact of these market and product exits on Q1 incurred estimates.
As Q1 IBNR completed during Q2, we saw higher level of restatement. This is a really long-winded way of saying that the year-to-date loss ratio of 83.5% is more indicative of the true performance of this business, along with some of the real improvements we're seeing in managing our patients better. We are still forecasting full year MLR results in the mid-80s, which will enable us to withstand some back half of the year seasonality. Medicare Part D results continue to run in-line with expectations, and remain on track with full year guidance of 1.6 million members in the mid-80s loss ratio. 
As Allen said, Medicaid produced another very good quarter with a loss ratio of 84.2% and a year-to-date results of 84.1%. The story here is pretty simple. Revenue PMPMs are in line with our expectations, so this is all a medical cost management story. We have been in this business a long time, but our patient care model has never been better. This is particularly important as we open our new Nebraska and Pennsylvania markets and bring our toolbox, so to speak, to bear in those markets.  While there will be volume opportunity in this business post reform, you have to assume revenues will always be tight, so carefully managing costs will be a key to success.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, total cash and investments stand at $3.8 billion. Our investment portfolio is in a net unrealized gain position of $89 million at June 30, up from $66 million at March 31, and this is really primarily due to changes in treasury rates. 
GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was $121 million. This results include the $21 million outflow for the run out of the Private Fee product line. Adjusting for the Private Fee run out, adjusted cash flow would have been $142 million or 94% of net income excluding the one-time charge.  Remember that in Q2, we made two Federal tax payments. 
Year-to-date core cash flow from operations is 114% of net income, but more importantly, free deployable cash at parent was $670 million versus $450 million at March 31. The main driver of the increase being receipts of dividends from our regulated subsidiaries.
Days in Claims Payable displayed in the press release exclude Private Fee for all periods presented. The increase in DCP of 1.3 days over prior quarter is due primarily to an increase in claims inventories related to the conversion of our Florida Commercial business to our IDX platform at the beginning of June. Debt-to-cap ratio now stands at 29.4%, down slightly from prior quarter, and we did not repay any debt in the quarter. 
Turning to 2010 guidance, we are forecasting GAAP EPS in the range of $1.72 to $1.87, including the class-action charge of $1.18. Excluding the charge, guidance is in the range of $2.90 to $3.05, including $0.35 of year-to-date earnings generated by Private Fee, but again, does not assume any further Private Fee earnings for the remainder of the year. Our core view of EPS then is in the range of $2.55 to $2.70. Basically, we're adding our view of Q2 outperformance to the prior full year guidance while adjusting for some revised use of the business in the back half of the year.
We provided a table in the press release to roll forward our guidance changes. I'll try to walk you through the table. When we announced the one-time charge in July 2, we increased our guidance, excluding the charge, to $2.75 to $2.90 from the previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.50. As outlined in the press release, we're increasing guidance again based on June results an additional $0.15.
Given that we do not provide the details to help you understand the July 2 guidance increase, we'll provide details of the current guidance versus the Q1 earnings call guidance, and hopefully, this will be a little simpler to track. I will walk through the guidance excluding the class-action charge using the midpoint of the range for both prior and revised guidance. The midpoint of guidance given on the Q1 earnings call was $2.43, which included $0.17 of Private Fee earnings, so core earnings guidance would have been $2.26. The current guidance of $2.98, less the year-to-date Private Fee of $0.35, leaves $2.63 for the core or an increase of $0.37 versus the April guidance. You can think of the increase in three main buckets: Commercial Risk worth about $0.27, Medicaid worth about $0.02 and SG&A worth about $0.08. So let me provide a little more detail on those. 
Starting with the Commercial Risk business, given our better than expected results to date and sales momentum, we now expect same-store membership to be about flat to prior year. When we include the addition of approximately 100,000 Preferred Health Commercial Risk members, total growth would be nearly 7%. Forecasted Commercial Group Risk MLRs are now expected to be 81% plus or minus 25 basis points, down from our Q1 view of 82% to 82.5%. This is 125 basis point reduction from the previous guidance midpoint driven by Q2 results, our more completed view of Q1 in late 2009, as well as our revised yield fundamental trend of 8% to 8.5%. Our current guidance would assume higher loss ratios in the back half of the year as compared to year-to-date Q2. We are not assuming some of the previously mentioned tailwinds continue. And remember that in the back half of the year, loss ratios are pushed higher due to the satisfaction of deductibles in the first half of the year and other seasonal factors. Again, this is $0.27 of the increased guidance.
For Medicare CCP, our view of guidance has unchanged. Continue to expect the 2010 Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the mid-80s. Medical cost trend will continue to march forward as the year progresses while revenue yields should remain relatively flat. So while the first half result was a little better than we had expected, we're still expecting a slightly higher MLR result in the back half of the year, with the full year in the mid-80s.
Part D continues to perform in-line with our expectations so far in 2010, and as a result, our annual view of this has unchanged from prior guidance, with membership in the 1.6 million range and a loss ratio in the mid-80s.
For Medicaid, our view of results for the back half of the year remained unchanged. Recall, the headwind we talked about previously in the second half of the year related to the less than expected rate increase in Missouri which is worth about two points or almost half of the business. While the Medicaid team continues to do an outstanding job in managing clinical care, we'll take a prudent posture in forecasting the business for the second half and just let the Q2 outperformance roll through guidance. Again, that impact is worth about $0.02.
Our guidance does include the addition of the Southeast Pennsylvania and Nebraska markets. We've been live in Southeast PA since April and have a little over 5,000 members. We go live in Nebraska August 1, with an expectation of 35,000 to 40,000 members by the year. We expect a neutral impact to overall earnings in 2010 for these new Medicaid markets.
On SG&A, the midpoint of the 2010 guidance range is $1.94 billion, a reduction of $20 million from the previous guidance due to better performance on reducing costs. We do expect expenses in the back half of the year to increase for normal activities such as open enrollment and also for expenses related to reform preparedness. 
Even with that, this is an excellent result which is particularly critical to succeed in the health care reform environment, and demonstrates Coventry's ability to manage costs while growing the core businesses. We've increased the midpoint of total revenue guidance $260 million this year while guiding to lower SG&A. Full year SG&A guidance now sits at 17% of revenues, down 25 basis points from the prior guidance. This results in about $0.08 of improvement.
While we have not repurchased any shares year-to-date, our guidance at the high end of EPS would assume a modest amount of share repurchase. We are putting capital to use in the Preferred Health acquisition and the announced Mercy Health Plans transaction and have to take into account the uncertain resolution of the one-time charge. 
So to recap the $0.37 change, $0.27 in Commercial Risk, $0.02 in Medicaid, $0.08 in SG&A, Medicare CCP Part D fee-based and all other items essentially net to zero.
As stated earlier, we have $670 million of deployable cash on hand. In addition, we expect to dividend out the capital supporting the Private Fee product, which, given year-to-date Q2 results would be approximately $275 million. We will seek to partially dividend this up in late '10 with the remainder in the first half of 2011. 
We still have our sights on a total of approximately $1 billion of capital, free deployable cash by mid-2011, of which less than 1/3 would be used to pay for Mercy Health Plans, and again, the uncertain resolution of the one-time litigation charge.  Our priorities for deployable cash continued to be growing the business through acquisition, followed by opportunistic share repurchase and delevering.
Really, to conclude, core earnings were strong in Q2 and a continuation of what we experienced in Q1. While there are clearly some tailwinds, we can see evidence of better management of the details across all our businesses. I am particularly encouraged by the continued strength of our small group sales engine, clinical management efforts and the results we're seeing in controlling administrative costs.
The future will have both challenges and opportunities, which are still being defined, and our comments will be limited in that regard. We believe the future success of Coventry though, will always be determined by low cost and execution on the details as it has been in the past. Fundamentals do matter, and the take away for 2010 so far is that Coventry is executing better on improving its businesses, which ultimately provides a better competitive foundation for the future.
We'll open the call to questions."

Number one, we have a long-term contractual relationship, which improves our cost structure both for our existing business today, our Commercial business, our Medicaid business and our Medicare Advantage business. Number two, we don't think there's enough money to deliver care like we have in the past. The BJC [BJC HealthCare] system in St. Louis has a cost structure that's significantly more than other high-quality systems. And we think that our product offering in the past will be both broad, but also a narrower system with high-quality care. They have a presence in South Central part of Missouri, which Coventry has not typically had. It helps our Network Rental business in terms of our cost structure. They have a presence in Arkansas, which not unlikely that some of the aircraft of our customers from the aircraft industry in Kansas will be moving some operations in that direction. And we actually, not unlike the Kansas acquisition, think that we have to have more strategic long-term relationships, so we joined together with our skill set and their skill set in caring for patients, do a much better job managing the patients, caring for the patients and improving the quality of care. And that we have to stop arguing over nickel, so to speak, on a purely unit-cost basis. So the Mercy system, which is just the last one on my mind, have begun, since the 90s, had a mission before that, but certainly, from the 90s, we've been looking for a partnership with Health Plan to execute on their mission to care for patients better. And so whether its cost structure, whether its planned design for the future, whether it's care management for the patients, whether it's a more competitive offering in terms of product and cost structure -- even with Mercy, we're third in town. The Blues are first, United the second or whichever. So it helps us on all fronts. It helps earnings, it helps us in offer what we think is going to be tomorrow's product, which goes back to what I've been saying for the last two years. First week back as a CEO, we're going to take better care of our members. And better care means that members are going to be better off and it means it's going to be more cost-effective. So it fulfilled a lot of the holes that we needed in that area."

We’re pleased to report another very strong quarter across our seven core businesses.  The fundamentals of our business continue to be strong and consistent with the last several quart",2127,"Good morning and thank you for your interest in Coventry Healthcare. We’re pleased to report another very strong quarter across our seven core businesses.  The fundamentals of our business continue to be strong and consistent with the last several quarters. We’re certainly operating in a unique and very favorable trend environment, but the core results over the last few quarters are also due to the focus and execution of this company, and its employees. 
We’re operating our businesses better, but more importantly I know there is room for continued improvement. Overall, as you can see in our press release, in Q3 we earned $1.29 which includes $0.05 of private fee for service run out. A significant driver of this very positive result is that both our commercial and our Medicare businesses continue to benefit from unusually low medical trend. 
However, as a practical matter, we continue to expect this low level of trend to be transitory. Given the company’s strong performance in the quarter, we’ve updated 2010 full year guidance and provided details in our press release. Let me first touch on a few operational highlights in the quarter, and then more importantly, provide some perspective on the longer term, or as much as I can, given the continuing lack of clarity relating to certain aspects of health care reform in other areas. 
Our commercial risk business comprised of both group and individual grew again in the quarter, about 11,000 members, or just under 1% sequentially. Remember that Q2 2010 was the first quarter our commercial group business grew organically since Q4 2007, and we were able to continue that positive growth. This is a result of execution in our local markets and across our company, but just as important, the cost structure and positioning of our products and our health plan markets, all attributes which we believe will be critical for success when implementing health reform exchanges. 
As mentioned earlier, the commercial results were nothing short of outstanding.  Although we recognize that minimum loss ratio provisions will commence in 2011, with specific rules yet to be finalized, we’re pleased to have a cost structure that enables us to produce this result and a product portfolio that enables to provide an attractive value proposition to our customers. 
Also in the area of commercial business, we continue to be pleased with results of our Preferred acquisition in Wichita, which as you recall, closed in February this year, and added approximately 120,000 members and $400 million in an annualized revenue to the company. 
Turning to our Medicare Advantage business, it grew slightly in the quarter and had very good results. We look forward to continuing to serve the senior population in 2011 and beyond, and are pleased with the positioning of our Medicare Advantage products and our local plan markets for 2011. Our footprint in 2011 is similar to 2010, as we are offering products in about the same number of counties for 2011. We continue to develop innovative programs in conjunction with provider system partners, and as an example, we’re offering a product in Wichita including a new model of care for Medicare patients whereby there’s a tighter integration of care management, medical homes, coordination of care, data sharing and disease management with our partner Via Christie. 
We expect an acceleration of collaboration between providers and payers more broadly, and in our case especially in the Medicare and the Medicaid ABD populations. In Medicare part D, we had another quarter of on track performance. In 2010, Part D has been a consistent performer for the company for the fifth straight year.  It will be interesting to see how the landscape evolves in 2011, given the push by CMS to reduce the number of products offered by carriers. 
As you have likely seen, we are offering one basic and one enhanced product. We have qualified for 15 auto-assigned regions in 2011 versus 21 in 2010. Once we have more visibility on the open enrollment season ending in December, we will and can provide some more color on membership levels for 2011. For reasons I don’t fully understand, CMS, at the last minute, did not approve our lowest cost Part D product, and as a result our Part D enrollment may suffer in 2011. 
I’m very pleased with the progress we’ve made in Medicaid over the past year. The fruits of our labor are evident this quarter; with the inception of our Nebraska win effective August 1st.  Although we are still waiting for the membership to settle out, we are pleased that we achieved the high end of our forecast as of September, and had 47 new Nebraskans in our Medicaid program. 
Our Pennsylvania membership continues to grow, albeit at a measured pace.  We had 9,000 members at the end of Q3, and we expect that to continue to build. We are pursuing other Medicaid opportunities as a part of our diversified portfolio, and will provide details as the process develops. We’re interested in growing membership in the ABD area, and expect to add approximately 16,000 ABD members in West Virginia over 13 months, beginning in December of this year. 
Our other businesses, including our fee based businesses continue to perform well. As you may have noticed earlier in the year, we have twice increased the fee range guidance for 2010. These businesses, including our market leading worker compensation server business are important contributors to our diversified earnings and cash flow.  In fact, just with the EBITDA contribution from our unregulated fee businesses, we can fund our entire annual interest expense and then some. 
In the area of capital deployment, we closed our Mercy Health Plan transaction on schedule effective October 1st. Once again, not only did we acquire an attractive business, but perhaps even more important, we have forged a collaborative long term relationship with the Sisters of Mercy Health System which spans the Midwest, including Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Beyond the transaction and long term provider contract, we are already off to the races, so to speak, jointly working on new products and shared incentive arrangements for the future. 
Our two acquisitions in 2010 are more than revenue and membership. It’s about our future cost structure and more important, our ability to improve care for members and develop long term strategic relationships with high quality health systems. I think it’s worth a minute to stay with this topic.  We feel the best way to care for members and provide the best value proposition is by having collaborative relationships with provider systems and physicians and working to develop affordable products. 
These relationships are rooted in collaboration, including shared incentives, quality incentives, data sharing, and in some cases, more focused networks. We have and will continue to build these types of relationships whether as a part of an ACO model, medical home, or variation of both. We believe we’re able to offer our provider partners creativity, flexibility, and local market commitment, whether it’s part of an acquisition or a contractual collaborative relationship or both, in some cases. 
We’ll continue to focus on these types of mutually beneficial opportunities in the years to come. While I’m certainly pleased with the accomplishments of our management team during 2010, the hard work and the focus of our employees has contributed to the results you see today. Our Board of Directors takes management depth and succession planning very seriously, and I have spent significant time and effort in recruiting additional individuals to lead us in tomorrow’s environment. 
In that context, I’m pleased to announce the addition of the following executives to our management team in the last quarter, and the forthcoming quarter. First, Ken Burdick; Ken joined our company in September and initially will be responsible for our Medicaid division as well as our behavioral business MHNet. After Amherst College and a law degree from the University of Connecticut, Ken spent 30 years in managed care. Some of us at Coventry knew Ken from our experience at Medford Health, as a part of United Healthcare, after they purchased Medford Health. Ken spent 15 years in various senior executive positions with United. 
I’m also pleased to announce that Kevin Conlin will be joining our company on January 3rd, and will serve in a diverse and broad role for our company.  Kevin will be responsible for our strategic direction with provider health systems, our unit cost, quality of care, and integrated cost structure and welfare of our patients. Kevin has 27 years of extensive healthcare management experience.  He spent the last six and a half years as President and CEO of the Via Christie Health System, a system that employs over 8500 individuals in Kansas and Oklahoma. After earning a degree in Biological Science from Rutgers, Kevin earned an MA in Health Administration from Duke University.  I met Kevin through our acquisition of the Via Christie Health Plan and over time became very impressed with his executive capacity, his insights in the high quality provider health systems, and how we need to partner with them in the future. 
In addition to Ken and Kevin, we plan on announcing another very key hire in Q4 of this year. These executives, coupled with our existing team, will help us navigate the shifting sands around our industry and I’m confident we’ll make notable contributions in the years to come. In addition to this group, along with our existing seasoned team, has altered our plans for succession of my role.  Our plan today is to evaluate our internal management team, with the intent of picking my successor from the internal group, and as a result I’ve committed to remain an additional year with our company, which would be through 2012. Our intent is to pick my successor in late 2011 or early 2012, and for me to remain through 2012 to ensure a smooth transition. 
As you would imagine, many of our 14,000 employees are squarely focused on healthcare reform, the implications and the resulting opportunities. With respect to the near term, we have sophisticated models with many changing variables that are updated daily regarding 2011 projections and minimum loss ratio impact on line of business by legal entity and so on. But more importantly, we have multi-year project plans focused on delivering the products and the related cost structure so that the company is positioned to succeed regardless of the set of final rules. 
We have teams of internal subject matter expert modifying products, benefits, and implementing the operational and compliance requirements reform. Regarding the near term, we will look forward to giving you more clarity on 2011 when we have enough visibility to provide a credible and responsible set of estimates. Now, while today we lack the level of clarity we would like on a number of key issues for 2011, it is obvious to me that 2011 EPS will be less than our outstanding 2010 results. In the meantime, we’ll focus on doing the right things to build long term value, regardless of external hurdles.  
This obviously starts with strong current underlying fundamentals across our seven core businesses.  Tail winds aside, 2010 will result in an outstanding year, and we accomplished a number of significant goals to set the stage for the future. First we added over $1 billion in annualized revenue from our two health plan acquisitions, when addition to revenue and membership will improve our care of members and allow attractive benefit plans for the future.  While future acquisitions, if done properly, can’t be predicted, we have a history of acquiring and improving good businesses, and feel strongly that we can do more of this in the future. 
Second, we added significant additions to our leadership, which strengthens our future prospects, and it’s going to make all the difference for the future.  I think in no order of importance, but third, we’re organically growing our commercial membership. It’s a dramatic turnaround from prior years; we’re gaining momentum on that front, and doing the right things to continue that for the future. 
Fourth, for the first time in years we added new Medicaid plans in Nebraska and Pennsylvania, and we’ll continue to find opportunities in that area. Lastly, we made substantial SG&A progress by reducing staff by about 900 people on a same store basis, without compromising service. So we have seven solid businesses which will continue to improve.  Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger, which allows us to actively seek new opportunities. While you’re more interested in tomorrow than yesterday, and I understand that, I need to make a point, as John Stelban is fond of saying. Fundamentals do matter. With that, it’s a good introduction for John, who will provide details on our financials followed by a brief question and answer session.

As Allen mentioned, our GAAP EPS for Q3 is $1.29, which is comprised of core earnings of $1.24 and $0.05 related to the run out of the private fee business.

As Allen mentioned, our GAAP EPS for Q3 is $1.29, which is comprised of core earnings of $1.24 and $0.05 related to the run out of the private fee business.  This was a strong quarter on all fronts, and a validation that the measures that we took to improve our seven businesses during 2009 and into 2010 are working. In addition, we are increasing the midpoint of our GAAP full year 2010 guidance from $1.80 to $2.79. 
I’ll start with a few highlights of the quarter. We again experienced strong results across our core businesses with better than expected performance, primarily driven by our commercial risk and Medicare CCP businesses. Our commercial risk business had an outstanding quarter by all measures. Commercial risk group membership grew sequentially by 4000 members over Q2, and the individual product grew 7000 members over Q2. 
Peeling back the covers, we show that our small group sales engine continues to perform very well. During Q3, we had about 19,000 member loss due to four large group accounts. However, these losses were more than offset by 23,000 members in new sales. Group premium yields were in line with expectations, given the mix of new sale and were up 3.8% over the prior year quarter, and 4.6% year to date. 
The commercial group medical loss ratio of 76.8% was also much better than expected, driven by a combination of care management and continuing utilization tail winds. Year to date, group MLR now stands at 78.4%. Our view of fundamental (inaudible) remains in the range of 8 to 8.5%.  We are about a year or more into lower than historical utilization trends, and while we see nothing to suggest a material or abrupt uptick in utilization, our forward view would expect utilization to increase. 
Medicare CCP results in Q3 were also better than expected. Reported loss ratio for the quarter of 77% was unusually low, due to a few out of period items. During Q3, we received final year end reconciliation payments related to 2009 as well as other intra-year payment adjustments that produced a below run rate MLR in the quarter. It is more instructive to look at the year to date reported MLR of 81.3%, which when adjusted for prior items, would produce a result at the 83% range for 2010.  It is more reflective of where this business is performing. 
Medicaid produced another very good quarter.  We commenced operations in Nebraska on August 1st, and currently have approximately 47,000 members, and in addition our Pennsylvania operations grew 4000 members over the prior quarter. While reported MLR for the quarter was 89%, same store MLR was much more consistent with the first half of the year, in the mid 80s. Year to date reported MLR of 85.8% is actually closer to 84% when adjusted for Nebraska and Pennsylvania. 
As Allen mentioned, we like this business a lot and are optimistic about its growth prospects. The key to success will be our cost structure and ability to manage patients. We have seen solid improvement in our same store businesses; will certainly apply our experience and lessons learned to the new markets. Turning to balance sheet and cash flows, total cash and investments stand at $4.08 billion, our investment portfolio is in excellent shape, and in a net unrealized gain position of $113 million on September 30, up from $89 million at June 30, primarily due to changes in Treasury rates. 
GAAP cash flow from operations for the quarter was $287 million or 151% of net income, inclusive of a negative $14 million impact from the run out of the private fee product line.  Year to date, core cash flow from operations, defined as GAAP cash flow, adjusted for private fee and the Q2 one time litigation charge was $553 million, or 136% of net income. 
More importantly, free deployable cash apparent was $650 million after accounting for the acquisition of Mercy Health plans, which was paid on October 1. In addition, we began the dividend process related to the return of capital for the private fee business and received $140 million in late October.  This would be additive to the $650 million of deployable cash at October 1. 
Days in claims payable displayed in the press release exclude private fee for all periods presented.  DCP stands at 51.7 days, versus 55.5 at June 30, and 49.5 at December 31. The decrease in DCO of 3.8 days versus prior quarter was due primarily to reduction in claims inventories related to the conversion of our Florida commercial business to our IDX platform at the beginning of June. 
Debt to cap ratio now stands at 28.3%, down slightly from prior quarter, due to earnings. We did not repay any debt in the quarter. Turning to updated 2010 guidance, we are forecasting GAAP EPS in the range of $2.74 to $2.84 including the Q2 litigation charge of $1.18. Excluding the charge, guidance is in the range of $3.92 to $4.02. This includes $0.40 of year to date earnings generated by private fee, but does not assume any further private fee earnings in Q4. 
Our core view of EPS, excluding both the class action charge and year to date private earnings is in the range of $3.52 to $3.62. We’re adding the Q3 outperformance to the prior full year guidance while adjusting for some improved utilization of business in Q4. As we did in Q2, there’s a table in the press release to roll forward the guidance changes. 
I will walk through the guidance, excluding the class action charge, using the midpoint of the range for both current and prior guidance. Midpoint of the guidance on the Q2 earnings call was $2.98, which included $0.35 of private fee earnings, leaving core earnings guidance at $2.63. The current guidance is $3.97, with year to date current fee of $0.40, leaves $3.57 of core earnings or an increase in core earnings guidance of $0.94 versus Q2. 
The lion’s share of the increase is related to commercial risk, with about $0.45 and Medicare CCP worth about $0.27. So let me provide a little more detail on that; starting with the commercial group risk business, as previously guided in Q2, we expect same store membership to be about flat to prior year.  When we include the addition of our approximately 100,000 PHS commercial group risk members and 90,000 Mercy Health plan members, total growth would be roughly 14%. Forecasted 2010 commercial group risk MLR is now expected to be in the range of 79 to 79.5. This is a 200 basis points reduction from the previous guidance midpoint, driven by Q3 results and our more completed view of the first half of 2010. 
The guidance assumes some pressure in Q4, due to the progression of deductible satisfaction and other seasonal factors. All in, this would be about $0.41 of the increase guidance and core earnings for the group risk business. In addition, there’s another $0.04 related to an improved ratio outlook on individual business. We expect the individual loss ratio to be in the mid 60s, down from our previous yield of mid to high 60s. 
So total commercial risk improved outlook is worth $0.45. For Medicare CCP, given the reported Q3 results, we expect a 2010 Medicare Advantage loss ratio to be in the low 80s. Medical cost trim will continue to march forward into Q4, which will push MLR higher than year to date results. An improvement over previous guidance for the full year loss ratio in the range of 300 basis points would produce a $0.27 increase to previous guidance. 
On Part D, with three quarters under our belt, we expect Part D will perform a little better than previous guidance.  We still expect membership in the 1.6 million ranges, and a loss ratio in the mid 80s, albeit about 100 basis points lower in that range. This improved outlook produces $0.07 of increase to previous guidance. 
On SG&A the midpoint of the 2010 guidance range, excluding the impact of Mercy in Q4 is $1.93 billion, a reduction of $10 million from previous guidance, due to better performance on our cost initiatives. Q4 SG&A expense will increase versus Q3, primarily for expenditures related to the selling seasons for Medicare and commercial, as well as additional reform preparedness. 
Our results will also include an additional $20 million or so related to Mercy. If you thing about where we were this time last year, looking at picking out almost $200 million of SG&A due to determination of the private fee product, this has been an excellent result, as we exceeded that goal, plus grew same store revenues. 
The improvement in guidance results in (inaudible) improvement. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes a flat share count for the past three quarters; we are putting capital to use in the completed Mercy Health Plan transaction, and have to take into account the uncertain resolution of the Q2 one time litigation charge. Really, to recap all of that, the $0.94 improvement in core guidance breaks down as follows; commercial risk loss ratio improved outlook worth $0.45, Medicare CCP loss ratio improved outlook worth $0.27, Medicare Part D loss ratio improvement worth $0.07, SG&A guidance improves $0.04, and improved outlook in our fee based businesses adds $0.04, and a change in tax rate guidance by moving the midpoint of the range down 125 basis points is worth $0.06. 
As stated earlier, we have $650 million of deployable cash on hand. In addition, we expect to dividend out the capital supporting the private fee product, which we estimate to be approximately $275 million. We have received $140 million so far in Q4, and will seek to dividend up the remainder the first half of 2011. 
Even after paying for Mercy Health Plan, we are still on track with approximately $1 billion of capital by mid 2011, which would be used for deployment priorities and any necessary after tax payment to resolve the Q2 one time litigation charge. Our priorities for deployable cash continue to be growing the business through acquisition, followed by opportunistic share repurchase, and delivering. 
Really, the take away from this quarter and the improved outlook for 2010 is fundamentals do matter, as we head into the future. While there are certainly challenges as we think about reform, there will also be many opportunities. Going into the future with a pre-fundamental business practices, including sales execution, clinical management, improving cost structure and servicing our customers are all tangible signs that we have a solid foundation on which to grow profitably for the long term. Our two health plan acquisitions and our entrance into two new Medicaid markets demonstrate our ability to simultaneously improve the core business, while taking advantage of opportunities to grow. 
Our balance sheet and deployable cash position is strong and provides us the flexibility to be opportunistic as we deploy capital to profitably grow the company. I will now turn the call over for questions. </TAG>

It’s going to be different in every market place.  It depends on what our position is.  There’s at least one market place which is Iowa which unrelated to anything in minimum loss ratios or reform we just didn’t get good coverage from brokers, we didn’t get really any help from them, so several years ago we decided to go direct, and are selling direct in the Iowa marketplace, and doing better there. If you take the other end of the spectrum, which is places like Atlanta, where the competition is everybody, you know you’re going to have to be sensitive to market conditions. So I think that for certain that we’ll be feeling our way and doing what we hope is smart and best for our groups on a marketplace by marketplace basis. We have made some early cuts on what the implication of that may be, but it’s still a work in progress. So the early reaction to the places where we have gone out with a new structure and a new plan has been okay, but the proof’s going to be what happens in a few quarters and see what the quote level is, and where we are.  So anyone that has - that is in multiple marketplaces that doesn’t have a plan that’s sensitive to who you’re competing with and what they do and what your position is in the marketplace and how much of it is direct, I just don’t understand. So I think we’re feeling our way marketplace by marketplace and so far so good. You know, I don’t think it’ll be - and if you want to talk about dimension, it’s not going to be draconian, it’s not going to reduce our cost 40% or 30%, whether that ends up by doing some more direct in some areas and whether we end up saving on the commercial side something in the 10 to 15% area would be a good guess.

I mean, they are better than I expected when I started, very strategically thinking partners there.  We’re going to do some really interesting things in the marketplace to take better care of the patients, and in turn more of the management of the patients over to provider partners, and provide input, provide data, provide maybe some nursing and clinical help, provide guidelines, and then when they take better care of the patients, then their census goes down, which invariably happens, we’ll share the gain with them and put the money back in to caring better for the patients.  We really like that part of the world, and we would like more of those, as opposed to, as I’m fond of saying, arguing over nickels with providers on unit cost.  We need to take better care of the patients. We can do that, what you don’t know is all the stuff that our acquisition team, headed by Drew Asher, and what we don’t do. I saw a long list of 15 or 20 things we looked at, and didn’t, because it wasn’t strategic because it was too small, or because we didn’t know how to make the business better. So I hope we disciplined, I think we’re disciplined, but we’re looking all the time and while we can’t predict when the next opportunity is coming, we’re going to do more in the way of acquisitions.  We’re going to do them right, and we have fully not converted them to the IDX system, but otherwise fully integrated these businesses and they’re going very well.  We’ve been doing this for a very long time, doing this for fifteen years, acquiring businesses that we know how to make better, having a lengthy disciplined process even before we decide what we need to do.  So we’ve got the resources, we just need to find the right opportunities and whether that’s in commercial or Medicare Advantage or whatever we find, or Medicaid.  So we are going to - first choice has always been to grow the business with acquisitions, and if cash keeps growing and we can’t keep up on the acquisition side, we’ll do a share repurchase.

Tomorrow you’re going to have to have more real time information, you’re going to have to come closer to the magic minimum loss ratio and if you can’t miss by 900 basis points on the negative side, you’re going to give up too much market share, and then write checks too. So the only thing that has changed is we’re going to have to be closer to the sweet spot and if we err we’re going to err a little bit north of the sweet spot in return for market share. Our cost structure, where we elect to do business and where we do it is second to - not to anyone that we compete with, it shows in our margins, it’s shown in our margins for decades, for the most part.  So we’ve got good cost structure and we’re going to turn that into better volumes and being more competitive in the market place, but with higher loss ratios.

It comes from a belief in watching where we make progress and where we don’t in caring for patients over 15 to 20 year periods, and understanding that there are limitations from that, and it comes from a belief of arguing over providers solely based on unit cost and the limitations that that has.  It comes from a belief that where integrated systems have employed physicians, and to pay them properly and to incent them properly, getting the proper information is really an improved and better way to go.  I think - and it comes from a belief that in some of our markets we can’t afford to have only a broad delivery system.  If you think back to the ‘80s when managed care exploded, it was smaller delivery systems, smaller deductibles, or no deductibles, small copays, then the ‘90s everyone wanted choice, they wanted unlimited everything, and the only problem is that ultimately we couldn’t pay for it.  Employers couldn’t, employees couldn’t, municipalities and states can’t, and finally the Federal Government, so we think we’re going to return in some places to narrow delivery systems, more cost effective systems. We have major contracts and major systems and major cites where’s there’s a 35% differential in the cost, and you cannot differentiate the quality in a discernable way at all. So if you add all this stuff together, we want more collaborative contracts with well run systems to take better care of the patients and what I would characterize as a gain sharing basis, if they’re incented and they’re  -- the primary care docs are incented to avoid unnecessary expenditures and just spend more time with the patients, and pay the physicians for that, and when that brings reduced costs to turn it back in terms of more favorable benefit plans, to drive membership to those systems, and in terms of economic arrangements that aren’t just unit cost, but that shares the gain in the width of its system, we’re taking better care of the patients.  So it’s - we did the first one with Medicare population for 2011 with Via Christie, when we had extensive discussions with the Mercy system, even before we closed, it was obvious that since the early ‘90s part of their mission was take better care of the patients and they were ecstatic about having a partner that wanted to do the same thing, so it’s easy to talk about and hard to do on a broad area, but we’re increasing believe that we have to help the people who are responsible for taking care of the patients anyway. And there’ll be more on that.  We’ll announce more of the arrangements as we get them signed and recognizing that how we do that is kind of proprietary, but it’s going to - the new models for the future lend themselves to this better than a unit cost negotiation and our trying to manage the patients from the outside. I’m happy to spend some time in a smaller group explaining how we feel about that, when we’ve got more time, too.
