Bob will cover the first quarter financial highlights in just a moment, but I'd like to give you some key highlights for the quarter. 
On the sales front, the first quarter, which we expected to be the toughest of the year, came in ahead of what we originally anticipated, up 1.3%. Across our sector, March was the strongest month and April the weakest due to the Easter shift and to consumers retreating somewhat in the latter half of the month, due to weather and the lack of any appointment shopping event during that time. 
We were pleased that our traffic trends were positive for the quarter. Mall traffic was up approximately 1% and off-mall traffic was up a couple hundred basis points, higher than our mall traffic, consistent with our trends. I am proud of the way our team's managed the business, which allowed us to deliver higher EPS than we had expected. This was due to better gross margins, up 90 basis points, which reflects the ongoing commitment across our organization to keep expenses at appropriate levels, the success of our Red Zone Clearance strategy, better sell-throughs on new merchandise reflecting positive response to our spring assortments and other new styles we introduced, and improved pricing strategies in certain areas as well. 
Those of you who were at our analyst meeting last month got to hear first-hand from our top merchants about the strategies they're putting in place in their respective areas of the business. I'm pleased to report that all divisions except Home had sales gains for the quarter, reflecting that these initiatives are already starting to pay off. For example, Men's performed very well during the quarter, leading our divisions. Steve Lawrence's team spent last year editing assortments and clarifying our price offerings. It's worked well. We're seeing marked improvements in Men's Sportswear where the addition of Joe Joseph Abboud, Irreverent, and our restyled J. Ferrar are generating excitement. 
Young Men's and Athletic Sportswear were also strong performers, and we continue to expand our market share in these areas. Another highlight of the quarter was the ongoing role of SEPHORA Inside JCPenney. This highly successful concept is now in 193 of our stores. We plan to open additional 37 locations this year, for a total of 230 by year-end. 
We're starting to see positive momentum in our center core businesses, such as Shoes and Handbags. After re-evaluating our approach, we introduced a deeper assortment of modern updated styles and have featured them as part of head-to-toe looks in our Little Red Book for spring. As a result, handbags and shoes were very strong sellers for the Mother's Day selling period. 
The Little Red Book in Women's and Matters of Style book in Men's also generated traffic on jcp.com. The alignment of our assortments across stores and dot-com is working. Both apparel divisions saw double-digit increases in their online businesses for the quarter. 
Overall, jcp.com was up approximately 1% over last year. This reflects the impact of a softer Home business and the restructuring of some aspects of our catalog business. As you know, Home is a significant part of our business on- and off-line. John Tighe, the new [inaudible] in charge of Home, has been on the job for two months and is putting together a solid plan to drive growth in both hard and soft Home businesses in stores and online. 
We ended the first quarter with inventory down 7.2% versus a year ago. Like most retailers, we cut back our inventory last year in order to tightly manage our business, recover gross margin deterioration, and maintain our profitability and financial strength. We finished the first quarter with inventory down less than 1%, and we'll continue to rebuild our inventory levels to capitalize on the general return for the consumer environment. You'll continue to see our inventory levels improve on a relative basis as we move to the second quarter and prepare for stronger sales growth in the back half of the year. 
Taken together, these merchandising initiatives, along with our strategic initiatives around JCP Rewards, which now has over five million members, the Red Zone Clearance strategy, and jcp.com will continue to drive our top line sales performance. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, the second quarter includes a few appointment shopping events and JCPenney and our team of 150,000 associates are well prepared for them. For Mother's Day, we launched our fine jewelry collection of One Kiss by Cindy Crawford. It's off to a strong start after only a few weeks. 
For Father's Day, we expect that our stylish value-priced apparel and gift offerings will resonate well with shoppers, like our assortment of St. John's Bay polos for our stylish assortments of ties and accessories. 
Also, the month of June will not be as big of a clearance month as in last year. This year, we will offer more wear-now goods like shorts and tees. When combined with our successful Red Zone Clearance strategy, we believe this change in our merchandise offering could benefit June sales volume. 
In July, begins our focus on back-to-school. We'll be showing kids, teens and their moms that JCPenney is the one-stop shop with the style and price points that are sharper than the specialty stores in the mall that cater to younger shoppers. They'll discover that JCPenney continues to be the denim destination for kids and teens for back-to-school with brands like Levi, City Streets, Decree and Arizona. 
In addition, our new private brand uproar for tweens offers cool, edgy and functional styles including premium denim at sharp prices. We're capitalizing our success in the surf-and-skate brands such as RS By Sheckler, rusty, and Zoo York by expanding those brands in the younger Boys and Girls segments. Our younger shoppers are pleased with this expansion as initial sell-throughs are good. 
Supergirl by Nastia will launch excessively at JCPenney for back-to-school. Supergirl, which celebrates Olympian Nastia Liukin, is an activewear collection adding to one of our best categories in Children's. These new brands will all be featured in our back-to-school marketing, which incorporates our ""New look. New day. Who knew."" messaging and includes a wide range of interactive, mobile and social media components that kids and teens will find compelling. 
We have a lot of exciting initiatives coming in the second quarter, and taking all these factors into account, we expect that comparable store sales will rise approximately 2½% to 3% in the second quarter. Correspondingly, we expect the earnings per share to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share. Bob Cavanaugh will discuss more about this in a moment. 
Looking beyond the second quarter, we have major style initiatives coming online for the back half of the year that will further establish JCPenney as the style destination, driving sales and market share growth. These include the launch of Liz Claiborne, a lifestyle brand in approximately 30 categories. Liz is one of the most desired and enduring brands with our existing customer segment and will drive new customers to JCPenney as they seek out where to find the Liz brand that beginning in August will only be found at JCPenney. 
Shortly after that, we'll introduce MNG by Mango as the centerpiece for our increasingly exceptional Contemporary offering. Mango is one of the top five fast fashion retail brands in the world and JCPenney will be the only U.S. store to offer it in a compelling way that will attract a younger customer to JCPenney. 
Also for fall, we're excited about our new partnership with People StyleWatch, where their top editors will select seasons must-haves from our JCPenney assortments. We believe this new partnership will give a highly credible third-party endorsement to our merchandise and our style authority. 
As we execute on all we have coming, we're keeping in mind that the economy and the consumer environment remain unpredictable. In light of that, we'll continue to execute our business with discipline, monitoring our costs and looking at our expenses very closely. 
We continue to expect that comparable store sales should increase in the low single digits for the full year and due to our continued success in protecting our gross margin, we also now expect that EPS should be approximately $1.64 per share for the year compared to our previous guidance of $1.55 per share.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob Cavanaugh to go more deeply into our results for the first quarter and our future outlook."

Our first quarter results demonstrate continued performance improvement for both top line sales and bottom line profitability. This morning, we reported earnings of $0.25 per share for the first quarter, which exceeded our original expectations of $0.16 to $0.20 per share. Our gross margin of 41.4% reflects better-than-expected sales performance achieved during the quarter and good early season sell-through of spring seasonal merchandise. 
SG&A expenses increased 2.7% in dollars, which was slightly higher than our original guidance, but well managed as we invested to support the increased sales volume. Including the impact of lower qualified pension expense, total expenses were leveraged and decreased 30 basis points to 37.5% of sales. 
Operating income for the quarter was $155 million, compared with $106 million in last year's period, an increase of 46.2%. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income, which excludes non-cash qualified pension expense, increased 12.3%. As a percent of sales, operating income increased 120 basis points and was 3.9% in the first quarter, compared with 2.7% last year. Excluding the qualified pension expense, adjusted operating income increased 50 basis points to 5.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, and the income tax rate was 37½%. 
Moving on to our financial condition. The company remains in a very solid position, with strong financial flexibility to support our growth plans. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.4 billion. In March, we retired $393 million of long-term debt using existing cash balance, and we ended the quarter with long-term debt of approximately $3 billion. 
You may have also seen that on April 26, we commenced the debt tender offer to purchase $300 million of long-term debt securities. The tender offer period will expire on May 21, and any impact to interest expense or expected earnings per share will be disclosed after the results of the tender are complete. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $116 million, in line with expectations and compared with $156 million last year.
During the first quarter, we opened two new stores. Separately, we also closed one store located in an underperforming mall, which brought our store count as of the end of the quarter to 1,109 stores. We also added 38 SEPHORA Inside JCPenney locations, bringing our total for the concept to 193 locations, and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. 
Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and full year. For the second quarter, comparable store sales are expected to increase in the range of 2½% to 3%. With respect to monthly sales, the shift of Memorial Day will have a negative impact on May sales and a similar benefit to June. We expect May comparable store sales to be below the quarter, June above the quarter, and July in line with the quarter. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 54 basis points less than the comparable store sales increase. 
Gross margins are expected to improve modestly over last year's second quarter, and we expect an increase of approximately 4½% in SG&A dollars primarily from new stores opened since last year's first quarter, minimum wage increases and a resumption of merit increases for our associates. 
In addition, our guidance for the second quarter includes depreciation and amortization of approximately $123 million, pre-opening expenses of approximately $1 million, net interest expense of $56 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. For the second quarter, we expect earnings to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share, and for the full year, we now expect 2010 earnings per share to be approximately $1.64. This update includes our first quarter results ahead of plan and a modest improvement in our outlook for the remaining three quarters.
In summary, our liquidity and financial conditions continue to be very strong and well positioned to support the initiatives of our long-range plan as we focus on expanding market share and delivering sustainable, long-term earnings growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike Ullman."

That was a long process of engineering it for execution in our stores and the way that the merchandising flow is being handled. We see the June selling period benefiting from this as well because there'll be more wear-now merchandise on the floor and less of the clearance cadence in chunks as we had in the past. So I think the initiatives we have are more loaded to the back half of the year in terms of Mango, Liz Claiborne, those kinds of things.

And as a result, it evens out the flow of clearance exiting our store, hopefully at better price points than previous strategy and that's what we've found so far. What's happened in the transition periods of June and January, our old strategy tended to not remerchandise to the customer what the customers were actually buying to wear now during those periods. So while we're not experts on that at this point because we haven't experienced that in the month of June, we do anticipate that being more in business in tanks and tees, and we've watched what our competition has done during that period, we believe we have an opportunity to pick up share during that time frame."

I think we feel like there are a number of positions in Home, which have been quite successful the last several years being the introduction of Linden Street, our ability to attract a brand like Cindy Crawford Style, which has resonated very online as well as in our stores. There've been a number of programs that we are proud of. Having said that, I'm not sure that we messaged the price points and the depth of our offer very effectively in the past. I think John Tighe is a very skilled merchant, and I think he and his team are putting together a solid plan, which I think will see a results in the second half of the year in terms of going after the business. Obviously, the two parts of the Home business, the Soft Home businesses, obviously very fashion-driven and more like the Apparel business and is doing well, but the Hard Home business, which is window covering and furniture, those businesses are harder to feel terrific about in the sense that the Home markets, as you know, if anything, are stagnant at best and possibly even down trending in some markets. So we actually look at Home as a positive because, frankly, we've languished a bit over the last couple of years, and we think there's upside. I think John and his team deserve a couple months to put it in place. And so far, I'm very pleased with the progress."

This year is up 1%. So that's our reason for our comments. It's still not where we'd like it to be. Purchase conversion is positive this year. It was negative last year. And off-mall locations continue to do better than on-mall.

And I think it speaks well of the concept and how well the customer resonates with the way beauty products are sold, and our customer service in that area is outstanding and exceeding our expectations there as well. Essentially, SEPHORA is not a promotional concept. It's really a concept based on selection and the quality and excitement of the merchandise. It continues be the strongest category in our store. And stores that have SEPHORA tend to do better in overall store sales than stores that have not yet had SEPHORA installed. 
So at this point, we have 193 stores, so we'll be at 230 stores by the end of this year, and we are planning to open 75 stores per year going forward. So SEPHORA is accretive in the sense that it also is the second-most cost-shopped [ph] department in our store. So I think those are the elements of SEPHORA.

One was that the recession, being the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, was going to take longer to get out of than probably most people had originally anticipated.

Bob will cover the first quarter financial highlights in just a moment, but I'd like to give you some key highlights for the quarter. 
On the sales front, the first quarter, which we expected to be the toughest of the year, came in ahead of what we originally anticipated, up 1.3%. Across our sector, March was the strongest month and April the weakest due to the Easter shift and to consumers retreating somewhat in the latter half of the month, due to weather and the lack of any appointment shopping event during that time. 
We were pleased that our traffic trends were positive for the quarter. Mall traffic was up approximately 1% and off-mall traffic was up a couple hundred basis points, higher than our mall traffic, consistent with our trends. I am proud of the way our team's managed the business, which allowed us to deliver higher EPS than we had expected. This was due to better gross margins, up 90 basis points, which reflects the ongoing commitment across our organization to keep expenses at appropriate levels, the success of our Red Zone Clearance strategy, better sell-throughs on new merchandise reflecting positive response to our spring assortments and other new styles we introduced, and improved pricing strategies in certain areas as well. 
Those of you who were at our analyst meeting last month got to hear first-hand from our top merchants about the strategies they're putting in place in their respective areas of the business. I'm pleased to report that all divisions except Home had sales gains for the quarter, reflecting that these initiatives are already starting to pay off. For example, Men's performed very well during the quarter, leading our divisions. Steve Lawrence's team spent last year editing assortments and clarifying our price offerings and it's worked well. We're seeing marked improvements in Men's Sportswear where the addition of Joe Joseph Abboud, Irreverent, and our restyled J. ferrar are generating excitement. 
Young Men's and Athletic Sportswear were also strong performers, and we continue to expand our market share in these areas. Another highlight of the quarter was the ongoing role of SEPHORA Inside JCPenney. This highly successful concept is now in 193 of our stores. We plan to open additional 37 locations this year, for a total of 230 by year end.
We're starting to see positive momentum in our center core businesses, such as Shoes and Handbags. After re-evaluating our approach, we introduced a deeper assortment of modern updated styles and have featured them as part of head-to-toe looks in our Little Red Book for spring. As a result, handbags and shoes were very strong sellers for the Mother's Day selling period. 
The Little Red Book in Women's and Matters of Style book in Men's also generated traffic on jcp.com. The alignment of our assortments across stores and dot-com is working. Both apparel divisions saw double-digit increases in their online businesses for the quarter. 
Overall, jcp.com was up approximately 1% over last year. This reflects the impact of a softer Home business and the restructuring of some aspects of our catalog business. As you know, Home is a significant part of our business on- and off-line. John Tighe, the new [indiscernible] in charge of Home, has been on the job for two months and is putting together a solid plan to drive growth in both hard and soft Home businesses in stores and online. 
We ended the first quarter with inventory down 7.2% versus a year ago. Like most retailers, we cut back our inventory last year in order to tightly manage our business, recover gross margin deterioration and maintain our profitability and financial strength. We finished the first quarter with inventory down less than 1%, and we'll continue to rebuild our inventory levels to capitalize on the general return for the consumer environment. You'll continue to see our inventory levels improve on a relative basis as we move to the second quarter and prepare for stronger sales growth in the back half of the year. 
Taken together, these merchandising initiatives, along with our strategic initiatives around JCP Rewards, which now has over 5 million members, the Red Zone Clearance strategy, and jcp.com will continue to drive our top line sales performance. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, the second quarter includes a few appointment shopping events and JCPenney and our team of 150,000 associates are well prepared for them. For Mother's Day, we launched our fine jewelry collection of One Kiss by Cindy Crawford. It's off to a strong start after only a few weeks. 
For Father's Day, we expect that our stylish value-priced apparel and gift offerings will resonate well with shoppers, like our assortment of St. John's Bay's polos or our stylish assortments of ties and accessories. 
Also, the month of June will not be as big of a clearance month as in last year. This year, we will offer more wear-now goods like shorts and tees. When combined with our successful Red Zone Clearance strategy, we believe this change in our merchandise offering could benefit June sales volume. 
And July begins our focus on back-to-school. We'll be showing kids, teens and their moms that JCPenney is the one-stop shop with the style and price points that are sharper than the specialty stores in the mall that cater to younger shoppers. They'll discover that JCPenney continues to be the denim destination for kids and teens for back-to-school with brands like Levi, City Streets, Decree and Arizona. 
In addition, our new private brand uproar for tweens offers cool, edgy and functional styles including premium denim at sharp prices. We're capitalizing our success in the surf-and-skate brands such as RS By Sheckler, rusty, and Zoo York by expanding those brands in the younger Boys and Girls segments. Our younger shoppers are pleased with this expansion as initial sell-throughs are good. 
Supergirl by Nastia will launch excessively at JCPenney for back-to-school. Supergirl, which celebrates Olympian Nastia Liukin, is an activewear collection adding to one of our best categories in Children's. These new brands will all be featured in our back-to-school marketing, which incorporates our ""New look. New day. Who knew."" messaging and includes a wide range of interactive, mobile and social media components that kids and teens will find compelling. 
We have a lot of exciting initiatives coming in the second quarter, and taking all these factors into account, we expect that comparable store sales will rise approximately 2½% to 3% in the second quarter. Correspondingly, we expect the earnings per share to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share. Bob Cavanaugh will discuss more about this in a moment. 
Looking beyond the second quarter, we have major style initiatives coming online for the back half of the year that will further establish JCPenney as the style destination, driving sales and market share growth. These include the launch of Liz Claiborne, a lifestyle brand in approximately 30 categories. Liz is one of the most desired and enduring brands with our existing customer segment and will drive new customers to JCPenney as they seek out where to find the Liz brand that beginning in August will only be found at JCPenney. 
Shortly after that, we'll introduce MNG by Mango as the centerpiece for our increasingly exceptional Contemporary offering. Mango is one of the top five fast fashion retail brands in the world and JCPenney will be the only U.S. store to offer it in a compelling way that will attract a younger customer to JCPenney. 
Also for fall, we're excited about our new partnership with People StyleWatch, where their top editors will select seasons must-haves from our JCPenney assortments. We believe this new partnership will give a highly credible third-party endorsement to our merchandise and our style authority. 
As we execute on all we have coming, we're keeping in mind that the economy and the consumer environment remain unpredictable. In light of that, we'll continue to execute our business with discipline, monitoring our costs and looking at our expenses very closely. 
We continue to expect that comparable store sales should increase in the low single digits for the full year and due to our continued success in protecting our gross margin, we also now expect that EPS should be approximately $1.64 per share for the year compared to our previous guidance of $1.55 per share.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob Cavanaugh to go more deeply into our results for the first quarter and our future outlook."

Our first quarter results demonstrate continued performance improvement for both top line sales and bottom line profitability. This morning, we reported earnings of $0.25 per share for the first quarter, which exceeded our original expectations of $0.16 to $0.20 per share. Our gross margin of 41.4% reflects better-than-expected sales performance achieved during the quarter and good early season sell-through of spring seasonal merchandise. 
SG&A expenses increased 2.7% in dollars, which was slightly higher than our original guidance, but well managed as we invested to support the increased sales volume. Including the impact of lower qualified pension expense, total expenses were leveraged and decreased 30 basis points to 37.5% of sales. 
Operating income for the quarter was $155 million, compared with $106 million in last year's period, an increase of 46.2%. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income, which excludes non-cash qualified pension expense, increased 12.3%. As a percent of sales, operating income increased 120 basis points and was 3.9% in the first quarter, compared with 2.7% last year. Excluding the qualified pension expense, adjusted operating income increased 50 basis points to 5.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, and the income tax rate was 37½%. 
Moving on to our financial condition. The company remains in a very solid position, with strong financial flexibility to support our growth plans. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.4 billion. In March, we retired $393 million of long-term debt using existing cash balance, and we ended the quarter with long-term debt of approximately $3 billion. 
You may have also seen that on April 26, we commenced the debt tender offer to purchase $300 million of long-term debt securities. The tender offer period will expire on May 21, and any impact to interest expense or expected earnings per share will be disclosed after the results of the tender are complete. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $116 million, in line with expectations and compared with $156 million last year.
During the first quarter, we opened two new stores. Separately, we also closed one store located in an underperforming mall, which brought our store count as of the end of the quarter to 1,109 stores. We also added 38 SEPHORA Inside JCPenney locations, bringing our total for the concept to 193 locations, and we continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. 
Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and full year. For the second quarter, comparable store sales are expected to increase in the range of 2½% to 3%. With respect to monthly sales, the shift of Memorial Day will have a negative impact on May sales and a similar benefit to June. We expect May comparable store sales to be below the quarter, June above the quarter, and July in line with the quarter. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 54 basis points less than the comparable store sales increase. 
Gross margins are expected to improve modestly over last year's second quarter, and we expect an increase of approximately 4½% in SG&A dollars primarily from new stores opened since last year's first quarter, minimum wage increases and a resumption of merit increases for our associates. 
In addition, our guidance for the second quarter includes depreciation and amortization of approximately $123 million, pre-opening expenses of approximately $1 million, net interest expense of $56 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. For the second quarter, we expect earnings to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share, and for the full year, we now expect 2010 earnings per share to be approximately $1.64. This update includes our first quarter results ahead of plan and a modest improvement in our outlook for the remaining three quarters.
In summary, our liquidity and financial conditions continue to be very strong and well positioned to support the initiatives of our long-range plan as we focus on expanding market share and delivering sustainable, long-term earnings growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike Ullman."

I think that is starting to improve as our inventory position improves, and obviously, went into the quarter down 7%, came out down 1.3% or something like that. I think that was a factor. Obviously, we have a number of things going on at the same time, one being the clearance strategy. We're pleased with the early results of that. That was a long process of engineering it for execution in our stores and the way that the merchandising flow is being handled. We see the June selling period benefiting from this as well because there'll be more wear-now merchandise on the floor and less of the clearance cadence in chunks as we had in the past. So I think, generally feel the initiatives we have are more loaded to the back half of the year in terms of Mango, Liz Claiborne, those kinds of things. Obviously, the dot-com business for us is double-digit ahead in the apparel categories, we're dragged down a bit by our Home performance and also some shifts we have in the way we're re-engineering the catalog business, which have an effect on dot-com as well."

It was a question of the cadence, how we merchandise clearance. We used to merchandise clearance in specific periods of time where the Red Zone strategy is to have clearance on the floor essentially all through the year with much, much easier to understand pricing. And as a result, it evens out the flow of clearance exiting our store, hopefully at better price points than previous strategy and that's what we've found so far. What's happened in the transition periods of June and January, our old strategy tended to not re-merchandise to the customer what the customers were actually buying to wear now during those periods. So while we're not experts on that at this point because we haven't experienced that in the month of June, we do anticipate that being more in business in tanks and tees, and we've watched what our competition has done during that period, we believe we have an opportunity to pick up share during that time frame."

I think John Tighe is a very skilled merchant, and I think he and his team are putting together a solid plan, which I think will see a results in the second half of the year in terms of going after the business. Obviously, the two parts of the Home business, the Soft Home businesses, obviously very fashion-driven and more like the Apparel business and is doing well, but the Hard Home business, which is window covering and furniture, those businesses are harder to feel terrific about in the sense that the Home markets, as you know, if anything, are stagnant at best and possibly even down trending in some markets.

And I think it speaks well of the concept and how well the customer resonates with the way beauty products are sold, and our customer service in that area is outstanding and exceeding our expectations there as well. Essentially, SEPHORA is not a promotional concept. It's really a concept based on selection and the quality and excitement of the merchandise. It continues be the strongest category in our store. And stores that have SEPHORA tend to do better in overall store sales than stores that have not yet had SEPHORA installed. 
So at this point, we have 193 stores, so we'll be at 230 stores by the end of this year, and we are planning to open 75 stores per year going forward. So SEPHORA is accretive in the sense that it also is the second-most cross-shopped department in our store. So I think those are the elements of SEPHORA. We've learned over the last several years how to open SEPHORA in existing stores and have it be right off the bat successful. We were always very good at it in our new store, but now even existing stores are starting off at a run rate that actually exceeds our original plan. So SEPHORA is a hit and I think it's helped us attract other attractions like Mango and other things to come."

I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results in the second quarter. Mike will then provide additional color around our results and an update on our strategic initiatives. This morning,",869,"Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results in the second quarter. Mike will then provide additional color around our results and an update on our strategic initiatives. 
This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.06 per share compared to break-even results last year and within our guidance of $0.05 to $0.08 per share, including the $0.05 impact for bond premiums incurred in connection with the company's debt tender offer completed in May. Our second quarter results demonstrate our commitment to operational flexibility and delivering improved profitability. Sales for the quarter were challenged by the company's performance in July, and in particular, were impacted by two non-comparable factors that Mike will discuss in a few minutes. 
All other financial and operational metrics exceeded plan for the quarter, and first half earnings were $0.31 per share compared with $0.11 per share in last year's first half. Gross margin exceeded plan and improved 90 basis points to a historic peak for the second quarter of 39.4%, primarily due to our ability to control unit cost through strong sourcing relationships and through more profitable sales of clearance merchandise during the quarter under our Red Zone clearance strategy. Also contributing to gross margin was exceptional sell-through of wear now merchandise, combined with year-over-year shrinkage improvement attributable to our shrinkage reduction initiatives. 
Our team continues to exhibit discipline in managing our operating expenses across the entire organization, as SG&A came in much better than guidance, up only 2.5% over last year. The increase in SG&A dollars is partially attributable to expenses related to new stores and the continued rollout of the Sephora inside JCPenney boutiques. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the incentive compensation accrual. 
Operating income for the quarter was up 41.8% to $95 million compared with $67 million last year. As noted in the release, if we exclude the impact of the non-cash qualified pension plan expense from both this year's and last year's second quarter, adjusted operating income increased 7.1%. 
Total operating expenses were relatively flat to last year, increasing 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $68 million in the prior year. The company also incurred approximately $20 million in additional expenses, primarily of bond premiums paid in connection with the debt tender offer I referred to earlier. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and reflected favorable adjustments to the company's state income taxes, and we had approximately 238 million average diluted shares for the quarter.  For the bottom line, net income was $14 million or $0.06 per share for the quarter. 
Moving on to our financial condition. We remain in a strong financial position, with continued flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives over the long-range plan. As of July 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2 billion. Year to date, our free cash flow is on plan. Taking into consideration our free cash flow position and the financing transactions noted in the release, we ended the first half with $300 million less cash when compared to last year's first half, and we ended the quarter with $300 million less debt or long-term debt of approximately $3.1 billion compared to $3.4 billion last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $113 million compared with $148 million in last year's second quarter. We continue to reinvest in our existing stores and expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. This includes 23 major store renovations, renovations associated with the addition of 76 Sephora inside JCPenney boutiques and store enhancements to support merchandise sets for Liz Claiborne and MNG by Mango. 
Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We expect comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3% for the third quarter. Total sales will be up approximately 100 basis points less than comparable store sales due to the expected negative impact from the discontinuation of our Big Book catalogs. We expect gross margins as a percent of sales to decline modestly during the quarter, which is unchanged from our original plan. 
SG&A expenses are expected to be up approximately 2% compared to last year's third quarter. Depreciation and amortization should be approximately $129 million, net interest expense of about $57 million and we expect a tax rate of approximately 38%. We currently anticipate about 238 million average diluted shares, including about 2 million common stock equivalents. 
For the third quarter, we expect earnings to be in the range of approximately $0.16 to $0.20 per share. And for the full year, we now expect earnings be in the range of $1.40 and $1.50 per share, as we are taking a relatively conservative approach to the economic climate and especially the moderate consumer. 
In summary, with the disciplined approach to our business, we continue to have the financial flexibility to support the strategies of our long-range plan. This is enabling JCPenney to strengthen both competitively and financially and position our business for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Ullman for more color on the company's performance and outlook."

Comparable store sales were positive for the second consecutive quarter, increasing approximately 1% from last year. We focused on increasing a proportion of wear now and season merchandise in our mix, enabling us to drive profitable sales at regular and promotional prices. And we were able to pull forward major deliveries to meet the demand, as we were selling through the merchandise earlier than anticipated. As a result, we are entering the third quarter in a very clean forward-looking inventory position. 
Also, as Bob mentioned, we opened 22 additional Sephora inside JCPenney shop within the store locations to bring our total to date to 215, which will increase to 232 by the end of the year. The sales trend of stores that have Sephora inside  JCPenney are consistently performing 150 basis points higher than stores that do not yet have the concept. And the sales productivity of Sephora space in the store is 3x the average of the overall store.  Due to the success of this concept, we'll continue to open approximately 75 Sephora locations for the year. 
To give you a sense of the sales by category, our Women's business continues to be strong, driven by the success of wear now apparel. As you know, we're up against very strong comps from last year when our Women's Apparel business was the industry leading performer during the downturn. And we expect our Women's businesses to be even stronger in the second half of the year, with the addition of Liz Claiborne and MNG by Mango, as well as the ongoing positive changes were making across our Apparel, Accessories, Shoes and Fine Jewelry businesses. 
Our new Liz Claiborne merchandise began arriving at the beginning of this month, and the response from customers has been overwhelmingly positive. The Liz brand is already beating our expectations, and the official marketing launch of the brand is until mid-September. 
The 77 MNG by Mango shops will open next week, as well as on jcp.com. We will reach a total of 600 stores by the end of next fall. There are really only truly five fast fashion retailers in the world: Zara, Uniqlo, Forever 21, H&M and Mango, and none of them have a department store presence in the U.S. With approximately 1,500 square feet of a shop within a shop, JCPenney will be the only department store offering true fast fashion, and the merchandise looks great and the shop environment will be compelling. 
Our first Call It Spring by ALDO Group's shop within a shop will open in September in our Manhattan store. Call It Spring will offer our customers an extensive collection of over 300 styles of up-to-the-minute, on-trend footwear and accessories, all at compelling prices. Again, we're the only department store retailer carrying ALDO-branded product outside their own specialty stores, and we're rapidly rolling this out to 600 stores over the next 12 months. 
Our Men's divisions had the strongest categories in the quarter, up 5.5%. We had an outstanding Father's Day and continuing to experience a great trend in our men's business. Sportswear, for example, is up 9%. Our success is a direct result of changes we made in adding assortment, sharpening our price points and the compelling type of floor presentations. 
We're also starting to see signs of life in our Home business through the new initiatives being put in place by John Tighe, our new GMM of Home. Specifically, we're seeing traction in our Soft Home business, with particular strength in the more affordable items. Our Furniture and Window Covering businesses, however, remain tough as a result of protracted housing slump, and improvement in these areas will be a longer-term proposition. 
In terms of the Children's businesses, the changes we're making are evident in our back-to-school offerings. While still early, we're very pleased with the performance of our just-launched brands of Uproar and Supergirl by Nastia, and the ongoing strength of our relatively new brands, including Olsenboye by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and Ryan Sheckler's RS by Sheckler brand. This, coupled with the breadth of our operating and core merchandise that kids need every year, including a terrific down selection of school uniforms, positions us well to once again be the leading back-to-school destination. 
However, we do expect the peak back-to-school selling period to be very close to school openings around the country. The timing of shopping malls will of course be tied closely to the tax-free events that are being held in a number of states to support back-to-school shopping. 
Overall, we have seen great strength in our Kid's businesses. As we continue to execute our growth strategy, which during the quarter, drove positive sales; our focus of driving greater value to our customers by offering sharp price points in private label brand; as well as increasing sales of select national brands, with great brand line like Carter's, has really moved the needle in establishing JCPenney as a destination for moms. In the second quarter, Carter's was up almost 30% over last year's quarter, while our private brand, Okie Dokie, also had a great sales increase. 
Our successful internet remains the largest general merchandising site, exceeding 1.5 billion per year. As you know, we made the decision to exit the Big Book catalog business at the beginning of the year. As it turns out, many of the former Big Book customers entered their orders online in the past, the loss of that sales volume this year had a negative effect on our overall internet trend and overall comp. Despite this non-comparable effect, jcp.com was up 4.1% for the quarter, fueled primarily by double-digit rises in all apparel categories. 
Contributing to our strong .com increases in July was at the introduction of Guided Navigation, which quickly directs customers to the right products within a few clicks. July was our first full month that it was available across all of our online categories, which led to a 22% lift in the average order value for the month. 
To give you some highlights for the quarter. All regions year-to-date have positive comp increases, all five regions, with the Southeast being up the most on a spring season basis. Overall transactions were up 5.9% and units per transaction were up 2.3% for the quarter. AUR was down slightly as planned. 
Due to our leading product development and sourcing organization and the long-term relationships we have with our overseas suppliers, our cost of goods has declined, which allowed us to pass the savings on to our customers. So while our overall average AUR is down slightly, we planned it that way. In order to provide our customers with the value they're looking for, we're hurting our gross merges. This AUR strategy worked. Throughout the quarter, our private brands continue to outperform national brands by approximately 400 basis points in sales trend, and we experienced an even larger improvement of approximately 800 basis points in private brand gross profit higher than national brands. 
Clearance AUR through our Red Zone clearance program was up 3.9%. We began this program at the beginning of the season, and its benefits are very clear. Our merchants can now accelerate the markdown on slow-selling merchandise on a more timely basis and have it available for sale in the apparel department locations throughout the store. This approach improves our flow of new fresh merchandise sold at regular and promotional price points, while maintaining a consistent presentation of clearance merchandise, which is moving out in a faster rate and more profitably. 
Yet, another key initiative is that the ramp up of our JCP Rewards program, which now reached to 8 million members by the end of the quarter. JCP Rewards customers visit JCPenney stores about 2x more per year than non-rewards customers and spend approximately $100 more per year. For the back half of the year, we'll be launching some major program enhancements that will continue to drive top line sales for us with this very important and very loyal customer. 
Total inventory at the close of the quarter was up approximately 7% over last year. This includes customer-facing inventory in stores and is approximately 5%, in line with the company's initial plan for sales to improve sequentially in the second half of the year. While the inventory is up compared to our updated sales guidance for the third quarter, we're very comfortable with the levels that includes private brand merchandise that we pulled forward to avoid overseas disruptions that may have negatively impacted our future deliveries during the back half. And we're holding this merchandise in our logistics facilities until its planned set dates. 
Additionally, a portion of the inventory increase includes the company's in-transit merchandise from our international sourcing organization in support of JCPenney's growth initiatives, including a higher sales mix of our private brands and the launch of Liz Claiborne in our stores and on jcp.com. And remember, we are now sourcing the Liz Claiborne brand ourselves, so the inventory ownership there is reflected earlier in the cycle. Again, we're very comfortable with our levels of merchandise. 
Mall traffic was up throughout the quarter, and that was mirrored in JCP store traffic as well. As has consistently been the trend, traffic in our off-mall stores is about 350 basis points higher than our mall-based stores. As we have mentioned, offsetting our positive sales trend at the end of the quarter were the impact of two non-comparable items that distorted our true operating performance for the balance for the balance of the year. So I want to call them out to you now, so it don't impact your point of view about the vibrancy of our business or your perception of our competitor's market share performance. 
The discontinuation of the Big Book catalog will impact total sales this year. This is particularly true in July, as we're up against two Big Book catalog drops from last year. This resulted in a 200 basis point hit to our total sales in July and 160 basis points for the quarter. 
The other non-comparable is our Red Zone clearance strategy transition, which allows us to move our clearance in a much smoother cadence throughout the year versus our previous clearance strategy of having large clearance downloads at the end of each season. Two of the largest downloads occurred at the end of July, and again, mid-February. So with that, we're up against our first big clearance download this last week of July. I should note that while the July clearance wasn't a surprise to us, as we knew it was coming, in retrospect, we could've handled it better as we ultimately gained back much of our comp sales increase that we earned throughout the quarter during that final week of July. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our Red Zone clearance program. It's working, and we're selling our clearance merchandise earlier in the cycle and more profitably. That said, one week is a brief moment in time, given what we've learned from it, we'll work to mitigate short-term impact in the future. And so overall, we're encouraged about where our business is heading and we're it managing well, as you can tell from our net and operating income results. 
So in conclusion, Bob shared with your guidance for the third quarter and the balance of the year. What it reflects is a conservative approach to what continues to be an uncertain consumer climate, particularly for the moderate consumer. Having said that, we're on a journey to fundamentally transform JCPenney from a traditional catalog-based department store to a retail destination for discovering great style at compelling prices. And we're on track with our plans to do just that. We're creating sustainable enterprise where customers receive attentive personalized service and inspired by our merchandise offerings, with engaged associates who choose to invest their careers toward us, and we will maintain a strong financial position even during the tough economic climate. 
As you know, growing top line sales is an important objective of our long-range plan. We have identified merchandise growth opportunities that will entice current customers to visit more frequently, engage and attract new and younger customers, and increase in customer spending overall. We have a compelling merchandise offering for our customers, with half of our business in industry-leading private brands and the other half in the best of national exclusive brands. 
As we continue to invest and power up our private brands, we expect they will continue grow at a faster rate than national brands and to continue providing great value to our customers and higher profitability for us. And we're bringing innovation to what we offer to our customers. JCPenney continues to implement game-changing merchandise growth concepts that will not only drive higher sales per square foot but help us establish JCPenney as a style destination. Sephora inside JCPenney, Liz Claiborne, MNG by Mango, Call It Spring by ALDO are clear examples of this. 
jcp.com is the leading general merchandise site on the internet, and it continues to grow. We have done a lot of the hard work during the recession to overhaul our entire digital platform. Customers are changing the way they interact through technology, and the retail competitive landscape, especially online, has changed even more dramatically. We're on the forefront of the changes. Our investment in the future retailing has competitive advantage and one that's not easily replicated. 
The actions we're taking are the right ones for our customers, our associates and our investors. We are intently focused on growing the top line. Maintaining our margins while maintaining a strong financial position allows us to pursue our growth initiatives. While we're committed to delivering progress every quarter, our overall objective of our journey is to build a long-term sustainable franchise and shareholder value. 
With that, we'll open the line to your questions."

So in terms of right now, as we forecast out the fall season, as Bob mentioned, we're a bit more concerned than we would've been at the beginning of the year about the consumer environment. So we're going to be looking very carefully at revising some aspects of our sales and inventory toward the rest of the year, but we don't see any major issue at this point."

And just the overall domestic environment in China is such that there's much more domestic demand, which is putting pressure on costing overall, particularly for apparel. Fortunately, we started to diversify our sourcing locations four or five years ago. So we have a balance of sourcing across Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Turkey, India. So we probably have less of an impact from China by itself. The cotton crop upcoming looks like it's stronger than the last. So I think any body who thinks that they're going to get cost improvement in '11 probably hasn't studied the facts. I think our view is that our cost impact will be less than our key competitors, that it will be naive to think that we're going to shielded completely.

The introductions of some new innovation like the Pure Perfection towel, which has gone very well and the realignment of our Bedding business. So the Soft Home part of our business is starting to respond. Stores have been very enthusiastic about what they saw for fall at our recent store managers' meeting, one of the most well-received sessions with the powering up of big, bold statements in Soft Home. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think the big ticket, Furniture and Window Covering business, will respond more slowly just by the reality of the housing slump being protracted beyond what was originally envisioned. But we think it's going to take another six months or so to see the full benefit of the changes that they're making. But we're starting to see signs of life and certainly, we always look to our sales associates because of they're the best customers we have and the best authority on how we're doing, and they feel very good about what they see on the floor. As to the margin impact on Liz and MNG by Mango, Liz has actually a very favorable product margin impact to us because part of our deal with the Liz Claiborne Corporation [Liz Claiborne Inc.] was for us to produce their merchandise, which gave us a 500 or 600 basis points improvement in gross margin profit even on the comparable sales. So the fact that it's also across more categories and we expect to grow it aggressively over the next five years, we think it's nothing but a positive to GP. MNG by Mango, frankly, is not driven on the basis of being a great GP conservator, but it is a contemporary fashion attraction, and that we'll only have in 77 stores this fall. We'll learn as we go. They have proven in their business, in the core Mango business, that they can turn the merchandise profitably. Until we obviously experience that with our customers, we won't have as much information that they currently have. They're very enthusiastic about going from 12 stores in the U.S. to 600 in a little over a year. So this is a big opportunity for them as well as we'll market aggressively one of the most successful fashion concepts in the world. So I think that the department store executives were candid. They would tell you that probably $20 billion to $30 billion of volumes come out of the department stores via the fashion retailers ramping up a very successful business model. And we think it's a real coup to have one of those residents at the entrance of our biggest stores."

If you look at the Liz Claiborne ramp up, there are 77 more supplier. If you look at our JCP Rewards increases, if you look at what we have planned in terms of guided navigation on dot com, our center core merchandising should have -- whether it be the Tops business across all businesses or the Accessories category, modern shoes, we've basically identified the growth categories at the beginning of the year and we knew most of those we're not going to be accretive in the first half. Although, what we try to say is as we thought about the year, we aren't going to look to the consumer economy to help us at all in 2010. Now we think there might be a slight drag on the consumer portion of this and we have to create not only the -- plus, we have to make it work harder to get to our comps. So I think anybody who's objective about the current environment saw a gradual slowing of the economy. I think, to be candid, the upper quartile customer never ran out of money. And those that catered to that customer had been smart in terms of looking at the merchandise they have on the floor and offering more value in a sector that really wasn't values-oriented in the past. I think the bottom quartile is obviously families are getting by, by taking care of the needs of their family. They don't have much flexibility beyond that. The middle two quartiles, which are our core customers, they've had the brunt of essentially the effect of the job situation. The country basically hasn't re-employed a worker at this point. There's new entrants to the workforce, 125,000 a month. It's larger than average job increases per month. So to be realistic, consumer constriction credit, the job loss situation and the protracted housing situation, this had the biggest impact on the middle income consumer. So as a store that's proud to be aligned with our consumer, we have to recognize that they have issues. And we obviously want to help them get through this by offering great value, but our customer tends to be more urban, more ethnic and more impacted by the economy than many others in the overall retail landscape."

It wasn't there. The books themselves, as I said, they probably, at one point, average over $400 million of our volume per book. And it gradually has been declining towards about half of that today. So the costing is an interactive process of re-engineering our infrastructure, which we started two years ago by aligning merchandising into one organization and marketing and immediate planning into one organization. So today, it's blended. It's a little hard to identify which part today would have been allocated toward the Big Book. But gradually, our Catalog business is declining and our Direct Mail and our Guided Media to allow people to shop online is increasing. So the point I made was that printing a 600- or 800-page document as opposed to the increases in the printing costs, not to mention the ecological impact of producing this thing. We decided it was time to take the hit and while it's detrimental to this year, we think it's the right thing to do. And we'll reinvest a lot of that media in the Direct Mail and things that are related more to dot com."

The reality is it's a little complicated to explain in the sense that why it is so important to change it. By adding five major events a year, it really forced merchants to hold markdowns so they didn't get doubled up on markdowns. And so things didn't necessarily clear as fast as the customer was willing to clear them. So getting off of that cadence was important even though it's painful. So you're going to hit the five periods where you're up against these big events and you will have sold through some of the clearance that would have been on those events. We are seeing higher AUR by doing it this way. More importantly, it opens the open to buy during that period to put in where in our merchandise. And that's the biggest benefit. So it's a little hard to explain because, frankly, some of the benefit is not showing in the markdown category. It's showing in the sales line.

We certainly haven't added events related to discounts.

We think we've been at disadvantage because we haven't messaged it particularly effectively. But we don't -- unlike some of our competitors, we're not really layering in additional promotion. We think we're up against that forever if you put it back in. We put 50 days out last year. We're not going to return there. As to the incentive comp, I don't think it's any secret at the end of the first quarter, we were well ahead of plan. So we accrued our incentive compensation above the plan levels for our executives and our managers. And obviously, we had to bring it back to what the trend is now because we not only accrued for above half of year-to-date, but we also accrued for the forecast. So obviously, it reflects what we think the reality is going to be for the second half of the year. The quantum of it, frankly, I don't have it in front of me, but it was --"

As Mike indicated earlier with his remarks on the impact on the Big Books and the profitability that they had generated, the second quarter impact there on the margins from a direct to stores, obviously, there was a negative impact or hit, if you will, from the big books on margin and a further improvement, of course, therefore, on the stores.  So with regard to the third quarter, I think modest decline was, as Mike said, really in our plan as we prepared for the year and in terms of modification. But we don't normally give out prospective margin numbers. I think we're historic highest. Last year's margin for the year was the highest in the company's history. I think the second quarter margin is the highest, at least in a decade. So I think we certainly don't feel like we have margin pressure by any surprises coming. I think it's a question of flow through and sell through. We keep churning merchandise as we have been, we're getting the favorable margin that we plan for."

I think if you would take a catalog or a piece of direct mail from three or four years ago and put alongside what we're producing today, it's a dramatic difference. It's not your mother's department store. I think our strategy is, obviously, get imaging that reflects the style and character and quality of the merchandise, and the customers responded very well to it. We know we're under indexed in that younger customer segment in the 24- to 35-year-old customer. We think that's a big opportunity for us because, frankly, the ones that are coming in the store, finding merchandise, where they do, is significantly lower prices than other department stores. So as much as other department stores talk about trading into our area, net price is customers still significantly higher. So our job is, obviously, to communicate as effectively as possible to a broad range of customers that give us a chance for them to come and discover Mango. It's called Spring [Call It Spring] by ALDO Group or Claiborne, where it's now exclusively at Penney's.

But as I said, I think ours has been effective. But where we look at ways to improve it, it's probably in the mix of how we talk about our business, as well as the clarity of offers. So we had a big effort a year ago on pricing clarity and communication. That has proven to be very successful. I would argue that one of the reasons our Men's business is so strong is we reorganized the layout, reorganized the messaging and the clarity and the customers responded very well, to the extent that those principles are now being applied to across all our businesses. Looking at some of the improvements in Home, I would argue that's part of the success there as well. So just adding money to the promotion bucket doesn't necessarily change the result. The effectiveness is what matters. We already are one of the largest of the 20 advertisers in the United States, so it's not as if we're not spending in the category. But we have a very diverse business. We've got Window Covering and Furniture and Beauty Salon and so forth. So we've got a lot of other different businesses under one roof.

In some cases, we're over assorted online. We have too much merchandise and then in the distribution centers, waiting for the customers. In other cases, we don't have enough. So putting the merchant organizations together, they're working day by day trying to make sure what the right balance is between online and in-store presence. The good news is we have total visibility of inventory in every store and online, and the customer as well as the associate totally have access to the online assortment at the store, from home or anywhere else.

This morning, we announced third quarter results of $0.19 per share. Now this reflects the combination of the actions we're taking to drive our top line with our continued focus on managing our costs and expenses in order to drive profitability. In fact, expenses came in even lower than we planned.
Earlier this year, we told you that our performance for the year would be second half loaded and that's exactly the way it's played out in spite of unseasonal weather in many areas of the country during the period. Our third quarter results reflect our growth initiatives, are waiting to take hold, and we feel good about the way we're positioned for the all-important Christmas season in the fourth quarter. I should note that November is off to a great start, since the weather has turned more seasonable in many parts of the country. With that, let me review our sales for the third quarter. I'll start with an update on the work being done by our co-chief merchants Liz Sweeney and Steve Lawrence, and their teams to continue to raise the style offering of our merchandise assortments. Specifically, the combination of the new looks we've introduced with new marketing approaches is serving as well. Here are a few highlights: first we began introducing Liz Claiborne, one of the nation's most recognized brands in August. It's in all 1,107 of our stores with the vast majority of our stores carrying all 26 categories of Liz Claiborne and Claiborne merchandise. The brand end is beating our plan across all businesses.
Second, our Men's business has been a top performer across the company year-to-date. This is due to the team's strategic decision to shift more of our merchandise mix into good and better price points, along with the improved level of style we now carry and the marketing which is targeted directly to male consumers.
Overall, we're very satisfied with this business we had a strong Father's Day and we're experiencing a strong trend in Men's since Father's Day. Third, the addition of MNG by Mango. This unique fast fashion brand is offered exclusively at JCPenney. It's drawn great attention to our contemporary assortments. MNG is now in 77 stores and performing well, with particular strength in our metropolitan stores. This brand will be in 600 stores at this time next year. Fourth, Call it Spring by ALDO launched in three stores this quarter will also be in 600 stores this time next year.
Prior this launch, we have already made considerable changes in our overall Modern Shoe and Handbag businesses, which has delivered strong results for us thus far. So with the addition of Call it Spring we feel very good about the future of our Modern Shoe and Handbag business. Fifth, in fine jewelry, our added assortments and introduction of new fashionable finds and re-brands at shopper price points is clearly resonated with our customers. Throughout the third quarter, find joy is one of our top performing divisions. Sixth, support inside JCPenney, once again this concert was a star performer. As of today, we're in 231 locations performing very well. On average, the foreign side JCPenney locations are 3x more productive than the rest of the store. We plan to open additional 75 stores inside JCPenney in 2011 and will have a total of 600 by the year 2014. Also I'd like to note that the growth initiatives we announced at the analyst meeting early in the year, all 14 growth initiatives are up year-to-date and ahead of our plan. To remind you, some of these were in the tops category across Juniors, Men's, Boys and Women's, our center core businesses, Fashion Jewelry, The National Brand Draw business, Ore and Metals and Fine Jewelry, Modern Shoes, Modern Handbags as well as our Kids business. So we feel good about identifying the growth opportunities, we knew the consumer wasn't going to help us much this year, we had to create our own growth and are quite pleased that we delivered on that objective.
Our marketing initiatives were also playing a critical role in this. JCPenney is one of the top 20 marketers in the country and we spend our dollars strategically in search of the reached the broadest booth for costumers while ensuring we target our messages to read the right customers with the right messages that relates to their lifestyle.
Overall, the changes we've made are attracting new customers to JCPenney as well as reaching an increasing number of younger customers who are attracted to our stepped-up style and compelling price points. 
We are also pursuing new marketing initiatives such as the partnership with People Style Watch. This alignment lends great credibility to our style authority and encourages customers to discover the new higher level of  fashion in merchandise assortments. Throughout the year, People Style Watch editors work with our trend and merchandising  teams to select must-haves from our fashion assortments focusing on women's and juniors apparel, accessories and footwear.
Since launching, the People Style Watch must-haves in store and at jcp.com, raw results are very encouraging. Must haves scienced and online essentially sell out. In our stores we've experienced some 25% sales lift on average, over the rest of selling for those things that have been identified as must-haves by those editors.
We're also in the process of integrating the rest of our print media from traditional catalogs to targeted print pieces. Future print media will be fully aligned to store at jcp.com assortments, and supported by enterprise-wide merchandising marketing and planning allocation. Our fine war print media will provide store selling associates additional support to help customers find the extended sizes and/or additional JCP merchandise offerings from one of our 40,000.com-enabled terminals in our stores that they can also shop from home or from mobile devices using to find more media.
As we transition out of the Catalog business, we are working to rationalize certain assets related to our catalog operations, which we expect to result in expense savings over the long term.
Moving back now to the results for the quarter. We delivered 1.9% growth in comparable store sales. Our third consecutive quarter comparable store gains.  We're delivering on the promise for sequential sales growth during the year. Our quarterly comp includes a 2.3% gain in August and 5.1% comparable gain in September, making us once again a leader in the key back-to-school period. Customers responded well to the new brands, such as Uproar and Supergirl by Nastia as well as some of the long-term leaders including Arizona and national brands such as Zoo York and Vans. This performance early in the quarter was partially offset by our sales results in October. The facts there were that October was one of the warmest in 30 years and one of the driest in 20 years across the country and this impacted sales across our industry.
The bright spot for us is the non-seasoned merchandise category such as housewares, luggage, fashion jewelry continued to perform well and support to as a strong performer once again in October.
Traffic in our stores, both on and off mall, was up year-over-year for each month. Additionally the number of transactions and units per traction were also up low to mid single digits over the year. And we'll note that the traffic in our off-mall locations was about 600 basis points higher than the traffic in our regional mall locations.
AUR was down for the quarter, which was our plan. Early this year we began a strategic effort to shift a greater portion of our assortments to good-better pricing versus better-best, as customers continue to be very price conscious. Through our industry sourcing organization which allows us to mitigate the costing pressures, and still maintain strong profitability, we were able to offer our customers sharp price points as well as stay true to our mission of being a commercial department store that America's families can rely on for affordable fashion. Additionally, we made it easier for our customers to recognize the value of our offer to our focus on our merchandising price clarity.
jcp.com experienced sales gains throughout the period of 3% for the quarter, which reflects solid performance across all categories as well as a continued positive impact given by our guided navigation technology with the success of our social media strategy to drive traffic to our site and the appeal of our free shipping offers. The strongest performing categories were men's as well as shoes and women's accessories and we also delivered positive sales on home categories online as growth initiatives in this business are striking to take hold on jcp.com, as well as in our stores.
Total inventory was up about 5% over last year. This includes an increase approximately 5% of customer based inventory over last year which is in line with both the company's initial sales plan for the third quarter and our targeted year-end inventory's reported growth initiatives in our next year. We believe we're in an appropriate and good inventory position entering the holiday season and we expect this to serve us well as we work to ensure that our price points are competitive in this harsh promotional environment. Additionally, to remind you, we lost sales during the holiday season last year, because we thought our inventories were too low.
This year, jcp inappropriately stopped throughout the period. With that, let me now turn it over, the call over to Bob for more detail on our financials."
295624,115380209,87958,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2010",2010-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results and outlook. Mike will then close with additional color around our plans for the fourth quarter and our growth initiatives before we open the ca",891,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results and outlook. Mike will then close with additional color around our plans for the fourth quarter and our growth initiatives before we open the call to questions. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.19 per share. This result reflects the team's focus on driving top line sales through our growth initiatives, while also continuing to manage our cost and expenses in order to drive profitability and deliver shareholder value. For the third quarter in a row, the company reported positive comparable store sales gains against last year as comparable store sales for the quarter increased 1.9%, essentially in line with our sales guidance for the quarter. As Mike mentioned, sales in August and September were strong, but this strength was offset by the company's performance in October as weather for the month was unseasonably warm, negatively impacting the sell-through cold-weather merchandise.
Gross margin decreased $61 million for the third quarter to 39% of sales, primarily due to the discontinuation of our Big Book catalogs, promotional activities during the quarter and in part, to the shift in our merchandise mix to more items than good and better price points.
Although we guided for SG&A dollars to increase 2%, we are pleased that our teams were able to reduce SG&A dollars by 3.8% when compared to last year. For example, the company launched Liz Claiborne during the quarter, which was supported by a successful and expensive marketing campaign, yet marketing expenses were actually down year-over-year as we reallocated Print Men to local and national advertising and online media. The company also benefited from the efficiencies we continue to generate through our tools and processes like jTime and door to floor, which helped to manage store staffing to customer traffic. In addition, the company also recorded a reduction in its incentive compensation accrual, which positively impacted SG&A for the quarter.
Total operating expenses were down significantly to last year, declining 4.9% or $78 million. Operating income for the quarter was up 15.9% to $124 million compared with $107 million last year. As noted in the release, if we exclude the impact of the non-cash qualified pension plan expense from both this year's and last year's third quarter, adjusted operating income was flat both in dollars and as a percent of sales. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $64 million in the prior year, reflecting both lower debt and interest rate levels.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. This is lower than expected due to a positive adjustment resulting from the true up to actuals after the filing of the company's tax return. And we had approximately $238 million average diluted shares for the quarter. For the bottom line, net income improved 63% to $44 million or $0.19 per share for the quarter. Adjusting net income for the impact of the qualifying pension plan, net income increased 11% to $80 million or $0.34 a share, up 13%.
Moving onto our financial condition. We remain in a strong financial position with continued flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives and the Long Range Plan. As of October 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, our free cash flow remains on plan to end the year at approximately $200 million.
Also capital expenditures for the nine months reported were approximately $380 million as we continue to reinvest in our existing stores and our growth initiatives. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. As announced earlier this week and as Mike will discuss, we are also investing in two high potential retail opportunities designed to grow our sales by expanding our customer reach into new ventures online, Gifting Grace and CLAD. Turning now to the company's outlook for the remainder of the year.
We expect comparable store sales to be up 3% or 4% in the fourth quarter. Due to the company's discontinuation of its Big Book catalogs, total sales are expected to increase approximately 150 basis points less than comparable store sales.
For the quarter, we expect gross margins as a percent of sales to modestly decline. And as a reminder, the company is up against historic peak margins achieved in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A dollars are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization should be approximately $141 million. Net interest expense should be about $58 million and we expect a tax rate of approximately 37%.
We currently anticipate about 238 million average diluted shares including about 2 million common stock equivalents. Earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share and for the full year, the company still expects comparable store sales to increase low single digits and for earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. In summary, as we move into the fourth quarter, we are confident that our continued focus on disciplined execution of our business and our long-range plan strategies will foster financial flexibility and further strengthen our business for long-term success.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Ullman for more details on the company's performance and outlook."

And additionally, we just launched a new mobile commerce site this week, so customers can shop directly from the their smartphones.

Finally, we are offering special incentives for our JCP Rewards customers during the Christmas holiday season. Our rewards program now has over 24 million members. 
Before we open the call to your questions, I want to quickly touch on some of the longer-term initiatives we're pursuing for 2011 and beyond. We announced a couple of weeks ago that we plan to expand our presence in major markets, which are currently underserved by JCPenney and offer great potential for us to our demographic profiles. This should begin next year with the opening of three new stores, one in San Francisco Bay area, one in suburban Maryland just outside Washington DC, and in Central Dallas and we expect announced further details on our new start growth plans shortly. At the same time, we're committed to elevating in store JCPenney experience through our comprehensive renovation program. This year in 2010, we made significant in-store enhancements in more than 750 stores, including 76 major renovations and by 2014, we plan to complete major remodels in more than 375 additional source.
Taken together, these new openings and innovation program will help enable JCPenney to deliver on our goal of being an industry growth leader by maximizing sales productivity in our existing locations and expanding our customer base in key markets.
Additionally, we announced yesterday the creation of a new business, the Growth Brands Division, which will pursue high potential opportunities in the retail sector. These initiatives will be separate from our core JCPenney brand and will capitalize in our retail expertise in strategically pursuing untapped opportunities to serve key customer segments and drive sales growth.
Our opportunities initiatives will include both digital a retail store opportunities reflects our long range plan objective of growth leadership in the industry . The first two businesses under this new division, CLAD and Gifting Grace will launch in summer of 2011 and both are strategic collaborations with the First Magazine group.
The First Magazine group will lend its vast brand expertise in consumer reach. We will leverage our industry-leading retail infrastructure. Both initiatives will be Online Retail businesses and are unlikely to be like anything that exist in the market today. CLAD will be a complete online modern menswear resource aimed at fashionable men offering a full assortment of wealth-curious designer brands in a savvy digital environment.
This business will be run Will Swillie, who joins us after having just built the Men's business at Rue La La. Gifting Grace will be a compressive online gifting resource offering extensive assortment of unique and memorable gift items compelling content and convenient tools for the year-around gift giver. This will be led by Mary Drolet, the retail patron and founder of Club Libby Lu. Will and Mary will both report to Anne Sutherland Fuchs, a highly experienced branding and digital executive who recently joined us.
Along with our new growth brands division, we're continuing our transformational journey of our core JCPenney brand into a destination for discovering great style and compelling prices.
We believe we enjoy a very solid position in regional malls as the price leader among the anchor tenants and at the same time in off mall locations, we offer the only true department store experience at affordable and compelling prices. Lastly, I'd like to congratulate all of our 150,000 associates for just completing our fourth year of our great customer service program. Great stands for greet, respect, engage, assist and thank.

As I've said, we want to be out of this business by the end of the quarter, so our anticipation at this point will not be a big factor. The issue of how jcp.com, performs over holiday obviously will impact the overall margin, the direct category. We think we can transition all these business that we're walking away from in terms of the traditional catalog and the different print media vehicles like, fine war print media. This actually would be accretive to our margin as far as de-leveraging the inventory as well as the print media form. We're not getting out of the Print business, but we're getting out of the traditional Catalog business, which was tied to call centers and fulfillment processes and specific actions by customers to go online to enter in order that they first saw in the  catalog. So re-purposing all of that, we get the inventory aligned with more of a store inventory, so we actually have the youngest customer being the predominant customer on the Internet as opposed to the oldest we think over time is a very important shift."

I think many of our competitors work with smaller suppliers may have had more difficulty dealing with that but we got ahead of it. Cotton prices have been the biggest driver of concern throughout '11 and particularly in second half. In some cases manufacturers aren't even taking orders at this point because they don't feel like they can anticipate what their costing is going to be. We're in better shape than that. We are able to place orders. Once again, we will work hard to try to change the offerings such a way to shield the price increase as much as possible from the consumer, but the fact is if cotton goes up 50% or 70% or whatever it lands, there will be an impact on pricing that everybody is honestly going to feel. And our objective is to have a competitive advantage particularly on key price points that the customer would expect us to maintain. This can be done obviously through a change in mix, in terms of how we promote the business, but importantly how we manage the costing in Asia. Having the ability to move between countries, the ability to move within a very established supplier base that works with us hand in hand, I think is an advantage.

Because if you think it's a spec add to the bubble you don't want to get very far out in terms of your placements. On the other hand, you can't sell air. So eventually you have to place the goods. The balancing act between the supplier and us typically the fall placements are done this time of year, it's very early in the cycle. So it's just the first couple of weeks of November. We expect another month we'll be a lot smarter as to what the costing is going to be in early fall. It would be naive to say that we don't think it's a problem for apparel manufacturers and apparel retailers. I think we have an advantage for about 50% below an average price point to the department stores in the other end of the mall, so to the extent that our price points are sharp. And the customer wants to trade into a lower price point because prices are going up over all. I think that gives us an advantage."

As to the overall Home business I mentioned earlier, housewares, particularly the coffee categories are very weary strong. The Luggage business which is more a profitable parts of your home happens to be one of the fastest-growing categories so that's obviously good news for Home margins. Margins in home have not been an issue, it's pretty more the customers' appetite for higher-priced big ticket merchandise.

We're virtually hitting every single one of those in growth things we have initiative that we've identified and this year and we'd expect to do the same in the coming years. The $1 billion in incremental volume in dotcom, frankly we're very confident about because we think the younger customers are really under penetrated on dotcom right now. We had that customer $27 million of them shopping on our store, that are not shopping yet with us online. That's a big opportunity for us to take the business from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. The last category, the third category is the billion dollar of incremental growth in store footprint or physical store environment. We expect to obviously find off mall 100,000 square-foot opportunities going forward it's uncertain how many of those we can find in the time period. So far we've set about 75 it turns out to be 50 and 75 we do believe that there's small of far many opportunities that we can find that will be more urban or more suitable to markets where we already have a fairly big footprint opportunities, that in feel opportunities. So that plus our big and tall off mall format that's not yet been announced in terms of it's name but it will be approximately 300 stores as it rolls out. And we think that's a growth opportunity and then on the non-physical space in terms of the digital opportunities CLAD and Gifting Grace are also accretive to the over all growth of volume.

We probably had 20 or 30 major remodels that did not involve a Sephora, either because of local conditions or an opportunity we decided to expand their footprint or whatever. The merchandising initiatives will be going to 600 stores and whether it be Mango or Call it Spring, those are much many call merchandising remodels, they're significant because particular in the case of the Mango, is at the front door, as well as Claiborne. So the customers deal with that is they think the whole store has been remodeled. But that's less of a capital commitment as planned in as part of the launch of the merchandise category. But as we mentioned we expected to take on over 300 major remodels within the five-year plan period that we'd like to believe that most of our customers, the results we get from the scorecard if you look at the key questions that where we score number one of our peer group is on claritive authority offer, lack of clutter, quality of fitting rooms, these are things that we believe that even in an unremodeled store that we execute extremely well in terms of store environment, uncluttered isles, availability of staffing, merchandise knowledge. Those are the things that frankly, we think to find the customer experience. Having said that, we're going to invest in remodeling the stores to get them all to a level that we're proud of."

Our view of expenses, it's on numbers, but more importantly is how do we run the business. And grow the business, we obviously have to invest but not with a blind eye towards what it costs.

The contemporary piece of it is much smaller than the updated modern or the classic piece of our business. Conceptually, the we leave it with Claiborne on the pad that's adjacent to American Living both are doing extremely well. The mere fact American Living has benefited from the Claiborne. I wouldn't over state the size of MNG compared to the Claiborne business they're completely different business. The key is up 3x more productive than any other contemporary brand we have in the space. So it's obviously resonating, it's the only fast fashion department store in the country and when you say fast fashion it's not a 30 week cycle the most important fashion pieces are in a two to three week cycle. Somebody can say they had fast fashion, you say compared to what? I think the customer has been trained that they want what they see on the runway. They want what they see in Sarah, H&M, Forever 21, Mango, these are looks that they're expecting to see. We think it brings the right kind of patina to our business, that there's a reason to come to the store more often. And our biggest opportunity, Frank, is more frequent visits. We always look for white space. I would say that AMA and Worthington are huge private brands that are very, very successful, operating much higher than national brands and their modern brands, they're doing well to fill that space between the classic and the contemporary space. And just like the rest of the private brand business, we like the fact that they're going faster than national brands because that says that the customer is voting for the merchandise that we've designed and built at higher profitability."

This morning, we announced third quarter results of $0.19 per share. Now this reflects the combination of the actions we're taking to drive our top line with our continued focus on managing our costs and expenses in order to drive profitability. In fact, expenses came in even lower than we planned.
Earlier this year, we told you that our performance for the year would be second half loaded and that's exactly the way it's played out in spite of unseasonal weather in many areas of the country during the period. Our third quarter results reflect our growth initiatives, are waiting to take hold, and we feel good about the way we're positioned for the all-important Christmas season in the fourth quarter. I should note that November is off to a great start, since the weather has turned more seasonable in many parts of the country. With that, let me review our sales for the third quarter. I'll start with an update on the work being done by our co-chief merchants Liz Sweeney and Steve Lawrence, and their teams to continue to raise the style offering of our merchandise assortments. Specifically, the combination of the new looks we've introduced with new marketing approaches is serving us well. Here are a few highlights: first we began introducing Liz Claiborne, one of the nation's most recognized brands in August. It's in all 1,107 of our stores with the vast majority of our stores carrying all 26 categories of Liz Claiborne and Claiborne merchandise. The brand end is beating our plan across all businesses.
Second, our Men's business has been a top performer across the company year-to-date. This is due to the team's strategic decision to shift more of our merchandise mix into good and better price points, along with the improved level of style we now carry and the marketing which is targeted directly to male consumers.
Overall, we're very satisfied with this business we had a strong Father's Day and we're experiencing a strong trend in Men's since Father's Day. Third, the addition of MNG by Mango. This unique fast fashion brand is offered exclusively at JCPenney. It's drawn great attention to our contemporary assortments. MNG is now in 77 stores and performing well, with particular strength in our metropolitan stores. This brand will be in 600 stores at this time next year. Fourth, Call it Spring by ALDO launched in three stores this quarter will also be in 600 stores this time next year.
Prior this launch, we have already made considerable changes in our overall Modern Shoe and Handbag businesses, which has delivered strong results for us thus far. So with the addition of Call it Spring we feel very good about the future of our Modern Shoe and Handbag business. Fifth, in fine jewelry, our added assortments and introduction of new fashionable finds and re-brands at shopper price points is clearly resonated with our customers. Throughout the third quarter, find joy is one of our top performing divisions. Sixth, support inside JCPenney, once again this concert was a star performer. As of today, we're in 231 locations performing very well. On average, the foreign side JCPenney locations are 3x more productive than the rest of the store. We plan to open additional 75 stores inside JCPenney in 2011 and will have a total of 600 by the year 2014. Also I'd like to note that the growth initiatives we announced at the analyst meeting early in the year, all 14 growth initiatives are up year-to-date and ahead of our plan. To remind you, some of these were in the tops category across Juniors, Men's, Boys and Women's, our center core businesses, Fashion Jewelry, The National Brand Draw business, Ore and Metals and Fine Jewelry, Modern Shoes, Modern Handbags as well as our Kids business. So we feel good about identifying the growth opportunities, we knew the consumer wasn't going to help us much this year, we had to create our own growth and are quite pleased that we delivered on that objective.
Our marketing initiatives were also playing a critical role in this. JCPenney is one of the top 20 marketers in the country and we spend our dollars strategically in search of the reached the broadest group of costumers while ensuring we target our messages to read the right customers with the right messages in a way that relates to their lifestyle.
Overall, the changes we've made are attracting new customers to JCPenney as well as reaching an increasing number of younger customers who are attracted to our stepped-up style and compelling price points. 
We are also pursuing new marketing initiatives such as the partnership with People Style Watch. This alignment lends great credibility to our style authority and encourages customers to discover the new higher level of  fashion in merchandise assortments. Throughout the year, People Style Watch editors work with our trend and merchandising  teams to select must-haves from our fashion assortments focusing on women's and juniors apparel, accessories and footwear.
Since launching, the People Style Watch must-haves in store and at jcp.com, the results are very encouraging. Must haves items that are online essentially sell out. In our stores we've experienced some 25% sales lift on average, over the rest of selling for those things that have been identified as must-haves by those editors.
We're also in the process of integrating the rest of our print media from traditional catalogs to targeted print pieces. Future print media will be fully aligned to store at jcp.com assortments, and supported by enterprise-wide merchandising marketing and planning allocation. Our fine war print media will provide store selling associates additional support to help customers find the extended sizes and/or additional JCP merchandise offerings from one of our 40,000 .com-enabled terminals in our stores that they can also shop from home or from mobile devices using to find more media.
As we transition out of the Catalog business, we are working to rationalize certain assets related to our catalog operations, which we expect to result in expense savings over the long term.
Moving back now to the results for the quarter. We delivered 1.9% growth in comparable store sales. Our third consecutive quarter comparable store gains.  We're delivering on the promise for sequential sales growth during the year. Our quarterly comp includes a 2.3% gain in August and 5.1% comparable gain in September, making us once again a leader in the key back-to-school period. Customers responded well to the new brands, such as Uproar and Supergirl by Nastia as well as some of the long-term leaders including Arizona and national brands such as Zoo York and Vans. This performance early in the quarter was partially offset by our sales results in October. The facts there were that October was one of the warmest in 30 years and one of the driest in 20 years across the country and this impacted sales across our industry.
The bright spot for us is the non-seasoned merchandise category such as housewares, luggage, fashion jewelry continued to perform well and support to as a strong performer once again in October.
Traffic in our stores, both on and off mall, was up year-over-year for each month. Additionally the number of transactions and units per transaction were also up low to mid single digits over the year. And we'll note that the traffic in our off-mall locations was about 600 basis points higher than the traffic in our regional mall locations.
AUR was down for the quarter, which was our plan. Early this year we began a strategic effort to shift a greater portion of our assortments to good-better pricing versus better-best, as customers continue to be very price conscious. Through our industry sourcing organization which allows us to mitigate the costing pressures, and still maintain strong profitability, we were able to offer our customers sharp price points as well as stay true to our mission of being a commercial department store that America's families can rely on for affordable fashion. Additionally, we made it easier for our customers to recognize the value of our offer to our focus on our merchandising price clarity.
jcp.com experienced sales gains throughout the period of 3% for the quarter, which reflects solid performance across all categories as well as a continued positive impact given by our guided navigation technology with the success of our social media strategy to drive traffic to our site and the appeal of our free shipping offers. The strongest performing categories were men's as well as shoes and women's accessories and we also delivered positive sales on home categories online as growth initiatives in this business are striking to take hold on jcp.com, as well as in our stores.
Total inventory was up about 5% over last year. This includes an increase approximately 5% of customer based inventory over last year which is in line with both the company's initial sales plan for the fourth quarter and our targeted year-end inventory's reported growth initiatives entering next year. We believe we're in an appropriate and good inventory position entering the holiday season and we expect this to serve us well as we work to ensure that our price points are competitive in this highly promotional environment. Additionally, to remind you, we lost sales during the holiday season last year, because we thought our inventories were too low.
This year, JCPenney will be appropriately stocked throughout the period. With that, let me now turn it over, the call over to Bob for more detail on our financials."
295624,115380209,87988,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2010",2010-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results and outlook. Mike will then close with additional color around our plans for the fourth quarter and our growth initiatives before we open the ca",891,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results and outlook. Mike will then close with additional color around our plans for the fourth quarter and our growth initiatives before we open the call to questions. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.19 per share. This result reflects the team's focus on driving top line sales through our growth initiatives, while also continuing to manage our cost and expenses in order to drive profitability and deliver shareholder value. For the third quarter in a row, the company reported positive comparable store sales gains against last year as comparable store sales for the quarter increased 1.9%, essentially in line with our sales guidance for the quarter. As Mike mentioned, sales in August and September were strong, but this strength was offset by the company's performance in October as weather for the month was unseasonably warm, negatively impacting the sell-through cold-weather merchandise.
Gross margin decreased $61 million for the third quarter to 39% of sales, primarily due to the discontinuation of our Big Book catalogs, promotional activities during the quarter and in part, to the shift in our merchandise mix to more items at good and better price points.
Although we guided for SG&A dollars to increase 2%, we are pleased that our teams were able to reduce SG&A dollars by 3.8% when compared to last year. For example, the company launched Liz Claiborne during the quarter, which was supported by a successful and expensive marketing campaign, yet marketing expenses were actually down year-over-year as we reallocated print spend to local and national advertising and online media. The company also benefited from the efficiencies we continue to generate through our tools and processes like jTime and door to floor, which helped to manage store staffing to customer traffic. In addition, the company also recorded a reduction in its incentive compensation accrual, which positively impacted SG&A for the quarter.
Total operating expenses were down significantly to last year, declining 4.9% or $78 million. Operating income for the quarter was up 15.9% to $124 million compared with $107 million last year. As noted in the release, if we exclude the impact of the non-cash qualified pension plan expense from both this year's and last year's third quarter, adjusted operating income was flat both in dollars and as a percent of sales. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $64 million in the prior year, reflecting both lower debt and interest rate levels.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. This is lower than expected due to a positive adjustment resulting from the true up to actuals after the filing of the company's tax return. And we had approximately $238 million average diluted shares for the quarter. For the bottom line, net income improved 63% to $44 million or $0.19 per share for the quarter. Adjusting net income for the impact of the qualifying pension plan, net income increased 11% to $80 million or $0.34 a share, up 13%.
Moving onto our financial condition. We remain in a strong financial position with continued flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives and the Long Range Plan. As of October 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, our free cash flow remains on plan to end the year at approximately $200 million.
Also capital expenditures for the nine months reported were approximately $380 million as we continue to reinvest in our existing stores and our growth initiatives. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. As announced earlier this week and as Mike will discuss, we are also investing in two high potential retail opportunities designed to grow our sales by expanding our customer reach into new ventures online, Gifting Grace and CLAD. Turning now to the company's outlook for the remainder of the year.
We expect comparable store sales to be up 3% or 4% in the fourth quarter. Due to the company's discontinuation of its Big Book catalogs, total sales are expected to increase approximately 150 basis points less than comparable store sales.
For the quarter, we expect gross margins as a percent of sales to modestly decline. And as a reminder, the company is up against historic peak margins achieved in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A dollars are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization should be approximately $141 million. Net interest expense should be about $58 million and we expect a tax rate of approximately 37%.
We currently anticipate about 238 million average diluted shares including about 2 million common stock equivalents. Earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share and for the full year, the company still expects comparable store sales to increase low single digits and for earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. In summary, as we move into the fourth quarter, we are confident that our continued focus on disciplined execution of our business and our long-range plan strategies will foster financial flexibility and further strengthen our business for long-term success.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Ullman for more details on the company's performance and outlook."

Second, our stores are now fully set for the Christmas holiday. Additionally this season, 200 JCPenney stores that don't currently have a support inside JCPenney beauty boutique. We're featuring a pop-up shop carrying a selection of sought after beauty and fragrance products and gift sets.
Third, we've increased our marketing spend in the fourth quarter to ensure there's a very loud steady drumbeat tauting JCPenney as the Christmas gift headquarters. Our integrated marketing campaign which includes a very robust promotional counter will highlight our competitive merchandise offering. And additionally, we just launched a new mobile commerce site this week, so customers can shop directly from their smartphones. 
On November 1, we began a free shipment return to store program as well for all orders made online or through mobile applications. We think this is a unique offering among our peer group. Finally, we are offering special incentives for our JCP Rewards customers during the Christmas holiday season. Our rewards program now has over 24 million members. 
Before we open the call to your questions, I want to quickly touch on some of the longer-term initiatives we're pursuing for 2011 and beyond. We announced a couple of weeks ago that we plan to expand our presence in major markets, which are currently underserved by JCPenney and offer great potential for us to our demographic profiles. This should begin next year with the opening of three new stores, one in San Francisco Bay area, one in suburban Maryland just outside Washington DC, and in Central Dallas and we expect to announce further details on our new start growth plans shortly. At the same time, we're committed to elevating in store JCPenney experience through our comprehensive renovation program. This year in 2010, we made significant in-store enhancements in more than 750 stores, including 76 major renovations and by 2014, we plan to complete major remodels in more than 375 additional source.
Taken together, these new openings and renovation program will help enable JCPenney to deliver on our goal of being an industry growth leader by maximizing sales productivity in our existing locations and expanding our customer base in key markets.
Additionally, we announced yesterday the creation of a new business, the Growth Brands Division, which will pursue high potential opportunities in the retail sector. These initiatives will be separate from our core JCPenney brand and will capitalize in our retail expertise in strategically pursuing untapped opportunities to serve key customer segments and drive sales growth.
Our opportunities initiatives will include both digital and retail store opportunities reflects our long range plan objective of growth leadership in the industry . The first two businesses under this new division, CLAD and Gifting Grace will launch in summer of 2011 and both are strategic collaborations with the First Magazine group.
The First Magazine group will lend its vast brand expertise in consumer reach. We will leverage our industry-leading retail infrastructure. Both initiatives will be Online Retail businesses and are unlikely to be like anything that exists in the market today. CLAD will be a complete online modern menswear resource aimed at fashionable men offering a full assortment of well curated [ph] designer brands in a savvy digital environment.
This business will be run Will Swillie, who joins us after having just built the Men's business at Rue La La. Gifting Grace will be a compressive online gifting resource offering extensive assortment of unique and memorable gift items compelling content and convenient tools for the year-around gift giver. This will be led by Mary Drolet, the retail patron and founder of Club Libby Lu. Will and Mary will both report to Anne Sutherland Fuchs, a highly experienced branding and digital executive who recently joined us.
Along with our new growth brands division, we're continuing our transformational journey of our core JCPenney brand into a destination for discovering great style and compelling prices.
We believe we enjoy a very solid position in regional malls as the price leader among the anchor tenants and at the same time in off mall locations, we offer the only true department store experience at affordable and compelling prices. Lastly, I'd like to congratulate all of our 150,000 associates for just completing our fourth year of our GREAT customer service program. Great stands for greet, respect, engage, assist and thank. We've enjoyed for the last two years being number one in customer service among stores in the U.S. and it's a great credit to our sales associates for their diligence in this area.
Their continued dedication to serving our customers has really differentiated us from the competition, fares us well to deliver to our customers during the Christmas holiday season. So now operator, please open the line for questions."

Sounds as if it's a similar impact to the top line of 150 basis points. So with that lingering into the fourth quarter, why wouldn't gross margins be impacted similarly?"

So it was probably more severe than we'd do in the fourth quarter. As we start to wind down it's less of an issue. As I've said, we want to be out of this business by the end of the quarter, so our anticipation at this point is it will not be a big factor. The issue of how jcp.com performs over holiday obviously will impact the overall margin, the direct category. We think we can transition all these business that we're walking away from in terms of the traditional catalog and the different print media vehicles like, fine war print media. This actually would be accretive to our margin as far as de-leveraging the inventory as well as the print media form. We're not getting out of the Print business, but we're getting out of the traditional Catalog business, which was tied to call centers and fulfillment processes and specific actions by customers to go online to enter in order that they first saw in the catalog. So re-purposing all of that, we get the inventory aligned with more of a store inventory, so we actually have the youngest customer being the predominant customer on the Internet as opposed to the oldest we think over time is a very important shift."

I think many of our competitors work with smaller suppliers may have had more difficulty dealing with that but we got ahead of it. Cotton prices have been the biggest driver of concern throughout '11 and particularly in second half. In some cases manufacturers aren't even taking orders at this point because they don't feel like they can anticipate what their costing is going to be. We're in better shape than that. We are able to place orders. Once again, we will work hard to try to change the offering in such a way to shield the price increase as much as possible from the consumer, but the fact is if cotton goes up 50% or 70% or whatever it lands, there will be an impact on pricing that everybody in our industry is going to feel. And our objective is to have a competitive advantage particularly on key price points that the customer would expect us to maintain. This can be done obviously through a change in mix, in terms of how we promote the business, but importantly how we manage the costing in Asia. Having the ability to move between countries, the ability to move within a very established supplier base that works with us hand in hand, I think is an advantage.

Because if you think it's a spec add to the bubble you don't want to get very far out in terms of your placements. On the other hand, you can't sell air. So eventually you have to place the goods. The balancing act between the supplier and us typically the fall placements are done this time of year, it's very early in the cycle. So it's just the first couple of weeks of November. We expect in another month we'll be a lot smarter as to what the costing is going to be in early fall. It would be naive to say that we don't think it's a problem for apparel manufacturers and apparel retailers. I think we have an advantage for about 50% below an average price point to the department stores in the other end of the mall, so to the extent that our price points are sharp. And the customer wants to trade into a lower price point because prices are going up over all. I think that gives us an advantage."

As to the overall Home business I mentioned earlier, housewares, particularly the coffee categories are very, very strong. The Luggage business which is more a profitable parts of your home happens to be one of the fastest-growing categories so that's obviously good news for Home margins. Margins in home have not been the issue, it's pretty more the customers' appetite for higher-priced big ticket merchandise.

We're virtually hitting every single one of those in growth things we have initiative that we've identified and this year and we'd expect to do the same in the coming years. The $1 billion in incremental volume in dotcom, frankly we're very confident about because we think the younger customers are really under penetrated on dotcom right now. We had that customer $27 million of them shopping on our store, that are not shopping yet with us online. That's a big opportunity for us to take the business from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. The last category, the third category is the billion dollar of incremental growth in store footprint or physical store environment. We expect to obviously find off mall 100,000 square-foot opportunities going forward. It's yet uncertain how many of those we can find in the time period. So far we've said about 75 it turns out to be 50 and 75 we do believe that there's smaller format opportunities that we can find that will be more urban or more suitable to markets where we already have a fairly big footprint, but we have in field [ph]opportunities. So that plus our big and tall off mall format that's not yet been announced in terms of its name but it will be approximately 300 stores as it rolls out. And we think that's a growth opportunity and then on the non-physical space in terms of the digital opportunities CLAD and Gifting Grace are also accretive to the overall growth of volume.

Our view of expenses, it's a number, but more importantly is how do we run the business. And grow the business, we obviously have to invest but not with a blind eye towards what it costs. But having a single centralized organization that has now 10 years experience gives us a lot more confidence in systems investments and the tools we're using to be more aggressive in taking expense out."

The contemporary piece of it is much smaller than the updated modern or the classic piece of our business. Conceptually, we lead it with Claiborne on the pad that's adjacent to American Living both are doing extremely well. As a matter of fact, American Living has benefited from adjacency of the Claiborne success. I wouldn't over state the size of MNG compared to the Claiborne business they're completely different business. The key is up 3x more productive than any other contemporary brand we have in the space. So it's obviously resonating, it's the only fast fashion in a department store in the country and when you say fast fashion it's not a 30 week cycle the most important fashion pieces are in a two to three week cycle. Somebody can say they had fast fashion, you say compared to what? I think the customer has been trained that they want what they see on the runway. They want what they see in Sarah, H&M, Forever 21, Mango, these are looks that they're expecting to see. We think it brings the right kind of patina to our business, that there's a reason to come to the store more often. And our biggest opportunity, Frank, is more frequent visits. We always look for white space. I would say that a.n.a. and Worthington are huge private brands that are very, very successful, operating much higher margin than national brands and they’re modern brands, so they do fill that space between the classic and the contemporary space. And just like the rest of the private brand businesses, we like the fact that they're going faster than national brands because that says that the customer is voting for the merchandise that we've designed and built at higher profitability."

This morning, we announced third quarter results of $0.19 per share. Now this reflects the combination of the actions we're taking to drive our top line with our continued focus on managing our costs and expenses in order to drive profitability. In fact, expenses came in even lower than we planned.
Earlier this year, we told you that our performance for the year would be second half loaded and that's exactly the way it's played out in spite of unseasonal weather in many areas of the country during the period. Our third quarter results reflect our growth initiatives, are waiting to take hold, and we feel good about the way we're positioned for the all-important Christmas season in the fourth quarter. I should note that November is off to a great start, since the weather has turned more seasonable in many parts of the country. With that, let me review our sales for the third quarter. I'll start with an update on the work being done by our co-chief merchants Liz Sweeney and Steve Lawrence, and their teams to continue to raise the style offering of our merchandise assortments. Specifically, the combination of the new looks we've introduced with new marketing approaches is serving us well. Here are a few highlights: first we began introducing Liz Claiborne, one of the nation's most recognized brands in August. It's in all 1,107 of our stores with the vast majority of our stores carrying all 26 categories of Liz Claiborne and Claiborne merchandise. The brand end is beating our plan across all businesses.
Second, our Men's business has been a top performer across the company year-to-date. This is due to the team's strategic decision to shift more of our merchandise mix into good and better price points, along with the improved level of style we now carry and the marketing which is targeted directly to male consumers.
Overall, we're very satisfied with this business we had a strong Father's Day and we're experiencing a strong trend in Men's since Father's Day. Third, the addition of MNG by Mango. This unique fast fashion brand is offered exclusively at JCPenney. It's drawn great attention to our contemporary assortments. MNG is now in 77 stores and performing well, with particular strength in our metropolitan stores. This brand will be in 600 stores at this time next year. Fourth, Call it Spring by ALDO launched in three stores this quarter will also be in 600 stores this time next year.
Prior this launch, we have already made considerable changes in our overall Modern Shoe and Handbag businesses, which has delivered strong results for us thus far. So with the addition of Call it Spring we feel very good about the future of our Modern Shoe and Handbag business. Fifth, in fine jewelry, our added assortments and introduction of new fashionable finds and re-brands at shopper price points is clearly resonated with our customers. Throughout the third quarter, find joy is one of our top performing divisions. Sixth, support inside JCPenney, once again this concert was a star performer. As of today, we're in 231 locations performing very well. On average, the foreign side JCPenney locations are 3x more productive than the rest of the store. We plan to open additional 75 stores inside JCPenney in 2011 and will have a total of 600 by the year 2014. Also I'd like to note that the growth initiatives we announced at the analyst meeting early in the year, all 14 growth initiatives are up year-to-date and ahead of our plan. To remind you, some of these were in the tops category across Juniors, Men's, Boys and Women's, our center core businesses, Fashion Jewelry, The National Brand Draw business, Ore and Metals and Fine Jewelry, Modern Shoes, Modern Handbags as well as our Kids business. So we feel good about identifying the growth opportunities, we knew the consumer wasn't going to help us much this year, we had to create our own growth and are quite pleased that we delivered on that objective.
Our marketing initiatives were also playing a critical role in this. JCPenney is one of the top 20 marketers in the country and we spend our dollars strategically in search of the reached the broadest group of costumers while ensuring we target our messages to read the right customers with the right messages in a way that relates to their lifestyle.
Overall, the changes we've made are attracting new customers to JCPenney as well as reaching an increasing number of younger customers who are attracted to our stepped-up style and compelling price points. 
We are also pursuing new marketing initiatives such as the partnership with People Style Watch. This alignment lends great credibility to our style authority and encourages customers to discover the new higher level of  fashion in merchandise assortments. Throughout the year, People Style Watch editors work with our trend and merchandising  teams to select must-haves from our fashion assortments focusing on women's and juniors apparel, accessories and footwear.
Since launching, the People Style Watch must-haves in store and at jcp.com, the results are very encouraging. Must haves items that are online essentially sell out. In our stores we've experienced some 25% sales lift on average, over the rest of selling for those things that have been identified as must-haves by those editors.
We're also in the process of integrating the rest of our print media from traditional catalogs to targeted print pieces. Future print media will be fully aligned to store at jcp.com assortments, and supported by enterprise-wide merchandising marketing and planning allocation. Our fine war print media will provide store selling associates additional support to help customers find the extended sizes and/or additional JCP merchandise offerings from one of our 40,000 .com-enabled terminals in our stores that they can also shop from home or from mobile devices using to find more media.
As we transition out of the Catalog business, we are working to rationalize certain assets related to our catalog operations, which we expect to result in expense savings over the long term.
Moving back now to the results for the quarter. We delivered 1.9% growth in comparable store sales. Our third consecutive quarter comparable store gains.  We're delivering on the promise for sequential sales growth during the year. Our quarterly comp includes a 2.3% gain in August and 5.1% comparable gain in September, making us once again a leader in the key back-to-school period. Customers responded well to the new brands, such as Uproar and Supergirl by Nastia as well as some of the long-term leaders including Arizona and national brands such as Zoo York and Vans. This performance early in the quarter was partially offset by our sales results in October. The facts there were that October was one of the warmest in 30 years and one of the driest in 20 years across the country and this impacted sales across our industry.
The bright spot for us is the non-seasoned merchandise category such as housewares, luggage, fashion jewelry continued to perform well and support to as a strong performer once again in October.
Traffic in our stores, both on and off mall, was up year-over-year for each month. Additionally the number of transactions and units per transaction were also up low to mid single digits over the year. And we'll note that the traffic in our off-mall locations was about 600 basis points higher than the traffic in our regional mall locations.
AUR was down for the quarter, which was our plan. Early this year we began a strategic effort to shift a greater portion of our assortments to good-better pricing versus better-best, as customers continue to be very price conscious. Through our industry sourcing organization which allows us to mitigate the costing pressures, and still maintain strong profitability, we were able to offer our customers sharp price points as well as stay true to our mission of being a commercial department store that America's families can rely on for affordable fashion. Additionally, we made it easier for our customers to recognize the value of our offer to our focus on our merchandising price clarity.
jcp.com experienced sales gains throughout the period of 3% for the quarter, which reflects solid performance across all categories as well as a continued positive impact given by our guided navigation technology with the success of our social media strategy to drive traffic to our site and the appeal of our free shipping offers. The strongest performing categories were men's as well as shoes and women's accessories and we also delivered positive sales on home categories online as growth initiatives in this business are striking to take hold on jcp.com, as well as in our stores.
Total inventory was up about 5% over last year. This includes an increase approximately 5% of customer based inventory over last year which is in line with both the company's initial sales plan for the fourth quarter and our targeted year-end inventory's reported growth initiatives entering next year. We believe we're in an appropriate and good inventory position entering the holiday season and we expect this to serve us well as we work to ensure that our price points are competitive in this highly promotional environment. Additionally, to remind you, we lost sales during the holiday season last year, because we thought our inventories were too low.
This year, JCPenney will be appropriately stocked throughout the period. With that, let me now turn it over, the call over to Bob for more detail on our financials."
295624,115380209,88050,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2010",2010-11-12,"Earnings Calls","Old COPPER Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results and outlook. Mike will then close with additional color around our plans for the fourth quarter and our growth initiatives before we open the ca",891,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will be speaking with you this morning about our financial results and outlook. Mike will then close with additional color around our plans for the fourth quarter and our growth initiatives before we open the call to questions. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.19 per share. This result reflects the team's focus on driving top line sales through our growth initiatives, while also continuing to manage our cost and expenses in order to drive profitability and deliver shareholder value. For the third quarter in a row, the company reported positive comparable store sales gains against last year as comparable store sales for the quarter increased 1.9%, essentially in line with our sales guidance for the quarter. As Mike mentioned, sales in August and September were strong, but this strength was offset by the company's performance in October as weather for the month was unseasonably warm, negatively impacting the sell-through cold-weather merchandise.
Gross margin decreased $61 million for the third quarter to 39% of sales, primarily due to the discontinuation of our Big Book catalogs, promotional activities during the quarter and in part, to the shift in our merchandise mix to more items at good and better price points.
Although we guided for SG&A dollars to increase 2%, we are pleased that our teams were able to reduce SG&A dollars by 3.8% when compared to last year. For example, the company launched Liz Claiborne during the quarter, which was supported by a successful and expensive marketing campaign, yet marketing expenses were actually down year-over-year as we reallocated print spend to local and national advertising and online media. The company also benefited from the efficiencies we continue to generate through our tools and processes like jTime and door to floor, which helped to manage store staffing to customer traffic. In addition, the company also recorded a reduction in its incentive compensation accrual, which positively impacted SG&A for the quarter.
Total operating expenses were down significantly to last year, declining 4.9% or $78 million. Operating income for the quarter was up 15.9% to $124 million compared with $107 million last year. As noted in the release, if we exclude the impact of the non-cash qualified pension plan expense from both this year's and last year's third quarter, adjusted operating income was flat both in dollars and as a percent of sales. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $64 million in the prior year, reflecting both lower debt and interest rate levels.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. This is lower than expected due to a positive adjustment resulting from the true up to actuals after the filing of the company's tax return. And we had approximately $238 million average diluted shares for the quarter. For the bottom line, net income improved 63% to $44 million or $0.19 per share for the quarter. Adjusting net income for the impact of the qualifying pension plan, net income increased 11% to $80 million or $0.34 a share, up 13%.
Moving onto our financial condition. We remain in a strong financial position with continued flexibility to support the key components of our growth initiatives and the Long Range Plan. As of October 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, our free cash flow remains on plan to end the year at approximately $200 million.
Also capital expenditures for the nine months reported were approximately $380 million as we continue to reinvest in our existing stores and our growth initiatives. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. As announced earlier this week and as Mike will discuss, we are also investing in two high potential retail opportunities designed to grow our sales by expanding our customer reach into new ventures online, Gifting Grace and CLAD. Turning now to the company's outlook for the remainder of the year.
We expect comparable store sales to be up 3% or 4% in the fourth quarter. Due to the company's discontinuation of its Big Book catalogs, total sales are expected to increase approximately 150 basis points less than comparable store sales.
For the quarter, we expect gross margins as a percent of sales to modestly decline. And as a reminder, the company is up against historic peak margins achieved in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A dollars are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization should be approximately $141 million. Net interest expense should be about $58 million and we expect a tax rate of approximately 37%.
We currently anticipate about 238 million average diluted shares including about 2 million common stock equivalents. Earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share and for the full year, the company still expects comparable store sales to increase low single digits and for earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. In summary, as we move into the fourth quarter, we are confident that our continued focus on disciplined execution of our business and our long-range plan strategies will foster financial flexibility and further strengthen our business for long-term success.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Ullman for more details on the company's performance and outlook."

Second, our stores are now fully set for the Christmas holiday. Additionally this season, 200 JCPenney stores that don't currently have a support inside JCPenney beauty boutique. We're featuring a pop-up shop carrying a selection of sought after beauty and fragrance products and gift sets.
Third, we've increased our marketing spend in the fourth quarter to ensure there's a very loud steady drumbeat touting JCPenney as the Christmas gift headquarters. Our integrated marketing campaign which includes a very robust promotional counter will highlight our competitive merchandise offering. And additionally, we just launched a new mobile commerce site this week, so customers can shop directly from their smartphones. 
On November 1, we began a free shipment return to store program as well for all orders made online or through mobile applications. We think this is a unique offering among our peer group. Finally, we are offering special incentives for our JCP Rewards customers during the Christmas holiday season. Our rewards program now has over 24 million members. 
Before we open the call to your questions, I want to quickly touch on some of the longer-term initiatives we're pursuing for 2011 and beyond. We announced a couple of weeks ago that we plan to expand our presence in major markets, which are currently underserved by JCPenney and offer great potential for us to our demographic profiles. This should begin next year with the opening of three new stores, one in San Francisco Bay area, one in suburban Maryland just outside Washington DC, and in Central Dallas and we expect to announce further details on our new start growth plans shortly. At the same time, we're committed to elevating in store JCPenney experience through our comprehensive renovation program. This year in 2010, we made significant in-store enhancements in more than 750 stores, including 76 major renovations and by 2014, we plan to complete major remodels in more than 375 additional source.
Taken together, these new openings and renovation program will help enable JCPenney to deliver on our goal of being an industry growth leader by maximizing sales productivity in our existing locations and expanding our customer base in key markets.
Additionally, we announced yesterday the creation of a new business, the Growth Brands Division, which will pursue high potential opportunities in the retail sector. These initiatives will be separate from our core JCPenney brand and will capitalize in our retail expertise in strategically pursuing untapped opportunities to serve key customer segments and drive sales growth.
Our opportunities initiatives will include both digital and retail store opportunities reflects our long range plan objective of growth leadership in the industry . The first two businesses under this new division, CLAD and Gifting Grace will launch in summer of 2011 and both are strategic collaborations with the First Magazine group.
The First Magazine group will lend its vast brand expertise in consumer reach. We will leverage our industry-leading retail infrastructure. Both initiatives will be Online Retail businesses and are unlikely to be like anything that exists in the market today. CLAD will be a complete online modern menswear resource aimed at fashionable men offering a full assortment of well curated [ph] designer brands in a savvy digital environment.
This business will be run Will Swillie, who joins us after having just built the Men's business at Rue La La. Gifting Grace will be a compressive online gifting resource offering extensive assortment of unique and memorable gift items compelling content and convenient tools for the year-around gift giver. This will be led by Mary Drolet, the retail patron and founder of Club Libby Lu. Will and Mary will both report to Anne Sutherland Fuchs, a highly experienced branding and digital executive who recently joined us.
Along with our new growth brands division, we're continuing our transformational journey of our core JCPenney brand into a destination for discovering great style and compelling prices.
We believe we enjoy a very solid position in regional malls as the price leader among the anchor tenants and at the same time in off mall locations, we offer the only true department store experience at affordable and compelling prices. Lastly, I'd like to congratulate all of our 150,000 associates for just completing our fourth year of our GREAT customer service program. Great stands for greet, respect, engage, assist and thank. We've enjoyed for the last two years being number one in customer service among stores in the U.S. and it's a great credit to our sales associates for their diligence in this area.
Their continued dedication to serving our customers has really differentiated us from the competition, fares us well to deliver to our customers during the Christmas holiday season. So now operator, please open the line for questions."

So it was probably more severe than we'd do in the fourth quarter. As we start to wind down it's less of an issue. As I've said, we want to be out of this business by the end of the quarter, so our anticipation at this point is it will not be a big factor. The issue of how jcp.com performs over holiday obviously will impact the overall margin, the direct category. We think we can transition all these business that we're walking away from in terms of the traditional catalog and the different print media vehicles like, fine war print media. This actually would be accretive to our margin as far as de-leveraging the inventory as well as the print media form. We're not getting out of the Print business, but we're getting out of the traditional Catalog business, which was tied to call centers and fulfillment processes and specific actions by customers to go online to enter in order that they first saw in the catalog. So re-purposing all of that, we get the inventory aligned with more of a store inventory, so we actually have the youngest customer being the predominant customer on the Internet as opposed to the oldest we think over time is a very important shift."

I think many of our competitors work with smaller suppliers may have had more difficulty dealing with that but we got ahead of it. Cotton prices have been the biggest driver of concern throughout '11 and particularly in second half. In some cases manufacturers aren't even taking orders at this point because they don't feel like they can anticipate what their costing is going to be. We're in better shape than that. We are able to place orders. Once again, we will work hard to try to change the offering in such a way to shield the price increase as much as possible from the consumer, but the fact is if cotton goes up 50% or 70% or whatever it lands, there will be an impact on pricing that everybody in our industry is going to feel. And our objective is to have a competitive advantage particularly on key price points that the customer would expect us to maintain. This can be done obviously through a change in mix, in terms of how we promote the business, but importantly how we manage the costing in Asia. Having the ability to move between countries, the ability to move within a very established supplier base that works with us hand in hand, I think is an advantage.

Because if you think it's a spec add to the bubble you don't want to get very far out in terms of your placements. On the other hand, you can't sell air. So eventually you have to place the goods. The balancing act between the supplier and us typically the fall placements are done this time of year, it's very early in the cycle. So it's just the first couple of weeks of November. We expect in another month we'll be a lot smarter as to what the costing is going to be in early fall. It would be naive to say that we don't think it's a problem for apparel manufacturers and apparel retailers. I think we have an advantage for about 50% below an average price point to the department stores in the other end of the mall, so to the extent that our price points are sharp. And the customer wants to trade into a lower price point because prices are going up over all. I think that gives us an advantage."

I think we've mentioned already is the catalog piece hopefully it will be passed that by the end of the quarter, but we don't expect any major surprises there. As to the overall Home business I mentioned earlier, housewares, particularly the coffee categories are very, very strong. The Luggage business which is more a profitable parts of your home happens to be one of the fastest-growing categories so that's obviously good news for Home margins. Margins in home have not been the issue, it's pretty more the customers' appetite for higher-priced big ticket merchandise.

We're virtually hitting every single one of those in growth things we have initiative that we've identified and this year and we'd expect to do the same in the coming years. The $1 billion in incremental volume in dotcom, frankly we're very confident about because we think the younger customers are really under penetrated on dotcom right now. We had that customer $27 million of them shopping on our store, that are not shopping yet with us online. That's a big opportunity for us to take the business from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. The last category, the third category is the billion dollar of incremental growth in store footprint or physical store environment. We expect to obviously find off mall 100,000 square-foot opportunities going forward. It's yet uncertain how many of those we can find in the time period. So far we've said about 75 it turns out to be 50 and 75 we do believe that there's smaller format opportunities that we can find that will be more urban or more suitable to markets where we already have a fairly big footprint, but we have in field [ph]opportunities. So that plus our big and tall off mall format that's not yet been announced in terms of its name but it will be approximately 300 stores as it rolls out. And we think that's a growth opportunity and then on the non-physical space in terms of the digital opportunities CLAD and Gifting Grace are also accretive to the overall growth of volume. So we still believe that $3 billion, $1 billion, $1 billion, the $5 billion incremental in the fourth and fifth years that is the right objective and we're preparing to go after it.

Without a layoff, without a severance. That using the technology and tools of jTime as well as door to floor. Our headquarters expense came off about 350 fewer associates in home office than we did it several years ago. This is with obviously technology and active attention to performance management. So obviously people that aren't doing as well are canceled out of business to allow us to continue to track the best talent and reward the best talent we have this year. Our view of expenses, it's a number, but more importantly is how do we run the business. And grow the business, we obviously have to invest but not with a blind eye towards what it costs. But having a single centralized organization that has now 10 years experience gives us a lot more confidence in systems investments and the tools we're using to be more aggressive in taking expense out."

The contemporary piece of it is much smaller than the updated modern or the classic piece of our business. Conceptually, we lead it with Claiborne on the pad that's adjacent to American Living both are doing extremely well. As a matter of fact, American Living has benefited from adjacency of the Claiborne success. I wouldn't over state the size of MNG compared to the Claiborne business they're completely different business. The key is up 3x more productive than any other contemporary brand we have in the space. So it's obviously resonating, it's the only fast fashion in a department store in the country and when you say fast fashion it's not a 30 week cycle the most important fashion pieces are in a two to three week cycle. Somebody can say they had fast fashion, you say compared to what? I think the customer has been trained that they want what they see on the runway. They want what they see in Sarah, H&M, Forever 21, Mango, these are looks that they're expecting to see. We think it brings the right kind of patina to our business, that there's a reason to come to the store more often. And our biggest opportunity, Frank, is more frequent visits. We always look for white space. I would say that a.n.a. and Worthington are huge private brands that are very, very successful, operating much higher margin than national brands and they’re modern brands, so they do fill that space between the classic and the contemporary space. And just like the rest of the private brand businesses, we like the fact that they're going faster than national brands because that says that the customer is voting for the merchandise that we've designed and built at higher profitability."
