A bedrock principle of this team is that we meet our commitments to our stakeholders, starting with the owners of the company.

A bedrock principle of this team is that we meet our commitments to our stakeholders, starting with the owners of the company. Since this management team has been fully in place, we have met or exceeded every element of the adjusted financial guidance we have provided. Despite an extremely dynamic operating and policy environment. The 2009 results we report today continue our adherence to that commitment. And our financial guidance for 2010 reflects our plan to continue to deliver results and meet our commitments. That guidance reflects a careful balance between two critical elements. First, we continue to drive costs out of the business and improve our productivity in everything we do. We are also making our cost structure more flexible, so that we can adjust our costs as needed. Second, we are making focused, disciplined investments where we see the greatest opportunities for growth whether in Emerging Markets, Established Products, in-line products, preparing the market for coming launches or in the pipeline. As a result, we see a portfolio with less risks, continued growth in adjusted earnings per share and more consistent earnings growth over time. In that regard, we are also providing today our targets for 2012, which given their long-term nature are necessarily subject to less certainty than our guidance for this year. We have refined and revised the 2012 targets what we provided when we announced the Wyeth acquisition based on a thorough, bottoms up review of all aspects of our business since we closed the transaction. In developing these targets, we have the benefit of the deep and current understanding that our business leaders around the world have of their respective markets, customers and products. The leaders who will have accountability for the performance of their businesses.Those targets show that Pfizer has come along way in a short time. Only a couple of years ago, we faced a significant clip in revenue and earnings in 2012 due to the coming loss of exclusivity for Lipitor. Today, thanks to the changes that we have made, the Wyeth acquisition and the hard work of thousands of people. Our targets for 2012 project adjusted earnings per share that are higher than both our 2009 actual results and our 2010 guidance. Now before Frank provides more detail, let me offer some additional perspective.For the past three years, we have been transforming the company's strategy, leadership and culture. First, strategy. We aimed over time for modest top line growth, better bottom line growth and steady, consistent earnings growth. To achieve these goals, we are diversifying our sources of revenue as well as the risks of our investments. At the same time, we continue to reduce our costs, continuously improve our productivity and make our cost structure more flexible. And above all, we maintain a strong commitment to exercising discipline in how we spend our owners capital. In 2009, we significantly advanced these strategies in many ways, mostly significantly of course through the Wyeth acquisition. We also fully implemented our unique business model of customer facing units with responsibility from proof of concept through the entire product lifecycle. Our business leaders are empowered to seize new sources of value, guided by disciplined and appropriate capital allocation requirements. One example this quarter that wouldn't have happened here even a year or two ago, we quickly secured a deal for a promising compound to treat Borchert's disease. Next, leadership. Over the past three years, we've substantially enhanced our leadership at all levels, through internal promotions and through external hires from inside and outside the industry. In the fourth quarter, we added several outstanding Wyeth executives to our leadership ranks including Cavan Redmond, who leads our Diversified businesses; Mikael Dolsten, who leads our BioTherapeutics Research team; and Geno Germano, who leads our Specialty Care business. Two of our world-class Chief Scientific Officers, Emilio Emini in Vaccines; and Mene Pangalos [Menelas Pangalos] in Neuroscience, also joined us from Wyeth along with Lou Schmuckler, our Head of Biomanufacturing and many others. During the quarter, in addition to many important internal promotions, we also brought in a number of other key leaders from outside the company. For example, from GSK, Dr. Gauthier Aias Ramos [ph], in BioTherapeutics Research; from Sanofi, Dr. Patricia  Kabatoni [ph], heading Worldwide Safety Strategy; from AstraZeneca, where she ran the Cardiovascular business and launched major brands including Crestor, Adele Gulfo, our new head of U.S. Primary Care; from PepsiCo, where he led the Gatorade brand Todd Magazine, our new President of North America for Consumer Healthcare; from J&J, Mark Gilbert, our Head of R&D for Consumer Healthcare; from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Dr. Norm Greenberg, now our Director of Oncology. Strategy, leadership and finally, culture. I call it the spirit of small and the power of scale. Across Pfizer, our teams are now small enough to focus on meeting the unique needs of specific customers, patients, physicians, payers. They each have empowered leaders with the authority, the resources, the knowledge and expertise to make decisions, the entrepreneurial mindset and agility to implement those decisions quickly. And most importantly, the accountability for the results of their decisions. And all of this is backed by Pfizer's global scale and resources. A distinct competitive advantage. This is allowing us to take actions to enhance shareholder value. Actions that are hard to imagine happening at Pfizer even a few years ago. For example, who would've thought that Pfizer would join forces with GSK to create ViiV Healthcare, a separate company that brings the industry's best assets in combating HIV/AIDS.Today, we are working hard to unleash creative thinking and fast disciplined execution throughout the company. The watch words of our culture are speed, focus, accountability, execution, results. In the last quarter, we saw a proof of that in the integration which continues to move quickly. On the day after closing, we announced all country leaders and all headquarters sites. Within six days, every member of the U.S. field forced knew their status. Within 30 days, we announced an integrated plan for R&D site productions. Within 90 days, we completed a scientifically complex prioritization across the two companies and announced Pfizer's new combined R&D pipeline. This is all the result of the close working relationships forming across the organization.This is especially true in R&D, where collaboration is advancing important programs. A great example is work on our beta amyloid vaccine for Alzheimer's disease, which is currently in Phase II studies. This program represents a joint effort across legacy research units from the two companies and across modalities, by our Vaccines team and  BioTherapeutics, our Neuroscience team and PharmaTherapeutics and our partners at J&J's Janssen unit. These changes in strategy, leadership and culture are for one purpose, to deliver value to our stakeholders. That in turn, requires execution and a relentless focus on results. And if you look the operating performance legacy Pfizer in today's release, you can see these changes paying off. In Emerging Markets for the first time, we saw a double-digit revenue growth, led by China, India, Brazil and Russia. The Established Products business consisting of products that historically simply decline, actually grew 1% on an operational basis for the first time. Now while the results in this business will vary, our long-term strategy of stabilization and ultimately growth is on track. In the patent protective portfolio, in-line products like Lipitor, Lyrica, Chantix, Geodon, Xalatan and Zyvox continue to perform well both internationally and in the U.S. Across all of these businesses, we will continue to focus on reducing costs, making our cost structure more flexible and improving productivity. And we will also make focused, disciplined investments where there is opportunity for profitable growth. That's why our Emerging Markets business has increased the size of our field force in China. That's why Established Products has built a portfolio that now includes about 600 products.  And that's why our primary Specialty and Oncology business units will continue to invest in the right products, in the right markets, consistent with their rigorous ROI models and their deep understandings of their customers and markets. And that's why we will make the right investments in market development at the right time to ensure that when we launch the exciting new products in our pipeline, we will be successful.All of this makes me very optimistic about our company and our future. But of course, what most excites all of us at Pfizer are all the scientific advances give us so many opportunities to make a difference in the lives of millions of people. With the substantial assets and capabilities of the two legacy companies, and the extraordinary scientific talent that we have assembled from both inside and outside Pfizer, we can attack some of the most feared diseases of our time. Our portfolio reflects our focus on those opportunities that we believe provide the greatest potential for investing our owners capital, and that represent our commitment to therapeutic diversity and diversity of approaches. We now have 133 compounds in development, including 27 Biologics and six vaccines, bringing our ratio of small molecules to Biologics from 3:1 to 1.3:1. We are especially enthusiastic about our late base portfolio. We now have 34 compounds in Phase III development across various indications. Among the most noteworthy of these are Dimebon for Alzheimer's disease, Tazo Axitinib, our JAK Inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, Apixaban for cardiovascular indications, Tanezumab for pain, Axitinib for renal cell carcinoma, additional indications for SUTENT and studies of the Prevnar 13 Vaccine in adults. We know of course, that it is very unlikely that every single trial we conduct will produce exactly the results that we all hoped. That's the nature of our business, but we are more enthusiastic about our late stage pipeline than we have been in years. In some, we're on the right course. We have the right strategy, the right leadership and the right culture to continue changing Pfizer in the right ways that will create value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Frank."

Because the Wyeth acquisition was October 15, 2009, we are incorporating Wyeth's results from that point forward, which includes approximately two",2435,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Because the Wyeth acquisition was October 15, 2009, we are incorporating Wyeth's results from that point forward, which includes approximately two and a half months of Wyeth domestic results, and one point five months of Wyeth international results as Pfizer's international calendar ends on November 30. Now, let me get our financials. Fourth quarter 2009  reported revenues were $16.5 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34% or $4.2 billion due to $3.3 billion or 27% from the addition of legacy Wyeth products, $419 million or 3% operational growth from legacy Pfizer products and $469 million or 4% from foreign exchange.Fourth quarter 2009 reported net income increased 188% to $767 million and reported diluted EPS increased 150% to $0.10 year-over-year due to higher revenues. The non-recurrence of the pretax and after-tax charge of $2.3 billion in the prior year quarter related to the resolution of certain investigations concerning Bextra and various other products, which were largely offset by higher acquisition-related costs which include transaction and integration costs, and restructuring charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition and significant purchase accounting adjustments. Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2009 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by tax benefits related to the sale of Vicuron and the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses associated with the acquisition of Wyeth. Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted income of $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 decreased year-over-year by 13% and 25% respectively. These results were favorably affected by higher revenues, but negatively impacted by increases in the following areas. Expenses primarily due to the addition of Wyeth operations, investments in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, net interest expense and the effective tax rate on adjusted income.Also, fourth quarter and full year '09 reported and adjusted diluted EPS were adversely affected by the increase in the number of shares outstanding versus 2008, primarily due to the issuance of shares to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted cost of sales was $2.9 billion or 17.5%, as a percentage of revenues versus 11.7% or $1.4 billion in the year ago quarter. Driven by first, the overall change in mix of products and businesses due to the Wyeth acquisition, essentially, what you're seeing is a blend of gross margin now for both Pfizer and Wyeth. And second, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange, adjusted fourth quarter cost of sales was 14.4% of revenues.It's important to note that fourth quarter adjusted cost of sales included the full manufacturing network of both companies. That said, we see opportunities to lower the combined company's adjusted cost of sales going forward.Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses increased 52% to $5.3 billion year-over-year resulting from the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, increased investment in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Fourth quarter adjusted R&D expenses increased year-over-year to $2.8 billion or 27% due to the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late stage development portfolio, cost associated with Established Products business development transactions and the negative impact of foreign exchange.The fourth quarter '09 effective tax rate on adjusted income increased to about 28% versus about 24% in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition.Because the adjusted diluted EPS calculation includes the additional shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition, there is a variance in the year-over-year percentage changes and adjusted diluted EPS compared with adjusted income.Last quarter, we updated our full year '09 guidance to reflect the inclusion of Wyeth from and after the closing date and we achieved full year '09 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. While our '09 guidance range reported diluted EPS excluded estimates for acquisition-related costs, our actual results included these. Consequently, '09 reported diluted EPS of $1.23 was lower than our previous guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50. On an adjusted results basis, FX increased fourth quarter revenues by approximately $469 million or 4% year-over-year. On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted total adjusted cost in the fourth quarter by $720 million or 10%, which resulted in a $0.02 net decrease in adjusted diluted EPS. Most notably, foreign exchange had a $568 million or 39% negative impact on cost of sales.Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total cost increased operationally by 44% due to the inclusion of legacy Wyeth operations and the continued investment in high-growth areas. Now let's move to the results of our commercial organizations. As you can see from the chart, Biopharmaceutical revenues increased year-over-year which included the $419 million or 4% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Operationally, Biopharmaceutical revenues increased $2.9 billion or 26% year-over-year due to $2.5 billion or 22% from the addition of Wyeth products and about $400 million or 4% from legacy Pfizer products.Primary Care revenues increased 10% year-over-year, including a 4% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 6% was due to the addition of Premarin, a legacy Wyeth product and operational improvements in Lyrica and Alliance revenues. Specialty Care revenues increased 84% year-over-year, including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 79% was due to the addition of Wyeth Specialty Care portfolio, particularly, Enbrel and Prevnar and operational growth of Xalatan and Zyvox among others.Established product revenues increased by 57% year-over-year, which included a 6% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 51% was due to the addition of legacy Wyeth products primarily driven by Effexor, the launch of six products in the U.S. bringing the number of solid oral dose license products launched in the U.S. to 26, the launch of five in-license products in the newly created U.S. sterile injectables unit, higher antibiotic sales and the stabilization of the rate decline of some LOE products.As you all recall, we created the Established Products unit to recapture value for products that have lost or will soon lose patent protection for marketing exclusivity. And we're pleased that in fourth quarter '09, legacy Pfizer contributed plus 1% of operational growth year-over-year to Established Products growth, positive growth for the first time. We do expect that the financial results for this unit will continue to vary quarterly depending on the products that have lost exclusivity and where they have lost exclusivity, the existence of generic alternatives and other factors. Emerging Markets revenues increased 25% year-over-year, including a 1% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 24% was due to the addition of Enbrel and Prevnar legacy Wyeth products and double-digit growth in priority markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.In fourth quarter '09, legacy Pfizer contributed 10% of operational growth to Emerging Markets results. This is the first quarter that legacy Pfizer has contributed double-digit operational growth to Emerging Markets results since the launch of this unit.Oncology revenues increased 11% year-over-year including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 6% was due to the addition of Wyeth's oncology portfolio, the continued solid performance of SUTENT despite increasing market challenges which were partially offset by the continued negative impact of Camptosar's LOE in most European markets in July 2009.Fourth quarter '09 diversified revenues increased 83% year-over-year, which included a favorable impact of $45 million or 5% from foreign exchange. Operational growth, 78% was due to an 11% operational increase in Animal Health revenues due to the addition of Wyeth's Fort Dodge products and an increase in legacy Pfizer's Animal Health revenues, and the addition of Wyeth Consumer Healthcare which includes Centrum, Advil and Robitussin among other products in Wyeth's Nutrition products. And an increase in Capsugel revenues due to strength in all regions and across all major product groups.In January of '09, Pfizer implemented a new cost reduction program expected to achieve gross reductions of approximately $3 billion at '08 average exchange rates compared with '08 adjusted total cost. As we previously said, we anticipate a $2 billion net decrease in adjusted total cost, as we expect to reinvest about $1 billion of those reductions in the business. At the same time, we also said we expect to generate $4 billion in synergies from the Wyeth acquisition. We now anticipate generating net synergies of about $2 billion to $3 billion after reinvestment. We are now combining the projected cost reductions from these two initiatives and expect to generate in the aggregate, gross cost reduction of about $7 billion and net cost reductions of about $4 billion to $5 billion by the end of 2012 at 2008  average exchange rates versus Pfizer and Wyeth's combined fully pro forma adjusted total cost.We expect approximately $2 billion to $3 billion of these reductions to be reinvested to potential growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond, such as Emerging Markets, Established Products, in-line product support and expected new product launches.Our cost reduction initiatives continue to span essentially all divisions, functions, markets and sites across Pfizer. For example, broad categories of activity include manufacturing and research site exits, targeting workforce reductions and outsourcing. We continue to expect about 50% of the projected reductions to come from SI&A and the remainder from R&D and manufacturing. In addition, we continue to expect the Wyeth acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2011.Consistent with our statements during the last earnings call, during the fourth quarter, we reinvested a portion of the year-to-date net cost reductions about $750 million in the following areas. Business development transactions in Established Products, resulting in license agreements this quarter with Protalix, Strides and Claris; incremental promotional efforts in the U.S. primarily around Primary Care products, including Lipitor, Lyrica and Chantix this fourth quarter '09 growth rates improved sequentially; and promotional efforts in Emerging Markets, which contributed to the 10% overall legacy Pfizer Emerging Markets year-over-year growth and strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter in Brazil, Russia, India and China.Net of these investments, we reduced Pfizer standalone cost by $200 million on a constant currency basis for full year '09 versus '08. We believe we can achieve our cost reduction targets as we begin to realize the benefits of some of the synergy decisions we've made including determining headquarters locations, rationalizing our R&D portfolio and reducing our R&D real estate footprint buy about 35%.In addition, we will continue making decisions quickly, including refining the combined company's manufacturing network strategy within the next few months. We are confident in our ability to achieve the previously mentioned $4 billion to $5 billion projected cost reductions, while continuing to reinvest in the business.Now we'll move on to 2010 financial guidance, which is based on late January exchange rates and does not assume the completion of any new business development transactions, not completed as of December 31, 2009. The guidance also excludes the potential impact of healthcare reform in the U.S.In 2010, we currently expect for the combined company, reported revenues in the range of $67 billion to $69 billion, cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of 19% to 20%, adjusted SI&A in the range of $19 billion to $20 billion, adjusted R&D expenses in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.6 billion, adjusted other deductions in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, effective tax on adjusted income of about 30%, reported diluted EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.10 and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.20.2010 revenue and EPS guidance was negatively impacted by the recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange. For example, based on exchange rates and in late January, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has decreased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by about $0.06. Finally, it's important to note that in 2010, Pfizer's U.S. Biopharmaceutical organization is evolving its U.S. distribution model to a fee-for-service approach in the U.S. Plans for this change were in place prior to the Wyeth acquisition and Wyeth already has a fee-for-service arrangement in the U.S. This change should not have a significant impact of 2010 results. It should, however, have a slight one-time impact on seasonal sales patterns in the first and the second quarter 2010.We expect first quarter sales of legacy Pfizer products to moderately decrease year-over-year, which we then expect will be offset by a moderate year-over-year increase in second quarter sales. We're updating and expanding our 2012 financial targets. We've added targets for reported diluted EPS, adjusted R&D expenses, adjusted other deductions and the effective tax rate on adjusted income. We now expect 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $66 billion to $68.5 billion, which reflects the divestiture of Animal Health assets required by the regulatory authorities, a revenue shift to the newly formed HIV company via healthcare resulting from our joint venture with GSK, and Wyeth's return of its RELISTOR rights to the licensor.All combined, these items decreased the previous target by about $1.5 billion. We also expect in 2012 adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $8 billion to $ 8.5 billion, adjusted other deductions to be in range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, adjusted operating margins to be in the previously expected range of high-30s to low-40s percent. The effective tax rate on adjusted income to be about 30%, reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.73, adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of 2.25 to 2.35 is based on approximately 8.1 billion shares currently outstanding, and an operating cash flow of $19 billion or more.It's important to note that 2012 targets assume the current rate of inflation, any meaningful change in this rate can cause these targets to change. Both our 2010 guidance and 2012 targets reflect our confidence in the business and bounce to the achievement of our expected cost reductions with the anticipated increased investment to drive longer-term top and bottom line performance. In addition, in 2012 our targets assume a modest level of planned business development activities. I want to emphasize that these longer-term targets are subject to greater variability and uncertainty due to macroeconomic factors. So to summarize the key takeaways, we achieved full year '09 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We realized $200 million in Pfizer standalone net operational cost reductions after a significant investment in our growth opportunities. We provided 2010 financial guidance, which balances investments in high-growth opportunities with our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, and we updated our 2012 financial targets adding additional line item targets. And as demonstrated by our performance this quarter, we continue to deliver operationally while advancing the integration of Wyeth. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

And then I'm going to ask Frank and Ian to elaborate. We've had the benefit now since the closing of the Wyeth transaction to really dig deep into the opportunities that the two companies provide and to really consider where there's opportunities to invest in growth. We have now with our business model, a very I think, very rigorous process. And as we've talked about in the past, we really apply very different hurdle rates to different businesses based on the various risks that they present, which vary and it's a pretty disciplined process and we have looked at where there are opportunities in these different businesses, based on their growth opportunities, based on what they see in their different markets. And we also, as I mentioned in my comments, and Frank and Ian can elaborate on this, want to do that in a flexible way so that we can adjust our costs and investments as needed. So what we're talking about for 2010 reflects a very thorough review of where those investments can be made in both the short and the long term to grow the business so that's the approach we took. I'll let Frank and Ian give you more specifics, but I just wanted to give you that overview of how we thought about it. And I think actually, that we're very excited about a lot of those opportunities but I want to emphasize that it's a balance between continuing to reduce costs both on an absolute basis but also create a flexible cost structure so that we can flex it as needed and as this business requirements demand. But also kind of a real bottoms up business leader focus, market by market customer set by customer set opportunities for growth that we approached in a pretty disciplined way and that's how we come about these investment opportunities. So let me ask Frank and Ian to take your questions both about the 2010 issue and the 2012 revenues.

So couple of things that happened. One, the first bridge is from 70 to 68.5, which is the top end of our new target range, three things. The planned Animal Health divestitures, the second item is the HIV joint venture via healthcare, and then the third item is basically the return of RELISTOR rights to the licensor. Those three items were not in the approximately $70 billion I'm talking about that we had issued. So that takes you from roughly $70 billion to $68.5 billion. Then in terms of the new range the 66 to 68.5, we've had a year now since we issued that target back in January, we've had a year with a new business unit model in place and getting the benefits of that model. We've integrated Wyeth, we've had four months or so now post-integration with Wyeth and when we factor in all the data, all the bottoms up work that we've done, we are now updating the target to $66 billion to $68.5 billion and we have confidence in our ability to achieve that number so that's the 2012 revenue item. On 2010 and on investments, I'll touch on this. Ian, I'll let you make some comments and we may want some product comments on this and not just limiting to SI&A, although Catherine talked about SI&A. Kind of at a high level, on a general level and then I'll let Ian get into some of the detail. The opportunity growth areas that we've been talking about where we continue to see opportunities. So it's Emerging Markets, where we continue to invest, I'll call it additional marketing investment in the focus countries, adding field force, promotional tools, sales tools, we saw some of the benefits of that this past quarter with double-digit growth in legacy Pfizer Emerging Market, and very strong double-digit growth in many of our priority countries, continuing to invest in Established Markets. Once again, sales on the street on SI&A and also continuing to work through other growth opportunity areas that we see. Ian?"

So a lot of our incremental investment will be in flexible spending and directly behind products. So certainly in the Emerging Markets we're adding field force as fast as we can with quality field force in China or in Brazil and some of the other markets. In Established Products we're adding Dossias and adding opportunities and really focusing on market by market which requires targeted promotional spend. In the U.S. Prevnar 13 adult, where it need to ramp up for that it'll probably require a primary care field for us to really fully explore this opportunity, similarly, in Europe and Western Europe, the same nature investment, a lot of pre-marketing investments prepare the market. And then inside the U.S., reporting variable spend behind some of the major products that we need to grow through this period, such as Lyrica, where we've seen in the fourth quarter, with that increase DTC spend, good improvements in market share for DPN/PHN and fibromyalgia. Chantix, which I'd like to point out in the three years Chantix being on the market prior to third quarter, it only had had 18 weeks of DTC in those three years. So we are putting substantial effort behind that, both in December and in 2010. We can look at our areas of spend at Lipitor. We're continuing to depend Lipitor where it makes sense to maximize the revenues of Lipitor through its LOE. And even smaller products such as Toviaz where we now have new data with head-to-head superiority against Detrol in two clinical trials. So we see a lot of opportunity in that segment and we intend to invest behind this new product. So that gives you a scope. And if we take it to 2012, clearly, we need to do a lot of market preparation and development for our Alzheimer's franchise, which with Dimebon would be hopefully the first one into marketplace. We have our JAK3 inhibitor. We have our oncology portfolio, where we expect Axitinib to be entering or the c-Met/ALK inhibitor. We have Apixaban. we have Tanezumab. We have Pristiq, both its depression indication and its vasomotor indication and potentially, Aprela. So we have a rich, powerful late-stage portfolio which we need to invest in to produce the growth from '12 and onwards. And actually, I'd like to ask Martin and Michael if they want to add some color to those really exciting products."

There's really when all is said and done, there's three items that go through there in for 2012, it's really other deducts, it's a charge, it's a debit, interest income, interest expense and royalty income. So it goes down, give or take, by a couple of hundred million from 2010, so it is declining. We have some royalty income that declines over the period as well, and when you put all that together, you get the adjusted deduction income number that we put out there for 2012. Our priorities for capital and use of cash haven't changed. The priorities that we've talked about, that I've talked about before, whether it be the dividend, the amount of cash that were repatriate, debt re-paydowns, share buybacks, business development. Those haven't changed, they're all priorities, they continue to be priorities. On the tax rate, our tax rate this year on an adjusted income basis, which is 21.9%, we had guided to approximately 30%, and that's really being driven by the cash that we're repatriating from overseas as a result of the financing that we put in place for the Wyeth acquisition. So I view that as very similar to what we've been doing. The industry average is lower and we were lower than the industry. At last year, we were 22% and really, it's what we're as a result of the Wyeth acquisition that's caused the rate to increase. And on Prevnar, the short answer is yes to your question. It really was the result of ""lower Prevnar sales in anticipation of Prevnar 13 in the U.S."""

Within each geography, it's really different businesses, the different business, the products are different businesses, so it's really multiple businesses. But the point is, we have now a variety of businesses that give us opportunities to create value in many, many different markets with different risk profiles for investments with different ways of serving patients and customers. We see the potential for opportunities across these businesses and let's take Nutrition as an example. In China for instance, the combination of the expertise and experience that the legacy organizations have with respect to mothers and children, whether it be through vaccines with Prevnar for children, nutritions, whether it be the vitamin experience of the Consumer business, whether it be the legacy Pfizer business, there's lots of potential opportunities there for those businesses to create value together. Now I say potential because it's early days. And the proof will be in our ability to do that. And it's our obligation, as a management team, on behalf of our shareholders, to determine whether in fact that value can be realized over time and whether any of our businesses and assets create value for shareholders best together and inside Pfizer or whether there are other ways of doing that. And that, for example, was what led to the conclusion that in the case of, for example, the HIV/AIDS assets, that the best way to create value in that case was in the GSK deal. But as we sit here today, we're very excited about the businesses that we have and the potential and opportunities that they create for the company, and we're going to seize those opportunities and value, but it's incumbent upon all of us over time to continue to ensure that they do that.

I'm a little perplexed by commentary on DTC with Chantix. So maybe you can just give us a little bit more clarity on -- are those investments really being driven to the Emerging Markets to potentially accelerate and sustain that double-digit growth, and it's being traded from some of the markets where we're seeing very disappointing, I think across the industry not necessarily Pfizer related, but across the industry product launches in the U.S. markets that we're tracking today. And then secondly, I just wanted to go back to Jami's question on Prevnar 13 and what's happening in the U.S. and then also what's happening internationally in terms of the timing of the national immunization programs getting up and running with new product. Can you give us a little bit of an update on that and when we would see sort of pricing and incorporation into that finalized? And again, just Prevnar 13 in the U.S., what's happening and do you expect at least to have some response from the FDA prior to the ACIP meeting scheduled for February?"

But moving those resources out of those markets that you commented to on and moving towards the Emerging Markets. The increase in investments through '10 and '12, I'm talking about, are principally in the Emerging Markets and the DTC is exclusively in the United States and its behind products that we believe there's an opportunity for growth and we intend to invest behind them such as I said, Lyrica and its indications of fibromyalgia on DPN/PHN. We hope to expand those indications as we go through this period. Chantix, where we believe we need to put sustained support behind it, both from a field force and from DTC, given we now have the label changes over, and targeted support behind Lipitor. In regard to Prevnar 13, I really can't make any more comments on the FDA. As I said, we're very comfortable about submission and we're working towards approval in the United States. Abroad, we're beginning to launch but in reality, probably there'll be small countries on launch so far. We've won the tender in the U.K. for their program. There is some important tenders still pending like Turkey and other major markets. We've won some tenders in small countries like Gambia and Rwanda. And in general, the process is evolving as we predicted in our forecast."

A bedrock principle of this team is that we meet our commitments to our stakeholders, starting with the owners of the company.

A bedrock principle of this team is that we meet our commitments to our stakeholders, starting with the owners of the company. Since this management team has been fully in place, we have met or exceeded every element of the adjusted financial guidance we have provided. Despite an extremely dynamic operating and policy environment. The 2009 results we report today continue our adherence to that commitment. And our financial guidance for 2010 reflects our plan to continue to deliver results and meet our commitments. That guidance reflects a careful balance between two critical elements. First, we continue to drive costs out of the business and improve our productivity in everything we do. We are also making our cost structure more flexible, so that we can adjust our costs as needed. Second, we are making focused, disciplined investments where we see the greatest opportunities for growth whether in Emerging Markets, Established Products, in-line products, preparing the market for coming launches or in the pipeline. As a result, we see a portfolio with less risks, continued growth in adjusted earnings per share and more consistent earnings growth over time. In that regard, we are also providing today our targets for 2012, which given their long-term nature are necessarily subject to less certainty than our guidance for this year. We have refined and revised the 2012 targets what we provided when we announced the Wyeth acquisition based on a thorough, bottoms up review of all aspects of our business since we closed the transaction. In developing these targets, we have the benefit of the deep and current understanding that our business leaders around the world have of their respective markets, customers and products. The leaders who will have accountability for the performance of their businesses.Those targets show that Pfizer has come along way in a short time. Only a couple of years ago, we faced a significant clip in revenue and earnings in 2012 due to the coming loss of exclusivity for Lipitor. Today, thanks to the changes that we have made, the Wyeth acquisition and the hard work of thousands of people. Our targets for 2012 project adjusted earnings per share that are higher than both our 2009 actual results and our 2010 guidance. Now before Frank provides more detail, let me offer some additional perspective.For the past three years, we have been transforming the company's strategy, leadership and culture. First, strategy. We aimed over time for modest top line growth, better bottom line growth and steady, consistent earnings growth. To achieve these goals, we are diversifying our sources of revenue as well as the risks of our investments. At the same time, we continue to reduce our costs, continuously improve our productivity and make our cost structure more flexible. And above all, we maintain a strong commitment to exercising discipline in how we spend our owners’ capital. In 2009, we significantly advanced these strategies in many ways, mostly significantly of course through the Wyeth acquisition. We also fully implemented our unique business model of customer facing units with responsibility from proof of concept through the entire product lifecycle. Our business leaders are empowered to seize new sources of value, guided by disciplined and appropriate capital allocation requirements. One example this quarter that wouldn't have happened here even a year or two ago, we quickly secured a deal for a promising compound to treat Borchert's disease. Next, leadership. Over the past three years, we've substantially enhanced our leadership at all levels, through internal promotions and through external hires from inside and outside the industry. In the fourth quarter, we added several outstanding Wyeth executives to our leadership ranks including Cavan Redmond, who leads our Diversified Businesses; Mikael Dolsten, who leads our BioTherapeutics Research team; and Geno Germano, who leads our Specialty Care business. Two of our world-class Chief Scientific Officers, Emilio Emini in Vaccines; and Mene Pangalos [Menelas Pangalos] in Neuroscience, also joined us from Wyeth; along with Lou Schmuckler, our Head of Biomanufacturing; and many others. During the quarter, in addition to many important internal promotions, we also brought in a number of other key leaders from outside the company. For example, from GSK, Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos in BioTherapeutics Research; from Sanofi, Dr. Patricia  Kabatoni [ph], heading Worldwide Safety Strategy; from AstraZeneca, where she ran the Cardiovascular business and launched major brands including Crestor, Adele Gulfo, our new head of U.S. Primary Care; from PepsiCo, where he led the Gatorade brand, Todd Magazine, our new President of North America for Consumer Healthcare; from J&J, Mark Gilbert, our Head of R&D for Consumer Healthcare; from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Dr. Norm Greenberg, now our Director of Oncology. Strategy, leadership and finally, culture. I call it the spirit of small and the power of scale. Across Pfizer, our teams are now small enough to focus on meeting the unique needs of specific customers, patients, physicians, payers. They each have empowered leaders with the authority, the resources, the knowledge and expertise to make decisions, the entrepreneurial mindset and agility to implement those decisions quickly. And most importantly, the accountability for the results of their decisions. And all of this is backed by Pfizer's global scale and resources, a distinct competitive advantage. This is allowing us to take actions to enhance shareholder value, actions that are hard to imagine happening at Pfizer even a few years ago. For example, who would've thought that Pfizer would join forces with GSK to create ViiV Healthcare, a separate company that brings together the industry's best assets in combating HIV/AIDS.Today, we are working hard to unleash creative thinking and fast disciplined execution throughout the company. The watch words of our culture are speed, focus, accountability, execution, results. In the last quarter, we saw proof of that in the integration which continues to move quickly. On the day after closing, we announced all country leaders and all headquarter sites. Within six days, every member of the U.S. field force knew their status. Within 30 days, we announced an integrated plan for R&D site reductions. Within 90 days, we completed a scientifically complex prioritization across the two companies and announced Pfizer's new combined R&D pipeline. This is all the result of the close working relationships forming across the organization.This is especially true in R&D, where collaboration is advancing important programs. A great example is work on our beta amyloid vaccine for Alzheimer's disease, which is currently in Phase II studies. This program represents a joint effort across legacy research units from the two companies and across modalities, by our Vaccines team in BioTherapeutics, our Neuroscience team in PharmaTherapeutics, and our partners at J&J's Janssen unit. These changes in strategy, leadership and culture are for one purpose, to deliver value to our stakeholders. That in turn, requires execution and a relentless focus on results. And as you look at the operating performance of legacy Pfizer in today's release, you can see these changes paying off. In Emerging Markets for the first time, we saw double-digit revenue growth, led by China, India, Brazil and Russia. The Established Products business consisting of products that historically simply decline actually grew 1% on an operational basis for the first time. Now while the results in this business will vary, our long-term strategy of stabilization and ultimately growth is on track. In the patent-protected portfolio, in-line products like Lipitor, Lyrica, Chantix, Geodon, Xalatan and Zyvox continue to perform well both internationally and in the U.S. Across all of these businesses, we will continue to focus on reducing costs, making our cost structure more flexible and improving productivity. And we will also make focused, disciplined investments where there is opportunity for profitable growth. That's why our Emerging Markets business has increased the size of our field force in China. That's why Established Products has built a portfolio that now includes about 600 products.  And that's why our primary Specialty and Oncology business units will continue to invest in the right products, in the right markets, consistent with their rigorous ROI models and their deep understandings of their customers and markets. And that's why we will make the right investments in market development at the right time to ensure that when we launch the exciting new products in our pipeline, we will be successful.All of this makes me very optimistic about our company and our future. But of course, what most excites all of us at Pfizer are all the scientific advances that give us so many opportunities to make a difference in the lives of millions of people. With the substantial assets and capabilities of the two legacy companies, and the extraordinary scientific talent that we have assembled from both inside and outside Pfizer, we can attack some of the most feared diseases of our time. Our portfolio reflects our focus on those opportunities that we believe provide the greatest potential for investing our owners’ capital, and that represent our commitment to therapeutic diversity and diversity of approaches. We now have 133 compounds in development, including 27 Biologics and six vaccines, bringing our ratio of small molecules to Biologics from 3:1 to 1.3:1. We are especially enthusiastic about our late base portfolio. We now have 34 compounds in Phase III development across various indications. Among the most noteworthy of these are Dimebon for Alzheimer's disease, Tazo Axitinib, our JAK Inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, Apixaban for cardiovascular indications, Tanezumab for pain, Axitinib for renal cell carcinoma, additional indications for SUTENT and studies of the Prevnar 13 Vaccine in adults. We know of course, that it is very unlikely that every single trial we conduct will produce exactly the results that we all hoped. That's the nature of our business, but we are more enthusiastic about our late stage pipeline than we have been in years. In some, we're on the right course. We have the right strategy, the right leadership and the right culture to continue changing Pfizer in the right ways that will create value for our shareholders.

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Because the Wyeth acquisition was October 15, 2009, we are incorporating Wyeth's results from that point forward, which includes approximately two",2433,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Because the Wyeth acquisition was October 15, 2009, we are incorporating Wyeth's results from that point forward, which includes approximately two and a half months of Wyeth domestic results, and one point five months of Wyeth international results as Pfizer's international calendar ends on November 30. Now, let me get our financials. Fourth quarter 2009 reported revenues were $16.5 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34% or $4.2 billion due to $3.3 billion or 27% from the addition of legacy Wyeth products, $419 million or 3% operational growth from legacy Pfizer products and $469 million or 4% from foreign exchange.Fourth quarter 2009 reported net income increased 188% to $767 million and reported diluted EPS increased 150% to $0.10 year-over-year due to higher revenues. The non-recurrence of the pretax and after-tax charge of $2.3 billion in the prior year quarter related to the resolution of certain investigations concerning Bextra and various other products, which were largely offset by higher acquisition-related cost which include transaction and integration cost, and restructuring charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition and significant purchase accounting adjustments. Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2009 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by tax benefits related to the sale of Vicuron and the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses associated with the acquisition of Wyeth. Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted income of $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 decreased year-over-year by 13% and 25% respectively. These results were favorably affected by higher revenues, but negatively impacted by increases in the following areas. Expenses primarily due to the addition of Wyeth operations, investments in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, net interest expense and the effective tax rate on adjusted income.Also, fourth quarter and full year '09 reported and adjusted diluted EPS were adversely affected by the increase in the number of shares outstanding versus 2008, primarily due to the issuance of shares to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted cost of sales was $2.9 billion or 17.5%, as a percentage of revenues versus 11.7% or $1.4 billion in the year ago quarter. Driven by first, the overall change in mix of products and businesses due to the Wyeth acquisition, essentially, what you're seeing is a blend of gross margin now for both Pfizer and Wyeth. And second, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange, adjusted fourth quarter cost of sales was 14.4% of revenues.It's important to note that fourth quarter adjusted cost of sales included the full manufacturing network of both companies. That said, we see opportunities to lower the combined company's adjusted cost of sales going forward.Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses increased 52% to $5.3 billion year-over-year resulting from the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, increased investment in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Fourth quarter adjusted R&D expenses increased year-over-year to $2.8 billion or 27% due to the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late stage development portfolio, cost associated with Established Products business development transactions and the negative impact of foreign exchange.The fourth quarter '09 effective tax rate on adjusted income increased to about 28% versus about 24% in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition.Because the adjusted diluted EPS calculation includes the additional shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition, there is a variance in the year-over-year percentage changes and adjusted diluted EPS compared with adjusted income.Last quarter, we updated our full year '09 guidance to reflect the inclusion of Wyeth from and after the closing date and we achieved full year '09 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. While our '09 guidance range reported diluted EPS excluded estimates for acquisition-related costs, our actual results included these. Consequently, '09 reported diluted EPS of $1.23 was lower than our previous guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50. On an adjusted results basis, FX increased fourth quarter revenues by approximately $469 million or 4% year-over-year. On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted total adjusted cost in the fourth quarter by $720 million or 10%, which resulted in a $0.02 net decrease in adjusted diluted EPS. Most notably, foreign exchange had a $568 million or 39% negative impact on cost of sales.Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total cost increased operationally by 44% due to the inclusion of legacy Wyeth operations and the continued investment in high-growth areas. Now let's move to the results of our commercial organizations. As you can see from the chart, Biopharmaceutical revenues increased year-over-year which included the $419 million or 4% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Operationally, Biopharmaceutical revenues increased $2.9 billion or 26% year-over-year due to $2.5 billion or 22% from the addition of Wyeth products and about $400 million or 4% from legacy Pfizer products.Primary Care revenues increased 10% year-over-year, including a 4% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 6% was due to the addition of Premarin, a legacy Wyeth product and operational improvements in Lyrica and Alliance revenues. Specialty Care revenues increased 84% year-over-year, including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 79% was due to the addition of Wyeth Specialty Care portfolio, particularly, Enbrel and Prevnar and operational growth of Xalatan and Zyvox among others.Established product revenues increased by 57% year-over-year, which included a 6% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 51% was due to the addition of legacy Wyeth products primarily driven by Effexor, the launch of six products in the U.S. bringing the number of solid oral dose license products launched in the U.S. to 26, the launch of five in-license products in the newly created U.S. sterile injectables unit, higher antibiotic sales and the stabilization of the rate decline of some LOE products.As you’ll recall, we created the Established Products unit to recapture value for products that have lost or will soon lose patent protection for marketing exclusivity. And we're pleased that in fourth quarter '09, legacy Pfizer contributed plus 1% of operational growth year-over-year to Established Products growth, positive growth for the first time. We do expect that the financial results for this unit will continue to vary quarterly depending on products that have lost exclusivity and where they have lost exclusivity, the existence of generic alternatives and other factors. Emerging Markets revenues increased 25% year-over-year, including a 1% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 24% was due to the addition of Enbrel and Prevnar, legacy Wyeth products and double-digit growth in priority markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.In fourth quarter '09, legacy Pfizer contributed 10% of operational growth to Emerging Market results. This is the first quarter that legacy Pfizer has contributed double-digit operational growth to Emerging Markets results since the launch of this unit.Oncology revenues increased 11% year-over-year including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 6% was due to the addition of Wyeth's oncology portfolio, the continued solid performance of SUTENT despite increasing market challenges which were partially offset by the continued negative impact of Camptosar's LOE in most European markets in July 2009.Fourth quarter '09 diversified revenues increased 83% year-over-year, which included a favorable impact of $45 million or 5% from foreign exchange. Operational growth, 78% was due to an 11% operational increase in Animal Health revenues due to the addition of Wyeth's Fort Dodge products and an increase in legacy Pfizer's Animal Health revenues, and the addition of Wyeth Consumer Healthcare which includes Centrum, Advil and Robitussin among other products in Wyeth's Nutrition products, and an increase in Capsugel revenues due to strength in all regions and across all major product groups.In January of '09, Pfizer implemented a new cost reduction program expected to achieve gross reductions of approximately $3 billion at '08 average exchange rates compared with '08 adjusted total cost. As we previously said, we anticipate a $2 billion net decrease in adjusted total cost, as we expect to reinvest about $1 billion of those reductions in the business. At the same time, we also said we expect to generate $4 billion in synergies from the Wyeth acquisition. We now anticipate generating net synergies of about $2 billion to $3 billion after reinvestment. We are now combining the projected cost reductions from these two initiatives and expect to generate in the aggregate, gross cost reduction of about $7 billion and net cost reductions of about $4 billion to $5 billion by the end of 2012 at 2008 average exchange rates versus Pfizer and Wyeth's combined fully pro forma adjusted total cost.We expect approximately $2 billion to $3 billion of these reductions to be reinvested to potential growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond, such as Emerging Markets, Established Products, in-line product support and expected new product launches.Our cost reduction initiatives continue to span essentially all divisions, functions, markets and sites across Pfizer. For example, broad categories of activity include manufacturing and research site exits, targeting workforce reductions and outsourcing. We continue to expect about 50% of the projected reductions to come from SI&A and the remainder from R&D and manufacturing. In addition, we continue to expect the Wyeth acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2011.Consistent with our statements during the last earnings call, during the fourth quarter, we reinvested a portion of the year-to-date net cost reductions about $750 million in the following areas. Business development transactions in Established Products, resulting in license agreements this quarter with Protalix, Strides and Claris; incremental promotional efforts in the U.S. primarily around Primary Care products, including Lipitor, Lyrica and Chantix this fourth quarter '09 growth rates improved sequentially; and promotional efforts in Emerging Markets, which contributed to the 10% overall legacy Pfizer Emerging Markets year-over-year growth and strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter in Brazil, Russia, India and China.Net of these investments, we reduced Pfizer standalone cost by $200 million on a constant currency basis for full year '09 versus '08. We believe we can achieve our cost reduction targets as we begin to realize the benefits of some of the synergy decisions we've made including determining headquarters locations, rationalizing our R&D portfolio and reducing our R&D real estate footprint buy about 35%.In addition, we will continue making decisions quickly, including refining the combined company's manufacturing network strategy within the next few months. We are confident in our ability to achieve the previously mentioned $4 billion to $5 billion projected cost reductions, while continuing to reinvest in the business.Now we'll move on to 2010 financial guidance, which is based on late January exchange rates and does not assume the completion of any new business development transactions, not completed as of December 31, 2009. The guidance also excludes the potential impact of healthcare reform in the U.S.In 2010, we currently expect for the combined company, reported revenues in the range of $67 billion to $69 billion, cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of 19% to 20%, adjusted SI&A in the range of $19 billion to $20 billion, adjusted R&D expenses in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.6 billion, adjusted other deductions in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, effective tax on adjusted income of about 30%, reported diluted EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.10 and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.20.2010 revenue and EPS guidance was negatively impacted by the recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange. For example, based on exchange rates and in late January, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has decreased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by about $0.06. Finally, it's important to note that in 2010, Pfizer's U.S. Biopharmaceutical organization is evolving its U.S. distribution model to a fee-for-service approach in the U.S. Plans for this change were in place prior to the Wyeth acquisition and Wyeth already has a fee-for-service arrangement in the U.S. This change should not have a significant impact of 2010 results. It should, however, have a slight one-time impact on seasonal sales patterns in the first and the second quarter 2010.We expect first quarter sales of legacy Pfizer products to moderately decrease year-over-year, which we then expect will be offset by a moderate year-over-year increase in second quarter sales. We're updating and expanding our 2012 financial targets. We've added targets for reported diluted EPS, adjusted R&D expenses, adjusted other deductions and the effective tax rate on adjusted income. We now expect 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $66 billion to $68.5 billion, which reflects the divestiture of Animal Health assets required by the regulatory authorities, a revenue shift to the newly formed HIV company via healthcare resulting from our joint venture with GSK, and Wyeth's return of its RELISTOR rights to the licensor.All combined, these items decreased the previous target by about $1.5 billion. We also expect in 2012 adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $8 billion to $ 8.5 billion, adjusted other deductions to be in range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, adjusted operating margins to be in the previously expected range of high-30s to low-40s percent. The effective tax rate on adjusted income to be about 30%, reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.73, adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of 2.25 to 2.35 is based on approximately 8.1 billion shares currently outstanding, and an operating cash flow of $19 billion or more.It's important to note that 2012 targets assume the current rate of inflation, any meaningful change in this rate can cause these targets to change. Both our 2010 guidance and 2012 targets reflect our confidence in the business and bounce to the achievement of our expected cost reductions with the anticipated increased investment to drive longer-term top and bottom line performance. In addition, in 2012 our targets assume a modest level of planned business development activities. I want to emphasize that these longer-term targets are subject to greater variability and uncertainty due to macroeconomic factors. So to summarize the key takeaways, we achieved full year '09 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We realized $200 million in Pfizer standalone net operational cost reductions after a significant investment in our growth opportunities. We provided 2010 financial guidance, which balances investments in high-growth opportunities with our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, and we updated our 2012 financial targets adding additional line item targets. And as demonstrated by our performance this quarter, we continue to deliver operationally while advancing the integration of Wyeth. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

And then I'm going to ask Frank and Ian to elaborate. We've had the benefit now since the closing of the Wyeth transaction to really dig deep into the opportunities that the two companies provide and to really consider where there's opportunities to invest in growth. We have now with our business model, a very I think, very rigorous process. And as we've talked about in the past, we really apply very different hurdle rates to different businesses based on the various risks that they present, which vary and it's a pretty disciplined process and we have looked at where there are opportunities in these different businesses, based on their growth opportunities, based on what they see in their different markets. And we also, as I mentioned in my comments, and Frank and Ian can elaborate on this, want to do that in a flexible way so that we can adjust our costs and investments as needed. So what we're talking about for 2010 reflects a very thorough review of where those investments can be made in both the short and the long term to grow the business so that's the approach we took. I'll let Frank and Ian give you more specifics, but I just wanted to give you that overview of how we thought about it. And I think actually, that we're very excited about a lot of those opportunities but I want to emphasize that it's a balance between continuing to reduce costs both on an absolute basis but also create a flexible cost structure so that we can flex it as needed and as this business requirements demand. But also kind of a real bottoms up business leader focus, market by market customer set by customer set opportunities for growth that we approached in a pretty disciplined way and that's how we come about these investment opportunities. So let me ask Frank and Ian to take your questions both about the 2010 issue and the 2012 revenues. And then I'll ask Ian, obviously, we're not going to comment on any particular potential transactions but Ian can elaborate generally about our thinking on established business opportunities. So Frank?"

On the 2012 revenue, let me bridge it this way. Back in January last year, we gave a target of approximately $70 billion which was the sum of the two companies’ revenue numbers in 2008, so we have the standalone Pfizer and standalone Wyeth. So couple of things that happened. One, the first bridge is from 70 to 68.5, which is the top end of our new target range, three things. The planned Animal Health divestitures, the second item is the HIV joint venture via healthcare, and then the third item is basically the return of RELISTOR rights to the licensor. Those three items were not in the approximately $70 billion I'm talking about that we had issued. So that takes you from roughly $70 billion to $68.5 billion. Then in terms of the new range the 66 to 68.5, we've had a year now since we issued that target back in January, we've had a year with a new business unit model in place and getting the benefits of that model. We've integrated Wyeth, we've had four months or so now post-integration with Wyeth and when we factor in all the data, all the bottoms up work that we've done, we are now updating the target to $66 billion to $68.5 billion and we have confidence in our ability to achieve that number so that's the 2012 revenue item. On 2010 and on investments, I'll touch on this. Ian, I'll let you make some comments and we may want some product comments on this and not just limiting to SI&A, although Catherine talked about SI&A. Kind of at a high level, on a general level and then I'll let Ian get into some of the detail. The opportunity growth areas that we've been talking about where we continue to see opportunities. So it's Emerging Markets, where we continue to invest, I'll call it additional marketing investment in the focus countries, adding field force, promotional tools, sales tools, we saw some of the benefits of that this past quarter with double-digit growth in legacy Pfizer Emerging Market, and very strong double-digit growth in many of our priority countries, continuing to invest in Established Markets. Once again, sales on the street on SI&A and also continuing to work through other growth opportunity areas that we see. Ian?"

So a lot of our incremental investment will be in flexible spending and directly behind products. So certainly in the Emerging Markets we're adding field force as fast as we can with quality field force in China or in Brazil and some of the other markets. In Established Products we're adding Dossias and adding opportunities and really focusing on market by market which requires targeted promotional spend. In the U.S. Prevnar 13 adult, where it need to ramp up for that it'll probably require a primary care field for us to really fully explore this opportunity, similarly, in Europe and Western Europe, the same nature investment, a lot of pre-marketing investments prepare the market. And then inside the U.S., reporting variable spend behind some of the major products that we need to grow through this period, such as Lyrica, where we've seen in the fourth quarter, with that increase DTC spend, good improvements in market share for DPN/PHN and fibromyalgia. Chantix, which I'd like to point out in the three years Chantix being on the market prior to third quarter, it only had had 18 weeks of DTC in those three years. So we are putting substantial effort behind that, both in December and in 2010. We can look at our areas of spend at Lipitor. We're continuing to depend Lipitor where it makes sense to maximize the revenues of Lipitor through its LOE. And even smaller products such as Toviaz where we now have new data with head-to-head superiority against Detrol in two clinical trials. So we see a lot of opportunity in that segment and we intend to invest behind this new product. So that gives you a scope. And if we take it to 2012, clearly, we need to do a lot of market preparation and development for our Alzheimer's franchise, which with Dimebon would be hopefully the first one into marketplace. We have our JAK3 inhibitor. We have our oncology portfolio, where we expect Axitinib to be entering or the c-Met/ALK inhibitor. We have Apixaban. we have Tanezumab. We have Pristiq, both its depression indication and its vasomotor indication and potentially, Aprela. So we have a rich, powerful late-stage portfolio which we need to invest in to produce the growth from '12 and onwards. And actually, I'd like to ask Martin and Michael if they want to add some color to those really exciting products."

Our priorities for capital and use of cash haven't changed. The priorities that we've talked about, that I've talked about before, whether it be the dividend, the amount of cash that were repatriate, debt re-paydowns, share buybacks, business development. Those haven't changed, they're all priorities, they continue to be priorities. On the tax rate, our tax rate this year on an adjusted income basis, which is 21.9%, we had guided to approximately 30%, and that's really being driven by the cash that we're repatriating from overseas as a result of the financing that we put in place for the Wyeth acquisition. So I view that as very similar to what we've been doing. The industry average is lower and we were lower than the industry. At last year, we were 22% and really, it's what we're as a result of the Wyeth acquisition that's caused the rate to increase. And on Prevnar, the short answer is yes to your question. It really was the result of, I’ll call it lower Prevnar sales in anticipation of Prevnar 13 in the U.S."

Within each geography, it's really different businesses, the different business, the products are different businesses, so it's really multiple businesses. But the point is we have now a variety of businesses that give us opportunities to create value in many, many different markets with different risk profiles for investments with different ways of serving patients and customers. We see the potential for opportunities across these businesses and let's take Nutrition as an example. In China for instance, the combination of the expertise and experience that the legacy organizations have with respect to mothers and children, whether it be through vaccines with Prevnar for children, nutritions, whether it be the vitamin experience of the Consumer business, whether it be the legacy Pfizer business, there's lots of potential opportunities there for those businesses to create value together. Now I say potential because it's early days. And the proof will be in our ability to do that. And it's our obligation, as a management team, on behalf of our shareholders, to determine whether in fact that value can be realized over time and whether any of our businesses and assets create value for shareholders best together and inside Pfizer or whether there are other ways of doing that. And that, for example, was what led to the conclusion that in the case of, for example, the HIV/AIDS assets, that the best way to create value in that case was in the GSK deal. But as we sit here today, we're very excited about the businesses that we have and the potential and opportunities that they create for the company, and we're going to seize those opportunities and value. But it's incumbent upon all of us over time to continue to ensure that they do that. And portfolio management is one of our responsibilities as leaders of the organization, and we'll always be looking at that."

And I'm wondering if in essence, you're saying you're going to cut less cost out of Wyeth than what you originally said about a year ago. Another question is, on your revenue guidance for 2012, how are you accounting for pipeline products that could launch between now and then? And so you've got certain products like Prevnar in adults, for example and Dimebon, are those types of products in that revenue guidance? And then the last piece was just on the R&D. So you’ve put forth some pretty aggressive R&D cost-cutting figures for 2010 and 2012, and as I think kind of the core of the organization, how are you confident that, that isn't going to ultimately come around to bite you for potentially under investing in R&D?"

On the 2012 revenue targets and pipeline assumptions, I think the one large pipeline assumption would be pediatric Prevnar 13 and to a much smaller degree, adult on Prevnar. In terms of the R&D programs, 9.1 to 9.6 in 2010, 8 billion to 8.5 billion in 2012 with the targets. Those numbers have obviously been worked in detail with Martin, with Michael, we've done bottoms-up analytics on that. We announced our updated pipeline last week with 600 programs to 500 programs.

But moving those resources out of those markets that you commented on and moving towards the Emerging Markets. The increase in investments through '10 and '12, I'm talking about, are principally in the Emerging Markets and the DTC is exclusively in the United States and it’s behind products that we believe there's an opportunity for growth and we intend to invest behind them such as I said, Lyrica in its indications of fibromyalgia on DPN/PHN. We hope to expand those indications as we go through this period. Chantix, where we believe we need to put sustained support behind it, both from a field force and from DTC, given we now have the label changes over, and targeted support behind Lipitor. In regard to Prevnar 13, I really can't make any more comments on the FDA. As I said, we're very confident about submission and we're working towards approval in the United States. Abroad, we're beginning to launch but in reality, probably there'll be small countries that launch so far. We've won the tender in the U.K. for their program. There are some important tenders still pending like Turkey and other major markets. We've won some tenders in small countries like Gambia and Rwanda.

When we gave the $70 billion target, that was based on, among other things, the combined revenue of both companies for 2008, which included all of the Animal Health revenues. So the $70 billion, although we knew we were going to be making Animal Health divestitures, we did not, we did not adjust the $70 billion for Animal Health divestitures.

A bedrock principle of this team is that we meet our commitments to our stakeholders, starting with the owners of the company. Since this management team has been fully in place, we have met or exceeded every element of the adjusted financial guidance we have provided. Despite an extremely dynamic operating and policy environment. The 2009 results we report today continue our adherence to that commitment. And our financial guidance for 2010 reflects our plan to continue to deliver results and meet our commitments. That guidance reflects a careful balance between two critical elements. First, we continue to drive costs out of the business and improve our productivity in everything we do. We are also making our cost structure more flexible, so that we can adjust our costs as needed. Second, we are making focused, disciplined investments where we see the greatest opportunities for growth whether in Emerging Markets, Established Products, in-line products, preparing the market for coming launches or in the pipeline. As a result, we see a portfolio with less risks, continued growth in adjusted earnings per share and more consistent earnings growth over time. In that regard, we are also providing today our targets for 2012, which given their long-term nature are necessarily subject to less certainty than our guidance for this year. We have refined and revised the 2012 targets what we provided when we announced the Wyeth acquisition based on a thorough, bottoms up review of all aspects of our business since we closed the transaction. In developing these targets, we have the benefit of the deep and current understanding that our business leaders around the world have of their respective markets, customers and products. The leaders who will have accountability for the performance of their businesses.Those targets show that Pfizer has come along way in a short time. Only a couple of years ago, we faced a significant clip in revenue and earnings in 2012 due to the coming loss of exclusivity for Lipitor. Today, thanks to the changes that we have made, the Wyeth acquisition and the hard work of thousands of people. Our targets for 2012 project adjusted earnings per share that are higher than both our 2009 actual results and our 2010 guidance. Now before Frank provides more detail, let me offer some additional perspective.For the past three years, we have been transforming the company's strategy, leadership and culture. First, strategy. We aimed over time for modest top line growth, better bottom line growth and steady, consistent earnings growth. To achieve these goals, we are diversifying our sources of revenue as well as the risks of our investments. At the same time, we continue to reduce our costs, continuously improve our productivity and make our cost structure more flexible. And above all, we maintain a strong commitment to exercising discipline in how we spend our owners’ capital. In 2009, we significantly advanced these strategies in many ways, mostly significantly of course through the Wyeth acquisition. We also fully implemented our unique business model of customer facing units with responsibility from proof of concept through the entire product life cycle. Our business leaders are empowered to seize new sources of value, guided by disciplined and appropriate capital allocation requirements. One example this quarter that wouldn't have happened here even a year or two ago, we quickly secured a deal for a promising compound to treat Borchert's disease. Next, leadership. Over the past three years, we've substantially enhanced our leadership at all levels, through internal promotions and through external hires from inside and outside the industry. In the fourth quarter, we added several outstanding Wyeth executives to our leadership ranks including Cavan Redmond, who leads our Diversified Businesses; Mikael Dolsten, who leads our BioTherapeutics Research team; and Geno Germano, who leads our Specialty Care business. Two of our world-class Chief Scientific Officers, Emilio Emini in Vaccines; and Mene Pangalos [Menelas Pangalos] in Neuroscience, also joined us from Wyeth; along with Lou Schmuckler, our Head of Biomanufacturing; and many others. During the quarter, in addition to many important internal promotions, we also brought in a number of other key leaders from outside the company. For example, from GSK, Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos in BioTherapeutics Research; from Sanofi, Dr. Patricia  Kabatoni [ph], heading Worldwide Safety Strategy; from AstraZeneca, where she ran the Cardiovascular business and launched major brands including Crestor, Adele Gulfo, our new head of U.S. Primary Care; from PepsiCo, where he led the Gatorade brand, Todd Magazine, our new President of North America for Consumer Healthcare; from J&J, Mark Gilbert, our Head of R&D for Consumer Healthcare; from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Dr. Norm Greenberg, now our Director of Oncology. Strategy, leadership and finally, culture. I call it the spirit of small and the power of scale. Across Pfizer, our teams are now small enough to focus on meeting the unique needs of specific customers, patients, physicians, payers. They each have empowered leaders with the authority, the resources, the knowledge and expertise to make decisions, the entrepreneurial mindset and agility to implement those decisions quickly. And most importantly, the accountability for the results of their decisions. And all of this is backed by Pfizer's global scale and resources, a distinct competitive advantage. This is allowing us to take actions to enhance shareholder value, actions that are hard to imagine happening at Pfizer even a few years ago. For example, who would've thought that Pfizer would join forces with GSK to create ViiV Healthcare, a separate company that brings together the industry's best assets in combating HIV/AIDS.Today, we are working hard to unleash creative thinking and fast disciplined execution throughout the company. The watch words of our culture are speed, focus, accountability, execution, results. In the last quarter, we saw proof of that in the integration which continues to move quickly. On the day after closing, we announced all country leaders and all headquarter sites. Within six days, every member of the U.S. field force knew their status. Within 30 days, we announced an integrated plan for R&D site reductions. Within 90 days, we completed a scientifically complex prioritization across the two companies and announced Pfizer's new combined R&D pipeline. This is all the result of the close working relationships forming across the organization.This is especially true in R&D, where collaboration is advancing important programs. A great example is work on our beta amyloid vaccine for Alzheimer's disease, which is currently in Phase II studies. This program represents a joint effort across legacy research units from the two companies and across modalities, by our Vaccines team in BioTherapeutics, our Neuroscience team in PharmaTherapeutics, and our partners at J&J's Janssen unit. These changes in strategy, leadership and culture are for one purpose, to deliver value to our stakeholders. That in turn, requires execution and a relentless focus on results. And as you look at the operating performance of legacy Pfizer in today's release, you can see these changes paying off. In Emerging Markets for the first time, we saw double-digit revenue growth, led by China, India, Brazil and Russia. The Established Products business consisting of products that historically simply decline actually grew 1% on an operational basis for the first time. Now while the results in this business will vary, our long-term strategy of stabilization and ultimately growth is on track. In the patent-protected portfolio, in-line products like Lipitor, Lyrica, Chantix, Geodon, Xalatan and Zyvox continue to perform well both internationally and in the U.S. Across all of these businesses, we will continue to focus on reducing costs, making our cost structure more flexible and improving productivity. And we will also make focused, disciplined investments where there is opportunity for profitable growth. That's why our Emerging Markets business has increased the size of our field force in China. That's why Established Products has built a portfolio that now includes about 600 products.  And that's why our primary Specialty and Oncology business units will continue to invest in the right products, in the right markets, consistent with their rigorous ROI models and their deep understandings of their customers and markets. And that's why we will make the right investments in market development at the right time to ensure that when we launch the exciting new products in our pipeline, we will be successful.All of this makes me very optimistic about our company and our future. But of course, what most excites all of us at Pfizer are all the scientific advances that give us so many opportunities to make a difference in the lives of millions of people. With the substantial assets and capabilities of the two legacy companies, and the extraordinary scientific talent that we have assembled from both inside and outside Pfizer, we can attack some of the most feared diseases of our time. Our portfolio reflects our focus on those opportunities that we believe provide the greatest potential for investing our owners’ capital, and that represent our commitment to therapeutic diversity and diversity of approaches. We now have 133 compounds in development, including 27 Biologics and six vaccines, bringing our ratio of small molecules to Biologics from 3:1 to 1.3:1. We are especially enthusiastic about our late base portfolio. We now have 34 compounds in Phase III development across various indications. Among the most noteworthy of these are Dimebon for Alzheimer's disease, taxocitinib, our JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, Apixaban for cardiovascular indications, Tanezumab for pain, Axitinib for renal cell carcinoma, additional indications for SUTENT and studies of the Prevnar 13 Vaccine in adults. We know of course, that it is very unlikely that every single trial we conduct will produce exactly the results that we all hoped. That's the nature of our business, but we are more enthusiastic about our late stage pipeline than we have been in years. In some, we're on the right course. We have the right strategy, the right leadership and the right culture to continue changing Pfizer in the right ways that will create value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Frank."

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Because the Wyeth acquisition was October 15, 2009, we are incorporating Wyeth's results from that point forward, which includes approximately two and a half months of Wyeth domestic results, and one point five months of Wyeth international results as Pfizer's international calendar ends on November 30. Now, let me get our financials. Fourth quarter 2009 reported revenues were $16.5 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34% or $4.2 billion due to $3.3 billion or 27% from the addition of legacy Wyeth products, $419 million or 3% operational growth from legacy Pfizer products and $469 million or 4% from foreign exchange.Fourth quarter 2009 reported net income increased 188% to $767 million and reported diluted EPS increased 150% to $0.10 year-over-year due to higher revenues. The non-recurrence of the pretax and after-tax charge of $2.3 billion in the prior year quarter related to the resolution of certain investigations concerning Bextra and various other products, which were largely offset by higher acquisition-related cost which include transaction and integration cost, and restructuring charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition and significant purchase accounting adjustments. Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2009 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by tax benefits related to the sale of Vicuron and the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses associated with the acquisition of Wyeth. Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted income of $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 decreased year-over-year by 13% and 25% respectively. These results were favorably affected by higher revenues, but negatively impacted by increases in the following areas. Expenses primarily due to the addition of Wyeth operations, investments in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, net interest expense and the effective tax rate on adjusted income.Also, fourth quarter and full year '09 reported and adjusted diluted EPS were adversely affected by the increase in the number of shares outstanding versus 2008, primarily due to the issuance of shares to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted cost of sales was $2.9 billion or 17.5%, as a percentage of revenues versus 11.7% or $1.4 billion in the year ago quarter. Driven by first, the overall change in mix of products and businesses due to the Wyeth acquisition, essentially, what you're seeing is a blend of gross margin now for both Pfizer and Wyeth. And second, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange, adjusted fourth quarter cost of sales was 14.4% of revenues.It's important to note that fourth quarter adjusted cost of sales included the full manufacturing network of both companies. That said, we see opportunities to lower the combined company's adjusted cost of sales going forward.Fourth quarter 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses increased 52% to $5.3 billion year-over-year resulting from the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, increased investment in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Fourth quarter adjusted R&D expenses increased year-over-year to $2.8 billion or 27% due to the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late stage development portfolio, cost associated with Established Products business development transactions and the negative impact of foreign exchange.The fourth quarter '09 effective tax rate on adjusted income increased to about 28% versus about 24% in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition.Because the adjusted diluted EPS calculation includes the additional shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition, there is a variance in the year-over-year percentage changes and adjusted diluted EPS compared with adjusted income.Last quarter, we updated our full year '09 guidance to reflect the inclusion of Wyeth from and after the closing date and we achieved full year '09 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. While our '09 guidance range reported diluted EPS excluded estimates for acquisition-related costs, our actual results included these. Consequently, '09 reported diluted EPS of $1.23 was lower than our previous guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50. On an adjusted results basis, FX increased fourth quarter revenues by approximately $469 million or 4% year-over-year. On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted total adjusted cost in the fourth quarter by $720 million or 10%, which resulted in a $0.02 net decrease in adjusted diluted EPS. Most notably, foreign exchange had a $568 million or 39% negative impact on cost of sales.Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total cost increased operationally by 44% due to the inclusion of legacy Wyeth operations and the continued investment in high-growth areas. Now let's move to the results of our commercial organizations. As you can see from the chart, Biopharmaceutical revenues increased year-over-year which included the $419 million or 4% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Operationally, Biopharmaceutical revenues increased $2.9 billion or 26% year-over-year due to $2.5 billion or 22% from the addition of Wyeth products and about $400 million or 4% from legacy Pfizer products.Primary Care revenues increased 10% year-over-year, including a 4% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 6% was due to the addition of Premarin, a legacy Wyeth product and operational improvements in Lyrica and Alliance revenues. Specialty Care revenues increased 84% year-over-year, including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 79% was due to the addition of Wyeth Specialty Care portfolio, particularly, Enbrel and Prevnar and operational growth of Xalatan and Zyvox among others.Established product revenues increased by 57% year-over-year, which included a 6% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 51% was due to the addition of legacy Wyeth products primarily driven by Effexor, the launch of six products in the U.S. bringing the number of solid oral dose license products launched in the U.S. to 26, the launch of five in-license products in the newly created U.S. sterile injectables unit, higher antibiotic sales and the stabilization of the rate decline of some LOE products.As you’ll recall, we created the Established Products unit to recapture value for products that have lost or will soon lose patent protection for marketing exclusivity. And we're pleased that in fourth quarter '09, legacy Pfizer contributed plus 1% of operational growth year-over-year to Established Products growth, positive growth for the first time. We do expect that the financial results for this unit will continue to vary quarterly depending on products that have lost exclusivity and where they have lost exclusivity, the existence of generic alternatives and other factors. Emerging Markets revenues increased 25% year-over-year, including a 1% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 24% was due to the addition of Enbrel and Prevnar, legacy Wyeth products and double-digit growth in priority markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.In fourth quarter '09, legacy Pfizer contributed 10% of operational growth to Emerging Market results. This is the first quarter that legacy Pfizer has contributed double-digit operational growth to Emerging Markets results since the launch of this unit.Oncology revenues increased 11% year-over-year including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operational growth of 6% was due to the addition of Wyeth's oncology portfolio, the continued solid performance of SUTENT despite increasing market challenges which were partially offset by the continued negative impact of Camptosar's LOE in most European markets in July 2009.Fourth quarter '09 diversified revenues increased 83% year-over-year, which included a favorable impact of $45 million or 5% from foreign exchange. Operational growth, 78% was due to an 11% operational increase in Animal Health revenues due to the addition of Wyeth's Fort Dodge products and an increase in legacy Pfizer's Animal Health revenues, and the addition of Wyeth Consumer Healthcare which includes Centrum, Advil and Robitussin among other products in Wyeth's Nutrition products, and an increase in Capsugel revenues due to strength in all regions and across all major product groups.In January of '09, Pfizer implemented a new cost reduction program expected to achieve gross reductions of approximately $3 billion at '08 average exchange rates compared with '08 adjusted total cost. As we previously said, we anticipate a $2 billion net decrease in adjusted total cost, as we expect to reinvest about $1 billion of those reductions in the business. At the same time, we also said we expect to generate $4 billion in synergies from the Wyeth acquisition. We now anticipate generating net synergies of about $2 billion to $3 billion after reinvestment. We are now combining the projected cost reductions from these two initiatives and expect to generate in the aggregate, gross cost reduction of about $7 billion and net cost reductions of about $4 billion to $5 billion by the end of 2012 at 2008 average exchange rates versus Pfizer and Wyeth's combined fully pro forma adjusted total cost.We expect approximately $2 billion to $3 billion of these reductions to be reinvested to potential growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond, such as Emerging Markets, Established Products, in-line product support and expected new product launches.Our cost reduction initiatives continue to span essentially all divisions, functions, markets and sites across Pfizer. For example, broad categories of activity include manufacturing and research site exits, targeting workforce reductions and outsourcing. We continue to expect about 50% of the projected reductions to come from SI&A and the remainder from R&D and manufacturing. In addition, we continue to expect the Wyeth acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2011.Consistent with our statements during the last earnings call, during the fourth quarter, we reinvested a portion of the year-to-date net cost reductions about $750 million in the following areas. Business development transactions in Established Products, resulting in license agreements this quarter with Protalix, Strides and Claris; incremental promotional efforts in the U.S. primarily around Primary Care products, including Lipitor, Lyrica and Chantix this fourth quarter '09 growth rates improved sequentially; and promotional efforts in Emerging Markets, which contributed to the 10% overall legacy Pfizer Emerging Markets year-over-year growth and strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter in Brazil, Russia, India and China.Net of these investments, we reduced Pfizer standalone cost by $200 million on a constant currency basis for full year '09 versus '08. We believe we can achieve our cost reduction targets as we begin to realize the benefits of some of the synergy decisions we've made including determining headquarters locations, rationalizing our R&D portfolio and reducing our R&D real estate footprint buy about 35%.In addition, we will continue making decisions quickly, including refining the combined company's manufacturing network strategy within the next few months. We are confident in our ability to achieve the previously mentioned $4 billion to $5 billion projected cost reductions, while continuing to reinvest in the business.Now we'll move on to 2010 financial guidance, which is based on late January exchange rates and does not assume the completion of any new business development transactions, not completed as of December 31, 2009. The guidance also excludes the potential impact of healthcare reform in the U.S.In 2010, we currently expect for the combined company, reported revenues in the range of $67 billion to $69 billion, cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of 19% to 20%, adjusted SI&A in the range of $19 billion to $20 billion, adjusted R&D expenses in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.6 billion, adjusted other deductions in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, effective tax on adjusted income of about 30%, reported diluted EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.10 and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.20.2010 revenue and EPS guidance was negatively impacted by the recent unfavorable changes in foreign exchange. For example, based on exchange rates and in late January, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has decreased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by about $0.06. Finally, it's important to note that in 2010, Pfizer's U.S. Biopharmaceutical organization is evolving its U.S. distribution model to a fee-for-service approach in the U.S. Plans for this change were in place prior to the Wyeth acquisition and Wyeth already has a fee-for-service arrangement in the U.S. This change should not have a significant impact of 2010 results. It should, however, have a slight one-time impact on seasonal sales patterns in the first and the second quarter 2010.We expect first quarter sales of legacy Pfizer products to moderately decrease year-over-year, which we then expect will be offset by a moderate year-over-year increase in second quarter sales. We're updating and expanding our 2012 financial targets. We've added targets for reported diluted EPS, adjusted R&D expenses, adjusted other deductions and the effective tax rate on adjusted income. We now expect 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $66 billion to $68.5 billion, which reflects the divestiture of Animal Health assets required by the regulatory authorities, a revenue shift to the newly formed HIV company via healthcare resulting from our joint venture with GSK, and Wyeth's return of its RELISTOR rights to the licensor.All combined, these items decreased the previous target by about $1.5 billion. We also expect in 2012 adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $8 billion to $ 8.5 billion; adjusted other deductions to be in range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion; adjusted operating margins to be in the previously expected range of high-30s to low-40s percent; the effective tax rate on adjusted income to be about 30%; reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.73; adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of 2.25 to 2.35, which is based on approximately 8.1 billion shares currently outstanding; and an operating cash flow of $19 billion or more.It's important to note that 2012 targets assume the current rate of inflation. Any meaningful change in this rate could cause these targets to change. Both our 2010 guidance and 2012 targets reflect our confidence in the business and balance the  achievement of our expected cost reductions, with the anticipated increased investment to drive longer-term top and bottom line performance. In addition, in 2012 our targets assume a modest level of planned business development activities. I want to emphasize that these longer-term targets are subject to greater variability and uncertainty due to macroeconomic factors. So to summarize the key takeaways, we achieved full year '09 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We realized $200 million in Pfizer stand-alone net operational cost reductions after a significant investment in our growth opportunities. We provided 2010 financial guidance, which balances investments and high-growth opportunities with our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, and we updated our 2012 financial targets, adding additional line item targets. And as demonstrated by our performance this quarter, we continue to deliver operationally while advancing the integration of Wyeth. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

Let me make a general statement about your first question, which is investments in 2010. And then I'm going to ask Frank and Ian to elaborate. We've had the benefit now since the closing of the Wyeth transaction to really dig deep into the opportunities that the two companies provide, and to really consider where there's opportunities to invest in growth. We have now with our business model a very, I think, very rigorous process. And as we've talked about in the past, we really apply very different hurdle rates to different businesses based on the various risks that they present, which vary. And it's a pretty disciplined process, and we have looked at where there are opportunities in these different businesses based on their growth opportunities, based on what they see in their different markets. And we also, as I mentioned in my comments and Frank and Ian can elaborate on this, want to do that in a flexible way so that we can adjust our costs and investments as needed. And so what we're talking about for 2010 reflects a very thorough review of where those investments can be made in both the short and the long term to grow the business. So that's the approach we took. I'll let Frank and Ian give you more specifics, but I just wanted to give you that overview of how we thought about it. And I think, actually, that we're very excited about a lot of those opportunities. But I want to emphasize that it's a balance between continuing to reduce costs both on an absolute basis, but also create a flexible cost structure so that we can flex it as needed and as this business requirements demand. But also kind of a real bottoms up business leader focus, market by market customer set by customer set opportunities for growth that we approached in a pretty disciplined way and that's how we come about these investment opportunities. So let me ask Frank and Ian to take your questions both about the 2010 issue and the 2012 revenues. And then I'll ask Ian, obviously, we're not going to comment on any particular potential transactions but Ian can elaborate generally about our thinking on established business opportunities. So Frank?"

On the 2012 revenue, let me bridge it this way. Back in January last year, we gave a target of approximately $70 billion, which was the sum of the two companies’ revenue numbers in 2008, to add the standalone Pfizer and the standalone Wyeth. So a couple of things have happened. One, the first bridge is from 70 to 68.5, which is the top end of our new target range. Three things. The planned Animal Health divestitures. The second item is the HIV joint venture and ViiV Healthcare. And then the third item is basically the return of RELISTOR rights to the licensor. Those three items were not in the approximately $70 billion on target that we had issued. So that takes you from roughly $70 billion to $68.5 billion. Then in terms of the new range, the $66 billion to $68.5 billion, we've had a year now since we issued that target back in January. We've had a year with a new business unit model in place and getting the benefits of that model. We've integrated Wyeth. We've had four months or so now post-integration with Wyeth. And when we factor in all the data, all the bottoms up work that we've done, we are now updating the target to $66 billion to $68.5 billion and we have confidence in our ability to achieve that number. So that's the 2012 revenue item. On 2010 and on investments, I'll touch on this. Ian, I'll let you make some comments that we may even want, some product comments for this, not just limiting it to SI&A, although Catherine talked about SI&A. Kind of at a high level, on a general ledger level, and then I'll let Ian get into some of the detail. It's the opportunity growth areas that we've been talking about, where we continue to see opportunities. So it's Emerging Markets, where we continue to invest, I'll call it additional marketing investment. Make additional marketing investment in the focus countries, adding field force, promotional tools, sales tools. We saw some other benefits of that this past quarter with double-digit growth in legacy Pfizer Emerging Market and very strong double-digit growth in many of our priority countries, continuing to invest in established markets. Once again, sales, feet on the street on SI&A and also continuing to just work through other growth opportunity areas that we sit. Ian?"

So a lot of our incremental investment will be in flexible spending and directly behind products. So certainly in Emerging Markets, we're adding field force as fast as we can with quality field force in China or in Brazil and some of the other markets. In Established Products we're adding dossiers and adding opportunities and really focusing on market by market, which requires targeted promotional spend. In the U.S. Prevnar 13 adult, where we need to ramp up for that. It'll probably require a primary care field force to really fully explore this opportunity. Similarly, in Europe and Western Europe, the same nature investment. A lot of pre-marketing investments compared to the market. And then inside the U.S., we're putting variable spend behind some of the major products that we need to grow through this period, such as Lyrica, where we've seen in the fourth quarter, with that increased DTC spend, good improvements in market share for DPN/PHN and fibromyalgia. CHANTIX, which I'd like to point out in the three years CHANTIX being on the market, prior to third quarter, it only had 18 weeks of DTC in those three years. So we are putting substantial effort behind that, both in December and in 2010. We can look at other areas of spend at LIPITOR. We're continuing to defend LIPITOR where it makes sense to maximize the revenues of LIPITOR through its LOE. And even smaller products such as Toviaz, where we now have new data with head-to-head superiority against Detrol in two clinical trials. So we see a lot of opportunity in that segment and we intend to invest behind this new product. So that gives you a scope. And if we take it to 2012, clearly, we need to do a lot of market preparation and development for our Alzheimer's franchise, which with dimebon, would be hopefully the first one into marketplace. We have our JAK3 inhibitor. We have our oncology portfolio, where we expect Axitinib to be entering or the c-Met/ALK inhibitor. We have apixaban. We have Tanezumab. We have Pristiq, both its depression indication and its vasomotor indication and potentially, Aprela. So we have a rich, powerful, late-stage portfolio which we need to invest in to produce the growth from '12 and onwards. And actually, I'd like to ask Martin and Mikael if you want to add some color to those really exciting products."

There's really, when all is said and done, there's three items that go through there for 2012, it's really other deducts, it's a charge, it's a debit. It's interest income, interest expense and royalty income. So it goes down, give or take, by a couple of hundred million from 2010, so it is declining. We have some royalty income that declines over the period as well, and when you put all that together, you get the adjusted deduction number that we put out there for 2012. Our priorities for capital and use of cash haven't changed. They're the priorities that we've talked about, that I've talked about before, whether it be the dividend, the amount of cash that were repatriate, debt re-paydowns, share buybacks, business development. Those haven't changed, they're all priorities, they continue to be priorities. On the tax rate, our tax rate this year on an adjusted income basis, which is 21.9%, we had guided to approximately 30%, and that's really being driven by the cash that we're repatriating from overseas as a result of the financing that we put in place for the Wyeth acquisition. So I view that as very similar to what we've been doing. The industry average is lower and we were lower than the industry. At last year, we were 22% and really, it's what we're doing as a result of the Wyeth acquisition that's caused the rate to increase. And on Prevnar, the short answer is yes to your question. It really was the result of, I’ll call it lower Prevnar sales in anticipation of Prevnar 13 in the U.S."

Within each geography, it's really a different business.  The products are different businesses, so it's really multiple businesses. But the point is we have now a variety of businesses that give us opportunities to create value in many, many different markets with different risk profiles for investments with different ways of serving patients and customers. We see the potential for opportunities across these businesses and let's take Nutrition as an example. In China for instance, the combination of the expertise and experience that the legacy organizations have with respect to mothers and children, whether it be through vaccines with Prevnar for children, nutritions, whether it be the vitamin experience of the Consumer business, whether it be the legacy Pfizer business, there's lots of potential opportunities there for those businesses to create value together. Now I say potential because it's early days. And the proof will be in our ability to do that. And it's our obligation, as a management team, on behalf of our shareholders, to determine whether in fact that value can be realized over time and whether any of our businesses and assets create value for shareholders best together and inside Pfizer or whether there are other ways of doing that. And that, for example, was what led to the conclusion that in the case of, for example, the HIV/AIDS assets, that the best way to create value in that case was in the GSK deal. But as we sit here today, we're very excited about the businesses that we have and the potential and opportunities that they create for the company, and we're going to seize those opportunities and value. But it's incumbent upon all of us over time to continue to ensure that they do that. And portfolio management is one of our responsibilities as leaders of the organization, and we'll always be looking at that."

Maybe I've missed it in the past, but I don't recall hearing that growth versus net distinction. And I'm wondering if in essence, you're saying you're going to cut less cost out of Wyeth than what you originally said about a year ago. Another question is, on your revenue guidance for 2012, how are you accounting for pipeline products that could launch between now and then? And so you've got certain products like Prevnar in adults, for example and Dimebon, are those types of products in that revenue guidance? And then the last piece was just on the R&D. So you’ve put forth some pretty aggressive R&D cost-cutting figures for 2010 and 2012, and as I think kind of the core of the organization, how are you confident that, that isn't going to ultimately come around to bite you for potentially under investing in R&D?"

So I don't view it at all as cutting less. We're going to get the $7 million that we talked about previously. What we're choosing to do is to reinvest some of that money. On the 2012 revenue targets and pipeline assumptions, I think the one large pipeline assumption would be pediatric Prevnar 13. And to a much smaller degree, adult on Prevnar. In terms of the R&D programs, 9.1 to 9.6 in 2010, 8 billion to 8.5 billion in 2012 with the targets. Those numbers have obviously been worked in detail with Martin, with Mikael, we've done bottoms-up analytics on that. We announced our updated pipeline last week with 600 programs to 500 programs. I believe, we, the R&D team, the leadership team, is very comfortable with the portfolio we have. We'll be continuing to refine and optimize that going forward and we think we are really focusing it on the invest-to-win areas and we think we are maximizing the potential return on investment on that capital deployment."

And then secondly, I just wanted to go back to Jami's question on Prevnar 13 and what's happening in the U.S. and then also what's happening internationally in terms of the timing of the national immunization programs getting up and running with new product. Can you give us a little bit of an update on that and when we would see sort of pricing and incorporation into that finalized?

But moving those resources out of those markets that you commented on and moving towards the Emerging Markets. The increase in investments through '10 and '12, I'm talking about, are principally in the Emerging Markets and the DTC is exclusively in the United States and it’s behind products that we believe there's an opportunity for growth and we intend to invest behind them such as I said, Lyrica in its indications of fibromyalgia on DPN/PHN. We hope to expand those indications as we go through this period. Chantix, where we believe we need to put sustained support behind it, both from a field force and from DTC, given we now have the label changes over, and targeted support behind Lipitor. In regard to Prevnar 13, I really can't make any more comments on the FDA. As I said, we're very confident about submission and we're working towards approval in the United States. Abroad, we're beginning to launch but in reality, probably there'll be small countries that launch so far. We've won the tender in the U.K. for their program. There are some important tenders still pending like Turkey and other major markets. We've won some tenders in small countries like Gambia and Rwanda.

Today's report covers our first full quarter since closing the Wyeth acquisition. Just seven months after putting these two companies together, we are creating value for shareholders in four ways: First, by maximizing the earnings for each business unit through operational performance, cost discipline and targeted investment in growth opportunities; second, by allocating investment dollars across the entire enterprise so that we create the most value for shareholders; third, by exercising discipline and applying appropriate hurdle rates on every investment we make; and fourth, by returning capital to shareholders. 
I'd like to comment on three aspects of capital allocation: First, investing in the business; second, business development; and third, returning cash to shareholders. Let me start by emphasizing some fundamental principles and objectives. As stewards of your capital, our job is, of course, to allocate that capital responsibly in order to enhance shareholder value. As we look beyond Lipitor's loss of U.S. exclusivity, we aim to generate modest, but consistent top line growth, to continue managing expenses effectively, and as a result, to generate steady, bottom line growth at a rate higher than revenue growth. Supported by the investments we had made and will be making, our sources of revenue are more diverse, both in terms of opportunities and risks. While we continue to pursue innovative treatments for significant unmet medical needs, the combined portfolio of Pfizer and Wyeth, together with disciplined investments, mean that we will no longer be overly dependent on a few blockbusters either in the market or in the pipeline. As a result, we expect to generate steady and consistent cash flow and earnings growth over time. 
Now to the three specific topics I mentioned. With regard to the first, investments in the business, it's important to emphasize that our anticipated investments do not affect our plans regarding cost savings, which had not changed. We remain on track to generate $4 billion to $5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2012. These savings will flow to the bottom line. While achieving these bottom line savings, we will continue to make disciplined, targeted investments in the business to produce solid returns.
These expected investments fall into three general categories: In-line products, where the investments produce solid returns; our R&D pipeline, including early-stage research, but particularly clinical trials and market development for our late-stage assets; and investments in those businesses and countries where we see substantial opportunities for profitable growth, such as in emerging markets and in Established Products. 
Let me give you a few examples. We're currently investing in support of Prevenar 13 for infants and toddlers, an indication which is now approved in more than 40 countries; and for adults, for which we anticipate submitting a registration in the U.S. and Europe later this year. This important innovation is of enormous value to public health, and it presents a significant opportunity for Pfizer shareholders. In addition, we are providing focused commercial support for other important products like Lyrica, Chantix, Sutent, Enbrel and Pristiq. Our approach is geographically-targeted, product-specific and highly flexible, which allows us continuously to manage our investments and monitor our returns. 
For example, in the United States, our DTC campaigns in support of Chantix have recently generated improved prescription trends and sales. Now with regard to the pipeline, we have made and will continue to make targeted investments in support of clinical and pre-market development for important Phase III assets. Later this year, we expect late-stage clinical data for a number agents that have shown encouraging efficacy and safety profiles to date.
For instance, Phase III data for Tanezumab, our innovative antibody for pain, will be presented at EULAR, The European League Against Rheumatism conference in June, and we are targeting further Phase III data on that agent at the American College of Rheumatology Meeting in November. At that same conference, we anticipate presenting Phase III data for tasocitinib, our JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June, we expect to see important clinical data on a number of our oncology compounds. Clinical data from a trial of our ALK inhibitor [indiscernible] [27:01) has been selected for presentation at ASCO's Plenary Session. This very promising compound targets a specific genetic mutation that occurs in a subset of lung cancer patients, a mutation that is most often found in people with a history of smoking very little or not at all. 
In neuroscience, our collaboration with Janssen on bapineuzumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, continues with four Phase III studies continuing to enroll. As you know, Janssen is conducting the two primarily North American carrier or non-carrier studies, which are expected to be completed in mid-2012, and Pfizer is conducting the two similar studies focused primarily outside North America. We currently expect that the last patients will have completed those 18-month trials outside North America, including associated biomarker studies in 2014.
Back to this year, we are also looking forward to receiving later this year Phase III data for Prevnar 13 in adults; for bosutinib, for chronic myeloid leukemia [chronic myelogenous leukemia]; for axitinib, for renal cell carcinoma; and for Sutent, for non-small cell lung cancer. For all of our Phase III projects, subject to meeting development and regulatory requirements, we intend to fully maximize their potential with the appropriate level of pre-market development and support at launch.
Another area for investment in the business beyond our in-line products in the pipeline is in our Emerging Markets and Established Products business unit where we have significant opportunities to diversify our risks and to create substantial new opportunities for profitable growth. It's important to note that these two business units operate with competitive operating margins. While selling prices are generally lower, these businesses also have a lower overall cost structure. As a result, we do not expect that growth in these business units will impose significant pressure on our overall operating margins, which we continue to target in the high 30s to low 40s percentage range in 2012. In addition, while investments in these two business units do, of course, carry some country risks in some markets, they also present substantially fewer regulatory uncertainties and depend less on the outcomes of new clinical trials. 
In the Emerging Markets, we will, of course, experience varying performance in different markets during any given period. But in general, the trends in most of the key countries remain very encouraging. This quarter, our Emerging Markets unit would have recorded approximately 6% operational growth on a legacy Pfizer basis, excluding the impact from our having moved the revenues from South Korea, which we now consider to be a developed market. The BRIC countries and other major countries are the key markets that we expect to drive growth over the next few years in this business. This quarter, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in Brazil, China and India. Mexico, on the other hand, was adversely affected by delayed government tender, and Turkey faced new pricing regulations. 
We also continue to make targeted, disciplined investments in our Established Products business unit. We launched several sterile injectable products in the U.S., and we continue to improve the overall cost profile of those products and of our top solid oral medications. 
Let me turn then to the second area of capital allocation, business development. As I've said before, business development is an enabler of our strategies, not a strategy in and of itself. And as we previously stated, our 2012 target revenue range contemplates modest business development. We continuously review opportunities to enhance shareholder value through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. On a small scale, deals of this nature are part of the normal course of business across our company in R&D and all nine of our business units. We reject far more ideas than we pursue as we apply a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to our evaluations. And when the price exceeds what makes sense for our shareholders, we walk away from opportunities that might otherwise be attractive. That said, we will continue to look for opportunities to extend our ability to meet our customers' needs, always with the objective of generating profitable revenue growth and enhancing shareholder value. 
We're especially interested in opportunities in Emerging Markets and Established Products and in what we've called “Invest to Win” therapeutic areas, such as oncology, pain, inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, psychoses, diabetes and vaccines.
Let me turn then to the third and final topic in this area of capital allocation, returning cash directly to shareholders. With regard to dividends, as we've previously stated, we currently intend to increase the dividend annually barring significant unforeseen events. Another way of returning cash to our shareholders is by repurchasing shares. We currently have authority from our board to repurchase shares, and we believe that under the right circumstances, this can be an attractive use of our capital to benefit shareholders. So we intend to repurchase our shares opportunistically as market conditions warrant. While we have significant one-time cash needs during 2010 for Wyeth restructuring costs and for the payment of taxes on our repatriated funds, we do not view these cash needs as precluding share repurchases during 2010.
Let me conclude with a brief comment on our 2012 targets. We have today reduced our target revenue range for that year by $800 million to reflect the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation. But we have otherwise reaffirmed our targets for 2012, including our target ranges for earnings per share. I want to emphasize, once again, that we are aligning our cost structure as appropriate to our revenues, and we will continue to do so. We have flexibility in our balance sheet, in our spending and in our investments, and we continuously look for ways to enhance that flexibility. That is why, should revenues fall short of our target range, we believe that we have the ability within reason to achieve the 2012 EPS targets that we have reaffirmed today, and we intend to do so. 
We also intend to continue to deploy your capital in a disciplined, focused way on appropriate investments in the business, in the right development business opportunities and in returning cash to our shareholders, all with the objective of increasing shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank."

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Now let's move on to the first quarter financial results. The 54% year-over-year increase in first quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributa",1197,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. 
Now let's move on to the first quarter financial results. The 54% year-over-year increase in first quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable to the addition of Wyeth products, mainly, the Prevnar franchise, Premarin, Enbrel, Zosyn/Tazocin and Effexor. Also, foreign exchange favorably impacted the quarter's revenues by $733 million or 7%. These favorable impacts were slightly offset by $137 million or 1% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products. 
First quarter 2010 revenues reflect a reduction of $56 million due to the recently enacted U.S. healthcare legislation. Adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS increased, primarily due to increased revenues resulting from the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with Wyeth operations and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year-ago quarter as a result of shared issues to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
First quarter adjusted total cost were negatively impacted, primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations and foreign exchange. The negative impact to foreign exchange increased adjusted total cost to [ph] (36:00) $450 million or 8%. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the addition of Wyeth's operations and the resulting change in mix of products and businesses, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange. 
The increases in adjusted SI&A and R&D were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. In addition, our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio contributed to the increase in R&D expenses. Given that our spending will vary from quarter to quarter, we are reaffirming our 2010 guidance ranges for all elements of adjusted total cost. For example, in 2010, we expect to increase spending in support of the launch of Prevnar 13 for infants and toddlers, certain product initiatives including the resumption of the previously successful Chantix DTC campaign and the expansion of our field force in certain emerging markets.
Foreign exchange continued to have a positive impact on revenues and a negative impact on adjusted total cost this quarter versus the prior-year quarter. The net effect to foreign exchange favorably impacted adjusted diluted EPS by $0.02 in the first quarter. 
Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased 44% in the first quarter, with operational growth of 38%. I'd like to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer operational performance was impacted year-over-year by both the loss of exclusivity of certain products and the reclassification of certain revenues among the various units.
Legacy Pfizer Oncology unit revenues in the first quarter of 2010 no longer include Camptosar's European revenues due to its loss of exclusivity in July of 2009. Camptosar's European revenues are now included in the Established Products unit beginning in first quarter 2010. This reclassification of revenues negatively impacted the Oncology unit's  performance by 24% first quarter of 2010 compared to prior-year quarter.
Also, revenues from South Korea were included in the Emerging Markets unit in '09, but are now included in the Developed Market units as appropriate beginning the first quarter of 2010. This negatively impacted legacy Pfizer's Emerging Market units revenues by 5%. 
Finally, legacy Pfizer Established Product unit revenues were adversely impacted by 5% in the first quarter due to loss of exclusivity of Norvasc in Canada in July of '09. This was offset by the favorable impact resulting from the addition of Camptosar's European revenues, as well as the reclassification revenues from South Korea. 
In the first quarter, revenues from our Diversified business increased year-over-year, mainly due to the addition of Wyeth products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The strong operational performance of legacy Pfizer Animal Health grew 17% and Capsugel's 8% operational growth both contributed to the increase of Diversified revenues.
We continue to make steady progress on the integration of Pfizer and Wyeth. In the first quarter of 2010, our workforce level decreased by 2,700. Since the closing of the Wyeth acquisition in October of '09, our workforce level has decreased by 6,900 people. In addition, we expect to announce our Plant Network Strategy during the second quarter of 2010. 
We are on track to deliver on our 2012 cost reduction target of $4 billion to $5 billion, with approximately 50% expected to be achieved in 2010, 75% in 2011 and 100% by the end of 2012. 
As I mentioned earlier, Q1 2010 revenues reflect the reduction of $56 million due to the recently enacted healthcare legislation. We expect the impact of this legislation to unfavorably impact full year 2010 revenues by approximately $300 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the base Medicaid rebate rate and the extension of the Medicaid rebates to certain managed care organizations effective January 1 and March 23, respectively; and the expansion of the Public Health Service 340B Program to include additional institutions effective January 1, 2010.
In addition, we expect these factors, plus the discount on branded pharmaceuticals for Medicare Part D participants in the doughnut hole, as well as the annual fee on branded pharmaceuticals sales to government programs to unfavorably impact 2011 revenues by approximately $900 million and 2012 revenues by approximately $800 million. 
We are reaffirming our full year 2010 financial guidance. I'd like to point out that in reaffirming this guidance, we are absorbing the anticipated impacts of healthcare legislation in the U.S. and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. While we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS target ranges, we are, however, decreasing the 2012 target revenue range by approximately $800 million to reflect the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation. We are now targeting 2012 reported revenue to be in the range of $65.2 billion to $67.7 billion. That said, we are reaffirming all remaining elements of our 2012 financial targets. We expect to offset the impact of the anticipated revenue decrease in earnings through spending reductions and as necessary, by other means that are available to us.
So moving on to the key takeaways, as expected, legacy Wyeth operations had a favorable impact on operational performance this quarter. We are making steady progress on our integration, and we remain on track to deliver our 2012 cost reduction target of $4 billion to $5 billion, with approximately 50% expected to be achieved in 2010, 75% in 2011 and 100% by the end 2012. We are reaffirming our 2010 financial guidance despite the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have updated our 2012 target revenue range to reflect the anticipated unfavorable impact of revenue on revenue of U.S. healthcare legislation, while reaffirming all other elements of our 2012 financial targets, including EPS. 
And finally, given the prevailing market conditions, we believe that share buybacks represent an attractive investment opportunity for the company and a prudent use of our capital. And to punctuate what Jeff mentioned earlier, we intend to buy back shares opportunistically as market conditions warrant. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

But I'll let Frank address the second in case that's also part of your question. I think it's important to recognize the different parts of our business or the different stages of the integration, and some of them are quite far along. So you take our Established Products business, for example, under Dave Simmons' leadership, they're very far along in terms of the integration of their business, and I think have a great deal of capacity to bolt on or integrate additional activities. Other parts of the business, possibly less so. We're certainly mindful of the distraction and disruption that large deals can cause. I think you could say, in many ways, we're quite expert in that from a historical basis. And I think we've learned a lot over the years on how to deal with that. I think one of the benefits of our business unit model is, that different businesses have the capability at different points in their planning and execution to take on different levels of integration of different-sized businesses. So I wouldn't want to give a generalized answer to that. It depends on the business and where they are. And I can assure you, though, that as we look at different business development opportunities, that's one of the most important considerations we take into effect. Sometimes we even look at opportunities that might involve a reverse integration because sometimes there's an opportunity to take on skills and capabilities that the target might provide to us that would be beneficial. So I think we're very careful to take that sort of thing into account, and it's very relevant to our consideration. To the extent that you're asking about financial capacity, maybe I'll let Frank address that."

Second question is, my understanding is that, at least in the not-so-distant past, Pfizer was exploring, breaking itself up into truly separate, independent entities that would've gone beyond the current business in the structure you currently have, is that still a consideration or has this idea moved squarely into the path [ph] (51:16)?"

I'm not sure specifically what you're referring to in terms of a prior review of the question, but let me say my view of this as I've expressed it before. We are  about a year and half, two years into the business unit model that we have and seven months into the Wyeth closing. That has provided us with a portfolio of nine business units which, as I said, we're seven months into now. Our obligation for our shareholders is to maximize the value of these business units, whether inside of Pfizer or if their value can be maximized in some other way, so be it. We are allocating capital across the portfolio as we believe most appropriate to maximize their value, both within each business unit and to the extent that they can create value with each other and create more value by being inside of Pfizer. That needs to be demonstrated. We look all the time at opportunities to do that. We believe there are opportunities to do that. But I also have told everybody here, and they know that, that we need to justify to ourselves and to our shoulders that, that's the best way to create value. It is early in the game here in terms of having this portfolio. I personally believe there are lots of opportunities for the combination of these assets and businesses to create greater value together, and we are exploring that. Over time, we'll continue to look for that, and we need to demonstrate that to ourselves and to our shareholders. As we sit here today, we are very excited about the opportunities and promise that these businesses have. But it is our obligation to continue to look at that question, and we'll continue to do so."

First of all, the branded generic business is among the most, fastest-growing segment in the biopharmaceutical industry. There is an overlap here in terms of Emerging Markets, and branded generics can be profitable. As I said in my opening comments, while the prices are lower, the cost structure is lower, the risk can be different. And in many marketplaces, branded generics, because physicians and patients are making the decisions, do command brand loyalty and price opportunities. And without commenting on other companies' strategies, I believe that Pfizer's scale, its go-to-market strategy, its experience in building brands, its relationships with key opinion leaders and the ability to bring a portfolio to the marketplace in many countries outside of the United States and outside of markets that have been commoditized, actually creates a very strong profitable growth opportunities for that business.

I'm here with Jeff Kindler, Frank D'Amelio, Ian Read, and other members of our leadership team. The financial charts that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page at www.pfizer.com in the Investor Presentations tab by clicking on the link Quarterly Corporate Performance Second Quarter 2010. Also, I would add that this quarter we have begun providing a more detailed geographic revenue breakdown in our financial tables.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K, and in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Also, the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, August 3, 2010. These reports are available at our website at pfizer.com in the Investors SEC Filings section.

First, for the second consecutive full quarters since we closed the Wyeth deal, we are reporting strong top and bottom line results across the business. Second, we are improving our outlook for the rest of this year. We are now projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share in the upper end of our range. Third, we are reaffirming every element of our targets for 2012 despite the headwinds of global economic challenges, U.S. healthcare reform, European pricing challenges and foreign exchange fluctuations. Fourth, as I discussed last quarter, we recognized that returning cash to our shareholders is an important part of how we deploy your capital. Consistent with that, we are today reporting on our repurchase of common stock during the quarter. Fifth, also consistent with that important principle, we are today reaffirming that barring significant unforeseen events, we expect our Board to approve an increase in the dividend at its December meeting. And sixth, we are announcing today that in light of our current assessment of the company's solid financial position and its strong operational prospects, we're now targeting a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
Looking ahead, we intend to continue delivering strong, steady and consistent results, even in times of economic uncertainty and even as different parts of our business face different challenges and seize the different opportunities offered by healthcare needs around the world. We believe we are well positioned to do this, based on the key factors that have driven our performance over the two complete quarters since we acquired Wyeth. 
First, the relentless insistence on operational execution produced by our customer-focused accountable business units. Second, our disciplined deployment of capital to achieve the right returns for the distinct risks and opportunities offered by different areas of medical research, products and markets, coupled with an ongoing drive across the company for continuing improvements in productivity. And third, a business mix of products, businesses, geographies and areas of medical research that balances both our risks and our opportunities.
To reinforce this last point, please take a look at this chart. This chart shows the share of our revenue generated by each business unit during this quarter compared to the same quarter last year before the Wyeth acquisition. I'd like to call your attention to the share represented by our Primary Care business unit, the blue slice on the pie chart. This business sells patent-protected Primary Care products in developed countries, including the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia. Sales of those types of products in those types of markets dominated Pfizer's earnings prospects in the recent past. This chart shows us that it's changing significantly. As you can see, Primary Care generated nearly half of our revenues in the second quarter of last year. By contrast, it represents about a third of our revenues this quarter. That's important to emphasize that the need to prevent and treat Primary Care diseases in the developed world is greater than ever, and the opportunities for Pfizer to create shareholder value in addressing those needs are still enormous. In fact, our confidence in Pfizer's ability to meet those needs is strengthened by the performance of the Primary Care business unit both this quarter and year-to-date. In a very difficult operating environment, the legacy Pfizer Primary Care business increased operationally 5% this quarter compared to last year: 4%, United States; 2%, Western Europe; and 11% in the other developed countries, including Japan, Australia and Canada, and nearly all of our key Primary Care products did well across the developed world. 
You may recall that last quarter, I spoke about how we target support of our in-line products in particular markets based on rigorous and proven ROI methodologies. This quarter, you can see some of the results of that in the performance of products like Lyrica, Celebrex and Viagra. Now all that said, we all know that Primary Care in the developed markets faces particularly tough challenges in meeting the expectations of patients, payers and regulators and facing competition from generics, and most importantly, in discovering and developing treatments for devastating diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's. 
So our overall ability to deliver strong and consistent results for our shareholders over time is substantially enhanced by balancing the opportunities and the risks offered by the Primary Care business, with increasingly substantial contributions from a wide range of products and markets that offer entirely different risk and return profiles. 
One example is our Specialty Care business in the developed world, the green slice on the pie chart. This business includes products whose technology, life cycles, pricing structures and other characteristics are quite different than those of Primary Care. Products like the world's leading vaccine, Prevnar, and its leading biologic, Enbrel. As you can see from the chart, our Specialty Care business produced 13% of our revenues in the second quarter of last year. By comparison this quarter, Specialty generated 22% of our sales and 5% of those sales came from vaccines.
Another set of business is offering a different balance of opportunities and risks are those within our Diversified business unit, the orange slice. As you know, the Wyeth acquisition added the Consumer Nutrition businesses to our portfolio and substantially enhanced our Animal Health business. As a group, our Diversified Businesses represented 8% of our revenues at this time last year, but they produced 13% of our sales this quarter. And as you can see from the chart, 5% of those Diversified business revenues are coming from the Emerging Markets.
And of course, the Emerging Markets unit itself, the red slice, which represents our Biopharmaceutical businesses in those geographies, as well as the Established Products unit, the off-patent products in the developed world, the yellow slice, also provide opportunities and risks quite different from the Primary Care business. The Established Products business remains on track to become a long-term source of growth. And in this quarter, Emerging Markets delivered a strong performance, growing 11% on a legacy Pfizer operational basis.
Our experience with Prevnar in China is a good example of what's driving growth in the Emerging Markets, and how the combination with Wyeth is producing shareholder value. In just the first six months of this year alone, sales of Prevnar in China have already surpassed the vaccine sales in China for all of last year. In fact, China powerfully illustrates, in an important growth market, the benefits of the Wyeth acquisition in our broad portfolio, our business unit structure and its focus on execution and our disciplined approach to capital investment and productivity. In China, our legacy Pfizer business produced operational growth of about 30%. Together with the addition of the Wyeth products, we now have a business in China that is twice as large as it was a year ago, a business that generated nearly $0.5 billion in this quarter.
We'll continue to review the balance of risks and opportunities in our business, so that we can deliver strong, consistent results for our shareholders over time. This balance is especially valuable in generating steady results because our core mission of bringing forth innovative, new medical treatments in ways that generate good returns for shareholders is a risky enterprise, and it always will be. Now on that point, I want to be very clear. I fully understand the significance to Pfizer's current valuation of our track record in R&D and of the historical return on capital invested in research. And one of my highest personal priorities is addressing R&D productivity and have it generate the best return from R&D for investors. That is also true for Ian, for Frank and from Mikael Dolsten, who as you know is appointed Head of Worldwide R&D during the quarter. 
Meanwhile, we continue to see data emerge from our late stage pipeline. And in that regard, we had both good news and bad news in the quarter. Certainly, the FDA's decisions regarding Tanezumab were both surprising and disappointing. By contrast, crizotinib has generated impressive and important clinical results for people suffering from lung cancer despite having smoked very little or not at all. In fact, the crizotinib results are so strong that we are planning to file for approval during the first half of next year, much sooner than originally expected. 
In addition, in June, along with Bristol-Myers, we announced the early termination of the Phase III trial for apixaban because it showed clear evidence of a reduction in stroke and embolism when compared to aspirin. We expect the initial scientific presentation of these results to occur at the European Society of Cardiology meeting at the end of the month. We're working to publish the data and are assessing our regulatory options based on these positive developments. And during the balance of the year, we expect to receive Phase III clinical results for a variety of compounds, including Prevenar 13 in adults, tasocitinib, bosutinib, axitinib and SUTENT for non-small cell lung cancer. We're looking forward to seeing these results, and I know you are as well. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Before I begin, I want to punctuate Jeff's previous comments regarding Pfizer's dividend. First, we have continued confidence in the business given the strong operational performance that we posted for the two full quarters that have included Wyeth operations. These results demonstrate the strength of our more balanced portfolio. In addition, we have continued confidence in the Wyeth integration and our initiatives are remaining on track. Finally, we continue to expect to generate consistent results over the long term, including cash flow, which we anticipate will benefit shareholders through appropriate levels of investment in the business and our pipeline to generate profitable revenue growth, as well as a direct return of cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
We understand the importance of our dividend, as well as our payout ratio relative to that of our peers. As such, we are now targeting a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average of approximately 40% in about three years. While the dividend level remains a decision of the Board and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we currently anticipate Board approval of the dividend increase in December. 
Now let's move on to the second quarter financial results. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. The 58% year-over-year increase in second quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable to the addition of Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues by 50%, as well as legacy Pfizer products, which increased revenues by 3%. Second quarter revenues also included the positive effect of foreign exchange of $584 million or 5%. The increases in adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products and foreign exchange, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, a higher net interest expense and an increase in the effective tax rate. Also, it's important to remember that both reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
Second quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations and to a much lesser extent by foreign exchange, which increased adjusted total cost by $48 million or 1%. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the change in mix of products and businesses, resulting from the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The increases in adjusted SI&A and R&D were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. In addition, our continued investment in our late stage development portfolio contributed to the increase in R&D expenses.
Foreign exchange continued to have a positive impact on revenues and a negative impact on adjusted total costs this quarter. While foreign exchange had a negative impact on adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, it had a positive effect of $99 million or 6% on adjusted cost of sales. The net effect to foreign exchange favorably impacted adjusted diluted EPS by $0.04 in the second quarter.
Beginning this quarter, we've included additional schedules to our financial tables, which break out the revenues for our top Biopharmaceutical products and our total Diversified business by geographic market, including the following international markets: developed Europe, developed Rest of World and Emerging Markets. As we have previously stated, given the volatility of Emerging Markets, we do expect performance to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 
Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased 49% in the second quarter, with operational growth of 44%, of which $4.2 billion or 41% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products and $313 million or 3% was attributable to legacy Pfizer products. I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products. Also, the switch to our fee-for-service distribution model had a favorable impact of $308 million on legacy Pfizer's second quarter U.S. Biopharmaceutical sales which as expected, essentially offset the unfavorable impact from this switch in the first quarter. Also, foreign exchange had a positive impact of $485 million or 5% on Biopharmaceutical revenues. It's important to remember that Pfizer's international calendar ends on November 30. And as a result, the second quarter of the year includes international results for March, April and May. June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro. This will be incorporated into our third quarter results.
Second quarter Diversified revenues increased 169% year-over-year, mainly due to the addition of Wyeth products and to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, which had a 12% positive impact on Diversified revenues. Operationally, Diversified revenues increased 157%. Second quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations, increased 90% year-over-year, driven by the significant contribution of legacy Wyeth products and legacy Pfizer revenues in Emerging Markets, which increased 11% year-over-year. It's important to note that Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey, contributed a combined 46% to the overall growth in Emerging Markets. And legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in these countries grew 19% operationally in the quarter.
We are reaffirming all elements of our 2010 full year guidance and expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the upper end of our guidance range with expenses in the lower end of our ranges. I'd like to point out that there are several factors that will unfavorably impact our revenues for the second half of the year, including LIPITOR's loss of exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010, Effexor's global loss of exclusivity in July of 2010, two additional selling days in the U.S. during the first half of the year versus the second half and continued pricing pressure in Europe. All other things being equal, the combined effect of these factors is expected to decrease second half 2010 revenues by approximately $2 billion. It's also important to remember that the level of our expenses varies from quarter to quarter.
All of these factors have been considered in our 2010 guidance. Therefore, we believe it's most prudent to maintain our current full year 2010 guidance ranges. Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our 2012 financial targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation, as does our 2010 guidance. And our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities up to 5% of our revenue target.
Moving on to key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved strong operational performance, while at the same time advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We are reaffirming all elements of our 2010 guidance, and at this point, expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the upper end of our guidance range with expenses in the lower end of our ranges, and we have reaffirmed our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to deliver our anticipated cost reductions, including achieving 50% in 2010. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $500 million worth of Pfizer shares, as we believe that given the prevailing market conditions, share repurchases are an attractive investment opportunity and a prudent use of our capital. Again, while the dividend level remains a decision of the Board and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, barring unforeseen events, we currently anticipate Board approval of a dividend increase in December, and we are now targeting a dividend payout ratio comparable to that of the current industry average of approximately 40% in about three years. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jeff."

How should we think about the trajectory of those potential increases? Is that something that will be relatively consistent over the next three years? Or should we think about those potential increases as more back-end loaded as you get past the 2012 patent cycle? Second question was with the capital structure currently, what type of constraint should we think about when considering your share repo, your dividend, your business development ambitions? Basically, what type of debt levels and leverage are you now comfortable operating with given the more diversified business that you have? And the final question was thinking about the longer-term model. You've moved your Primary Care business, obviously, down to 34% this quarter, given a number of major patent expirations and what appears to be some of your larger pipeline opportunities coming from non-Primary Care areas. Where should we think about PCP going as a percent revenue over time? Could we see that number go below 25% when you consider your longer-term targets?"

We're able to fund the business operationally and do the things we need to do. And to invest in future profitable growth, I think, we're seeing some of that. In our Emerging Markets, for example, we had a strong quarter in China. We've been deploying capital in China, and we're getting a nice return on that capital. So from my perspective, I think we have lots of flexibility to do the things that we need to do to invest in the business, to return capital to our shareholders.

In terms of business development, we continue to view bolt-on transactions as prudent from a business development perspective, and the focused areas have not changed.

So on foreign exchange, the reason that we've been different than our competitors is really based on our fiscal calendar for international. So remember, our fiscal year ends in November for our International business. So for the second quarter, it includes the months of March, April and May. Whereas for the rest of the industry on a whole, it's April, May and June. So in the quarter, we had March and not June. And what happens, Tim, is if you look at the euro to the dollar, for example, in March, it was 1.36 on average. If you look at the euro to the dollar on average for June, it was 1.23. So if we had June in the results, our $0.04 benefit would have been more like $0.02 on an EPS basis. The 5% in revenue would have been more like, call it, 2%. So it's really the calendar, the months that are included in the calendar that caused the difference. On foreign exchange impact for the year, I think what I would say is, this quarter, it was $584 million on revenue. On a year-to-date basis, it's $1,316,000,000. I'm trying to project that on a going-forward basis. Just with all the moving parts and with the different currencies and the basket of currencies that we have, it's extremely difficult. And the third question? On Emerging Markets, that 11% was operational. It excluded foreign exchange.

First, for the third consecutive full quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, we are reporting solid operating performance. Second, given this performance and our continued confidence in the business, we are increasing both the top end and the bottom end of our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Third, we are once again reaffirming the financial targets that we've set out for 2012. It's important to emphasize that we are raising this year's guidance and reaffirming the 2012 targets despite uncertainty in the global economy, strong competitive challenges and significant changes in the regulatory and public policy environment across the markets in which we operate.
Fourth, consistent with our commitment to enhancing total shareholder value, we are continuing to return cash to our owners. During the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased a total of $1 billion in stock at an average price of $16.40 per share. 
And finally, fifth, also consistent with that commitment, we are on track to paying nearly $6 billion in dividends this year. As we have previously stated, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in December, and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
Now on the subject of capital allocation, I want to highlight a particularly important point illustrated this quarter. As we said we would do, we have continued to deploy your capital in discipline business development activities that allow us to shape our balanced business portfolio in order to maximize shareholder value. And I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning discussing the deals we announced since the beginning of September in the context of the balanced business portfolio that I described on last quarter's earnings call.
First, let me review briefly the context. We closed the Wyeth acquisition just over a year ago, and since then, we have moved quickly to integrate the companies to achieve our planned cost synergies and to deliver solid financial performance form the combined company. The people  and assets that Wyeth brought to us, together with the changes we have made in our leadership, culture and operating model over the last three years have positioned us to deliver three important things: One, producing steady, reliable, adjusted earnings growth over time; two, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks; and three, making disciplined internal and external investments in innovative new treatments and cures that produce good returns on your capital. 
The foundation for these results is a dynamic portfolio of businesses, products, geographies and areas of research that balances both our risks and our opportunities. That portfolio enables us to advance our strategies of growing our patent-protected portfolio in priority therapeutic areas, in vaccines and Biologics and Established Products, in Emerging Markets and in appropriate Diversified businesses. Now each of the five actions that we recently announced significantly advances these strategies and helps us further balance our portfolio, businesses and products. And let me show you what I mean. 
In Primary Care, which currently accounts for about 1/3 of our revenues, we have identified pain as one of our 'Invest to Win' therapeutic areas because of our strong capabilities in this area and because of the growing market for this condition of unmet medical need. Our pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals will provide an excellent complement to our current portfolio of pain treatments, which ranges from Advil and Pharma care to Celebrex and Lyrica, as well as several promising pipeline candidates. King is the leader in new formulation of pain treatment designed to discourage common methods of misuse and abuse. King's assets will provide Pfizer with multiple new drug-delivery platforms, as well as potential long-term upside in our Primary Care Established Products as well as in our Animal Health business.
Now in Specialty Care, which generates almost a quarter of our revenues. We have strengthened our presence in the growing orphan diseases market by acquiring FoldRx, privately held drug discovery and clinical develop and company. FoldRx brings us on oral once-daily small-molecule candidate with a potential to treat a fatal, genetic neuro degenerative disease for which a liver transplant currently is the only available treatment. It brings us greater understanding of protein misfolding, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying cause in many chronic degenerative diseases.
Meanwhile in Established Products, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, our alliance with Biocon, India's leading Biotech Company, will advance our strategies in biosimilars and will position us competitively in the diabetes market over time. This is important in the developing world where patients uninterrupted access to insulin is often very difficult, as well as in developed countries like United States, where the CDC just announced that up to 1/3 of the population could be living with diabetes within a generation.
Turning to our Emerging Markets business, which produces about an eight of our revenues, we agreed last month to acquire 40% of Laboratorio Teuto Brasileiro, a privately held company in Brazil that approximately 250 branded and unbranded generic product pharmaceuticals in more than 400 presentations. This partnership will get us access to a large network of independent distributors that reach more than 36,000 pharmacies in rural and suburban Brazil and customers that Pfizer is not currently reaching. This agreement also includes the opportunity to commercialize the Teuto's products outside Brazil, which we believe offers substantial promise for both our Emerging Markets and our Established Products business.
Finally, within our Diversified businesses, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, we announced that we are reviewing strategical alternatives for Capsugel. I've said before that review of the role, fit and value creation of each of our businesses is part of our ongoing review of our dynamic business portfolio. We will continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Capsugel represents a unique business, with strong potential for growth outside of Pfizer, and now is the right time to undertake this review.
It's worth noting that each of these business development actions came about as a result of the speed, focus and agility that characterize our business unit operating model. Around here we use the phrase, the power of scale, the spirit of small. These announcements demonstrated that concept in action. Because our respective business unit leaders and their teams understand their distinct customers, marketplaces and competitors, they saw the chance to create value, and they moved quickly to bring these opportunities forward. For our part, corporate level leadership ensured that the right hurdle rates were applied, that there was appropriate discipline around price and terms and that Pfizer's scale and resources were brought to bear when appropriate.  Once the deals are closed, the leaders of the relevant business units will be accountable for the success of each of these deals.
Now in addition to our business development activities, we continue, of course, to advance our late-stage development pipeline, and we have several important milestones ahead. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology, we will provide an update on the development of tasocitinib, our oral JAK inhibitor, and we will present Phase III data from our initial study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we remain on track to submit regulatory applications for an adult indication education for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and by the end of this year. Pfizer has completed it's Phase III trials in support of these regulatory submissions.
With respect to apixaban, our factor Xa inhibitor, based on the strength of the preliminary Phase III AVERROES study data, our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week that the companies have initiated a rolling submission with the FDA under the trade name Eloquise [ph] for people with atrial fibrillation that is unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. And finally, in the first half of next year, we anticipate filing with the FDA for crizotinib, our novel personalized agent for people with lung cancer.
To wrap up, I believe our results this quarter, like each quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, demonstrate that the changes we have been make at Pfizer have enabled us to deliver steady, consistent, adjusted earnings results to return cash to shareholders and to make disciplined investments in medicines that will produce good returns for our shareholders. And we are doing so consistently despite global economic headwinds, currency fluctuations, competitive challenges and regulatory and public policy uncertainties. That is because today, our company has a dynamic portfolio of businesses that represents a good balance of risks and opportunities across products, geographies, technologies and customers. 
We continuously review of our portfolio. We're relentlessly focused on cost productivity and capital discipline. And our culture emphasizes focus and accountability. We have the benefits that come with the scale and resources of a large company, but our business unit operating model allows us to move into agility necessary to seize valuable opportunities like the ones I described this morning. With that, I'll ask Frank to review our third quarter results."
162270,114083296,84376,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move onto third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attr",1244,"Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move onto third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable for the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues by $5.2 billion or 44%, partially offset by a $458 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products and a $160 million or 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.
The year-over-year decrease in third quarter 2010 reported net income and reported diluted EPS was due to a non-cash impairment charge resulting from updated forecast of certain Wyeth assets compared with the fair values estimated at the closing of the acquisition last year. This pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion consists of IPR&D charges of about $715 million and brand assets and developed technology charges of approximately $750 million. 
These updated cash flow projections are based on the most recently projected development of regulatory time frames and the current market environment for brands assets and their planned investments support. I want to point out that the we do not expect these updated projections to have an impact on our 2010 revenue or just adjusted diluted EPS targets, which we are reaffirming today.
It's also important to remember that while there have been acquired assets and these projected values have decreased, there are acquired assets whose projected values have increased as well. However, these increases are not reflected in our third quarter financial statements because current accounting rules require that we record asset value decreases or impairments but do not allow us to record asset value increases subsequent to day zero.
In addition, reported net income and reported diluted EPS in the quarter were negatively impacted by a charge for expenses litigation of $701 million. The increase in an adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, lower aggregate revenues from legacy Pfizer products and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that both reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
Third quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by a 4% positive impact from foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 15.4% to 18.3% was primarily due to the change in the mix of products and businesses resulting from the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The 43% increase in adjusted SI&A [selling, informational and administrative] expenses and 33% increase in R&D expenses were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, also driven by our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio, which contributed to this increase.
In the third quarter 2010, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $160 million on revenues and a positive impact of $298 million on adjusted total costs. The net effect of foreign exchange resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact to adjusted diluted EPS.
Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased $3.3 billion or 31% in the third quarter, with operational growth of 33%, of which $3.9 billion or 37% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, which was partially offset by $468 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products. 
It's important to remember that Pfizer's annual international calendar ends on November 30, and as a result, third quarter includes international results for June, July and August. As we previously stated on our second quarter earnings call, June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro, and therefore, this negative impact was reflected in our third quarter results.
Also, I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including Lipitor, which lost exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July of 2010.
Third quarter diversified revenues increased approximately $1.3 billion or 151% year-over-year due to the addition of Wyeth products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues in the third quarter was immaterial. Third quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations increased 66% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to significant contribution of legacy Wyeth products. It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey contributed a combined 46% to the overall growth in emerging markets and legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in this brick-entry markets grew 5% operationally in the third quarter and 10% operationally year-to-date. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2010, we are updating the ranges of our 2010 guidance. We are tightening the revenue range to $67 billion to $68 billion, decreasing and tightening the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 18.5% to 19%, tightening our adjusted SI&A expense range to $19.2 billion to $19.7 billion, tightening the adjusted R&D expense range to $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, expecting adjusted other deductions to be approximately $1 billion, maintaining our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income at approximately 30%, decreasing the reported diluted EPS range to $0.84 to $0.94 and, finally, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.17 to $2.22. 
As we previously stated and forecasted, the adjusted diluted EPS range absorbs effects of loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in July, too fewer selling days in the fourth what are compared with the fourth quarter and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in Canada and May of 2010 and Spain in July 2010. In addition, the range now reflects the impact of our recently announced collaboration with Biocon and the upfront payment that was included. Consequently, we expect these factors in the aggregate to negatively impact our fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07, which has been factored into our 2010 guidance.
Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our total financial targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation as does our 2010 guidance. And our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities, up to 5% of our revenue targets. 
So moving on key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved solid overall operational performance while, at the same time, advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We have tightened the ranges of all components of our 2010 financial guidance, including increasing and narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range, $2.17 to 2.22. And we have reaffirmed all of our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to deliver anticipated cost reductions, including achieving approximately 50% in 2010. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 500 million of Pfizer shares and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are advancing our strategic priorities through our recently announced review of strategic alternatives for our Capsugel business, collaboration with Biocon and pending collaboration with Teuto and acquisition of FoldRx and pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals.
Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck."

Our cost of sales guidance at the beginning of the year was 19% to 20%. We lowered that to 18.5% to 19% this quarter. After the quarter, cost of sales was 18.3%. If you remove the benefits of foreign exchange that they had on costs this quarter, 18.3% becomes 19.7%. But the overall, I'll call it, strength in our cost of goods sold is really being driven by our restructuring, our focus on cost reduction, all of the things that we've been doing to really manage our cost structure. So nothing unusual to answer your question specifically. It's really based on the actions that we've been taking. In terms of beyond Lipitor, the last part of your question, I think if you look at the rhythm of the business and where the growth is, the growth will put some pressure on our gross margins, but not on our operating margins. If you look at our targets for 2012, we have operating margins in the high-30s to low-40s, which is where operating margins are today. So some of that growth will lower gross margins than it does today. They'll have lower expenses, and we believe we maintain our operating margins."

And inventory, your wholesale inventory reduction, specifically in Russia, as they adjust just to the economic situations, we expect to see some softness continuing, I think, in Russia in the fourth quarter.

And how much time are you giving yourself? I appreciated your opening comments, it sounds like you were obviously managing the portfolio dynamically, but how much time are you giving yourself to make a decision with respect to these assets, especially given where the multiple is in the stock, and I think that would beg the question that maybe investors don't appreciate some of these other assets? And my other question both for you and to Frank, is that it is very good to see that continued share repurchase program. But $500 million still reflects a relatively lackluster pace, especially given your low-stock PE multiple and $20 billion in operating cash flow. So my question is this: Is this the pace that we should come to expect? Or do you see an opportunity to be more aggressive, especially in light of record-low borrowing costs?

I said it previously and I said it again this morning that we are engaged in a continuous review of the role of each of our businesses, not frankly just even the ones you mentioned. Every business has to demonstrate in an ongoing basis that it's creating shareholder value in accordance with the strategic purpose of that business, with the return on capital that it's producing. That's it's creating more value inside Pfizer than outside Pfizer. That can range from all kinds of alternatives. The Capsugel decision to consider a strategic options for was the result of such review. And that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses consistent with what I talked about at the last quarter. So my view on that hasn't changed. In terms of timing, that's on ongoing process. I think that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses. And we have had this particular collection of businesses for just about a year. We are continuing to evaluate the opportunities that having these businesses together may create within Pfizer and exploring the degree to which some of the businesses you mentioned, may create more value together than in other forms. And we continue to do that. And that's an ongoing process, and we'll always be engage in that process, both in terms of potentially looking at businesses for strategic reviews, as well as bringing in businesses like we did with King. So I think that's just in the nature of managing what I call, a dynamic portfolio of balanced businesses, balance both in terms of the risk and their opportunities. And I'll let Frank address the share repurchases issue."

Probably the average price on that $1 billion is about $16.40. In addition to that $1 billion, we'll be paying out in our dividend this year about $6 billion. So between the stock buyback and dividend this year, now directly returning capital to shareholders in the amount of about $7 billion and significant unforeseen events aside, we expect the dividend to increase at our upcoming December meeting. In terms of what we're going to be going forward, what I would say is buybacks are clearly something we will continue to be opportunistic about as market conditions warrant, and remember, we have other potential uses of our capital like we did this quarter. This past quarter, we committed about $4 billion of cash for business development opportunities, which are the transactions that Jeff had talked about, with the biggest piece of that commitment obviously being King Pharma. And then in terms of the returns, on those business development transactions, obviously they are based on projections that we have to execute on. But we will execute and those returns are favorable.

We did tighten the range, but we absorbed in that range two items that were fairly significant, neither of which was in the range when we initially disclosed back at the beginning of the year. In terms of our 2012 targets, the revenue targets for 2012 now are a range of $65.2 billion to $67.7 billion, and we've said that they assume a modest level of business development, up to 5% of the total. And so if you do the math, 5% on that, call it $3 billion to $3.5 billion, we had about half of that done on this past quarter and particularly are primarily from acquisition. We've said, we'll never rule out anything. we said our objective is bolt-on acquisitions and the couple billion-dollars space, focus on emerging markets established products and 'Invest to Win' areas. That is our strategy. That continues to be our strategy. That's all."

First, for the third consecutive full quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, we are reporting solid operating performance. Second, given this performance and our continued confidence in the business, we are increasing both the top end and the bottom end of our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Third, we are once again reaffirming the financial targets that we've set out for 2012. It's important to emphasize that we are raising this year's guidance and reaffirming the 2012 targets despite uncertainty in the global economy, strong competitive challenges and significant changes in the regulatory and public policy environment across the markets in which we operate.
Fourth, consistent with our commitment to enhancing total shareholder value, we are continuing to return cash to our owners. During the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased a total of $1 billion in stock at an average price of $16.40 per share. 
And finally, fifth, also consistent with that commitment, we are on track to paying nearly $6 billion in dividends this year. As we have previously stated, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in December, and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
Now on the subject of capital allocation, I want to highlight a particularly important point illustrated this quarter. As we said we would do, we have continued to deploy your capital in discipline business development activities that allow us to shape our balanced business portfolio in order to maximize shareholder value. And I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning discussing the deals we announced since the beginning of September in the context of the balanced business portfolio that I described on last quarter's earnings call.
First, let me review briefly the context. We closed the Wyeth acquisition just over a year ago, and since then, we have moved quickly to integrate the companies to achieve our planned cost synergies and to deliver solid financial performance form the combined company. The people  and assets that Wyeth brought to us, together with the changes we have made in our leadership, culture and operating model over the last three years have positioned us to deliver three important things: One, producing steady, reliable, adjusted earnings growth over time; two, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks; and three, making disciplined internal and external investments in innovative new treatments and cures that produce good returns on your capital. 
The foundation for these results is a dynamic portfolio of businesses, products, geographies and areas of research that balances both our risks and our opportunities. That portfolio enables us to advance our strategies of growing our patent-protected portfolio in priority therapeutic areas, in vaccines and Biologics and Established Products, in Emerging Markets and in appropriate Diversified businesses. Now each of the five actions that we recently announced significantly advances these strategies and helps us further balance our portfolio, businesses and products. And let me show you what I mean. 
In Primary Care, which currently accounts for about 1/3 of our revenues, we have identified pain as one of our 'Invest to Win' therapeutic areas because of our strong capabilities in this area and because of the growing market for this condition of unmet medical need. Our pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals will provide an excellent complement to our current portfolio of pain treatments, which ranges from Advil and Pharma care to Celebrex and Lyrica, as well as several promising pipeline candidates. King is the leader in new formulation of pain treatment designed to discourage common methods of misuse and abuse. King's assets will provide Pfizer with multiple new drug-delivery platforms, as well as potential long-term upside in our Primary Care Established Products as well as in our Animal Health business.
Now in Specialty Care, which generates almost a quarter of our revenues. We have strengthened our presence in the growing orphan diseases market by acquiring FoldRx, privately held drug discovery and clinical develop and company. FoldRx brings us on oral once-daily small-molecule candidate with a potential to treat a fatal, genetic neuro degenerative disease for which a liver transplant currently is the only available treatment. It brings us greater understanding of protein misfolding, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying cause in many chronic degenerative diseases.
Meanwhile in Established Products, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, our alliance with Biocon, India's leading Biotech Company, will advance our strategies in biosimilars and will position us competitively in the diabetes market over time. This is important in the developing world where patients uninterrupted access to insulin is often very difficult, as well as in developed countries like United States, where the CDC just announced that up to 1/3 of the population could be living with diabetes within a generation.
Turning to our Emerging Markets business, which produces about an eight of our revenues, we agreed last month to acquire 40% of Laboratorio Teuto Brasileiro, a privately held company in Brazil that approximately 250 branded and unbranded generic product pharmaceuticals in more than 400 presentations. This partnership will get us access to a large network of independent distributors that reach more than 36,000 pharmacies in rural and suburban Brazil and customers that Pfizer is not currently reaching. This agreement also includes the opportunity to commercialize the Teuto's products outside Brazil, which we believe offers substantial promise for both our Emerging Markets and our Established Products business.
Finally, within our Diversified businesses, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, we announced that we are reviewing strategical alternatives for Capsugel. I've said before that review of the role, fit and value creation of each of our businesses is part of our ongoing review of our dynamic business portfolio. We will continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Capsugel represents a unique business, with strong potential for growth outside of Pfizer, and now is the right time to undertake this review.
It's worth noting that each of these business development actions came about as a result of the speed, focus and agility that characterize our business unit operating model. Around here we use the phrase, the power of scale, the spirit of small. These announcements demonstrated that concept in action. Because our respective business unit leaders and their teams understand their distinct customers, marketplaces and competitors, they saw the chance to create value, and they moved quickly to bring these opportunities forward. For our part, corporate level leadership ensured that the right hurdle rates were applied, that there was appropriate discipline around price and terms and that Pfizer's scale and resources were brought to bear when appropriate.  Once the deals are closed, the leaders of the relevant business units will be accountable for the success of each of these deals.
Now in addition to our business development activities, we continue, of course, to advance our late-stage development pipeline, and we have several important milestones ahead. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology, we will provide an update on the development of tasocitinib, our oral JAK inhibitor, and we will present Phase III data from our initial study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we remain on track to submit regulatory applications for an adult indication education for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and by the end of this year. Pfizer has completed it's Phase III trials in support of these regulatory submissions.
With respect to apixaban, our factor Xa inhibitor, based on the strength of the preliminary Phase III AVERROES study data, our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week that the companies have initiated a rolling submission with the FDA under the trade name Eloquise [ph] for people with atrial fibrillation that is unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. And finally, in the first half of next year, we anticipate filing with the FDA for crizotinib, our novel personalized agent for people with lung cancer.
To wrap up, I believe our results this quarter, like each quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, demonstrate that the changes we have been make at Pfizer have enabled us to deliver steady, consistent, adjusted earnings results to return cash to shareholders and to make disciplined investments in medicines that will produce good returns for our shareholders. And we are doing so consistently despite global economic headwinds, currency fluctuations, competitive challenges and regulatory and public policy uncertainties. That is because today, our company has a dynamic portfolio of businesses that represents a good balance of risks and opportunities across products, geographies, technologies and customers. 
We continuously review of our portfolio. We're relentlessly focused on cost productivity and capital discipline. And our culture emphasizes focus and accountability. We have the benefits that come with the scale and resources of a large company, but our business unit operating model allows us to move into agility necessary to seize valuable opportunities like the ones I described this morning. With that, I'll ask Frank to review our third quarter results.

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move onto third quarter financial results.

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move onto third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable for the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues by $5.2 billion or 44%, partially offset by a $458 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products and a $160 million or 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.
The year-over-year decrease in third quarter 2010 reported net income and reported diluted EPS was due to a non-cash impairment charge resulting from updated forecast of certain Wyeth assets compared with the fair values estimated at the closing of the acquisition last year. This pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion consists of IPR&D charges of about $715 million and brand assets and developed technology charges of approximately $750 million. 
These updated cash flow projections are based on the most recently projected development of regulatory time frames and the current market environment for brands assets and their planned investments support. I want to point out that the we do not expect these updated projections to have an impact on our 2010 revenue or just adjusted diluted EPS targets, which we are reaffirming today.
It's also important to remember that while there have been acquired assets and these projected values have decreased, there are acquired assets whose projected values have increased as well. However, these increases are not reflected in our third quarter financial statements because current accounting rules require that we record asset value decreases or impairments but do not allow us to record asset value increases subsequent to day zero.
In addition, reported net income and reported diluted EPS in the quarter were negatively impacted by a charge for expenses litigation of $701 million. The increase in an adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, lower aggregate revenues from legacy Pfizer products and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that both reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
Third quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by a 4% positive impact from foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 15.4% to 18.3% was primarily due to the change in the mix of products and businesses resulting from the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The 43% increase in adjusted SI&A [selling, informational and administrative] expenses and 33% increase in R&D expenses were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, also driven by our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio, which contributed to this increase.
In the third quarter 2010, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $160 million on revenues and a positive impact of $298 million on adjusted total costs. The net effect of foreign exchange resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact to adjusted diluted EPS.
Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased $3.3 billion or 31% in the third quarter, with operational growth of 33%, of which $3.9 billion or 37% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, which was partially offset by $468 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products. 
It's important to remember that Pfizer's annual international calendar ends on November 30, and as a result, third quarter includes international results for June, July and August. As we previously stated on our second quarter earnings call, June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro, and therefore, this negative impact was reflected in our third quarter results.
Also, I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including Lipitor, which lost exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July of 2010.
Third quarter diversified revenues increased approximately $1.3 billion or 151% year-over-year due to the addition of Wyeth products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues in the third quarter was immaterial. Third quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations increased 66% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to significant contribution of legacy Wyeth products. It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey contributed a combined 46% to the overall growth in emerging markets and legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in this brick-entry markets grew 5% operationally in the third quarter and 10% operationally year-to-date. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2010, we are updating the ranges of our 2010 guidance. We are tightening the revenue range to $67 billion to $68 billion, decreasing and tightening the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 18.5% to 19%, tightening our adjusted SI&A expense range to $19.2 billion to $19.7 billion, tightening the adjusted R&D expense range to $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, expecting adjusted other deductions to be approximately $1 billion, maintaining our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income at approximately 30%, decreasing the reported diluted EPS range to $0.84 to $0.94 and, finally, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.17 to $2.22. 
As we previously stated and forecasted, the adjusted diluted EPS range absorbs effects of loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in July, too fewer selling days in the fourth what are compared with the fourth quarter and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in Canada and May of 2010 and Spain in July 2010. In addition, the range now reflects the impact of our recently announced collaboration with Biocon and the upfront payment that was included. Consequently, we expect these factors in the aggregate to negatively impact our fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07, which has been factored into our 2010 guidance.
Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our total financial targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation as does our 2010 guidance. And our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities, up to 5% of our revenue targets. 
So moving on key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved solid overall operational performance while, at the same time, advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We have tightened the ranges of all components of our 2010 financial guidance, including increasing and narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range, $2.17 to 2.22. And we have reaffirmed all of our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to deliver anticipated cost reductions, including achieving approximately 50% in 2010. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 500 million of Pfizer shares and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are advancing our strategic priorities through our recently announced review of strategic alternatives for our Capsugel business, collaboration with Biocon and pending collaboration with Teuto and acquisition of FoldRx and pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals.
Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck.

Our cost of sales guidance at the beginning of the year was 19% to 20%. We lowered that to 18.5% to 19% this quarter. After the quarter, cost of sales was 18.3%. If you remove the benefits of foreign exchange that they had on costs this quarter, 18.3% becomes 19.7%. But the overall, I'll call it, strength in our cost of goods sold is really being driven by our restructuring, our focus on cost reduction, all of the things that we've been doing to really manage our cost structure. So nothing unusual to answer your question specifically. It's really based on the actions that we've been taking. In terms of beyond Lipitor, the last part of your question, I think if you look at the rhythm of the business and where the growth is, the growth will put some pressure on our gross margins, but not on our operating margins. If you look at our targets for 2012, we have operating margins in the high-30s to low-40s, which is where operating margins are today. So some of that growth will lower gross margins than it does today. They'll have lower expenses, and we believe we maintain our operating margins.

Jeff, in relation to your plans to consider alternative for Capsugel, does this signal a change in your view about keeping the other non-core assets at this dental health consumer and nutritionals? And how much time are you giving yourself? I appreciated your opening comments, it sounds like you were obviously managing the portfolio dynamically, but how much time are you giving yourself to make a decision with respect to these assets, especially given where the multiple is in the stock, and I think that would beg the question that maybe investors don't appreciate some of these other assets? And my other question both for you and to Frank, is that it is very good to see that continued share repurchase program. But $500 million still reflects a relatively lackluster pace, especially given your low-stock PE multiple and $20 billion in operating cash flow. So my question is this: Is this the pace that we should come to expect? Or do you see an opportunity to be more aggressive, especially in light of record-low borrowing costs? And I would also like to know how you think the IRRs on whatever M&A you might be just considering would compare to the IRRs on-share repurchase programs?

I said it previously and I said it again this morning that we are engaged in a continuous review of the role of each of our businesses, not frankly just even the ones you mentioned. Every business has to demonstrate in an ongoing basis that it's creating shareholder value in accordance with the strategic purpose of that business, with the return on capital that it's producing. That's it's creating more value inside Pfizer than outside Pfizer. That can range from all kinds of alternatives. The Capsugel decision to consider a strategic options for was the result of such review. And that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses consistent with what I talked about at the last quarter. So my view on that hasn't changed. In terms of timing, that's on ongoing process. I think that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses. And we have had this particular collection of businesses for just about a year. We are continuing to evaluate the opportunities that having these businesses together may create within Pfizer and exploring the degree to which some of the businesses you mentioned, may create more value together than in other forms. And we continue to do that. And that's an ongoing process, and we'll always be engage in that process, both in terms of potentially looking at businesses for strategic reviews, as well as bringing in businesses like we did with King. So I think that's just in the nature of managing what I call, a dynamic portfolio of balanced businesses, balance both in terms of the risk and their opportunities. And I'll let Frank address the share repurchases issue.

Last quarter, we also bought back $500 million of our stock, about 30.8 million shares. So about $1 billion of our stock has been repurchased. Probably the average price on that $1 billion is about $16.40. In addition to that $1 billion, we'll be paying out in our dividend this year about $6 billion. So between the stock buyback and dividend this year, now directly returning capital to shareholders in the amount of about $7 billion and significant unforeseen events aside, we expect the dividend to increase at our upcoming December meeting. In terms of what we're going to be going forward, what I would say is buybacks are clearly something we will continue to be opportunistic about as market conditions warrant, and remember, we have other potential uses of our capital like we did this quarter. This past quarter, we committed about $4 billion of cash for business development opportunities, which are the transactions that Jeff had talked about, with the biggest piece of that commitment obviously being King Pharma. And then in terms of the returns, on those business development transactions, obviously they are based on projections that we have to execute on. But we will execute and those returns are favorable.

We did not have factored into the guidance at that time the impact of healthcare reform U.S. reform and the European pricing pressures. Despite that, we were able to maintain our guidance range that we should at the beginning of the year where we did tightened it. So from my perspective, we did exactly what we said we're going to do. We did tighten the range, but we absorbed in that range two items that were fairly significant, neither of which was in the range when we initially disclosed back at the beginning of the year. In terms of our 2012 targets, the revenue targets for 2012 now are a range of $65.2 billion to $67.7 billion, and we've said that they assume a modest level of business development, up to 5% of the total. And so if you do the math, 5% on that, call it $3 billion to $3.5 billion, we had about half of that done on this past quarter and particularly are primarily from acquisition. We've said, we'll never rule out anything. we said our objective is bolt-on acquisitions and the couple billion-dollars space, focus on emerging markets established products and 'Invest to Win' areas. That is our strategy. That continues to be our strategy. That's all.

Second, given this performance and our continued",1515,"Thanks, Chuck, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start by making five key points. 
First, for the third consecutive full quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, we are reporting solid operating performance. Second, given this performance and our continued confidence in the business, we are increasing both the top end and the bottom end of our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Third, we are once again reaffirming the financial targets that we've set out for 2012. It's important to emphasize that we are raising this year's guidance and reaffirming the 2012 targets despite uncertainty in the global economy, strong competitive challenges and significant changes in the regulatory and public policy environment across the markets in which we operate.
Fourth, consistent with our commitment to enhancing total shareholder value, we are continuing to return cash to our owners. During the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased a total of $1 billion in stock at an average price of $16.40 per share. 
And finally, fifth, also consistent with that commitment, we are on track to paying nearly $6 billion in dividends this year. As we have previously stated, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in December, and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
Now on the subject of capital allocation, I want to highlight a particularly important point illustrated this quarter. As we said we would do, we have continued to deploy your capital in disciplined business development activities that allow us to shape our balanced business portfolio in order to maximize shareholder value. And I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning discussing the deals we announced since the beginning of September in the context of the balanced business portfolio that I described on last quarter's earnings call.
First, let me review briefly the context. We closed the Wyeth acquisition just over a year ago, and since then, we have moved quickly to integrate the companies to achieve our planned cost synergies and to deliver solid financial performance from the combined company. The people and assets that Wyeth brought to us, together with the changes we have made in our leadership, culture and operating model over the last three years have positioned us to deliver three important things: One, producing steady, reliable, adjusted earnings growth over time; two, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks; and three, making disciplined internal and external investments in innovative new treatments and cures that produce good returns on your capital. 
The foundation for these results is a dynamic portfolio of businesses, products, geographies and areas of research that balances both our risks and our opportunities. That portfolio enables us to advance our strategies of growing our patent-protected portfolio in priority therapeutic areas, in vaccines and Biologics and Established Products, in Emerging Markets and in appropriate Diversified businesses. Now each of the five actions that we recently announced significantly advances these strategies and helps us further balance our portfolio, businesses and products. And let me show you what I mean. 
In Primary Care, which currently accounts for about 1/3 of our revenues, we have identified pain as one of our 'Invest to Win' therapeutic areas because of our strong capabilities in this area and because of the growing market for this condition of unmet medical need. Our pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals will provide an excellent complement to our current portfolio of pain treatments, which ranges from Advil and ThermaCare to Celebrex and Lyrica, as well as several promising pipeline candidates. King is a leader in new formulations of pain treatment designed to discourage common methods of misuse and abuse. King's assets will provide Pfizer with multiple new drug-delivery platforms, as well as potential long-term upside in our Primary Care Established Products as well as in our Animal Health business.
Now in Specialty Care, which generates almost a quarter of our revenues, we have strengthened our presence in the growing orphan diseases market by acquiring FoldRX, a privately held drug discovery and clinical development company. FoldRX brings us on oral, once-daily, small-molecule candidate with the potential to treat a fatal genetic neuro-degenerative disease for which a liver transplant currently is the only available treatment. It brings us greater understanding of protein misfolding, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying cause in many chronic degenerative diseases.
Meanwhile in Established Products, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, our alliance with Biocon, India's leading biotech company, will advance our strategies in biosimilars and will position us competitively in the diabetes market over time. This is important in the developing world, where patients' uninterrupted access to insulin is often very difficult, as well as in developed countries like United States, where the CDC just announced that up to 1/3 of the population could be living with diabetes within a generation.
Turning to our Emerging Markets business, which produces about an eighth of our revenues, we agreed last month to acquire 40% of Laboratorio Teuto Brasileiro, a privately held company in Brazil with approximately 250 branded and unbranded generic pharmaceuticals in more than 400 presentations. This partnership will give us access to a large network of independent distributors that reach more than 36,000 pharmacies in rural and suburban Brazil and customers that Pfizer is not currently reaching. This agreement also includes the opportunity to commercialize Teuto's products outside Brazil, which we believe offers substantial promise for both our Emerging Markets and our Established Products business.
Finally, within our Diversified businesses, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for Capsugel. I've said before that review of the role, fit and value creation of each of our businesses is part of our ongoing review of our dynamic business portfolio. We will continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Capsugel represents a unique business, with strong potential for growth outside of Pfizer, and now is the right time to undertake this review.
It's worth noting that each of these business development actions came about as a result of the speed, focus and agility that characterize our business unit operating model. Around here we use the phrase, the power of scale, the spirit of small. These announcements demonstrated that concept in action. Because our respective business unit leaders and their teams understand their distinct customers, marketplaces and competitors, they saw the chance to create value, and they moved quickly to bring these opportunities forward. For our part, corporate-level leadership ensured that the right hurdle rates were applied, that there was appropriate discipline around price and terms and that Pfizer's scale and resources were brought to bear when appropriate.  Once the deals are closed, the leaders of the relevant business units will be accountable for the success of each of these deals.
Now in addition to our business development activities, we continue, of course, to advance our late-stage development pipeline, and we have several important milestones ahead. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology, we will provide an update on the development of tasocitinib, our oral JAK inhibitor, and we will present Phase III data from our initial study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we remain on track to submit regulatory applications for an adult indication education for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. by the end of this year. Pfizer has completed its Phase III trials in support of these regulatory submissions.
With respect to apixaban, our factor Xa inhibitor, based on the strength of the preliminary Phase III AVERROES study data, our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week that the companies have initiated a rolling submission with the FDA under the trade name Eloquise [ph] for people with atrial fibrillation that is unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. And finally, in the first half of next year, we anticipate filing with the FDA for crizotinib, our novel personalized agent for people with lung cancer.
To wrap up, I believe our results this quarter, like each quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, demonstrate that the changes we have been making at Pfizer have enabled us to deliver steady, consistent, adjusted earnings results to return cash to shareholders and to make disciplined investments in medicines that will produce good returns for our shareholders. And we are doing so consistently despite global economic headwinds, currency fluctuations, competitive challenges and regulatory public policy uncertainties. That is because today, our company has a dynamic portfolio of businesses that represents a good balance of risks and opportunities across products, geographies, technologies and customers. 
We continuously review our portfolio. We're relentlessly focused on cost productivity and capital discipline. And our culture emphasizes focus and accountability. We have the benefits that come with the scale and resources of a large company, but our business unit operating model allows us to move with the agility necessary to seize valuable opportunities like the ones I described this morning. With that, I'll ask Frank to review our third quarter results."
162270,114083296,84582,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move on to third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily att",1243,"Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move on to third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable for the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues by $5.2 billion or 44%, partially offset by a $458 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products and a $160 million or 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.
The year-over-year decrease in third quarter 2010 reported net income and reported diluted EPS was due to a non-cash impairment charge resulting from updated forecast of certain Wyeth assets compared with the fair values estimated at the closing of the acquisition last year. This pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion consists of IPR&D charges of about $715 million and brand assets and developed technology charges of approximately $750 million. 
These updated cash flow projections are based on the most recently projected development of regulatory time frames and the current market environment for brands assets and their planned investments support. I want to point out that the we do not expect these updated projections to have an impact on our 2012 revenue or adjusted diluted EPS targets, which we are reaffirming today.
It's also important to remember that while there have been acquired assets whose projected values have decreased, there are acquired assets whose projected values have increased as well. However, these increases are not reflected in our third quarter financial statements, because current accounting rules require that we record asset value decreases or impairments but do not allow us to record asset value increases subsequent to day zero.
In addition, reported net income and reported diluted EPS in the quarter were negatively impacted by a charge for asbestos litigation of $701 million. The increase in an adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, lower aggregate revenues from legacy Pfizer products and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that both reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
Third quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by a 4% positive impact from foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 15.4% to 18.3% was primarily due to the change in the mix of products and businesses resulting from the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The 43% increase in adjusted SI&A [selling, informational and administrative] expenses and 33% increase in R&D expenses were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, also driven by our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio, which contributed to this increase.
In the third quarter 2010, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $160 million on revenues and a positive impact of $298 million on adjusted total costs. The net effect of foreign exchange resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact to adjusted diluted EPS.
Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased $3.3 billion or 31% in the third quarter, with operational growth of 33%, of which $3.9 billion or 37% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, which was partially offset by $468 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products. 
It's important to remember that Pfizer's annual international calendar ends on November 30, and as a result, third quarter includes international results for June, July and August. As we previously stated on our second quarter earnings call, June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro, and therefore, this negative impact was reflected in our third quarter results.
Also, I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including Lipitor, which lost exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July of 2010.
Third quarter diversified revenues increased approximately $1.3 billion or 151% year-over-year due to the addition of Wyeth products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues in the third quarter was immaterial. Third quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations increased 66% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to significant contribution of legacy Wyeth products. It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey contributed a combined 46% to the overall growth in emerging markets, and legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in these BRIC-MT markets grew 5% operationally in the third quarter and 10% operationally year-to-date. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2010, we are updating the ranges of our 2010 guidance. We are tightening the revenue range to $67 billion to $68 billion, decreasing and tightening the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 18.5% to 19%, tightening our adjusted SI&A expense range to $19.2 billion to $19.7 billion, tightening the adjusted R&D expense range to $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, expecting adjusted other deductions to be approximately $1 billion, maintaining our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income at approximately 30%, decreasing the reported diluted EPS range to $0.84 to $0.89 and, finally, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.17 to $2.22. 
As we previously stated and forecasted, the adjusted diluted EPS range absorbs Effexor's loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in July, too fewer selling days in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July 2010. In addition, the range now reflects the impact of our recently announced collaboration with Biocon and the upfront payment that was included. Consequently, we expect these factors in the aggregate to negatively impact our fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07, which has been factored into our 2010 guidance.
Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our 2012 financial targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation as does our 2010 guidance. And our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities, up to 5% of our revenue targets. 
So moving on to key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved solid overall operational performance while at the same time advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We have tightened the ranges of all components of our 2010 financial guidance, including increasing and narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range, $2.17 to 2.22. And we have reaffirmed all of our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to deliver our anticipated cost reductions, including achieving approximately 50% in 2010. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of Pfizer shares and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are advancing our strategic priorities through our recently announced review of strategic alternatives for our Capsugel business, collaboration with Biocon and pending collaboration with Teuto and acquisition of FoldRx and pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals.
Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck."

Our cost of sales guidance at the beginning of the year was 19% to 20%. We lowered that to 18.5% to 19% this quarter. After the quarter, cost of sales was 18.3%. If you remove the benefits of foreign exchange that they had on costs this quarter, 18.3% becomes 19.7%. But the overall, I'll call it, strength in our cost of goods sold is really being driven by our restructuring, our focus on cost reduction, all of the things that we've been doing to really manage our cost structure. So nothing unusual, to answer your question specifically. It's really based on the actions that we've been taking. In terms of beyond Lipitor, the last part of your question, I think if you look at the rhythm of the business and where the growth is, the growth will put some pressure on our gross margins, but not on our operating margins. If you look at our targets for 2012, we have operating margins in the high-30s to low-40s, which is where operating margins are today. So some of that growth will lower gross margins than it does today. They'll have lower expenses, and we believe we maintain our operating margins."

And how much time are you giving yourself? I appreciated your opening comments, it sounds like you were obviously managing the portfolio dynamically, but how much time are you giving yourself to make a decision with respect to these and other assets, especially given where the multiple is in the stock, and I think that would beg the question that maybe investors don't appreciate some of these other assets? And my other question both for you and to Frank, is that it is very good to see the continued share repurchase programs. But $500 million still reflects a relatively lackluster pace, especially given your low-stock PE multiple and $20 billion in operating cash flow. So my question is this: Is this the pace that we should come to expect? Or do you see an opportunity to be more aggressive, especially in light of record-low borrowing costs?

I said it previously and I said it again this morning that we are engaged in a continuous review of the role of each of our businesses, not frankly just even the ones you mentioned. Every business has to demonstrate on an ongoing basis that it's creating shareholder value in accordance with the strategic purpose of that business, with the return on capital that it's producing. That's it's creating more value inside Pfizer than outside Pfizer. That can range from all kinds of alternatives. The Capsugel decision to consider strategic options for it was the result of one such review. And that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses consistent with what I talked about at the last quarter. So my view on that hasn't changed. In terms of timing, that's on ongoing process. I think that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses. And we have had this particular collection of businesses for just about a year. We are continuing to evaluate the opportunities that having these businesses together may create within Pfizer and exploring the degree to which some of the businesses you mentioned may create more value together than in other forms. And we'll continue to do that. And that's an ongoing process, and we'll always be engaged in that process, both in terms of potentially looking at businesses for strategic reviews, as well as bringing in businesses, like we did with King. So I think that's just in the nature of managing what I call a dynamic portfolio of balanced businesses, balanced both in terms of their risk and their opportunities. And I'll let Frank address the share repurchases issue."

Probably the average price on that $1 billion is about $16.40. In addition to that $1 billion, we'll be paying out in our dividend this year about $6 billion. So between the stock buyback and dividend this year, now directly returning capital to shareholders in the amount of about $7 billion and, significant unforeseen events aside, we expect the board to approve a dividend increase at our upcoming December meeting. In terms of what we're going to do going forward, what I would say is buybacks are clearly something we will continue to be opportunistic about as market conditions warrant, and, remember, we have other potential uses of our capital like we did this quarter. This past quarter, we committed about $4 billion of cash for business development opportunities, which are the transactions that Jeff had talked about, with the biggest piece of that commitment obviously being King Pharma. And then in terms of the returns on those business development transactions, obviously they are based on projections that we have to execute on. But we will execute and those returns are favorable.

Please remember, when we gave that $67 billion to $69 billion, that was the end of January, early February. We did not have factored into the guidance at that time the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. or European pricing pressures. Despite that, we were able to maintain our guidance range that we issued at the beginning of the year although we did tighten it. So from my perspective, we did exactly what we said we're going to do. We did tighten the range, but we absorbed in that range two items that were fairly significant, neither of which was in the range when we initially disclosed it back at the beginning of the year. In terms of our 2012 targets, the revenue targets for 2012 now are a range of $65.2 billion to $67.7 billion, and we've said that they assume a modest level of business development, up to 5% of the total. And so if you do the math, 5% on that, call it $3 billion to $3.5 billion, we had about half of that done this past quarter and particularly or primarily from acquisition. We've said, we'll never rule out anything. We said our objective is bolt-on acquisitions in the couple, the billion-dollar space, focused on emerging markets, established products and 'Invest to Win' areas. That is our strategy. That continues to be our strategy. That's all."

 First, for the third consecutive full quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, we are reporting solid operating performance. Second, given this performance and our continued confidence in the business, we are increasing both the top end and the bottom end of our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Third, we are once again reaffirming the financial targets that we've set out for 2012. It's important to emphasize that we are raising this year's guidance and reaffirming the 2012 targets despite uncertainty in the global economy, strong competitive challenges and significant changes in the regulatory and public policy environment across the markets in which we operate.
 Fourth, consistent with our commitment to enhancing total shareholder value, we are continuing to return cash to our owners. During the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased a total of $1 billion in stock at an average price of $16.40 per share.
 And finally, fifth, also consistent with that commitment, we are on track to paying nearly $6 billion in dividends this year. As we have previously stated, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in December, and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
 Now on the subject of capital allocation, I want to highlight a particularly important point illustrated this quarter. As we said we would do, we have continued to deploy your capital in discipline business development activities that allow us to shape our balanced business portfolio in order to maximize shareholder value. And I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning discussing the deals we announced since the beginning of September in the context of the balanced business portfolio that I described on last quarter's earnings call.
 First, let me review briefly the context. We closed the Wyeth acquisition just over a year ago, and since then, we have moved quickly to integrate the companies to achieve our planned cost synergies and to deliver solid financial performance form the combined company. The people  and assets that Wyeth brought to us, together with the changes we have made in our leadership, culture and operating model over the last three years have positioned us to deliver three important things: One, producing steady, reliable, adjusted earnings growth over time; two, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks; and three, making disciplined internal and external investments in innovative new treatments and cures that produce good returns on your capital.
 The foundation for these results is a dynamic portfolio of businesses, products, geographies and areas of research that balances both our risks and our opportunities. That portfolio enables us to advance our strategies of growing our patent-protected portfolio in priority therapeutic areas, in vaccines and Biologics and Established Products, in Emerging Markets and in appropriate Diversified businesses. Now each of the five actions that we recently announced significantly advances these strategies and helps us further balance our portfolio, businesses and products. And let me show you what I mean.
 In Primary Care, which currently accounts for about 1/3 of our revenues, we have identified pain as one of our 'Invest to Win' therapeutic areas because of our strong capabilities in this area and because of the growing market for this condition of unmet medical need. Our pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals will provide an excellent complement to our current portfolio of pain treatments, which ranges from Advil and Pharma care to Celebrex and Lyrica, as well as several promising pipeline candidates. King is the leader in new formulation of pain treatment designed to discourage common methods of misuse and abuse. King's assets will provide Pfizer with multiple new drug-delivery platforms, as well as potential long-term upside in our Primary Care Established Products as well as in our Animal Health business.
 Now in Specialty Care, which generates almost a quarter of our revenues. We have strengthened our presence in the growing orphan diseases market by acquiring FoldRx, privately held drug discovery and clinical develop and company. FoldRx brings us on oral once-daily small-molecule candidate with a potential to treat a fatal, genetic neuro degenerative disease for which a liver transplant currently is the only available treatment. It brings us greater understanding of protein misfolding, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying cause in many chronic degenerative diseases.
 Meanwhile in Established Products, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, our alliance with Biocon, India's leading Biotech Company, will advance our strategies in biosimilars and will position us competitively in the diabetes market over time. This is important in the developing world where patients uninterrupted access to insulin is often very difficult, as well as in developed countries like United States, where the CDC just announced that up to 1/3 of the population could be living with diabetes within a generation.
 Turning to our Emerging Markets business, which produces about an eight of our revenues, we agreed last month to acquire 40% of Laboratorio Teuto Brasileiro, a privately held company in Brazil that approximately 250 branded and unbranded generic product pharmaceuticals in more than 400 presentations. This partnership will get us access to a large network of independent distributors that reach more than 36,000 pharmacies in rural and suburban Brazil and customers that Pfizer is not currently reaching. This agreement also includes the opportunity to commercialize the Teuto's products outside Brazil, which we believe offers substantial promise for both our Emerging Markets and our Established Products business.
 Finally, within our Diversified businesses, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, we announced that we are reviewing strategical alternatives for Capsugel. I've said before that review of the role, fit and value creation of each of our businesses is part of our ongoing review of our dynamic business portfolio. We will continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Capsugel represents a unique business, with strong potential for growth outside of Pfizer, and now is the right time to undertake this review.
 It's worth noting that each of these business development actions came about as a result of the speed, focus and agility that characterize our business unit operating model. Around here we use the phrase, the power of scale, the spirit of small. These announcements demonstrated that concept in action. Because our respective business unit leaders and their teams understand their distinct customers, marketplaces and competitors, they saw the chance to create value, and they moved quickly to bring these opportunities forward. For our part, corporate level leadership ensured that the right hurdle rates were applied, that there was appropriate discipline around price and terms and that Pfizer's scale and resources were brought to bear when appropriate.  Once the deals are closed, the leaders of the relevant business units will be accountable for the success of each of these deals.
 Now in addition to our business development activities, we continue, of course, to advance our late-stage development pipeline, and we have several important milestones ahead. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology, we will provide an update on the development of tasocitinib, our oral JAK inhibitor, and we will present Phase III data from our initial study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we remain on track to submit regulatory applications for an adult indication education for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and by the end of this year. Pfizer has completed it's Phase III trials in support of these regulatory submissions.
 With respect to apixaban, our factor Xa inhibitor, based on the strength of the preliminary Phase III AVERROES study data, our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week that the companies have initiated a rolling submission with the FDA under the trade name Eloquise [ph] for people with atrial fibrillation that is unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. And finally, in the first half of next year, we anticipate filing with the FDA for crizotinib, our novel personalized agent for people with lung cancer.
 To wrap up, I believe our results this quarter, like each quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, demonstrate that the changes we have been make at Pfizer have enabled us to deliver steady, consistent, adjusted earnings results to return cash to shareholders and to make disciplined investments in medicines that will produce good returns for our shareholders. And we are doing so consistently despite global economic headwinds, currency fluctuations, competitive challenges and regulatory and public policy uncertainties. That is because today, our company has a dynamic portfolio of businesses that represents a good balance of risks and opportunities across products, geographies, technologies and customers.
 We continuously review of our portfolio. We're relentlessly focused on cost productivity and capital discipline. And our culture emphasizes focus and accountability. We have the benefits that come with the scale and resources of a large company, but our business unit operating model allows us to move into agility necessary to seize valuable opportunities like the ones I described this morning. With that, I'll ask Frank to review our third quarter results.

162270,114083296,86585,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move onto third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily att",1244," Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move onto third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable for the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues by $5.2 billion or 44%, partially offset by a $458 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products and a $160 million or 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.
 The year-over-year decrease in third quarter 2010 reported net income and reported diluted EPS was due to a non-cash impairment charge resulting from updated forecast of certain Wyeth assets compared with the fair values estimated at the closing of the acquisition last year. This pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion consists of IPR&D charges of about $715 million and brand assets and developed technology charges of approximately $750 million.
 These updated cash flow projections are based on the most recently projected development of regulatory time frames and the current market environment for brands assets and their planned investments support. I want to point out that the we do not expect these updated projections to have an impact on our 2010 revenue or just adjusted diluted EPS targets, which we are reaffirming today.
 It's also important to remember that while there have been acquired assets and these projected values have decreased, there are acquired assets whose projected values have increased as well. However, these increases are not reflected in our third quarter financial statements because current accounting rules require that we record asset value decreases or impairments but do not allow us to record asset value increases subsequent to day zero.
 In addition, reported net income and reported diluted EPS in the quarter were negatively impacted by a charge for expenses litigation of $701 million. The increase in an adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, lower aggregate revenues from legacy Pfizer products and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that both reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
 Third quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by a 4% positive impact from foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 15.4% to 18.3% was primarily due to the change in the mix of products and businesses resulting from the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The 43% increase in adjusted SI&A [selling, informational and administrative] expenses and 33% increase in R&D expenses were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, also driven by our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio, which contributed to this increase.
 In the third quarter 2010, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $160 million on revenues and a positive impact of $298 million on adjusted total costs. The net effect of foreign exchange resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact to adjusted diluted EPS.
 Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased $3.3 billion or 31% in the third quarter, with operational growth of 33%, of which $3.9 billion or 37% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, which was partially offset by $468 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products.
 It's important to remember that Pfizer's annual international calendar ends on November 30, and as a result, third quarter includes international results for June, July and August. As we previously stated on our second quarter earnings call, June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro, and therefore, this negative impact was reflected in our third quarter results.
 Also, I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including Lipitor, which lost exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July of 2010.
 Third quarter diversified revenues increased approximately $1.3 billion or 151% year-over-year due to the addition of Wyeth products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues in the third quarter was immaterial. Third quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations increased 66% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to significant contribution of legacy Wyeth products. It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey contributed a combined 46% to the overall growth in emerging markets and legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in this brick-entry markets grew 5% operationally in the third quarter and 10% operationally year-to-date.
 Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2010, we are updating the ranges of our 2010 guidance. We are tightening the revenue range to $67 billion to $68 billion, decreasing and tightening the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 18.5% to 19%, tightening our adjusted SI&A expense range to $19.2 billion to $19.7 billion, tightening the adjusted R&D expense range to $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, expecting adjusted other deductions to be approximately $1 billion, maintaining our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income at approximately 30%, decreasing the reported diluted EPS range to $0.84 to $0.94 and, finally, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.17 to $2.22.
 As we previously stated and forecasted, the adjusted diluted EPS range absorbs effects of loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in July, too fewer selling days in the fourth what are compared with the fourth quarter and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in Canada and May of 2010 and Spain in July 2010. In addition, the range now reflects the impact of our recently announced collaboration with Biocon and the upfront payment that was included. Consequently, we expect these factors in the aggregate to negatively impact our fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07, which has been factored into our 2010 guidance.
 Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our total financial targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation as does our 2010 guidance. And our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities, up to 5% of our revenue targets.
 So moving on key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved solid overall operational performance while, at the same time, advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We have tightened the ranges of all components of our 2010 financial guidance, including increasing and narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range, $2.17 to 2.22. And we have reaffirmed all of our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to deliver anticipated cost reductions, including achieving approximately 50% in 2010.
 During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 500 million of Pfizer shares and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are advancing our strategic priorities through our recently announced review of strategic alternatives for our Capsugel business, collaboration with Biocon and pending collaboration with Teuto and acquisition of FoldRx and pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals.
 Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck.

Our cost of sales guidance at the beginning of the year was 19% to 20%. We lowered that to 18.5% to 19% this quarter. After the quarter, cost of sales was 18.3%. If you remove the benefits of foreign exchange that they had on costs this quarter, 18.3% becomes 19.7%. But the overall, I'll call it, strength in our cost of goods sold is really being driven by our restructuring, our focus on cost reduction, all of the things that we've been doing to really manage our cost structure. So nothing unusual to answer your question specifically. It's really based on the actions that we've been taking. In terms of beyond Lipitor, the last part of your question, I think if you look at the rhythm of the business and where the growth is, the growth will put some pressure on our gross margins, but not on our operating margins. If you look at our targets for 2012, we have operating margins in the high-30s to low-40s, which is where operating margins are today. So some of that growth will lower gross margins than it does today. They'll have lower expenses, and we believe we maintain our operating margins.

If you look at, as Frank mentioned, at the BRIC entity markets, up 5% in the quarter, up 10% year-to-date, the impact in the third quarter across all emerging markets is really focused in Eastern Europe and Russia or a little bit of Asia. We're seeing price increases in Romania, Czech Republic, Taiwan, Thailand. And inventory, your wholesale inventory reduction, specifically in Russia, as they adjust just to the economic situations, we expect to see some softness continuing, I think, in Russia in the fourth quarter. But overall, when we look at and take out the price decreases and the inventory adjustments, our unit growth is running at about 10% in the emerging markets. And then when you look at that and you look at -- an interesting fact, if you compare to launch sequencing between developed markets and emerging markets, we have about 22 launches in the emerging markets that we will do in '11 and '12, which are very different patterns from the launches in developed markets.

Jeff, in relation to your plans to consider alternative for Capsugel, does this signal a change in your view about keeping the other non-core assets at this dental health consumer and nutritionals? And how much time are you giving yourself? I appreciated your opening comments, it sounds like you were obviously managing the portfolio dynamically, but how much time are you giving yourself to make a decision with respect to these assets, especially given where the multiple is in the stock, and I think that would beg the question that maybe investors don't appreciate some of these other assets? And my other question both for you and to Frank, is that it is very good to see that continued share repurchase program. But $500 million still reflects a relatively lackluster pace, especially given your low-stock PE multiple and $20 billion in operating cash flow. So my question is this: Is this the pace that we should come to expect? Or do you see an opportunity to be more aggressive, especially in light of record-low borrowing costs? And I would also like to know how you think the IRRs on whatever M&A you might be just considering would compare to the IRRs on-share repurchase programs?

I said it previously and I said it again this morning that we are engaged in a continuous review of the role of each of our businesses, not frankly just even the ones you mentioned. Every business has to demonstrate in an ongoing basis that it's creating shareholder value in accordance with the strategic purpose of that business, with the return on capital that it's producing. That's it's creating more value inside Pfizer than outside Pfizer. That can range from all kinds of alternatives. The Capsugel decision to consider a strategic options for was the result of such review. And that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses consistent with what I talked about at the last quarter. So my view on that hasn't changed. In terms of timing, that's on ongoing process. I think that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses. And we have had this particular collection of businesses for just about a year. We are continuing to evaluate the opportunities that having these businesses together may create within Pfizer and exploring the degree to which some of the businesses you mentioned, may create more value together than in other forms. And we continue to do that. And that's an ongoing process, and we'll always be engage in that process, both in terms of potentially looking at businesses for strategic reviews, as well as bringing in businesses like we did with King. So I think that's just in the nature of managing what I call, a dynamic portfolio of balanced businesses, balance both in terms of the risk and their opportunities. And I'll let Frank address the share repurchases issue.

Last quarter, we also bought back $500 million of our stock, about 30.8 million shares. So about $1 billion of our stock has been repurchased. Probably the average price on that $1 billion is about $16.40. In addition to that $1 billion, we'll be paying out in our dividend this year about $6 billion. So between the stock buyback and dividend this year, now directly returning capital to shareholders in the amount of about $7 billion and significant unforeseen events aside, we expect the dividend to increase at our upcoming December meeting. In terms of what we're going to be going forward, what I would say is buybacks are clearly something we will continue to be opportunistic about as market conditions warrant, and remember, we have other potential uses of our capital like we did this quarter. This past quarter, we committed about $4 billion of cash for business development opportunities, which are the transactions that Jeff had talked about, with the biggest piece of that commitment obviously being King Pharma. And then in terms of the returns, on those business development transactions, obviously they are based on projections that we have to execute on. But we will execute and those returns are favorable.

And just thinking a bit longer term, strategically, we'll see your committing to really pursuing large-scale M&A pricing entering 2012, does that mean in 2013, potentially Pfizer might be looking once more to large-scale consolidation in your long-term strategic planning?

Please remember, when we gave that $67 billion to $69 billion, that was the end of January going February. We did not have factored into the guidance at that time the impact of healthcare reform U.S. reform and the European pricing pressures. Despite that, we were able to maintain our guidance range that we should at the beginning of the year where we did tightened it. So from my perspective, we did exactly what we said we're going to do. We did tighten the range, but we absorbed in that range two items that were fairly significant, neither of which was in the range when we initially disclosed back at the beginning of the year. In terms of our 2012 targets, the revenue targets for 2012 now are a range of $65.2 billion to $67.7 billion, and we've said that they assume a modest level of business development, up to 5% of the total. And so if you do the math, 5% on that, call it $3 billion to $3.5 billion, we had about half of that done on this past quarter and particularly are primarily from acquisition. We've said, we'll never rule out anything. we said our objective is bolt-on acquisitions and the couple billion-dollars space, focus on emerging markets established products and 'Invest to Win' areas. That is our strategy. That continues to be our strategy. That's all.

First, for the third consecutive full quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, we are reporting solid operating performance. Second, given this performance and our continued confidence in the business, we are increasing both the top end and the bottom end of our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Third, we are once again reaffirming the financial targets that we've set out for 2012. It's important to emphasize that we are raising this year's guidance and reaffirming the 2012 targets despite uncertainty in the global economy, strong competitive challenges and significant changes in the regulatory and public policy environment across the markets in which we operate.
Fourth, consistent with our commitment to enhancing total shareholder value, we are continuing to return cash to our owners. During the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased a total of $1 billion in stock at an average price of $16.40 per share. 
And finally, fifth, also consistent with that commitment, we are on track to pay nearly $6 billion in dividends this year. As we have previously stated, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the board of directors to raise the dividend in December, and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
Now on the subject of capital allocation, I want to highlight a particularly important point illustrated this quarter. As we said we would do, we have continued to deploy your capital in disciplined business development activities that allow us to shape our balanced business portfolio in order to maximize shareholder value. And I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning discussing the deals we announced since the beginning of September in the context of the balanced business portfolio that I described on last quarter's earnings call.
First, let me review briefly the context. We closed the Wyeth acquisition just over a year ago, and since then, we have moved quickly to integrate the companies to achieve our planned cost synergies and to deliver solid financial performance from the combined company. The people and assets that Wyeth brought to us, together with the changes we have made in our leadership, culture and operating model over the last three years have positioned us to deliver three important things: One, producing steady, reliable, adjusted earnings growth over time; two, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks; and three, making disciplined internal and external investments in innovative new treatments and cures that produce good returns on your capital. 
The foundation for these results is a dynamic portfolio of businesses, products, geographies and areas of research that balances both our risks and our opportunities. That portfolio enables us to advance our strategies of growing our patent-protected portfolio in priority therapeutic areas, in vaccines and biologics, in Established Products, in Emerging Markets and in appropriate Diversified businesses. Now each of the five actions that we recently announced significantly advances these strategies and helps us further balance our portfolio, businesses and products. And let me show you what I mean. 
In Primary Care, which currently accounts for about a third of our revenues, we have identified pain as one of our 'Invest to Win' therapeutic areas because of our strong capabilities in this area and because of the growing market for this condition of unmet medical need. Our pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals will provide an excellent complement to our current portfolio of pain treatments, which ranges from Advil and ThermaCare to Celebrex and Lyrica, as well as several promising pipeline candidates. King is a leader in new formulations of pain treatments designed to discourage common methods of misuse and abuse. King's assets will provide Pfizer with multiple new drug-delivery platforms, as well as potential long-term upside in our Primary Care Established Products as well as in our Animal Health business.
Now in Specialty Care, which generates almost a quarter of our revenues, we have strengthened our presence in the growing orphan diseases market by acquiring FoldRx, a privately held drug discovery and clinical development company. FoldRx brings us an oral, once-daily, small-molecule candidate with the potential to treat a fatal genetic neuro-degenerative disease for which a liver transplant currently is the only available treatment. It brings us greater understanding of protein misfolding, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying cause in many chronic degenerative diseases.
Meanwhile in Established Products, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, our alliance with Biocon, India's leading biotech company, will advance our strategies in biosimilars and will position us competitively in the diabetes market over time. This is important in the developing world, where patients' uninterrupted access to insulin is often very difficult, as well as in developed countries like United States, where the CDC just announced that up to 1/3 of the population could be living with diabetes within a generation.
Turning to our Emerging Markets business, which produces about an eighth of our revenues, we agreed last month to acquire 40% of Laboratorio Teuto Brasileiro, a privately held company in Brazil with approximately 250 branded and unbranded generic pharmaceuticals in more than 400 presentations. This partnership will give us access to a large network of independent distributors that reach more than 36,000 pharmacies in rural and suburban Brazil and customers that Pfizer is not currently reaching. This agreement also includes the opportunity to commercialize Teuto's products outside Brazil, which we believe offers substantial promise for both our Emerging Markets and our Established Products business.
Finally, within our Diversified businesses, which accounts for about 1/8 of our revenues, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for Capsugel. I've said before that review of the role, fit and value creation of each of our businesses is part of our ongoing review of our dynamic business portfolio. We will continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Capsugel represents a unique business, with strong potential for growth outside of Pfizer, and now is the right time to undertake this review.
It's worth noting that each of these business development actions came about as a result of the speed, focus and agility that characterize our business unit operating model. Around here we use the phrase, the power of scale, the spirit of small. These announcements demonstrated that concept in action. Because our respective business unit leaders and their teams understand their distinct customers, marketplaces and competitors, they saw the chance to create value, and they moved quickly to bring these opportunities forward. For our part, corporate-level leadership ensured that the right hurdle rates were applied, that there was appropriate discipline around price and terms and that Pfizer's scale and resources were brought to bear when appropriate. Once the deals are closed, the leaders of the relevant business units will be accountable for the success of each of these deals.
Now in addition to our business development activities, we continue, of course, to advance our late-stage development pipeline, and we have several important milestones ahead. Next week, at the American College of Rheumatology, we will provide an update on the development of tasocitinib, our oral JAK inhibitor, and we will present Phase III data from our initial study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we remain on track to submit regulatory applications for an adult indication education for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. by the end of this year. Pfizer has completed its Phase III trials in support of these regulatory submissions.
With respect to apixaban, our Factor Xa inhibitor, based on the strength of the preliminary Phase III AVERROES study data, our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week that the companies have initiated a rolling submission with the FDA under the trade name ELIQUIS for people with atrial fibrillation that is unsuitable for treatment with warfarin. And finally, in the first half of next year, we anticipate filing with the FDA for crizotinib, our novel personalized agent for people with lung cancer.
To wrap up, I believe our results this quarter, like each quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, demonstrate that the changes we have been making at Pfizer have enabled us to deliver steady, consistent, adjusted earnings results to return cash to shareholders and to make disciplined investments in medicines that will produce good returns for our shareholders. And we are doing so consistently despite global economic headwinds, currency fluctuations, competitive challenges and regulatory and public policy uncertainties. That is because today, our company has a dynamic portfolio of businesses that represents a good balance of risks and opportunities across products, geographies, technologies and customers. 
We continuously review our portfolio. We're relentlessly focused on cost productivity and capital discipline. And our culture emphasizes focus and accountability. We have the benefits that come with the scale and resources of a large company, but our business unit operating model allows us to move with the agility necessary to seize valuable opportunities like the ones I described this morning. With that, I'll ask Frank to review our third quarter results."
162270,114083296,91207,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move on to third quarter financial results.

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included on our webcast. Now let's move on to third quarter financial results. The $4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter 2010 revenues was primarily attributable to the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues by $5.2 billion or 44%, partially offset by a $458 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products and a $160 million or 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.
The year-over-year decrease in third quarter 2010 reported net income and reported diluted EPS was due to a non-cash impairment charge resulting from updated forecast of certain Wyeth assets compared with the fair values estimated at the closing of the acquisition last year. This pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion consists of IPR&D charges of about $715 million and brand assets and developed technology charges of approximately $750 million. 
These updated cash flow projections are based on the most recently projected development of regulatory time frames and the current market environment for brands assets and their planned investments support. I want to point out that the we do not expect these updated projections to have an impact on our 2012 revenue or adjusted diluted EPS targets, which we are reaffirming today.
It's also important to remember that while there have been acquired assets whose projected values have decreased, there are acquired assets whose projected values have increased as well. However, these increases are not reflected in our third quarter financial statements, because current accounting rules require that we record asset value decreases or impairments but do not allow us to record asset value increases subsequent to day zero.
In addition, reported net income and reported diluted EPS in the quarter were negatively impacted by a charge for asbestos litigation of $701 million. The increase in an adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, lower aggregate revenues from legacy Pfizer products and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that both reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the year ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
Third quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by a 4% positive impact from foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from 15.4% to 18.3% was primarily due to the change in the mix of products and businesses resulting from the addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The 43% increase in adjusted SI&A [selling, informational and administrative] expenses and 33% increase in R&D expenses were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations, also driven by our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio, which contributed to this increase.
In the third quarter 2010, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $160 million on revenues and a positive impact of $298 million on adjusted total costs. The net effect of foreign exchange resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact to adjusted diluted EPS.
Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased $3.3 billion or 31% in the third quarter, with operational growth of 33%, of which $3.9 billion or 37% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, which was partially offset by $468 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products. 
It's important to remember that Pfizer's annual international calendar ends on November 30, and as a result, third quarter includes international results for June, July and August. As we previously stated on our second quarter earnings call, June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro, and therefore, this negative impact was reflected in our third quarter results.
Also, I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including LIPITOR, which lost exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July of 2010.
Third quarter diversified revenues increased approximately $1.3 billion or 151% year-over-year due to the addition of Wyeth products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues in the third quarter was immaterial. Third quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations increased 66% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to the significant contribution of legacy Wyeth products. It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and Turkey contributed a combined 46% to the overall growth in emerging markets, and legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in these BRIC-MT markets grew 5% operationally in the third quarter and 10% operationally year-to-date. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2010, we are updating the ranges of our 2010 guidance. We are tightening the revenue range to $67 billion to $68 billion, decreasing and tightening the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to 18.5% to 19%, tightening our adjusted SI&A expense range to $19.2 billion to $19.7 billion, tightening the adjusted R&D expense range to $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, expecting adjusted other deductions to be approximately $1 billion, maintaining our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income at approximately 30%, decreasing the reported diluted EPS range to $0.84 to $0.89 and, finally, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.17 to $2.22. 
As we previously stated and forecasted, the adjusted diluted EPS range absorbs Effexor's loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in July, two fewer selling days in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter and LIPITOR's loss of exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July 2010. In addition, the range now reflects the impact of our recently announced collaboration with Biocon and the upfront payment that was included. Consequently, we expect these factors in the aggregate to negatively impact our fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07, which has been factored into our 2010 guidance.
Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our 2012 financial targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation as does our 2010 guidance. And our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities, up to 5% of our revenue targets. 
So moving on to key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved solid overall operational performance while at the same time advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We have tightened the ranges of all components of our 2010 financial guidance, including increasing and narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range, $2.17 to 2.22. And we have reaffirmed all of our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to deliver our anticipated cost reductions, including achieving approximately 50% in 2010. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of Pfizer shares and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are advancing our strategic priorities through our recently announced review of strategic alternatives for our Capsugel business, collaboration with Biocon and pending collaboration with Teuto and acquisition of FoldRx and pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals.
Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck."

Our cost of sales guidance at the beginning of the year was 19% to 20%. We lowered that to 18.5% to 19% this quarter. After the quarter, cost of sales was 18.3%. If you remove the benefits of foreign exchange that they had on costs this quarter, 18.3% becomes 19.7%. But the overall, I'll call it, strength in our cost of goods sold is really being driven by our restructuring, our focus on cost reduction, all of the things that we've been doing to really manage our cost structure. So nothing unusual, to answer your question specifically. It's really based on the actions that we've been taking. In terms of beyond LIPITOR, the last part of your question, I think if you look at the rhythm of the business and where the growth is, the growth will put some pressure on our gross margins, but not on our operating margins. If you look at our targets for 2012, we have operating margins in the high-30s to low-40s, which is where operating margins are today. So even though some of that growth will have lower gross margins than it does today, they'll have lower expenses, and we believe we can maintain our operating margins."

If you look at, as Frank mentioned, at the BRIC-MT markets, up 5% in the quarter, up 10% year-to-date. The impact in the third quarter across all emerging markets is really focused in Eastern Europe and Russia or a little bit of Asia. We're seeing price increases in Romania, Czech Republic, Taiwan, Thailand. And inventory, your wholesale inventory reduction, specifically in Russia as they adjust to the economic situation. We expect to see some softness continuing, I think, in Russia in the fourth quarter. But overall, when we look at and take out the price decreases and the inventory adjustments, our unit growth is running at about 10% in the emerging markets. And then when you look at that and you look at -- an interesting fact, if you compare the launch sequencing between developed markets and emerging markets, we have about 22 launches in the emerging markets that we will do in '11 and '12, which is a very different pattern from the launches in developed markets."

And how much time are you giving yourself? I appreciated your opening comments, it sounds like you were obviously managing the portfolio dynamically, but how much time are you giving yourself to make a decision with respect to these and other assets, especially given where the multiple is in the stock, and I think that would beg the question that maybe investors don't appreciate some of these other assets? And my other question both for you and to Frank, is that it is very good to see the continued share repurchase programs. But $500 million still reflects a relatively lackluster pace, especially given your low-stock PE multiple and $20 billion in operating cash flow. So my question is this: Is this the pace that we should come to expect? Or do you see an opportunity to be more aggressive, especially in light of record-low borrowing costs? And I would also like to know how you think the IRRs on whatever M&A you might be considering would compare to the IRRs on-share repurchase programs?"

I said it previously and I said it again this morning that we are engaged in a continuous review of the role of each of our businesses, not frankly just even the ones you mentioned. Every business has to demonstrate on an ongoing basis that it's creating shareholder value in accordance with the strategic purpose of that business, with the return on capital that it's producing. That's it's creating more value inside Pfizer than outside Pfizer. That can range from all kinds of alternatives. The Capsugel decision to consider strategic options for it was the result of one such review. And that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses consistent with what I talked about at the last quarter. So my view on that hasn't changed. In terms of timing, that's on ongoing process. I think that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses. And we have had this particular collection of businesses for just about a year. We are continuing to evaluate the opportunities that having these businesses together may create within Pfizer and exploring the degree to which some of the businesses you mentioned may create more value together than in other forms. And we'll continue to do that. And that's an ongoing process, and we'll always be engaged in that process, both in terms of potentially looking at businesses for strategic reviews, as well as bringing in businesses, like we did with King. So I think that's just in the nature of managing what I call a dynamic portfolio of balanced businesses, balanced both in terms of their risk and their opportunities. And I'll let Frank address the share repurchase issue."

Last quarter, we also bought back $500 million of our stock, about 30.8 million shares. So about $1 billion of our stock has been repurchased. Probably the average price on that $1 billion is about $16.40. In addition to that $1 billion, we'll be paying out in a dividend this year about $6 billion. So between the stock buyback and dividend this year, now directly returning capital to shareholders in the amount of about $7 billion and, significant unforeseen events aside, we expect the board to approve a dividend increase at our upcoming December meeting. In terms of what we're going to do going forward, what I would say is buybacks are clearly something we will continue to be opportunistic about as market conditions warrant, and, remember, we have other potential uses of our capital like we did this quarter. This past quarter, we committed about $4 billion of cash for business development opportunities, which are the transactions that Jeff had talked about, with the biggest piece of that commitment obviously being King Pharma. And then in terms of the returns on those business development transactions, obviously they are based on projections that we have to execute on. But we will execute and those returns are favorable.

You've lost $1 billion from the guidance range this year. Just go through the factors a bit more that drive them and how should we think about 2011, 2012 gross and targets in light of this? How do you have the confidence in the 2010 range being cut? And just thinking a bit longer term, strategically, I see you're committing to not really pursuing large-scale M&A pricing during 2012. Does that mean in 2013, potentially Pfizer might be looking once more to large-scale consolidation in your long-term strategic planning?"

Please remember, when we gave that $67 billion to $69 billion, that was the end of January, early February. We did not have factored into the guidance at that time the impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. or European pricing pressures. Despite that, we were able to maintain our guidance range that we issued at the beginning of the year although we did tighten it. So from my perspective, we did exactly what we said we're going to do. We did tighten the range, but we absorbed in that range two items that were fairly significant, neither of which was in the range when we initially disclosed it back at the beginning of the year. In terms of our 2012 targets, the revenue targets for 2012 now are a range of $65.2 billion to $67.7 billion, and we've said that they assume a modest level of business development, up to 5% of the total. And so if you do the math, 5% on that, call it $3 billion to $3.5 billion, we had about half of that done this past quarter and particularly or primarily from acquisition. We've said, we'll never rule out anything. We said our objective is bolt-on acquisitions in the couple, the billion-dollar space, focused on emerging markets, established products and 'Invest to Win' areas. That is our strategy. That continues to be our strategy. That's all."
