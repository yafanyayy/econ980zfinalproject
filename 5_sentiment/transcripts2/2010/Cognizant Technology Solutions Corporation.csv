Gordon will address financial and operating",1837,"Thanks, David and good morning from the NASDAQ in Times Square. Thank you for joining us today, as we discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2009. I'm delighted to report a strong quarter and year. Gordon will address financial and operating metrics later in the call but, let me offer you a few highlights. During the quarter, we generated almost $903 million in revenue, up 6% sequentially and 20% on the year. Annual revenue rose 16.4% to close to $3.3 billion. Both during the quarter and on a full-year basis, our growth was broadbased with strength across our services and industries. As I review our performance in 2009, it's gratifying to note that our strategy of staying even closer to our customers than ever before and investing back into the business for long-term success has paid off. We are clearly a stronger company today than when we entered the economic crisis.During the downturn, we kept our eye on our long-term value drivers and maintained our program of constant reinvestment. We invested in our people to gain an unfair share from the talent marketplace as evidenced in the strong hiring in the last two quarters. We strengthened our existing service offerings and launched newer ones. We expanded our geographies, capitalized on some great acquisition opportunities and drove synergistic long-term alliances and relationships. As a result, we're  a much stronger organization financially, with over $1.5 billion of cash, short and long-term investments on our balance sheet and no debt. We're also a stronger firm competitively in our client relationships, which continually deepen as evidenced by our financial results, our conversations with clients, our competitive win rates and our strong customer satisfaction results.Some of the most notable areas of continued investment in the firm are our people, service offerings, alliances and new geographies.Last year, we added more than 16,700 people, bringing our year-end headcount to over 78,400. Even with that, we boosted our full-year utilization. We recruited new talent across the globe and in all areas of our business. This includes about 140 people added to our client partner and account management team. As I said before, we believe that we have one of the strongest client-facing teams in the industry which has resulted in excellent client relationships and client satisfaction and has led to a stronger channel to the market. Our biggest investment is in our talent and across the business in 2009, we attracted some exceptional people from campuses and from the lateral market. As I reflect on our portfolio of services, I note that newer services like infrastructure management, which we refer to as ITIS and KPO have now achieved critical mark, are growing nicely and are contributing to our financial results. These represent large market opportunities for us going forward. We recently launched a new service offering in the area of engineering and manufacturing solutions or EMS through our relationship with Invensys. As I've told you before, this relationship opened up an entirely new market which will help us expand into core engineering, manufacturing and industrial automation solutions and penetrate industries that are now embracing global sourcing, such as chemical and petrochemical companies in the process manufacturing space. In corporate development activities, we're deploying capital in focused M&A opportunities and we're forging strategic alliances. Last year, we concluded more M&A and alliance deals than in the previous three years combined. Each of these linkups has reinforced a fast growing area of our business. For example, in addition to our Invensys relationship which I have already touched on, we acquired Active Intelligence, a systems-integration company specializing in Oracle's Retail Solutions portfolio, integrating Active Intelligence's capabilities has solidified Cognizant's position as a leading provider of global services to the retail industry. With SAP in May, we announced a global services partnership underscoring our commitment to innovative SAP solutions in line with our vision of enabling businesses to meet the challenges of the new and changing global economy. We signed a strategic partnership with Temenos, a leader in core banking systems which added to the breadth and depth of our capabilities in banking and financial services technology and operations. We acquired Pepperweed Advisors, which has strengthened our IT infrastructure services practice by broadening our portfolio of consulting offerings, advising on business performance risk management and infrastructure cost management. And finally, we closed the acquisition of the UBS India Service Center. This expands our financial services domain knowledge, broadens our geographies and sharpens our KPO, BPO and IT infrastructure services capabilities.We have also invested in expanding our geographic reach beyond the U.S. and Europe. You are aware of our efforts in Asia and the Middle East, which grew 66% year-over-year in 2009. Additionally, we have expanded our delivery network in Mexico, Manila and Budapest and we've deepened our presence in the U.S. and Canada to serve a growing roster of U.S. and Canadian clients, seeking in-country and near-shore alternatives.With that review of our accomplishments in 2009, let me look forward and discuss what we're seeing in the marketplace and how we expect this year to unfold. The economies of the world have begun to recover, and there is a more stable business climate when compared to a year ago. However, there remains considerable debate on the shape of the recovery and the so-called new normal in terms of long-term growth rates for key economies of the world. When I translate this to our client environment, the six years of 2002 through 2007 were stable and steady. During this time, the majority of our clients had stable industry structures, business architectures and technology platforms. This environment enabled clients to focus, first, on improving efficiency and effectiveness in their business operations by taking advantage of low-cost offshore services and incremental process redesign initiatives. It's now evident that the past two years have not just been a time of a major cyclical downturn but also that of significant secular shift point for many of the industries we serve. These secular changes are driven by the mega trends of digitization and disintermediation, government mandated change and new disruptive technology such as cloud, social computing and virtualization coupled with accelerated competition from around the globe.These shifts represent challenges and opportunities for our clients. Most of our clients have found that their long-held business models and supporting technology environment have to be reinvented to cope with the new environment. With clients facing these twin challenges, the economic slowdown which compels efficiency and effectiveness on one side and the secular shifts which deals with new business models, our strategy and the corresponding investments that we've been making has been to build a range of capabilities to offer clients efficiency, effectiveness, innovation, transformation and virtualization all on one single platform. Our approach has three main parts. The first is a drive to continuous improvement in the services we are currently delivering to clients in order to take clients to world-class levels of efficiency and effectiveness. The second is to extend our customer relationships by identifying core business process areas that we can redefine and offer a stand-alone solution across an industry. These opportunities are typically in process areas that are most impacted by the secular shifts happening in our client industries, for example, security services in banking or pharmacovigilance in life sciences. They constitute new product-based solutions that we can offer to our customers, allowing us to extend our customer relationships. The third is to continue investing in our talent base to ensure that we have deep expertise in the technologies, process areas, consulting skills and methods that will be required to deliver on our vision to optimize and extend our client relationships. Let's take a recent client example. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is the world's largest publisher of educational material for pre-K-through-12 schools. They selected Cognizant as a business technology services partner, not only to provide IT services to drive operational improvement and to support their continuing expansion from print products to digital channels, but also to co-develop innovative approaches and products to serve their markets. This comprehensive bundle deal will assist them to address the structural shifts in the Publishing business. As clients increasingly come to recognize Cognizant as a company that can help them drive to greater levels of efficiency, effectiveness, innovation and virtualization, we are investing to enhance our platform so that we can sell into these two areas of customer need.Through Cognizant Business Consulting or CBC, we provide strategic consulting services, helping companies identify opportunities to improve IT and business operations, lower operational expenses and enhance overall performance of IT and IT-enabled processes. For example, our consultants are helping clients address industry changes, such as the advent of ICD-10, a regulation hitting major healthcare players. We are helping healthcare players streamline their operations and create new value-added services.Through our Web 2.0 based platform, Cognizant 2.0, we enable the true virtualization of work and we are driving ourselves and as a result, our clients, to new levels of globalization. With Cognizant 2.0, we have solved some of the most difficult challenges of realtime project management and knowledge management amongst teams of highly distributed professionals around the globe. And as our clients embark on significant enterprise-level transformation programs, our ability to participate in, and often, lead that change is essential. We're continuing to invest in large-scale program management and change management so that we can be partners with clients in navigating change. I hope that I haven't dwelt too much on our investment initiatives. But we are excited about how powerfully all these pieces have begun to mesh together to reinforce our ability to deliver distinctive value for our clients by integrating our understanding of our customer's business environments with our significant operational capabilities.Now let's change gears and focus on our guidance for 2010. We are looking for at least $935 million of revenue in the first quarter or close to 4% sequential growth and at least $3.935 billion for the full year, which equates to at least 20% annualized revenue growth. Our guidance is based on the following observations. In contrast to last year, we see client budget cycles preceding as they tend to during a normal year. In other words, at this stage, budgets are nearing finalization and are far enough along in the cycle that we have a view to client's broad spending plans.We think that client IT budgets in 2010 will probably range from flat to slightly up. However, we believe that the proportion of IT budgets that will be dedicated to offshoring will rise, compared to 2009. Having said this, as I mentioned earlier, there remains uncertainty about the level of the new normal of economic activity in our key markets. As a result, we have reflected that by taking a cautious view on the second half of 2010 until budgets are firmly locked down and our visibility to specific project work in the back half of the year improves. With that, let me turn the call over to Gordon who will detail our financial and operating results. Gordon?"

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance was broadbased.

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance was broadbased. During the fourth quarter, our Financial Services segment which includes our practices and insurance, banking and transaction processing grew 3.9% on a sequential basis and 11.8% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 41.9% of revenue for the quarter.The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad with clients focusing on cost controls and efficiencies, transformational projects, M&A integration, regulatory compliance and risk management. Healthcare continued its strong performance during the quarter with 6.1% sequential growth and 26.5% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We experienced growth among both our life sciences clients and our healthcare insurance clients. These clients have used outsourcing to focus on cost control and are also using our Business Intelligence and Analytics group to understand what is driving their overall costs. This segment represented 26.6% of revenues for the quarter. Retail Manufacturing and Logistics was stronger than anticipated during the quarter. This segment continued the company-leading growth that delivered during their earlier quarters in 2009, growing 11% sequentially and 31.8% year-over-year, representing 18% of revenues for the quarter. We are particularly pleased with the strength we saw in our retail sector where many of our clients continued their transition to global delivery, and see the weak economy as a catalyst to accelerate these programs.The remaining 13.4% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, media and high-technology, which grew 4.2% sequentially and 19.7% on a year-over-year basis.For the full-year 2009, Financial Services grew 9.5%, Healthcare grew 25%. Retail, Manufacturing and Logistics grew 27.5% and our Other segment grew 11.4%.For the quarter, application management represented 56% of revenues including 22.7% year-over-year and 6.2%, sequentially. Application development was 44% of revenues and grew 16.5% year-over-year and 5.2%, sequentially. For the full year, management grew 21.9% and development grew 10.2%, comprising 56% and 44% of revenues, respectively.During the quarter, 78.8% of revenues came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.6% of total revenue, and 2.6% came from the Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. On a reported basis, Europe grew just over 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Europe grew 12% and represented 18.5% of total revenue. It's important to note, for the full year, European revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $59 million due to the weakening of the European currencies in the latter part of 2008. On a constant dollar basis, Europe grew 23% year-over-year for the full-year 2009 versus 12% on a reported basis.As anticipated on a sequential basis, pricing remains stable. We had a gross addition of 57 new customers during the fourth quarter. We closed the quarter with 589 active clients. During the quarter, the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by five. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 144. We continue to see a trend towards our new strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage in the relationship.Turning to costs. On a GAAP basis, cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization were approximately $521 million for the quarter as compared to a $420 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter cost of revenues included approximately $3.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in costs of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by close to 10,000 people during the quarter and close to 16,000 compared to December 2008. We ended the quarter with over 73,500 technical staff.For the full year, cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 17.6% as compared to 2008. Full-year cost of revenues include approximately $14.9 million of stock-based compensation expense and $187,000 of non-cash, stock-based fringe benefit tax expense from the first quarter.Fourth quarter SG&A depreciation and amortization expenses were $215 million on a GAAP basis, up from $190.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. GAAP SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 include approximately $9.4 million of stock-based compensation. For the full year, SG&A, depreciation and amortization were $110.7 million compared to $726.8 million in 2008. Full-year SG&A included approximately $30 million of stock-based compensation expense and about $750,000 of fringe benefit tax expense recovered from our employees.Our GAAP operating margin was 18.5% for the quarter and our non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense was 19.9%, within our target range of 19% to 20%.The average rate for the rupee was 46.6 in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 48.3 in the third quarter and 48.6 in the Q4 of 2008. 46.6 in the fourth quarter of 2009, $88 million of rupee operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the fourth quarter. This resulted in a $5.7 million gain which was recognized in operating expenses and partially offset the increased costs, resulting from the appreciation of the rupee. For 2010, we currently have $510 million of rupee operating expense hedges in place at an average rate of 49.1. And we have $480 million for 2011 at an average rate of 48.3. And finally, for 2012, we have $300 million at an average rate of 48.8.We had about $4.5 million of non-operating expenses. This was comprised primarily of an $11.3 million loss on our rupee balance sheet hedges, partially offset by $6.8 million gain related to balance sheet remeasurements, primarily associated with movements of the dollar versus the rupee, pound, euro and Swiss franc.Our GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.6% and for the full year was 16%. The fourth quarter and full-year tax rates were below our original expectations due primarily to the tax impact of our foreign exchange hedges as well as the geographic mix of our earnings.We expect the full-year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.8%. This anticipated increase from the 2009 rate is due primarily to the expiration in 2010 of tax holidays at two of our Indian development centers. As we mentioned on previous calls, during 2009, the Indian government extended the benefits of certain of our tax holidays through March 2011 which had originally been  scheduled to expire in March of this year.Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. As Francisco mentioned, we finished the quarter with approximately $1,550,000,000 of cash, short-term and long-term investments, up over $210 million from the end of Q3. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated over $237 million of cash. Financial [ph] activities generated over $45 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of our option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. We spent approximately $14.7 million for capital expenditures during the year and $62.8 million for acquisitions and related costs. For full-year 2009, we spent $77 million on capital expenditures. This was below our prior expectations due to the timing of our new facilities and infrastructure requirements. For 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million on capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion, as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction. Based on our $709 million balance on December 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 72 days, compared to 71 days for the same period in 2008 and down about two days compared to the third quarter of 2009.The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $83 million at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease of about $15 million compared to Q3. Over 60% of December 31 unbilled balance was billed in January.During the fourth quarter, 31% of our revenues came from fixed-price contracts, flat from the third quarter of 2009 and up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, 30.3% of our revenues came from fixed-price contracts.Net headcount increased by over 10,300 people during the fourth quarter and 16,700 during the year. During 2009, approximately 44% of our gross additions were hired directly from college and 56% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. Annualized turnover during the fourth quarter including both voluntary and involuntary, improved sequentially by 110 basis points to 11.2%. On a full-year basis, total attrition dropped to 10.3% from 14.2% in 2008. As discussed previously, our medium-term strategy has been to increase the company's utilization levels to this scale [ph] economies and historical heavy overinvestment and bench resources. We achieved that goal earlier than anticipated in 2009 as revenue grew faster than anticipated. During the fourth quarter, we have expedited [ph] the hiring of both recent college grads and experienced IT processional professionals to position ourselves well to meet expected 2010 demand. As a result, our utilization levels in Q4 showed a decline versus Q3. Offshore utilization was approximately 70% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program during the quarter, was approximately 77%. On-site utilization was approximately 89% during the quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had over 6,600 unbilled people in our training program compared to 3,400 at the end of Q3.I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for 2010. During his comments, Frank spoke about the twin challenges, cyclical and secular, which our clients are facing. These twin challenges are resulting in revenue opportunities for Cognizant in some of the key industries that we serve. Examples of these opportunities include: First, M&A integration work across a number of key industries such as banking and financial services, healthcare and retail. The economic slowdown is driving consolidation in many of our industries. Second, additional levels of outsourcing as clients increase the scope of what they are going to outsource. For example, in our healthcare BPO practice, we are seeing increased traction in vertical process outsourcing areas such as claims, medical bill reviews, benefits coding [ph] and medical management. Third, secular shifts of digitization and disintermediation, especially in the media and information industries. Information companies are being forced to rethink date of delivery in the Internet age, requiring them to transform their integrated data supply chain. We have a long history of serving the information industry and are currently engaged in a number of multi-year programs designed to build new innovative and integrated data supply chains for our clients.And finally, know-your-customer initiatives, especially across our banking and retail clients. Given the hyper-competitive markets today, it's never been more important for our clients to know and understand the customers deeply and to develop innovative new capabilities to serve these customers. We are working on a number of initiatives to help customers create deep insight into their customer base. Among our retail clients in particular, we're working on a number of multi-channel initiatives to provide their shoppers with newer and more convenient ways to shop.For the first quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue at, at least $935 million. This guidance includes a negative sequential impact of about $5 million in revenue, due to the recent depreciation of the European currencies. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we are providing guidance for revenue of at least $9.935 billion, representing growth of at least 20%. As Francisco mentioned earlier, our strategy of aggressive reinvestment is delivering results and we intend to continue this strategy this year. Therefore, we're expecting our operating margin to be in our historic target range of 19% to 20% before the impact of equity-based compensation expenses. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q1 share count of approximately 304.7 million shares and a tax rate of 16.8%. This guidance excludes any non-operating foreign exchange gains or losses.For full-year 2010, based on the current business trends, we expect our GAAP EPS guidance to be at least $2.03 and we expect our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to be at least $2.19 excluding $0.16 of estimated full-year stock-based compensation. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 305.9 million shares and this guidance excludes any non-operating foreign exchange gains or losses.We'd now like to open the call for questions.

Our structure remains fairly consistent. We want to have a healthy balance sheet. We continue to look for small acquisitions. Interest income picked up a little bit as we went through the year. And part of that was driven -- as we established the hedging program in India on our balance sheet, we were able to have a greater portion of our cash earning interest in India. So we're currently thinking that our interest income next year will certainly work off with the Q4 number, so you're somewhere in the mid- to upper 20 millions for the full year. Also remember Tien-Tsin, our CapEx number was quite low in 2009 because we have to absorb some of the stuff we had already built. But we're starting another way wave of construction so as I mentioned, our CapEx's income, $77 million last year to about $180 million this year."

I won't dwell on those too long because we've talk about them many times on past calls and Gordon has already touched on that on this call as well. But we view those as having hit critical mass and if you look at sort of contributions in 2010 and in the short-term, I think those are the ones that are going to have the most immediate impact. And then there's EMS or engineering and manufacturing solutions, which we've just launched on the back of the inventor's relationship. I think that, that will take a little bit time to play out. We obviously have a very to a healthy relationship with inventor's, themselves, as a result of the deal that we did a few months ago. And we are starting to see a pipeline of opportunities building behind EMS. My guess is that, that will start to translate into significant revenue or material revenue growth for us, probably three, four quarters from now as we build out that practice. The third area that I would highlight has to do with this broad trend that we see across all of our industries and it's not a specific service offering as much as it is an ability to serve clients and it's what Gordon and I both touched on, which is that as we start to see stability in the key markets around the world in the U.S. in Europe in particular, we are seeing clients come to us saying that we really in this clients thing, we are in the difficult position of having continued cost pressures on the one side, being driven by the fact that we're not out of the woods yet on the cyclical environment; but at the same time, clients facing a lot of secular pressures from changing into [ph] dynamics whether that's digitalization, globalization and so on and so forth. And what they really -- the value proposition that we have that's really resonating with these clients is the ability for us to go to a client and offer them what we think of as an efficiency and effective value proposition on the one side, which is all about the cost side of their income statement if you will. And on the other side, an innovation and virtualization value proposition, which is about the revenue side of their income statement and also potentially the CapEx side of their balance sheet. So we're able to go to a client and say, we can help you across cost, revenue and CapEx on your balance sheet. And that's a very powerful paradigm."

I'm pleased to report yet another strong quarter and the resulting increase in our guidance for 2010. After summarizing our Q1 results and giving you some context for our revised 2010 outlook, I'd like to spend time today commenting on the strength of Cognizant's growth platform. Gordon will then discuss our financial and operating metrics. And as always, we'll conclude by opening the floor for questions.
Our first quarter results reflect the fact that the cyclical downturn that has marred the global economy over the last 18 to 24 months appears to be turning. While our planning assumption remains, that it is premature to say that a full recovery is upon us, we're optimistic that the worst of the recession is behind us. 
First quarter revenue was $960 million against our guidance of at least $935 million, a sequential increase of 6.3% and 29% on the year. That growth was once again broad-base spanning many of our services, industries and geographies. We saw strong performance in core service offerings and believe that they have ample room for continued long-term growth. 
Application Development saw a surge this quarter, growing faster than Application Maintenance, perhaps signaling that a recovery in discretionary spending is underway. In terms of industries, we saw growth in Financial Services as an environment of relative stability continued in that industry. 
Retail and Manufacturing delivered another strong quarter, contributing significantly to both sequential and year-on-year results. Our Other Industry category also grew substantially, driven largely by success in the telecom and high-tech sectors. 
During the quarter, we added five accounts that we consider strategic and have the potential to ramp up to at least $5 million and more than $50 million in annual revenue; two from Financial Services, two from Retail and Manufacturing and one from Healthcare and Life Sciences. 
Turning to geographies, while a surge in North American revenues drove results, revenues increased throughout much of the world. The U.K. came back on stream, though continental Europe remained sluggish due to slower economic recovery and a negative impact from weaker currencies. We expect European recovery to take a few more quarters. We were encouraged by rapid expansion of our business outside North America and Europe, what we refer to as the rest of the world. Though growing from a small base, the region posted nearly 30% sequential growth and 90% year-on-year growth.
Despite the optimism that our first quarter results portend, we remain cautious. The overall economic situation looks more positive, but still tenuous. Demand and credit, prerequisites for business investment, are resuming some normalcy, yet unemployment gnaws at developed economies. And while the economies of many European nations are looking up, those still struggling, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, among others, could impact the broader European Union and the global economy. Consequently, our planning bias will remain cautious until we see, at a minimum, sustained improvement in the unemployment situation and less volatility in the currency markets. 
Given this posture of cautious optimism, we've increased our 2010 guidance to at least 25% revenue growth or at least $4.1 billion for the year, up from the at least 20% guidance we put forward last quarter. This increased guidance reflects our Q1 overall performance and strong expectations for Q2, but factors a more cautious approach in the back half of the year given the continued economic uncertainties that I referred to earlier. Gordon will cover our detailed results and guidance shortly.
I'd now like to talk about Cognizant's growth platform. From our conversations with clients at our recently concluded customer event and from other sources, it's clear that clients have re-embarked on their growth agendas after a pause of 18 to 24 months. Given the reemergence of top line growth as a key priority for clients and the resulting demand for our services, it's appropriate to spend some time discussing Cognizant's overall architecture for sustained growth. 
Let's start with a look at the demand environment. Historically, economic recovery has been a strong catalyst for our business as client seek to free investment capital by outsourcing non-core processes. We saw this after the 2001 slowdown, and we are beginning again to see this trend driving demand for our services. During this recovery, we also see another powerful driver fueling demand. The past two years have not just been the time of a major cyclical downturn, but also that of a significant secular shift point for many of the industries we serve. These secular changes are driven by megatrends of digitization, demographic shifts, government-mandated change and new disruptive technologies such as cloud, social computing and virtualization. These shifts represent challenges and growth opportunities for our clients. In this environment, clients don't want to choose between a strategic partner and a cost-effective outsourcing provider. They want both. The investment that we've made over the years position us extremely well to serve these twin needs.
To respond to market demand, Cognizant's approach has been to lead our market in terms of reinvestment, continually innovating so that our clients turn to us first as their needs of a partner change and evolve. Our reinvestment approach is underpinned by two tenets. 
First, at any point in time, we focus our investments on a small set of opportunities that represent the highest priorities for Cognizant, based on the strong conviction that our resources are most productive when they aren't stretched thin. 
Second, we balance investments across multiple return horizons, making sure to capitalize on near-term opportunities, but never losing sight of planting seeds for the future. This discipline of consistently executing this reinvestment approach over many years through up-and-down cycles has resulted in a strong three-pillar growth platform that we believe can drive sustainable growth at Cognizant. 
Our core business represents the first pillar. Core services once again this quarter showed strong growth, driven by rising regulation, enhanced offshore adoption and modest redemption in discretionary spending. Our core businesses are strong and vibrant, and we see considerable untapped opportunity in these areas as illustrated by a recent industry analyst report that found that, collectively, the top six India-based providers share only 2.7% of the global services market.
The second pillar of growth is comprised of new capabilities, which we have incubated over the past few years, that are now collectively starting to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way. Typically, these are new industries, new capabilities to service the evolving needs of our clients or new geographies to continue market expansion. Two illustrative examples that are showing results include our Enterprise Analytics Practice and our Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions Practice.
In our Enterprise Analytics Practice, we help businesses around the world that are facing an explosion of data volumes to distill large quantities of data into actionable information. Through increased hiring of statisticians and analysts, combined with Cognizant's world-class data management technologists, our Enterprise Analytics Practice has helped clients in two major ways.
First, by developing applications to automate repeatable analytical functions; and second by performing very sophisticated custom analytics for our clients that cannot be automated. As an example, we recently helped a large grocery retailer improve chain profitability by analyzing large amounts of customer data to optimize store placement and promotional activities. 
Another example, our Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions Practice has grown to nearly 1,000 associates in under two quarters. Initially, launched to have Invensys manage product development and innovation, this practice is now helping new customers integrate applications on the manufacturing shop floor and in control systems with back-office enterprise infrastructure. Cognizant's strong capabilities in controls and automation, product lifecycle management and embedded systems are helping clients improve efficiencies, reduce time-to-market and provide better customer service.
We were recently chosen by a Fortune 500 organization in the building controls industry as their strategic engineering partner to advance its offerings to optimize energy and operational efficiencies of buildings. The Enterprise Analytics Practice and the Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions Practice are just two example of areas of recent investment that are showing results. We have a portfolio of similar opportunities across geographic markets, industry segments and new solutions, which we have incubated.
The third pillar of our growth platform is comprised of the investments we are making today for the longer-term growth. First, there remain areas today where we are underrepresented. Geographic markets like Latin America and adjacent industries like healthcare providers and energy and utilities represent growth opportunities for us. In addition, all of the new technologies and approaches that fall under the umbrella of cloud computing represent opportunities for us to create a range of cloud-enabled solutions, which were not feasible with older-generation technologies. Cognizant is working on new offerings that could unlock new levels of business value by implementing next-generation delivery and commercial models based upon a cloud computing backbone. These vertically-aligned cloud-enabled business solutions weave together people, applications, infrastructure and business process services to address key business problems our clients face. 
This is an exciting shift in business technology, and we're taking the steps necessary to differentiate ourselves in this important area. When taken together, our three-pillar growth approach, supported by our strategy of reinvestment, creates an engine for sustainable growth at Cognizant. 
The final point before I turn it over to Gordon is, that our growth platform is only as good as our channel to market. As I've said in the past, our client-facing team is one of the strongest in the industry. A key part of that team is Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC. CBC resources, now more than 1,800 strong, are involved in an increasing number of projects and accounts. Their role is to identify and deliver the value-added advisory services that our client need to navigate change. 
An example of this is the work we recently performed for a well-known global apparel brand. Our clients sought to aggressively diversify beyond their traditional business-to-business distribution channel and begin selling directly to consumers. They planned a series of retail acquisitions and also a program to organically open and operate retail stores.
CBC consultants developed an M&A integration roadmap designed to standardize business processes and developed an IT strategy for the firm. Simultaneously, we helped the client create a business model that take control of, reopen and operate new retail stores. This program has helped our clients realize substantial synergy savings, eliminate transition costs and reduce IT spending. And we continue to invest in order to further strengthen our client-facing capabilities. 
As we undertake increasingly strategic roles, our engagements have become wider reaching transformational programs that touch many facets of client organizations. Managing these large initiatives is a unique capability onto itself. To that end, we have invested and will continue to invest in enhancing our client-facing organization with the program management capabilities needed to make these types of large-scale initiatives successful.
So as we look forward to the rest of 2010, we are excited that we are well positioned with our clients. We have invested in opportunities across industries and geographies, embracing a range of solutions that give us breadth and balance, balance between efficiency and effectiveness which save our clients money and innovation which expand their businesses. Our customers don't need to compromise between a strategic partner and a cost-effective outsourcing provider. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gordon to detail our financial and operating results. Gordon?"
386024,100599794,59402,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance was broad-based, with all of our major industry segments experiencing healthy demand. During the first quarter, our Financial Services segment, wh",1803,"Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance was broad-based, with all of our major industry segments experiencing healthy demand. 
During the first quarter, our Financial Services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing, grew 5.3% on a sequential basis and 20.3% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 41.5% of revenue for the quarter. The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad, with clients focusing on cost controls and efficiencies, transformational projects, M&A integration, regulatory compliance, risk management and certainly, discretionary innovation initiatives.
Healthcare continued its strong performance during the quarter, with 5.1% sequential growth and 33.3% growth compared to the first quarter of 2009. The segment represented 26.3% of revenues for the quarter. The sequential growth was driven primarily by our healthcare insurance clients. Demand within these clients is driven by movements from the assessment stage to the remediation stage for code set 5010 implementation, demand for data warehouse in business development services to better understand and control medical costs, expansion of BPO services, including claims, benefits quoting and enrollment and the ramp up of new accounts.
Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics was also strong during the quarter. This segment continued to build on the growth from 2009, growing 6.4% sequentially, 40.7% year-over-year and represent an 18% of revenues for the quarter. The remaining 14.1% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of Communications, Media and High Technology, which grew 11.8% sequentially and 32.7% on a year-over-year basis. Within this other segment, we saw particular strength from our telecommunications clients as we continue to expand the range of services provided to them, as well as strength from our high-tech clients, who primarily purchase development services from us.
For the quarter, Application Management represent 55% of revenues and grew 28% year-over-year at 4% sequentially. Application Development was 45% of revenue and grew 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The strength in Application Development was driven in part by pent-up demand resulting from clients having underinvested in their businesses during 2008 and 2009 due to the economic uncertainty. 
During the quarter, 79% of revenues came from clients in North America, Europe was 18%, and 3% of revenues came from Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin markets. On a reported basis, Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and approximately 28% year-over-year. In the first quarter, European revenues was negatively impacted by approximately $6.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year due to the weakening of European currencies in the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, Europe grew 7.5% sequentially.
Pricing was down approximately 1% on a sequential basis. This was driven primarily by the growth in BPO services during Q1. We are having initial success in our pricing discussions with our client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in as the year progresses.
We had gross additions of 52 new customers during the first quarter. We closed the quarter with 597 active customers. During the quarter, the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by five. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 149. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage of the relationship.
Turning to costs, on a GAAP basis, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $556 million for the quarter compared to $420 million in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter cost of revenues included approximately $3.7 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 6,700 during the quarter and ended the quarter with close to 80,300 technical staff. 
Our first quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expenses, were $220.8 million on a GAAP basis, up from $188 million in the first quarter of 2009. GAAP SG&A expense in Q1 included approximately $10.3 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP operating margin was 19.1% for the quarter, and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 20.5%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. 
The average rate for the rupee was 45.9 in the first quarter of 2010 versus 46.6 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 49.6 in Q1 2009. $90 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled in Q1. This resulted in a $9.4 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses and partially offset the increase in cost resulting from the appreciation of the rupee. 
As of today, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $420 million and a weighted average forward rate of 48.9 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in the second to the fourth quarters of 2010. In addition, we have outstanding contracts with the notional value of $480 million and a weighted average forward rate of 48.3 rupees to the dollar scheduled to mature throughout 2011, and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $375 million and a weighted forward rate of 48.5 scheduled to mature in 2012.
We had $6.1 million of interest income. In addition, we had $10.3 million of other non-operating expenses, which include $10.5 million foreign exchange loss related to balance sheet remeasurements and related balance sheet hedges, primarily associated with the movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro. The remaining $200,000 of non-operating expenses included the mark-to-market requirements related to our auction-rate securities portfolio. 
Our GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 15.2%, below our original expectations due primarily to the tax impact of our foreign exchange hedges, the geographic mix of our earnings and the discrete item related to our non-U.S. operations. We expect the full year tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 16.3%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact from our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.57 billion of cash, short-term and long-term investments, up almost $21 million from the end of Q4. During the first quarter, operating activities generated over $2 million of cash, finance activities generated over $43 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. We spent approximately $24 million on capital expenditures during the quarter.
As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million on capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facilities expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction. Based on our $812 million balance on March 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76 days, up just under four days on a sequential basis and also on a year-on-year basis. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $106 million at the end of the first quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services. Approximately 62% of the Q1 unbilled balance was billed in April. 
During the quarter, 31% of our revenues came from fixed price contracts, flat from fourth quarter of 2009 and up from 29% in the first quarter of 2009. Net headcount increased by 7,100 people during the quarter, of which approximately 28% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 72% were lateral hires and experienced IT professionals. 
Similar to others in the industry, we experienced an increase in attrition during the first quarter. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, increased sequentially by 420 basis points to 16.4%. We believe this pick up in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors, combined with a flushing of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009, but were unable to due to the economy. This attrition was primarily at the junior levels. If we look at attrition on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how many others in the industry report attrition, our Q1 attrition was 12.4%. 
During the first quarter, we continued the hiring of both recent college graduates and experienced professionals to position ourselves well to meet revised 2010 demand expectations. As a result, our utilization level in Q1 showed a slight decline from Q4. Offshore utilization was approximately 67% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program during the quarter, was approximately 76%. On-site utilization was approximately 89% during the quarter. At the end of Q1, we had 7,500 unbilled people in our training program compared to 6,600 at the end of Q4 of 2009.
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q2 and full year 2010. For the second quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.015 billion. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current additions and client indications, we have increased our guidance for revenue to at least $4.1 billion. This represents growth of at least 25%. Due to the fragile economy, our guidance assumes some lumpiness in the back half of the year. In addition, the guidance reflects the wind-down in the third quarter of some of the M&A integration work we have been doing and the stabilization of pent-up discretionary development spend from which we have recently benefited. 
As previously mentioned, during Q1, we exceeded our margin targets. Due to anticipated wage inflation and a weakening rupee, partially offset by an expected improvement in utilization and a slightly favorable pricing environment, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense for the coming quarter and for the full year.
Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q2 share count of approximately 307.2 million shares and a tax rate of 16.6%. This guidance excludes any non-operating foreign exchange gains or losses.
For the full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to at least $2.10, and we now expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $2.26, excluding $0.16 of estimated full year stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 307.6 million shares and a full year tax rate of 16.3%. This guidance also excludes any future non-operating foreign exchange gain or losses.

It was broad-based across industries, and it was broad-based across our service offerings. I think that there are a few things I'd point out. One is that we did see Development grow faster than Application Maintenance this quarter, which was the first time since, I think, the end of 2007 that we saw that happen. So after almost, in fact, a full two years of Maintenance growing faster than Development for the first time, we saw App Development growing faster than App Maintenance. Now I think it's too early to call a trend yet, but we are seeing some strength in discretionary spending and Application Development, and we think that that's largely because essentially our clients have underinvested in their business over the last two years. And now as they turn back to their growth agendas, they're starting to spend and reinvest in their business. So I think that that's one important factor. The other is, I'll just say it again that, as I said during my comments, that a lot of these new services that, as you know, we invested very heavily during the downturn in the premise that we wanted to come out of the downturn in a stronger position than we went in. So we invested heavily in new service offerings like EMS [Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions], like Enterprise Analytics and several others, new geographies like the rest of the world, what we call the rest of the world. And those also are starting to show results. I think it's collectively all of those things that we've invested in that are contributing to our growth."

I don't think that there's -- we don't have a target of saying we have x number of people we need to hire in the business. As the business grows, I think you'll continue to see us expanding what we think of broadly as the client-facing team. If you think about the growth in that team, let me try and characterize it for you in a slightly different way. There really are, I would say, three buckets that we're hiring into or building capability around on the client-facing team. The first is what we call the client partners and account managers and account executives. These are the folks that manage our client relationships on a day-to-day basis. And you'll see us continue to hire into that, driven by business growth. As the business grows, we will continue to hire that. As we move into new geographies, we'll need to bring those people into new geographies and so on and so forth. So that will be an ongoing process, driven by business growth. The second area we're investing in is in our Consulting business, in the CBC team that I talked about. CBC, as I mentioned in my remarks, is about 1,800 people at this point, and those are largely billable folks, give or take, with utilization. And so we'll continue that build-out. I would say that in that build-out, although we're not focused on scale, we're focused far more on quality of outcomes in that business. I would say that we probably are about halfway through the process of building out that team. If I look at the parts of our business that are covered by CBC today, we still have work to do to build that out. And then the last piece of the build-out are new capabilities in the front-end teams that we need to continue to build out as the nature of our business changes as we get engaged in larger and more strategic complex programs, things like program management, for example, which is a very important part of and becoming an increasingly important part of how we need to engage with clients. We didn't have to have extremely sophisticated program management five or 10 years ago because the nature of our client relationships didn't require it. As we are becoming much more integral and much larger in terms of our footprint at given clients, we're going to continue to build out the program management capability. And that's a place where we're at somewhat earlier in our journey, and it's a place that we look to accelerate over the coming days and quarters."

And the portfolio is at different places. The traditional core services are very mature at this point.

Then we've got a set of services that you could say we've incubated or that are relatively new, let's say, in the last 18 to 24, 36 months. And I would include things like BPO and  IT IS in that group. I would include the Enterprise Analytics business. I would even put Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions or EMS in that group. We've largely made the investments, we'll continue to invest. They still require care and feeding but are already starting to show revenue that are profitable in almost all cases. And we're seeing good solid revenue growth. So those are well on their way and doing well. And then we have a set around new emerging opportunity areas. For example, the easy ones to think about will be new geos, like what we call the rest of the world, where we're very early. We've been making investments. We still have lots of work to do in those areas to continue to build out, and those will require attention and investment dollars over the next few years to continue to grow there. Let me spend a minute on cloud, since you specifically asked about cloud. The cloud opportunity is an interesting one. And we actually think about the cloud opportunity along two dimensions. Cloud is the technology and it impacts a lot of the areas of our business or has opportunities around a lot of the areas of our business. So when you think about cloud from an infrastructure standpoint, our IT infrastructure team is very heavily involved in the technologies around virtualization, around helping clients put in private clouds, around advising clients on how to use public clouds from an infrastructure standpoint. When you think about cloud from a platform standpoint, like the platforms that are available through Salesforce and so on and so forth, there, we have -- that impacts principally our Application Development business. And we're already engaged in a number of projects where we're helping clients build new applications, sitting on top of public cloud platform infrastructure, so building apps for Salesforce.com and so on and so fourth. That's already under way, and I think we've got lots of projects that we have when you think about those things. But we also think that cloud is going to enable. Beyond the technology of cloud, we think that cloud is going to enable us to deliver services to our clients in a different way. We think that business services delivered over the cloud, so it's sort of a combination of our traditional BPO business platforms, and people will allow us to create industry utilities delivered over the cloud. That will be a change in how these services are delivered in some segments. And so that's an early area of investment for us. We're continuing to put energy and attention, and that's something that, I think, is in early stages and will start to show results some quarters down the road."

I'm pleased to report yet another strong quarter and the resulting increase in our guidance for 2010. After summarizing our Q1 results and giving you some context for our revised 2010 outlook, I'd like to spend time today commenting on the strength of Cognizant's growth platform. Gordon will then discuss our financial and operating metrics. And as always, we'll conclude by opening the floor for questions.
Our first quarter results reflect the fact that the cyclical downturn that has marred the global economy over the last 18 to 24 months appears to be turning. While our planning assumption remains, that it is premature to say that a full recovery is upon us, we're optimistic that the worst of the recession is behind us. 
First quarter revenue was $960 million against our guidance of at least $935 million, a sequential increase of 6.3% and 29% on the year. That growth was once again broad-base spanning many of our services, industries and geographies. We saw strong performance in core service offerings and believe that they have ample room for continued long-term growth. 
Application Development saw a surge this quarter, growing faster than Application Maintenance, perhaps signaling that a recovery in discretionary spending is underway. In terms of industries, we saw growth in Financial Services as an environment of relative stability continued in that industry. 
Retail and Manufacturing delivered another strong quarter, contributing significantly to both sequential and year-on-year results. Our Other Industry category also grew substantially, driven largely by success in the telecom and high-tech sectors. 
During the quarter, we added five accounts that we consider strategic and have the potential to ramp up to at least $5 million and more than $50 million in annual revenue; two from Financial Services, two from Retail and Manufacturing and one from Healthcare and Life Sciences. 
Turning to geographies, while a surge in North American revenues drove results, revenues increased throughout much of the world. The U.K. came back on stream, though continental Europe remained sluggish due to slower economic recovery and a negative impact from weaker currencies. We expect European recovery to take a few more quarters. We were encouraged by rapid expansion of our business outside North America and Europe, what we refer to as the rest of the world. Though growing from a small base, the region posted nearly 30% sequential growth and 90% year-on-year growth.
Despite the optimism that our first quarter results portend, we remain cautious. The overall economic situation looks more positive, but still tenuous. Demand and credit, prerequisites for business investment, are resuming some normalcy, yet unemployment gnaws at developed economies. And while the economies of many European nations are looking up, those still struggling, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, among others, could impact the broader European Union and the global economy. Consequently, our planning bias will remain cautious until we see, at a minimum, sustained improvement in the unemployment situation and less volatility in the currency markets. 
Given this posture of cautious optimism, we've increased our 2010 guidance to at least 25% revenue growth or at least $4.1 billion for the year, up from the at least 20% guidance we put forward last quarter. This increased guidance reflects our Q1 overall performance and strong expectations for Q2, but factors a more cautious approach in the back half of the year given the continued economic uncertainties that I referred to earlier. Gordon will cover our detailed results and guidance shortly.
I'd now like to talk about Cognizant's growth platform. From our conversations with clients at our recently concluded customer event and from other sources, it's clear that clients have re-embarked on their growth agendas after a pause of 18 to 24 months. Given the reemergence of top line growth as a key priority for clients and the resulting demand for our services, it's appropriate to spend some time discussing Cognizant's overall architecture for sustained growth. 
Let's start with a look at the demand environment. Historically, economic recovery has been a strong catalyst for our business as client seek to free investment capital by outsourcing non-core processes. We saw this after the 2001 slowdown, and we are beginning again to see this trend driving demand for our services. During this recovery, we also see another powerful driver fueling demand. The past two years have not just been the time of a major cyclical downturn, but also that of a significant secular shift point for many of the industries we serve. These secular changes are driven by megatrends of digitization, demographic shifts, government-mandated change and new disruptive technologies such as cloud, social computing and virtualization. These shifts represent challenges and growth opportunities for our clients. In this environment, clients don't want to choose between a strategic partner and a cost-effective outsourcing provider. They want both. The investment that we've made over the years position us extremely well to serve these twin needs.
To respond to market demand, Cognizant's approach has been to lead our market in terms of reinvestment, continually innovating so that our clients turn to us first as their needs of a partner change and evolve. Our reinvestment approach is underpinned by two tenets. 
First, at any point in time, we focus our investments on a small set of opportunities that represent the highest priorities for Cognizant, based on the strong conviction that our resources are most productive when they aren't stretched thin. 
Second, we balance investments across multiple return horizons, making sure to capitalize on near-term opportunities, but never losing sight of planting seeds for the future. This discipline of consistently executing this reinvestment approach over many years through up-and-down cycles has resulted in a strong three-pillar growth platform that we believe can drive sustainable growth at Cognizant. 
Our core business represents the first pillar. Core services once again this quarter showed strong growth, driven by rising regulation, enhanced offshore adoption and modest redemption in discretionary spending. Our core businesses are strong and vibrant, and we see considerable untapped opportunity in these areas as illustrated by a recent industry analyst report that found that, collectively, the top six India-based providers share only 2.7% of the global services market.
The second pillar of growth is comprised of new capabilities, which we have incubated over the past few years, that are now collectively starting to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way. Typically, these are new industries, new capabilities to service the evolving needs of our clients or new geographies to continue market expansion. Two illustrative examples that are showing results include our Enterprise Analytics Practice and our Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions Practice.
In our Enterprise Analytics Practice, we help businesses around the world that are facing an explosion of data volumes to distill large quantities of data into actionable information. Through increased hiring of statisticians and analysts, combined with Cognizant's world-class data management technologists, our Enterprise Analytics Practice has helped clients in two major ways.
First, by developing applications to automate repeatable analytical functions; and second by performing very sophisticated custom analytics for our clients that cannot be automated. As an example, we recently helped a large grocery retailer improve chain profitability by analyzing large amounts of customer data to optimize store placement and promotional activities. 
Another example, our Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions Practice has grown to nearly 1,000 associates in under two quarters. Initially, launched to have Invensys manage product development and innovation, this practice is now helping new customers integrate applications on the manufacturing shop floor and in control systems with back-office enterprise infrastructure. Cognizant's strong capabilities in controls and automation, product lifecycle management and embedded systems are helping clients improve efficiencies, reduce time-to-market and provide better customer service.
We were recently chosen by a Fortune 500 organization in the building controls industry as their strategic engineering partner to advance its offerings to optimize energy and operational efficiencies of buildings. The Enterprise Analytics Practice and the Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions Practice are just two example of areas of recent investment that are showing results. We have a portfolio of similar opportunities across geographic markets, industry segments and new solutions, which we have incubated.
The third pillar of our growth platform is comprised of the investments we are making today for the longer-term growth. First, there remain areas today where we are underrepresented. Geographic markets like Latin America and adjacent industries like healthcare providers and energy and utilities represent growth opportunities for us. In addition, all of the new technologies and approaches that fall under the umbrella of cloud computing represent opportunities for us to create a range of cloud-enabled solutions, which were not feasible with older-generation technologies. Cognizant is working on new offerings that could unlock new levels of business value by implementing next-generation delivery and commercial models based upon a cloud computing backbone. These vertically-aligned cloud-enabled business solutions weave together people, applications, infrastructure and business process services to address key business problems our clients face. 
This is an exciting shift in business technology, and we're taking the steps necessary to differentiate ourselves in this important area. When taken together, our three-pillar growth approach, supported by our strategy of reinvestment, creates an engine for sustainable growth at Cognizant. 
The final point before I turn it over to Gordon is, that our growth platform is only as good as our channel to market. As I've said in the past, our client-facing team is one of the strongest in the industry. A key part of that team is Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC. CBC resources, now more than 1,800 strong, are involved in an increasing number of projects and accounts. Their role is to identify and deliver the value-added advisory services that our client need to navigate change. 
An example of this is the work we recently performed for a well-known global apparel brand. Our clients sought to aggressively diversify beyond their traditional business-to-business distribution channel and begin selling directly to consumers. They planned a series of retail acquisitions and also a program to organically open and operate retail stores.
CBC consultants developed an M&A integration roadmap designed to standardize business processes and developed an IT strategy for the firm. Simultaneously, we helped the client create a business model that take control of, reopen and operate new retail stores. This program has helped our clients realize substantial synergy savings, eliminate transition costs and reduce IT spending. And we continue to invest in order to further strengthen our client-facing capabilities. 
As we undertake increasingly strategic roles, our engagements have become wider reaching transformational programs that touch many facets of client organizations. Managing these large initiatives is a unique capability onto itself. To that end, we have invested and will continue to invest in enhancing our client-facing organization with the program management capabilities needed to make these types of large-scale initiatives successful.
So as we look forward to the rest of 2010, we are excited that we are well positioned with our clients. We have invested in opportunities across industries and geographies, embracing a range of solutions that give us breadth and balance, balance between efficiency and effectiveness which save our clients money and innovation which expand their businesses. Our customers don't need to compromise between a strategic partner and a cost-effective outsourcing provider. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gordon to detail our financial and operating results. Gordon?

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance was broad-based, with all of our major industry segments experiencing healthy demand. During the first quarter, our Financial Services segment, wh",1803,"Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance was broad-based, with all of our major industry segments experiencing healthy demand. 
During the first quarter, our Financial Services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing, grew 5.3% on a sequential basis and 20.3% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 41.5% of revenue for the quarter. The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad, with clients focusing on cost controls and efficiencies, transformational projects, M&A integration, regulatory compliance, risk management and certainly, discretionary innovation initiatives.
Healthcare continued its strong performance during the quarter, with 5.1% sequential growth and 33.3% growth compared to the first quarter of 2009. The segment represented 26.3% of revenues for the quarter. The sequential growth was driven primarily by our healthcare insurance clients. Demand within these clients is driven by movements from the assessment stage to the remediation stage for code set 5010 implementation, demand for data warehouse in business development services to better understand and control medical costs, expansion of BPO services, including claims, benefits quoting and enrollment and the ramp up of new accounts.
Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics was also strong during the quarter. This segment continued to build on the growth from 2009, growing 6.4% sequentially, 40.7% year-over-year and represent an 18% of revenues for the quarter. The remaining 14.1% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of Communications, Media and High Technology, which grew 11.8% sequentially and 32.7% on a year-over-year basis. Within this other segment, we saw particular strength from our telecommunications clients as we continue to expand the range of services provided to them, as well as strength from our high-tech clients, who primarily purchase development services from us.
For the quarter, Application Management represent 55% of revenues and grew 28% year-over-year at 4% sequentially. Application Development was 45% of revenue and grew 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The strength in Application Development was driven in part by pent-up demand resulting from clients having underinvested in their businesses during 2008 and 2009 due to the economic uncertainty. 
During the quarter, 79% of revenues came from clients in North America, Europe was 18%, and 3% of revenues came from Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin markets. On a reported basis, Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and approximately 28% year-over-year. In the first quarter, European revenues was negatively impacted by approximately $6.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year due to the weakening of European currencies in the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, Europe grew 7.5% sequentially.
Pricing was down approximately 1% on a sequential basis. This was driven primarily by the growth in BPO services during Q1. We are having initial success in our pricing discussions with our client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in as the year progresses.
We had gross additions of 52 new customers during the first quarter. We closed the quarter with 597 active customers. During the quarter, the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by five. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 149. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage of the relationship.
Turning to costs, on a GAAP basis, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $556 million for the quarter compared to $420 million in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter cost of revenues included approximately $3.7 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 6,700 during the quarter and ended the quarter with close to 80,300 technical staff. 
Our first quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expenses, were $220.8 million on a GAAP basis, up from $188 million in the first quarter of 2009. GAAP SG&A expense in Q1 included approximately $10.3 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP operating margin was 19.1% for the quarter, and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 20.5%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. 
The average rate for the rupee was 45.9 in the first quarter of 2010 versus 46.6 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 49.6 in Q1 2009. $90 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled in Q1. This resulted in a $9.4 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses and partially offset the increase in cost resulting from the appreciation of the rupee. 
As of today, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $420 million and a weighted average forward rate of 48.9 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in the second to the fourth quarters of 2010. In addition, we have outstanding contracts with the notional value of $480 million and a weighted average forward rate of 48.3 rupees to the dollar scheduled to mature throughout 2011, and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $375 million and a weighted forward rate of 48.5 scheduled to mature in 2012.
We had $6.1 million of interest income. In addition, we had $10.3 million of other non-operating expenses, which include $10.5 million foreign exchange loss related to balance sheet remeasurements and related balance sheet hedges, primarily associated with the movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro. The remaining $200,000 of non-operating expenses included the mark-to-market requirements related to our auction-rate securities portfolio. 
Our GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 15.2%, below our original expectations due primarily to the tax impact of our foreign exchange hedges, the geographic mix of our earnings and the discrete item related to our non-U.S. operations. We expect the full year tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 16.3%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact from our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.57 billion of cash, short-term and long-term investments, up almost $21 million from the end of Q4. During the first quarter, operating activities generated over $2 million of cash, finance activities generated over $43 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. We spent approximately $24 million on capital expenditures during the quarter.
As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million on capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facilities expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction. Based on our $812 million balance on March 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76 days, up just under four days on a sequential basis and also on a year-on-year basis. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $106 million at the end of the first quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services. Approximately 62% of the Q1 unbilled balance was billed in April. 
During the quarter, 31% of our revenues came from fixed price contracts, flat from fourth quarter of 2009 and up from 29% in the first quarter of 2009. Net headcount increased by 7,100 people during the quarter, of which approximately 28% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 72% were lateral hires and experienced IT professionals. 
Similar to others in the industry, we experienced an increase in attrition during the first quarter. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, increased sequentially by 420 basis points to 16.4%. We believe this pick up in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors, combined with a flushing of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009, but were unable to due to the economy. This attrition was primarily at the junior levels. If we look at attrition on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how many others in the industry report attrition, our Q1 attrition was 12.4%. 
During the first quarter, we continued the hiring of both recent college graduates and experienced professionals to position ourselves well to meet revised 2010 demand expectations. As a result, our utilization level in Q1 showed a slight decline from Q4. Offshore utilization was approximately 67% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program during the quarter, was approximately 76%. On-site utilization was approximately 89% during the quarter. At the end of Q1, we had 7,500 unbilled people in our training program compared to 6,600 at the end of Q4 of 2009.
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q2 and full year 2010. For the second quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.015 billion. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current additions and client indications, we have increased our guidance for revenue to at least $4.1 billion. This represents growth of at least 25%. Due to the fragile economy, our guidance assumes some lumpiness in the back half of the year. In addition, the guidance reflects the wind-down in the third quarter of some of the M&A integration work we have been doing and the stabilization of pent-up discretionary development spend from which we have recently benefited. 
As previously mentioned, during Q1, we exceeded our margin targets. Due to anticipated wage inflation and a weakening rupee, partially offset by an expected improvement in utilization and a slightly favorable pricing environment, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense for the coming quarter and for the full year.
Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q2 share count of approximately 307.2 million shares and a tax rate of 16.6%. This guidance excludes any non-operating foreign exchange gains or losses.
For the full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to at least $2.10, and we now expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $2.26, excluding $0.16 of estimated full year stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 307.6 million shares and a full year tax rate of 16.3%. This guidance also excludes any future non-operating foreign exchange gain or losses.
Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?

It was broad-based across industries, and it was broad-based across our service offerings. I think that there are a few things I'd point out. One is that we did see Development grow faster than Application Maintenance this quarter, which was the first time since, I think, the end of 2007 that we saw that happen. So after almost, in fact, a full two years of Maintenance growing faster than Development for the first time, we saw App Development growing faster than App Maintenance. Now I think it's too early to call a trend yet, but we are seeing some strength in discretionary spending and Application Development, and we think that that's largely because essentially our clients have underinvested in their business over the last two years. And now as they turn back to their growth agendas, they're starting to spend and reinvest in their business. So I think that that's one important factor. The other is, I'll just say it again that, as I said during my comments, that a lot of these new services that, as you know, we invested very heavily during the downturn in the premise that we wanted to come out of the downturn in a stronger position than we went in. So we invested heavily in new service offerings like EMS [Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions], like Enterprise Analytics and several others, new geographies like the rest of the world, what we call the rest of the world. And those also are starting to show results. I think it's collectively all of those things that we've invested in that are contributing to our growth.

As we move into new geographies, we'll need to bring those people into new geographies and so on and so forth. So that will be an ongoing process, driven by business growth. The second area we're investing in is in our Consulting business, in the CBC team that I talked about. CBC, as I mentioned in my remarks, is about 1,800 people at this point, and those are largely billable folks, give or take, with utilization. And so we'll continue that build-out. I would say that in that build-out, although we're not focused on scale, we're focused far more on quality of outcomes in that business. I would say that we probably are about halfway through the process of building out that team. If I look at the parts of our business that are covered by CBC today, we still have work to do to build that out. And then the last piece of the build-out are new capabilities in the front-end teams that we need to continue to build out as the nature of our business changes as we get engaged in larger and more strategic complex programs, things like program management, for example, which is a very important part of and becoming an increasingly important part of how we need to engage with clients. We didn't have to have extremely sophisticated program management five or 10 years ago because the nature of our client relationships didn't require it. As we are becoming much more integral and much larger in terms of our footprint at given clients, we're going to continue to build out the program management capability. And that's a place where we're at somewhat earlier in our journey, and it's a place that we look to accelerate over the coming days and quarters.

And the portfolio is at different places. The traditional core services are very mature at this point. We continue to enhance them and make investments, but those are -- I would characterize those as more incremental. Then we've got a set of services that you could say we've incubated or that are relatively new, let's say, in the last 18 to 24, 36 months. And I would include things like BPO and  IT IS in that group. I would include the Enterprise Analytics business. I would even put Engineering and Manufacturing Solutions or EMS in that group. We've largely made the investments, we'll continue to invest. They still require care and feeding but are already starting to show revenue that are profitable in almost all cases. And we're seeing good solid revenue growth. So those are well on their way and doing well. And then we have a set around new emerging opportunity areas. For example, the easy ones to think about will be new geos, like what we call the rest of the world, where we're very early. We've been making investments. We still have lots of work to do in those areas to continue to build out, and those will require attention and investment dollars over the next few years to continue to grow there. Let me spend a minute on cloud, since you specifically asked about cloud. The cloud opportunity is an interesting one. And we actually think about the cloud opportunity along two dimensions. Cloud is the technology and it impacts a lot of the areas of our business or has opportunities around a lot of the areas of our business. So when you think about cloud from an infrastructure standpoint, our IT infrastructure team is very heavily involved in the technologies around virtualization, around helping clients put in private clouds, around advising clients on how to use public clouds from an infrastructure standpoint. When you think about cloud from a platform standpoint, like the platforms that are available through Salesforce and so on and so forth, there, we have -- that impacts principally our Application Development business. And we're already engaged in a number of projects where we're helping clients build new applications, sitting on top of public cloud platform infrastructure, so building apps for Salesforce.com and so on and so fourth. That's already under way, and I think we've got lots of projects that we have when you think about those things. But we also think that cloud is going to enable. Beyond the technology of cloud, we think that cloud is going to enable us to deliver services to our clients in a different way. We think that business services delivered over the cloud, so it's sort of a combination of our traditional BPO business platforms, and people will allow us to create industry utilities delivered over the cloud. That will be a change in how these services are delivered in some segments. And so that's an early area of investment for us. We're continuing to put energy and attention, and that's something that, I think, is in early stages and will start to show results some quarters down the road.

Thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report outstanding results for the second quarter of 2010. Results, which validate our view that Cognizant has emerged from the economic downturn",1947,"Thank you, David, and good morning from London, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report outstanding results for the second quarter of 2010. Results, which validate our view that Cognizant has emerged from the economic downturn stronger than we've ever been. The strategy of reinvestment, of which we've spoken to you in the past, has created meaningful differentiation in our business model. Throughout the recession, our commitment to continued investment in our business was unwavering in winning new clients and strengthening our client-facing teams and innovative new service capabilities in our infrastructure and importantly, in hiring and developing our team. 
The second quarter's results are a testament to the soundness of that approach. During the second quarter, Cognizant reached $1.1 billion in revenue, a sequential increase of 15% and an increase of 42% year-over-year. This marks Cognizant's first quarter exceeding $1 billion. That's a milestone of which our associates are particularly proud. Our exceptional growth in the second quarter was broad-based, with nearly every sector, service and the geography, exceeding our expectations. This was largely the result of a sustained surge in new discretionary projects that kept up during the quarter. Application development revenue, which is a good indicator of discretionary projects, grew 22% sequentially and 52% on the year. During the recession, our clients underinvested in technology. As this pent-up demand has released, we've been able to capture an outside share of it. And while we are not yet hearing from clients that everything is back to normal, clients do acknowledge that prudent investment in their businesses require to remain  competitive in the face of the secular changes their industries are facing.
Growth in Q2 was further accelerated by a small set of large ongoing M&A integration projects, in which we are playing a key role, although we do expect some of those projects to wind down for us in the back half of the year. And finally, regulatory changes such as HIPAA 5010 and ICD-10 in the U.S. healthcare industry continue to drive new projects for Cognizant. As the impact of the most recent U.S. regulatory reform in the financial services and healthcare industries is still being assessed, we continue to work closely with our clients to gauge the impact of these regulatory reforms on their businesses. We expect that this will not have a significant impact on our business this year, but rather might be growth drivers for 2011 and beyond. 
Geographically, we saw solid growth return to the markets in Europe. Our results in Q2 illustrates the differentiated position that we've been able to achieve in Europe as a result of our investments. In a notable achievement this quarter, EquaTerra, our leading independent sourcing advisory firm, ranked Cognizant first in customer satisfaction out of the 25 leading service providers in Europe, across both India-based providers and global multinational players. Cognizant was the only firm out of the 25 providers assessed that had no dissatisfied clients. Furthermore, Cognizant scored the highest in seven of the eight factors contributing to customer satisfaction, on which the study focused. Our Q2 financial results reflect the high degree of customer satisfaction. 
Overall, our European revenue grew 15% sequentially, but 20% after removing the currency effects. Our U.K. practice, in particular, saw company-leading growth of 22% on a reported basis, some of which was driven by the M&A integration activity, of which I've already spoken. One of the key elements of our differentiation in Europe had been our ability to build strong local teams in their respective countries in Europe and to couple those teams very tightly with our global delivery operations in order to give clients a strong local front-end capability, including language, with the benefits of the global delivery model, the best of both worlds in some senses. In Q2, we continue to deepen our front-end capabilities in continent Europe, with the acquisition of Galileo, a boutique firm focused on testing services in the French market. We are already seeing market opportunities in France to combine the Galileo front-end with our global testing practice, which, at over 12,000 associates, stands today as one of the single largest testing organizations in the world.
As we reflect on our results for this and the past few quarters, it is clear that Cognizant is capturing an outside share of the market opportunity. We believe that this is a direct result of the differentiation that we have achieved in the business model, including our Cognizant Business Consulting team or CBC. For example, this year, our healthcare consulting team is engaged with five of our clients to assess the impact of ICD regulations on them. This has already led to our involvement in three large follow-on programs, two of which are in the remediation stage.
Our CBC front-end will continue to differentiate us from our competition. In Q2, we continued investing in CBC through the acquisition of the global program management consulting firm, PIPC. As clients continue to adjust to the secular changes in their industries, we expect that we will see larger business transformation programs. Managing these programs require the unique skill set which PIPC bring to the table. The services they offer range from managing forced M&A integration through strategic software implementations and large-scale outsourcing programs. CIBC is already enhancing our capability to drive large complex transformation projects on a global basis.
Given Q2's positive results and our outlook for 2010, we have increased our revenue guidance for 2010 to at least 36% growth or at least $4.46 billion for the year. Sequentially, we believe third quarter growth will be at least 6.3%. While increased guidance reflects optimism for the remainder of the year, there are a number of very real factors that are causing us to temper our outlook. 
First, part of the more modest growth is a result of the seasonality we traditionally see in our results. Although not as apparent during last year's recession, Q2 has historically been our strongest quarter. In addition, we continued to believe that the economic recovery is still tenuous. Despite positive messages from clients, macroeconomic indicators continue to tell a different story. A number of legislative initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide continue to create uncertainty and a mindset of risk aversion for our clients. While the European environment appears less uncertain than it did during our last earnings announcement, it is evident that recovery there will lag the U.S., particularly on the continent. Despite our strong growth in Europe during the second quarter, we expect a more tempered rate that is aligned with the messages from the macroeconomic indicators going forward.
And finally, Cognizant would take steps during the back half of the year to ensure that we prudently manage our growth. While high growth is not new to us, as we've seen it throughout our history, the rate at which growth has accelerated over these past few quarters is extraordinary. In order to maintain our strong positioning while sustaining high levels of client satisfaction, we will make sure that our resources are allocated optimally, keeping in mind the best interest of our customers and our prospects. Over the coming quarters, we intend to focus sharply on ensuring that our attrition and our attention is unwaveringly focused on clients that represent solid long-term client opportunities for the company.
With regard to our associates, we have always focused on building a team of the very best people. We believe that the Cognizant team, our access to the best talent from top universities, coupled with our unique culture and DNA, represent another aspect of differentiation for Cognizant. During the downturn, while competitors cut back or suspended hiring altogether, Cognizant continue to build strong relationships with universities and hire the exceptional talent that was available in the market. As a result of these efforts, Cognizant recently earned the top placement from a leading Indian business publication as a leading recruiter from premier technical schools and from premier business schools across industries. We think this speaks volumes, not only about the fact that Cognizant is a great place to work, but about the fact that Cognizant has the best talent for our clients. We will continue to focus on developing this incredibly talented team of people. 
As you'll notice in Q2, we were not immuned from the industry-wide problem of increased attrition. And while we fared better than most of our peers, we can do better. Our industry-leading growth provides our associates the best opportunities to build their careers. Over the next several quarters, they're going to take steps to ensure -- to step up our efforts and to ensure that these opportunities manifest themselves for our associates so that they continue to benefit from Cognizant's growth.
Before I close my remarks and I hand out to Gordon, I'd like to briefly comment on what we're seeing in the business longer term. Over the last several quarters, we've told the story of how clients are facing, not only cyclical pressures, but secular ones as well, about how a new generation of workers and consumers, the Millennials, are shifting our supply is created and how demand is manifested, and about how a new generation of business models, virtualized and globalized, are changing how a work is getting done and how a new generation of technology is changing the IT landscape. 
During Q2, amidst the surge in discretionary spending, we see proof points of this story continuing to play out. As we have shared with you several years ago, we, at Cognizant, started moving our own business to cloud platforms and social technologies via Cognizant 2.0. We've experienced significant benefits from these new approaches. We're now seeing interest from clients with this approach in their own businesses. 
In the cloud world, you're all familiar with Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service. At Cognizant, we are pioneering the delivery of business processes and service for our clients, through which we can deliver process solutions to our clients in the cloud, leveraging a global workforce, which is tightly coordinated, not in a physical workspace, but in virtual workspaces, enabled by the business use of social computing. As an example, with a leading U.S.-based media firm, we are providing finance and accounting functions as a service. Now on the one hand, this may seem straightforward. Yet for this client, to take a well-understood process and not only make it more efficient, but also more effective through the innovations introduced by a globally-distributed and virtually-connected team provides a clear before-and-after picture on the improvements we can deliver through a new approach to work. We're implementing this approach across industries such as insurance, media, retail and travel, addressing such process areas as vendor management, maintenance and repair operations, production management, as well as finance and accounting.
Our early clients are enthused with these efforts and tell us that this approach of infusing business processes with greater degrees of collaboration and virtualization represents a new way of working. It is, in some senses, the future of work. This demonstrates the story we believe would play out and the story that we planned for is coming to fruition. More importantly for us, it demonstrates that clients seek Cognizant as a credible source to help them, credible because of the insights and capabilities we bring, and credible because this next generation of work is what we live with every day. With an employee base comprised of significant number of Millennials that work everyday as part of global virtual teams, we know what success looks like, and clients are coming to us to hear this story. 
With that, let me hand it over to Gordon before we open up the call for questions. Gordon?"

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad-based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. During the second quarter, we experienced exceptional strength in",2133,"Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad-based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. During the second quarter, we experienced exceptional strength in our Financial Services segments, which includes our Practices and Insurance, Banking and Transaction Processing. This segment grew 18.1% on a sequential basis and 41.6% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 42.6% of revenue for the quarter. The current demand within financial services continues to be fairly broad-based across our client base. We are seeing continued focus on M&A integration work, as Francisco mentioned earlier, initiatives to drive cost efficiencies and operational effectiveness, projects related to regulatory compliance and risk management and very importantly, discretionary innovation initiatives to enhance competitive positioning.
Healthcare continued its strong performance during the quarter, with 11.8% sequential growth and 38.1% growth compared to the second quarter of 2009. This segment represented 25.5% of revenues for the quarter. The sequential growth was driven largely by our healthcare insurance claims with some pickup in our Life Sciences segment over the last quarter. Demand within these clients was driven by data warehousing and analytics services to better understand and control medical costs, expansion of BPO services including claims, benefits, coding and enrollment and platform-modernization initiatives.
Manufacturing, retail and logistics were also very strong during the quarter. This segment continued to build on the growth from the first quarter and from 2009, growing 17.3% sequentially and 53.4% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 18.4% of revenues for the quarter. Demand within this segment was driven by an increase in large-scale transformation and systems integration projects among our major manufacturing clients. For our retail clients, we have seen an increase in business transformation projects such as service platform development and multichannel expansion, especially in the e-commerce. In addition, we have seen an increased interest in customer segmentation initiatives. We refer to these as Know your Customer projects. Finally, this segment continues to benefit from the ramp-up of clients won in the past year. 
The remaining 13.5% of our revenues came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high-tech, which grew 10% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. For the quarter, application management represented 52% of revenues and grew 34.3% year-over-year and 9.7% sequentially. Application development was 48% of revenues and grew 52.3% year-over-year and a whopping 21.7% sequentially. The strength in application development was driven in part by pent-up demand resulting from clients having under-invested in their businesses during 2008 and 2009 due to the economic uncertainty.
During the quarter, 78.6% of revenues came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.1% of total revenues, and 3.3% of revenues came from the Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. On a reported basis, Europe grew 15.3% sequentially and 44.3% year-over-year. During the second quarter, European revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $8.7 million compared to the first quarter due to the weakening of European currencies in the quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, Europe grew 20.3% sequentially.
Our Q2 acquisitions at PIPC consulting and Galileo contributed approximately $6.1 million of revenue towards our Q2 results. Pricing on a sequential basis was up slightly on site and down slightly offshore. Overall, pricing was essentially flat. We continue to have success in our pricing discussions with our existing client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters, as rate increases start to kick in.
We had gross additions of 116 new clients during the second quarter. This included 54 additions through our acquisitions at PIPC and Galileo. We closed the quarter with 662 active customers. During the quarter, number of accounts, which we consider to be strategic, increased by six. This brings our total number of strategic accounts to 155. We continue to see a trend towards newer strategic accounts, embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at a  early stage in the relationship. 
Turning to costs. On a GAAP basis, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $641 million for the quarter, and included approximately $3.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by close to 2,900 during the quarter, and ended the quarter with over 83,100 technical staff. 
Second quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expense, was $258.2 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $10.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP operating margin was 18.6% for the quarter, and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 19.9%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. 
The average rates for the rupee was 45.5 in the second quarter of 2010 versus 45.9 in the first quarter of 2010 and 48.7 in the second quarter of last year. $135 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the second quarter. This resulted in a $9.5 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses. We currently have outstanding operating expense cash flow hedges with a notional value totaling over $2.2 billion, of which $330 million are scheduled to mature in the second half of 2010 with an average forward rate of 48.6. In addition, we have $780 million of contracts at an average rate of 48 scheduled to mature throughout 2011, as well as another $780 million at a rate of 48.1 scheduled to mature in 2012 and $330 million at a rate of 49.9 scheduled to mature in 2013.
We had $6.5 million of interest income. In addition, we had a net loss of $4.4 million of other nonoperating expenses, which included $4.6 million of foreign exchange losses related to balance sheet measurements, primarily associated with the movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro, as well as certain balance sheet hedges. The remaining $200,000 in non-operating income included the mark-to-market requirements related to our Auction Rates Securities portfolio, which was liquidated at the end of the quarter. 
Our GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 17.2%, above our original expectations, due primarily to the tax impact of our foreign exchange hedges, the geographic mix of our earnings and certain discreet items related to our ongoing operations recorded in the quarter. We expect the full year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.7%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact related to our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.65 billion of cash and investments, which was up approximately $81 million from Q1. During the second quarter, operating activities generated over $135 million of cash. Financing activities generated almost $30 million of cash comprised of the proceeds of our employee equity programs and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. We spent approximately $29 million for acquisitions and $42 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million in capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction.
Based on our $933.7 million balance on June 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76.9 days, up from 76.2 days in the first quarter. The unbilled portion of our Receivables portfolio was approximately $119.5 million at the end of the second quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services, which represented approximately 70% of our unbilled AR balance. It's important to note approximately 60% of our second quarter unbilled balance was billed at the end of July.
During the second quarter, 31.3% of our revenue came from fixed bid contracts, up slightly from the first quarter. Net headcount increased by close to 3,200 people during the second quarter, of which approximately 30% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 70% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 88,700 employees globally. 
Similar to others in the industry, we experienced an increase in attrition during the second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, there is no consistent methodology in the way the industry reports attrition numbers. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurs within the quarter, both voluntary and involuntary. This number has increased sequentially to 20.7%. Much of the industry calculates turnover on a trailing 12-month basis. Calculated this way, which is consistent with the way others in the industry report attrition, our attrition was 15.6% during the quarter. It is also important to note that our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO, including employees in our training program.
We believe this pickup in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors, combined with a cash up of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009 but were able to do so due to the economy. The attrition was primarily at the junior levels. We are very focused on addressing the spike in attrition. In addition to the obvious compensation adjustments that we discussed on last quarter's calls, we're also making it very clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them. This includes implementing a record number of promotions over the last few months, which, on a percentage basis, was certainly industry-leading. 
In addition, we have redoubled our efforts on employee engagement, transparent communication, ensuring that we continue to force through the collaborative entrepreneurial culture, which our associates tells us a secret source at Cognizant, or what we simply refer to as the Cognizant DNA. Finally, we will certainly share the success of this year's performance with our employees through very strong, variable compensation payouts for the year.
Due to the strong overall industry demand, we do not expect attrition to return to normalized levels overnight, and we are planning for that in our hiring plans. Due to our aggressive hiring in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of this year, we were able to meet the starting requirements resulting from the surge in demand we experienced during the second quarter. This resulted in a significant increase in our utilization rates during the second quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 73% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program during the quarter, was approximately 82%. On-site utilization was approximately 93% for the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 6,900 unbilled people in our training program compared to 7,500 at the end of Q1. During the second quarter, utilization was higher than desired, and we plan to accelerate hiring in the back half of the year to ensure that we have the people in our pipeline to support long-term growth. 
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q3 and full year 2010. For the third quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.175 billion. For full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we've increased our guidance for revenue to at least $4.46 billion. This represents growth of at least 36%. Our guidance for the second half of the year reflects the wind down of some of the M&A integration work, which we have been doing, and the stabilization of pent-up discretionary development spend, from which we have recently benefited.
As previously mentioned, during Q2, we met our target margins. And for the remainder of the year, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q3 share count of approximately 310 million shares and a tax rate of 17%. This guidance excludes any non-operating FX gains or losses.
For the full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to at least $2.26, and we now expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $2.42, excluding $0.16 of estimated full year stock-based compensation. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a tax rate for the full year of 16.7%. This guidance excludes any future nonoperating FX gains and losses.

Look, I think we said for some time that what we're seeing in the marketplace is demand that's driven by two things: the cyclical pressure that our clients are facing, which drives efficiency and effectiveness; and the secular pressures that our clients are facing that require greater degrees of innovation, focus on top line growth, new business models that are increasingly globalized and virtualized. What's truly unique about what we built and what we've invested in Cognizant over many years now is the fact that we can equally address both of those sets of needs with our clients. We can help them drive efficiency and effectiveness on the cost side of the equation. But equally, when it comes to driving large-scale transformation, driving innovation for our clients drives top line growth for them, our consulting teams, our subject matter expertise, our large-scale program management, is very effective on that side of the equation. So when you put these two things together, it's the best of both worlds and some sense for our clients, because they can come to us to solve some of their cyclical challenges, the cost pressures they're facing, but they can also come to us when they need to talk about growth and driving top line. And we think that that's unique. We think that that's differentiated, and that's really the result of sustained investment over many years, as you know, in building out the capability in Cognizant."

In areas such as retail, a lot of work on data warehousing, what we refer to as know-your-customer initiatives. A fair amount of regulatory work in healthcare. But I think the important part is we saw customers spend discretionary dollars, at least with Cognizant, on more than just costs savings initiatives, more than just required regulatory thing. We also saw clients spend discretionary dollars on true innovation, and that's the part that we're really excited about that. Rebound and spending on innovation happen much more quickly than we anticipated, and that was broad-based across our industry segments."

We benefited from a number of things that all came together in the second quarter. We saw this sustained surge in discretionary projects kicking off. Candidly, the strength of that surprised us. We had seen -- we talked about this during the last call, we've started to see some of that towards the end of the first quarter and early in the second quarter, but that trend accelerated. As we said, the M&A integration stuff kicked in and the ramp, and then of course, the regulatory changes, the HIPAA 5010, ICD-10, PEG stuff all came together. All of these things all came together in the second quarter, and that's why you see the growth was very, very broad-based across geographies, industries and service offerings. As we look forward, we think that we're taking a prudent view, a cautious view. We think that some of this surge in discretionary spending, the rate at which new projects will kick off, will clearly not be where it is in the past. But based on our current view, we feel that the at least 36% guidance that we provided is reasonable. I'll ask Gordon to give you some color on the guidance."

We clearly were not expecting that, and that's being driven by a bunch of projects kicked off, there's a lot of M&A work going on. So if there was one single area that was the biggest surprise, I think it would have been Financial Services. We don't expect that sequential growth to continue that way. But obviously, what allows us to take our guidance way up for the year is, for the rest of the year, we're now working off of a new foundation for growth. So it's really the surge we had in Q2, has the follow-on impact to the full year. But as Francisco said, certainly, it was not one customer or one area, though BFS was the leader in driving the performance."

So it's not something that's unique to us, but we're being very proactive about it. We're making sure both that we hire in anticipation of attrition, and we're being very proactive in making sure that we address reason people might choose to leave. The unique differentiator we have is because of our growth rates, we can provide career opportunities that no one else can do while making the business model work. We promoted a much larger percentage of our people this year than our key competitors. Why? Because we're growing faster. Therefore, while maintaining the pyramid, more people can promote. So I think as we continue to outperform the industry, as our employees see that the strong revenue growth results in much better career opportunities for them than they can get at other places, I think that should result in us being able to address the attrition. But in the interim, because that takes a little time, we're making sure we're doing the right operational things to match the business.

As we have introduce new service offerings and increase what we think of as a circle of services that we offer to clients, every time we do that, the slice of a client's budget that we can compete for increases the pie, the overall pie increases. So our ability to drive deeper penetration into our existing client base is significantly increased. We certainly think that BPO and IT IS represent great opportunities to take back to our existing client base. Engineering and manufacturing services, obviously, apply to a more limited portion of our client base. It's obviously not relevant to the Financial Services clients, and to some extent, not relevant to healthcare, although pharmaceutical clients do, obviously, have big manufacturing operations. So we clearly expect that we will drive growth from our existing clients by taking them a new set of services. But all of this, of course, is predicated on the fact that we have very, very deep client relationships. As I mentioned in my comments, this quarter, we had this very unprecedented study done by EquaTerra where for clients in Europe they surveyed. I think it was about 2,000 clients and across 25 different providers, including the global multi-nationals and the India players. But through all of that, we were the only provider, the only provider, of these 25 providers that had no dissatisfied clients at all. And so that I think is a testament of the strength of the relationships we have in Europe and similarly across the world, which is what allows us to have the dialog with clients around deepening our relationship with these new service offerings. So clearly, that's the key part of how we'll grow going forward."

And also, it's looking more and more like the go-to-a-direct tax structure with the Corporate being at 25%, and that we'll have protection on the Special Economic Zones. If all those things happen, and I want to be really clear, it's not done yet. It's not the law yet. But if those things happen, that would probably put our tax rate somewhere between 22% and 25%."

Thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report outstanding results for the second quarter of 2010. Results, which validate our view that Cognizant has emerged from the economic downturn",1949,"Thank you, David, and good morning from London, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report outstanding results for the second quarter of 2010. Results, which validate our view that Cognizant has emerged from the economic downturn stronger than we've ever been. The strategy of reinvestment, of which we've spoken to you in the past, has created meaningful differentiation in our business model. Throughout the recession, our commitment to continued investment in our business was unwavering in winning new clients and strengthening our client-facing teams and innovative new service capabilities in our infrastructure and importantly, in hiring and developing our team. 
The second quarter's results are a testament to the soundness of that approach. During the second quarter, Cognizant reached $1.1 billion in revenue, a sequential increase of 15% and an increase of 42% year-over-year. This marks Cognizant's first quarter exceeding $1 billion. That's a milestone of which our associates are particularly proud. Our exceptional growth in the second quarter was broad-based, with nearly every sector, service and the geography, exceeding our expectations. This was largely the result of a sustained surge in new discretionary projects that kept up during the quarter. Application development revenue, which is a good indicator of discretionary projects, grew 22% sequentially and 52% on the year. During the recession, our clients under-invested in technology. As this pent-up demand has released, we've been able to capture an outside share of it. And while we are not yet hearing from clients that everything is back to normal, clients do acknowledge that prudent investment in their businesses require to remain  competitive in the face of the secular changes their industries are facing.
Growth in Q2 was further accelerated by a small set of large ongoing M&A integration projects, in which we are playing a key role, although we do expect some of those projects to wind down for us in the back half of the year. And finally, regulatory changes such as HIPAA 5010 and ICD-10 in the U.S. healthcare industry continue to drive new projects for Cognizant. As the impact of the most recent U.S. regulatory reform in the financial services and healthcare industries is still being assessed, we continue to work closely with our clients to gauge the impact of these regulatory reforms on their businesses. We expect that this will not have a significant impact on our business this year, but rather might be growth drivers for 2011 and beyond. 
Geographically, we saw solid growth return to the markets in Europe. Our results in Q2 illustrates the differentiated position that we've been able to achieve in Europe as a result of our investments. In a notable achievement this quarter, EquaTerra, our leading independent sourcing advisory firm, ranked Cognizant first in customer satisfaction out of the 25 leading service providers in Europe, across both India-based providers and global multinational players. Cognizant was the only firm out of the 25 providers assessed that had no dissatisfied clients. Furthermore, Cognizant scored the highest in seven of the eight factors contributing to customer satisfaction, on which the study focused. Our Q2 financial results reflect the high degree of customer satisfaction. 
Overall, our European revenue grew 15% sequentially, but 20% after removing the currency effects. Our U.K. practice, in particular, saw company-leading growth of 22% on a reported basis, some of which was driven by the M&A integration activity, of which I've already spoken. One of the key elements of our differentiation in Europe had been our ability to build strong local teams in their respective countries in Europe and to couple those teams very tightly with our global delivery operations in order to give clients a strong local front-end capability, including language, with the benefits of the global delivery model, the best of both worlds in some senses. In Q2, we continue to deepen our front-end capabilities in continent Europe, with the acquisition of Galileo, a boutique firm focused on testing services in the French market. We are already seeing market opportunities in France to combine the Galileo front-end with our global testing practice, which, at over 12,000 associates, stands today as one of the single largest testing organizations in the world.
As we reflect on our results for this and the past few quarters, it is clear that Cognizant is capturing an outside share of the market opportunity. We believe that this is a direct result of the differentiation that we have achieved in the business model, including our Cognizant Business Consulting team or CBC. For example, this year, our healthcare consulting team is engaged with five of our clients to assess the impact of ICD regulations on them. This has already led to our involvement in three large follow-on programs, two of which are in the remediation stage.
Our CBC front-end will continue to differentiate us from our competition. In Q2, we continued investing in CBC through the acquisition of the global program management consulting firm, PIPC. As clients continue to adjust to the secular changes in their industries, we expect that we will see larger business transformation programs. Managing these programs require the unique skill set which PIPC bring to the table. The services they offer range from managing forced M&A integration through strategic software implementations and large-scale outsourcing programs. CIBC is already enhancing our capability to drive large complex transformation projects on a global basis.
Given Q2's positive results and our outlook for 2010, we have increased our revenue guidance for 2010 to at least 36% growth or at least $4.46 billion for the year. Sequentially, we believe third quarter growth will be at least 6.3%. While increased guidance reflects optimism for the remainder of the year, there are a number of very real factors that are causing us to temper our outlook. 
First, part of the more modest growth is a result of the seasonality we traditionally see in our results. Although not as apparent during last year's recession, Q2 has historically been our strongest quarter. In addition, we continued to believe that the economic recovery is still tenuous. Despite positive messages from clients, macroeconomic indicators continue to tell a different story. A number of legislative initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide continue to create uncertainty and a mindset of risk aversion for our clients. While the European environment appears less uncertain than it did during our last earnings announcement, it is evident that recovery there will lag the U.S., particularly on the continent. Despite our strong growth in Europe during the second quarter, we expect a more tempered rate that is aligned with the messages from the macroeconomic indicators going forward.
And finally, Cognizant would take steps during the back half of the year to ensure that we prudently manage our growth. While high growth is not new to us, as we've seen it throughout our history, the rate at which growth has accelerated over these past few quarters is extraordinary. In order to maintain our strong positioning while sustaining high levels of client satisfaction, we will make sure that our resources are allocated optimally, keeping in mind the best interest of our customers and our prospects. Over the coming quarters, we intend to focus sharply on ensuring that our attrition and our attention is unwaveringly focused on clients that represent solid long-term client opportunities for the company.
With regard to our associates, we have always focused on building a team of the very best people. We believe that the Cognizant team, our access to the best talent from top universities, coupled with our unique culture and DNA, represent another aspect of differentiation for Cognizant. During the downturn, while competitors cut back or suspended hiring altogether, Cognizant continue to build strong relationships with universities and hire the exceptional talent that was available in the market. As a result of these efforts, Cognizant recently earned the top placement from a leading Indian business publication as a leading recruiter from premier technical schools and from premier business schools across industries. We think this speaks volumes, not only about the fact that Cognizant is a great place to work, but about the fact that Cognizant has the best talent for our clients. We will continue to focus on developing this incredibly talented team of people. 
As you'll notice in Q2, we were not immuned from the industry-wide problem of increased attrition. And while we fared better than most of our peers, we can do better. Our industry-leading growth provides our associates the best opportunities to build their careers. Over the next several quarters, they're going to take steps to ensure -- to step up our efforts and to ensure that these opportunities manifest themselves for our associates so that they continue to benefit from Cognizant's growth.
Before I close my remarks and I hand out to Gordon, I'd like to briefly comment on what we're seeing in the business longer term. Over the last several quarters, we've told the story of how clients are facing, not only cyclical pressures, but secular ones as well, about how a new generation of workers and consumers, the Millennials, are shifting our supply is created and how demand is manifested, and about how a new generation of business models, virtualized and globalized, are changing how a work is getting done and how a new generation of technology is changing the IT landscape. 
During Q2, amidst the surge in discretionary spending, we see proof points of this story continuing to play out. As we have shared with you several years ago, we, at Cognizant, started moving our own business to cloud platforms and social technologies via Cognizant 2.0. We've experienced significant benefits from these new approaches. We're now seeing interest from clients with this approach in their own businesses. 
In the cloud world, you're all familiar with Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service. At Cognizant, we are pioneering the delivery of business processes and service for our clients, through which we can deliver process solutions to our client in the cloud, leveraging a global workforce, which is tightly coordinated, not in a physical workspace, but in virtual workspaces, enabled by the business use of social computing. As an example, with a leading U.S.-based media firm, we are providing finance and accounting functions as a service. 
Now on the one hand, this may seem straightforward. Yet for this client, to take a well-understood process and not only make it more efficient but also more effective through the innovations introduced by a globally distributed and virtually connected team provides a clear before-and-after picture on the improvements we can deliver through a new approach to work. We're implementing this approach across industries such as insurance, media, retail and travel, addressing such process areas as vendor management, maintenance and repair operations, production management as well as finance and accounting.
Our early clients are enthused with these efforts and tell us that this approach of infusing business processes with greater degrees of collaboration and virtualization represents a new way of working. It is, in some senses, the future of work. This demonstrates the story we believe would play out and the story that we planned for is coming to fruition. More importantly for us, it demonstrates that clients seek Cognizant as a credible source to help them, credible because of the insights and capabilities we bring, and credible because this next generation of work is what we live with every day. With an employee base comprised of significant number of Millennials that work everyday as part of global virtual teams, we know what success looks like, and clients are coming to us to hear this story. 
With that, let me hand it over to Gordon before we open up the call for questions. Gordon?"

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. During the second quarter, we experienced exceptional strength in",2137,"Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. During the second quarter, we experienced exceptional strength in our Financial Services segment, which includes our Practices and Insurance, Banking and Transaction Processing. This segment grew 18.1% on a sequential basis and 41.6% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 42.6% of revenue for the quarter. The current demand within financial services continues to be fairly broad based across our client base. We are seeing continued focus on M&A integration work, as Francisco mentioned earlier, initiatives to drive cost efficiencies and operational effectiveness, projects related to regulatory compliance and risk management, and very importantly, discretionary innovation initiatives to enhance competitive positioning.
Healthcare continued its strong performance during the quarter, with 11.8% sequential growth and 38.1% growth compared to the second quarter of 2009. This segment represented 25.5% of revenues for the quarter. The sequential growth was driven largely by our healthcare insurance claims with some pickup in our Life Sciences segment over the last quarter. Demand within these clients was driven by data warehousing and analytics services to better understand and control medical costs, expansion of BPO services including claims, benefits coding and enrollment and platform-modernization initiatives.
Manufacturing, retail and logistics were also very strong during the quarter. This segment continued to build on the growth from the first quarter and from 2009, growing 17.3% sequentially and 53.4% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 18.4% of revenues for the quarter. Demand within this segment was driven by an increase in large-scale transformation and systems integration projects among our major manufacturing clients. For our retail clients, we have seen an increase in business transformation projects such as service platform development and multichannel expansion, especially in the e-commerce. In addition, we have seen an increased interest in customer segmentation initiatives. We refer to these as Know your Customer projects. Finally, this segment continues to benefit from the ramp up of clients won in the past year. 
The remaining 13.5% of our revenues came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high-tech, which grew 10% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. For the quarter, application management represented 52% of revenues and grew 34.3% year-over-year and 9.7% sequentially. Application development was 48% of revenues and grew 52.3% year-over-year and a whopping 21.7% sequentially. The strength in application development was driven in part by pent-up demand resulting from clients having under-invested in their businesses during 2008 and 2009 due to the economic uncertainty.
During the quarter, 78.6% of revenues came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.1% of total revenues, and 3.3% of revenues came from the Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. On a reported basis, Europe grew 15.3% sequentially and 44.3% year-over-year. During the second quarter, European revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $8.7 million compared to the first quarter due to the weakening of European currencies in the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, Europe grew 20.3% sequentially.
Our Q2 acquisitions at PIPC consulting and Galileo contributed approximately $6.1 million of revenue towards our Q2 results. Pricing on a sequential basis was up slightly on site and down slightly offshore. Overall, pricing was essentially flat. We continue to have success in our pricing discussions with our existing client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in.
We had gross additions of 116 new clients during the second quarter. This included 54 additions through our acquisitions at PIPC and Galileo. We closed the quarter with 662 active customers. During the quarter, a number of accounts which we consider to be strategic, increased by six. This brings our total number of strategic accounts to 155. We continue to see a trend towards newer strategic accounts, embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at a earlier stage in the relationship. 
Turning to costs. On a GAAP basis, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $641 million for the quarter, and included approximately $3.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by close to 2,900 during the quarter, and ended the quarter with over 83,100 technical staff. 
Second quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expense, was $258.2 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $10.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP operating margin was 18.6% for the quarter, and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 19.9%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. 
The average rate for the rupee was 45.5 in the second quarter of 2010 versus 45.9 in the first quarter of 2010 and 48.7 in the second quarter of last year. $135 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the second quarter. This resulted in a $9.5 million gain which was recognized in operating expenses. We currently have outstanding operating expense cash flow hedges with a notional value totaling over $2.2 billion, of which $330 million are scheduled to mature in the second half of 2010 with an average forward rate of 48.6. In addition, we have $780 million of contracts at an average rate of 48 scheduled to mature throughout 2011, as well as another $780 million at a rate of 48.1 scheduled to mature in 2012 and $330 million at a rate of 49.9 scheduled to mature in 2013.
We had $6.5 million of interest income. In addition, we had a net loss of $4.4 million of other non-operating expenses, which included $4.6 million of foreign exchange losses related to balance sheet measurements, primarily associated with the movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro, as well as certain balance sheet hedges. The remaining $200,000 in non-operating income included the mark-to-market requirements related to our Auction Rates Securities portfolio, which was liquidated at the end of the quarter. 
Our GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 17.2%, above our original expectations, due primarily to the tax impact of our foreign exchange hedges, the geographic mix of our earnings and certain discreet items related to our ongoing operations recorded in the quarter. We expect the full year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.7%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact related to our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.65 billion of cash and investments, which was up approximately $81 million from Q1. During the second quarter, operating activities generated over $135 million of cash. Financing activities generated almost $30 million of cash comprised of the proceeds of our employee equity programs and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. We spent approximately $29 million for acquisitions and $42 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million in capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction.
Based on our $933.7 million balance on June 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76.9 days, up from 76.2 days in the first quarter. The unbilled portion of our Receivables portfolio was approximately $119.5 million at the end of the second quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services, which represented approximately 70% of our unbilled AR balance. It's important to note approximately 60% of our second quarter unbilled balance was billed at the end of July.
During the second quarter, 31.3% of our revenue came from fixed bid contracts, up slightly from the first quarter. Net headcount increased by close to 3,200 people during the second quarter, of which approximately 30% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 70% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 88,700 employees globally. 
Similar to others in the industry, we experienced an increase in attrition during the second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, there is no consistent methodology in the way the industry reports attrition numbers. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurs within the quarter, both voluntary and involuntary. This number has increased sequentially to 20.7%. Much of the industry calculates turnover on a trailing 12-month basis. Calculated this way, which is consistent with the way others in the industry report attrition, our attrition was 15.6% during the quarter. It is also important to note that our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO, including employees in our training program.
We believe this pickup in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors, combined with a cash up of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009 but were able to do so due to the economy. The attrition was primarily at the junior levels. We are very focused on addressing the spike in attrition. In addition to the obvious compensation adjustments that we discussed on last quarter's calls, we're also making it very clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them. This includes implementing a record number of promotions over the last few months, which, on a percentage basis, was certainly industry-leading. 
In addition, we have redoubled our efforts on employee engagement, transparent communication, ensuring that we continue to force through the collaborative entrepreneurial culture, which our associates tells us a secret source at Cognizant, or what we simply refer to as the Cognizant DNA. Finally, we will certainly share the success of this year's performance with our employees through very strong, variable compensation payouts for the year.
Due to the strong overall industry demand, we do not expect attrition to return to normalized levels overnight, and we are planning for that in our hiring plans. Due to our aggressive hiring in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of this year, we were able to meet the starting requirements resulting from the surge in demand we experienced during the second quarter. This resulted in a significant increase in our utilization rates during the second quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 73% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program during the quarter, was approximately 82%. On-site utilization was approximately 93% for the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 6,900 unbilled people in our training program compared to 7,500 at the end of Q1. During the second quarter, utilization was higher than desired, and we plan to accelerate hiring in the back half of the year to ensure that we have the people in our pipeline to support long-term growth. 
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q3 and full year 2010. For the third quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.175 billion. For full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we've increased our guidance for revenue to at least $4.46 billion. This represents growth of at least 36%. Our guidance for the second half of the year reflects the wind down of some of the M&A integration work, which we have been doing, and the stabilization of pent-up discretionary development spend, from which we have recently benefited.
As previously mentioned, during Q2, we met our target margins. And for the remainder of the year, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q3 share count of approximately 310 million shares and a tax rate of 17%. This guidance excludes any non-operating FX gains or losses.
For the full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to at least $2.26, and we now expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $2.42, excluding $0.16 of estimated full year stock-based compensation. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a tax rate for the full year of 16.7%. This guidance excludes any future nonoperating FX gains and losses.

Look, I think we said for some time that what we're seeing in the marketplace is demand that's driven by two things: the cyclical pressure that our clients are facing, which drives efficiency and effectiveness; and the secular pressures that our clients are facing that require greater degrees of innovation, focus on top line growth, new business models that are increasingly globalized and virtualized. What's truly unique about what we built and what we've invested in Cognizant over many years now is the fact that we can equally address both of those sets of needs with our clients. We can help them drive efficiency and effectiveness on the cost side of the equation. But equally, when it comes to driving large-scale transformation, driving innovation for our clients drives top line growth for them, our consulting teams, our subject matter expertise, our large-scale program management, is very effective on that side of the equation. So when you put these two things together, it's the best of both worlds and some sense for our clients, because they can come to us to solve some of their cyclical challenges, the cost pressures they're facing, but they can also come to us when they need to talk about growth and driving top line. And we think that that's unique. We think that that's differentiated, and that's really the result of sustained investment over many years, as you know, in building out the capability in Cognizant."

In areas such as retail, a lot of work on data warehousing, what we refer to as know-your-customer initiatives. A fair amount of regulatory work in healthcare. But I think the important part is we saw customers spend discretionary dollars, at least with Cognizant, on more than just costs savings initiatives, more than just required regulatory thing. We also saw clients spend discretionary dollars on true innovation, and that's the part that we're really excited about that. Rebound and spending on innovation happen much more quickly than we anticipated, and that was broad-based across our industry segments."

So you have some offsets there. But I'm not losing a lot of sleep over maintaining our margins. The wage inflation is done for the year. I don't expect any further wage inflation this year. And as I mentioned, while the rupee had weakened, we put in place a very aggressive hedging program going out several years. So we're feeling comfortable that our exposure to negative movements on the rupee would be quite minimal to us."

As we have introduce new service offerings and increase what we think of as a circle of services that we offer to clients, every time we do that, the slice of a client's budget that we can compete for increases the pie, the overall pie increases. So our ability to drive deeper penetration into our existing client base is significantly increased. We certainly think that BPO and IT IS represent great opportunities to take back to our existing client base. Engineering and manufacturing services, obviously, apply to a more limited portion of our client base. It's obviously not relevant to the Financial Services clients, and to some extent, not relevant to healthcare, although pharmaceutical clients do, obviously, have big manufacturing operations. So we clearly expect that we will drive growth from our existing clients by taking them a new set of services. But all of this, of course, is predicated on the fact that we have very, very deep client relationships. As I mentioned in my comments, this quarter, we had this very unprecedented study done by EquaTerra where for clients in Europe they surveyed. I think it was about 2,000 clients and across 25 different providers, including the global multi-nationals and the India players. But through all of that, we were the only provider, the only provider, of these 25 providers that had no dissatisfied clients at all. And so that I think is a testament of the strength of the relationships we have in Europe and similarly across the world, which is what allows us to have the dialog with clients around deepening our relationship with these new service offerings. So clearly, that's the key part of how we'll grow going forward."

Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant. Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% year",1629,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% year-over-year. We maintained our non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our target range, and we achieved record cash flow level. For the third straight quarter, application development grew faster than application maintenance by a strong margin. Maintenance grew 6% sequentially, while development, an indicator of discretionary spending, grew 14%. Again this quarter, our growth was broad based across sectors, geographies and service offerings.
A portion of the growth in discretionary spending in the third quarter was the tail end of pent-up demand created by two years of cost-cutting and conservative spending. But we think more significantly, the overall increase in spending over the last two quarters, three quarters, is a validation of our view that our clients are dealing with more than the after effects of a cyclical downturn. As I've said on past calls, the major industry that we serve are going to fundamental secular changes. 
The secular changes that we see clients addressing are driven by three global trends that are rapidly reshaping the way forward-thinking companies operate. These trends represent three pillars upon which a new normal in some senses for companies is defined.
The first pillar is a new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. These models are pushing global talent integration to new levels in search of dramatically better efficiency and effectiveness. The second pillar is a new generation of technologies. Loosely labeled under the umbrella of cloud computing, these technologies, including Web 2.0 mobile computing and social computing and cloud computing, that are once again changing the price performance curve of technology and are redefining the range of business problems that technology can help address. And the third pillar is a new generation of workers and consumers, so-called millennials, who grew up with technology and have dramatically different expectations about the how they interact with companies both as employees and also as consumers. 
These three pillars that is new business models, new technologies and a new generation of workers and consumers form the foundation of a new Future of Work. We see clients increasingly turning to Cognizant as they make the investments necessary to adapt to these structural changes as evidenced by our strong performance over the past few quarters. This morning, I want to elaborate on these three pillars and highlight how Cognizant's heritage and investment have prepared us to help client address these challenges. Gordon will then present our detailed financial and operating results. And as always, we'll close with your questions.
So let's jump into the Future of Work. The first pillar that I spoke about is new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. And while globalization of services is not new, we see clients pushing the envelope on what activities they feel comfortable outsourcing and increasingly demanding a more variablized cost and consumption model. Traditional organizational boundaries have given way as work migrates to its right location worldwide allowing companies to leverage expertise anywhere and everywhere it resides.
Complex and Dynamic end-to-end processes that were once performed by self-contained workforce are now performed by globally distributed virtual teams that regularly include outside partners. We see this clearly from the rapid growth of new services, such as IT infrastructure services, business process outsourcing, engineering and manufacturing services and enterprise analytics. Clients are outsourcing or partnering on activities that two to three years ago stayed well within the walls of the corporation. Our ability to successfully deploy and orchestrate these new business models, a part of investments, differentiates us.
Investments in sophisticated technology, like Cognizant 2.0 or our on-target infrastructure management platform that seamlessly connect our virtual workforce with that of our clients. Our investment in large-scale program management and Pfizer capabilities, such as those our business consulting group offers with the support of our recent acquisition of PIPC, are also investment in this area.
The second pillar is the rapid growth and adoption of a new generation of technologies that are social, mobile and cloud-enabled. Consumer technologies now far surpass the capabilities found in many enterprises. The Monday morning corporate technology experience is far different from the ease and richness of communication, collaboration and connectedness experienced on Sunday night by the consumer. The technologies that have had a transformative effect on people's personal lives remain largely absent from most workplaces.
In response, we are helping our clients create a consumer-grade experience within the enterprise, which is possible with these new technologies. We offer clients a range of pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-need business models, including softwares of service and business processes of service, to help companies variablized cost and dramatically improve the end-user experience. A great example of this is our recently announced contract extension with 3M, where we've implemented a novel, new-IT-as-a-service model that gives 3M the ability to consume our services on demand.
Another example is Cognizant's proprietary platform for pharmaceutical sales force planning that we have developed and host. Based on Cognizant proprietary intellectual property, the platform allows clients to dramatically improve the effectiveness of their sales operations. We currently have commitments from several leading global pharmaceutical companies to manage thousands of sales professionals through either a software as a service or business process as a service-based model, which allows us to create completely variable, user-based pricing structures for our clients.
And finally, through deep collaborative partnerships with leading cloud providers, including firms like Microsoft Salesforce.com and Amazon, we are helping clients adopt these technologies by leveraging infrastructure as a service and platform as a service models. For example, we recently helped a leading information company develop a strategy to move their applications off their own infrastructure and into the cloud. We're now in the process of deploying the first of those applications on Amazon Easy 2, which is their cloud-computing platform of choice.
All of this brings us to the third pillar of change, which is the rise of the millennial generation. A major shift in the nature of work coincides with growing presence of consumers and employees that are millennials. People roughly between the ages of 18 and 29. This first generation of digital natives brings a mindset of collaborative problem solving shipped by high-bandwidth always-on connectivity and Web 2.0 technologies. This perspective, less related to age than behavior, is reshaping everything from recruiting and retention, to communications and innovation. 
To help clients adapt to this collaborative mindset, CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting and our customer solutions practice, have been engaging with customers to add a social layer on top of core business processes. A classic example of this is designing Social Customer Relationship Management Systems or Social CRM.  These systems incorporate public social media tools, like Facebook or Twitter, to engage customers in a two-way dialogue to influence purchasing decisions or resolve customer problems. The consult of these three unstoppable forces, coupled with a highly dynamic regulatory environment will have a profound impact on how work is conducted and how value is created, especially in the complex knowledge-intensive businesses that we serve. We call this the Future of Work, and it's no longer in the future.
Cognizant recently commissioned a survey of more than 400 senior executives who revealed that the Future of Work is not on the distant horizon, they're already embracing more global and virtualized operating models. One in three respondents said that they're already seeing or expected that collaborative virtual environments would have a measurable return on investment within a year.
We also recognized that the future of work is an ever-evolving concept. And that's why Cognizant recently announced the joint initiative with Carnegie Mellon University to establish the Future of Work Research Center. The center will study the technological and social system enablers of next-generation organization. The goal is to continue to develop ideas that will extend the use of social platforms in ways that will help advance the many systems of the world.
Let me now turn quickly to our 2010 guidance and outlook for the near future. Looking ahead for the rest of 2010, we are cautious about the macro environment and regulatory climate in key economies, but remain optimistic. Given strong Q3 performance, we've increased our revenue guidance to at least $1.27 billion for next quarter or at least $4.55 billion for the full year.
Beyond this year, we see three demand drivers over the medium term. The first is the growth of traditional outsourcing across IT business process and infrastructure. Clients continue to search for cost savings in order to fund growth and innovation in other areas. At the same time, the industry is mature to a point where the benefit from labor arbitrage is strongly complemented by the improved efficiency and effectiveness that third-party providers like Cognizant are delivering. Taken together, these two factors are stimulating companies to reconsider what is core to their business and what should be outsourced. 
The second driver is the new slate of domestic and international regulations. This is particularly prevalent in the financial services and healthcare industries, two industries where we are extremely strong. 
And the third demand driver is near-term Future of Work projects. Although the Future of Work is a long-term journey for clients, we've already started to see clients take the first steps. As I mentioned earlier, the traction over the past few quarters in new services we have invested in, like IT IS, BPO, Social CRM and so on, are evidence of this. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gordon who'll explain our financial and operating results in more detail before we move into the Q&A section. Gordon?"

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. 
During the third quarter, we continued to experience strength in our Financial Services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing. This segment grew 10.5% on a sequential basis and 42.9% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 42.8% of revenue for the quarter.
The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad based across our client base. We're seeing continued focus on initiatives to drive cost efficiencies and operational effectiveness; projects related to regulatory-compliance and risk management; discretionary innovation initiatives to enhance competitive positioning; and finally, M&A integration work, which we expected to ramp down during the quarter was extended through the latter part of 2010.
Healthcare continued its growth during the quarter with 7.4% sequential growth and 33.9% growth compared to the third quarter of 2009. This segment represented 24.9% of revenues for the quarter. We experienced similar sequential strength among both our Healthcare Insurance clients and our Life Sciences clients. Demand within these clients was driven by data warehousing and analytics services to better understand the controlled medical costs; expansion of BPO services, including clinical operations, claims benefits coding and enrollment; IDC 10 code set and 5010 assessment remediation work; and platform modernization initiatives.
Retail manufacturing logistics were once again very strong during the quarter. This segment continue to build on the growth from the first half of the year and 2009, growing 13.3% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. It represented 18.9% of revenues for the quarter. Demand within this segment was driven by an increase in large-scale transformational and system integration projects among our major manufacturing clients. For our retail clients, we've seen an increase in business transformation projects, such as service platform development, modernization of core retail systems and multichannel expansion, especially in e-commerce.
In addition, we have seen an increased interest in customer segmentation initiatives, which we refer to as Know Your Customer projects. And finally, this segment continues to benefit from the ramp-up of new strategic accounts, one in the past year.
The reigning 13.4% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high-tech, which grew 9.5% sequentially and 40.4% on a year-over-year basis. For the quarter, application management represented 50% of revenues and grew 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Application development was 50% of revenues and grew 59% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The strength in application development was driven in part by the final stages of pent-up demand resulting from clients having under-invested in their businesses during 2008 to 2009 due to the economic uncertainty.
During the quarter, 77.7% of revenue came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.9% of total revenue and 3.4% of revenue came from the Asia Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. 
On a reported basis, Europe grew by 14.7% sequentially and 39.8% year-over-year. During the third quarter, European revenue was positively impacted by approximately $6.4 million compared to the second quarter due to the strengthening of the European currencies in the quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, Europe grew 11.6% sequentially.
Pricing on a sequential basis was up 1% on-site and flat offshore. We continue to have success in our pricing discussions with our existing client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in.
We did gross additions of 87 new customers during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 697 active customers. During the quarter, the number of accounts, which we consider to be strategic, increased by five. This brings the total number of strategic clients to 160. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant's services earlier in the relationship.
Turning to cost. On a GAAP basis, cost to revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $700 million for the quarter and included approximately $2.8 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 6,400 during the quarter and ended the quarter with over 83,100 technical staff. 
Third quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expense, was $289 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $11.3 million of stock-based compensation. 
Our GAAP operating margin was 18.8% for the quarter and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 19.9% within our target range of 19% to 20%. The average rate for the rupee was 46.4 in the third quarter of 2010 versus 45.5 in the second quarter of 2010 and 48.3 in the third quarter of last year. $165 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the third quarter. This resulted in a $8.4 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses.
As of September 30, 2010, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $165 million and a weighted-average forward rate of 48.8 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in Q4 of 2010. We had $780 million at a rate of 48 scheduled to mature in 2011. And we have another $780 million at 48.1, scheduled to mature in 2012. And finally, we have $360 million at a rate of 50.1 for 2013.
We had $7 million of interest income during the quarter. In addition, we had a net gain of $7.9 million of other nonoperating expenses, which included $7.6 million of net foreign exchange gains, related to balance sheet remeasurements primarily associated with movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro and certain balance sheet hedges.
Our GAAP tax rate to the third quarter was 16.3%, slightly below our original expectations, due primarily to the favorable impact of our foreign exchange hedges in Q3 and certain discrete items, relating to our ongoing operations recorded in the quarter. We expect the full year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact related to our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with over $1.9 billion of cash and investments, up approximately $277 million from the end of the second quarter. 
During the third quarter, operating activities generated over $234 million of cash. Financing activities generated almost $62 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of our employee equity programs and related tax benefits as well as our employee stock purchase plan. We spent approximately $3 million for acquisitions and $45 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million of capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction. 
Based on our $1.06 billion balance as of September 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 80.5 days, up from 77 days in the second quarter. The quality of our receivables portfolio remains very strong. However, we're disappointed in the DSO increase during the quarter. 80-plus days like the industry, and we can do better. 
To be clear, this is not a quality of receivables issue, rather due to the strength of demand that we've seen over the past two consecutive quarters and the result in double-digit sequential growth, our client teams has been principally focused on revenue generation and business development. As a result, working with the clients to clear payments do not receive its normal level of attention. We have implemented additional processes to refocus our team on DSO and expect that the trends of increasing DSO will reverse in Q4.
The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $146 million at the end of the third quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services. Approximately 63% of the Q3 unbilled balance was billed in October, compared to 60% of our Q2 balance, which billed in August.
During the third quarter, 31.2% of our revenue came from fixed-bid contracts, essentially flat from second quarter of 2010. Net headcount increased by close to 7,000 people during the third quarter, of which approximately 53% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 47% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 95,600 employees globally.
Similar to others in the industry, we expected and experienced increased levels of attrition during the third quarter. As we've discussed in the past, there's no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition numbers. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary.  This number increased sequentially to 21.8%. Much of the industry calculates turnover on a trailing 12-month basis. Calculated this way, our attrition was 18.2% during the quarter. It is also important to note that our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. We believe this pickup in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors. Combined with the catch-up of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009 and early 2010, but were unable due to the economy. The attrition was primarily at the junior levels. We remain very focused on addressing this spike in attrition. We are making it clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them. This includes implementing a record number of promotions, including a promotion round that was completed today. 
In addition, we continue our efforts on employee engagement, transparent communication ensuring that we continue to foster a collaborative entrepreneurial culture, which our associates tell us is the secret source at Cognizant or what we simply refer to as Cognizant DNA.  
Finally, we will certainly share the success of this year's performance with our employees through a very strong, variable compensation payouts for the year. Based on the attrition data so for this quarter, we expect attrition to decline in Q4 as compared to Q3.
During the quarter, we accelerated the hiring of both recent college graduates and experienced professionals. In total, our gross additions were close to 12,000. Offshore utilization was approximately 75% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates, who were in our training program during the quarter was approximately 83%. On-site utilization was partially 92% for the quarter. At the end of Q3, we had over 7,100 unbilled people in our training program.
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q4 and full year 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.27 billion. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects our view that there will be no budget flush this year. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we've increased our guidance per revenue to at least $4.55 billion. This represents growth of approximately 39%.
As previously mentioned during the Q3, we met our margin targets. And for the remainder of the year, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we're currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.68, which excludes estimates stock-based compensation expenses of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q4 share count of approximately 311.6 million shares and a tax rate for the fourth quarter of 17%. This guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses in the fourth quarter.
For full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to $2.35 and now expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be $2.50, excluding $0.15 of estimated stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a full year tax rate of 16.5%. This guidance excludes any fourth quarter, nonoperating FX gains or losses.

If I would summarize it, what I would say is that as we've gone out there and we've looked at this and started to actually do work for our clients across the range of technologies, I think that our view is that the nature of demand is different. It's a different wave like when we saw other technology shifts in the past, we have to make sure that we retool ourselves, and we're doing that actively for the new generation of technologies that are out there. But we think that the same drivers that drove demand for customization and systems integration in the past will continue to be the case with this new breed of technologies. In the end, the new technologies need to be put to work for clients, and that requires customization. It requires implementation. It requires systems integration. And those things will be done differently, but will still need to be done, and we think that will drive demand for our services."

And we feel very confident now of having watched this trend for three or four quarters, that, that is in fact, the case. The clients are really dealing with these three big forces. There's a whole new generation of technologies that are out there, that are creating new opportunities for them that are changing the price performance curve of technology. There's a new generation of workers and consumers. The millennial generation, they are really demanding a different technology experience than a year or two or three ago. And finally, there's this new generation of highly distributed and globalized business models that clients are beginning to adopt and feel very comfortable with. All of this is driving new development, application development systems integration, what you might think of as the more discretionary side of our business. And we think those are long-term trends across the industries that we serve. Specifically in Financial Services, I think that as growth returns to that industry and more stability returns, what we're seeing is a demand that's driven by some of these Future of Work concepts. So when you think about new generation of consumers that are demanding more integrated online banking experiences, a better or more robust mobile banking experiences, and so on and so forth, you're starting to see that kind of demand. And then of course, there's a lot of technology deployment that's being driven in Financial Services as a result of the regulatory initiatives, FinReg and son on and so forth that's requiring Financial Services institutions to put in new technology around risk management and so on and so forth to be able to address the regulatory compliance issues here in the U.S. and also internationally."

Hard to say exactly how much that increase is at this point, but we do think budgets will be up. IT budgets will be up next year over 2010 levels. Within that though, I think that the trend of offshore, in general, or outsourcing more broadly, will have a greater share of that. I think it's definitely the case. We're seeing clients pushing the envelope on the traditional services in terms of looking at areas of even application outsourcing or application development that they may not have traditionally outsourced. But then there's this whole new set of services, IT Infrastructure Services, Business Process Outsourcing, Engineering and Manufacturing Services, Enterprise Analytics, that historically three or four years ago or two or three years ago even, clients would not have considered outsourcing or offshoring. Those are now viable candidates. And so, I think that you'll see the trend to offshore in capturing a greater share of the IT wallet and the IT budget, continuing strongly."

I think that these are longer-term initiatives lines. Clients are taking steps in terms of implementation. There are some deadlines out there or will be some deadlines out there, which may drive spending patterns. But in general, our view right now is that these are going to be more incremental spending over '11 and '12. In terms of how they've been funded, I think there's going to be a mix. I think that some of it clearly will clearly cannibalize dollars that clients would otherwise have spend on other things. So the business is usual dollars or the maintenance dollars might move more towards regulatory-related enhancements and fixes. But I think that there's some amount of work that needs to be done, particularly the work that's needed to drive new capabilities that will require incremental funding. We think that, that's actually a great opportunity for us because what we see is that in current situations, what clients are doing is outsourcing more of their business as usual initiatives to use the savings that they generate from offshoring and outsourcing to fund the investment that they need in new capabilities and in regulatory enhancements. So we think that overall, that's going to be a positive for us because it'll drive more work offshore to be able to fund the investment that clients need to make in these new capabilities."

I think that Indian companies in the United States account for employment of about 60,000 people in the United States.

Our view with M&A is that, for a while, we've said that our approach -- let me start with our approach. Our approach to M&A is to look at small tuck-under acquisitions that add capability in specific areas. For us, when we think about the size of Cognizant today, and we think about what our tuck-under acquisition means, our sweet spot really is probably in the $20 million to $80 million range, may be going up as big as $200 million in revenue, but really $20 million to $80 million is sort of our sweet spot of revenue for an acquisition. We like to that size of acquisition because we feel it's easier to get our arms around cultural integration is easier with those kinds of acquisitions. When it starts to get larger than that, then the risks of both acquisition become more significant. And frankly at this point, we're looking to add capabilities. We're not looking to acquire for growth. When we think about the kind of capabilities that we're looking to add, certainly the emerging service offerings is a key area. So IT Infrastructure Services, Vertical Business Process Outsourcing and then some of the new ones, like EMS and Analytics and EMS of Engineering and Manufacturing Services or Analytics, would be areas that we look at. We also would be looking at acquisitions from a geographical expansion standpoint. So we did the acquisition of Galileo some time a couple of quarters ago. In France, we'll do those kinds of acquisitions that give us specific geographic capabilities and footprints, and then potentially look at acquisitions that deepen or broaden our industry footprint. So that's really our screen and how we're looking at. In terms of the emerging services, your first question and the percent of revenue, we haven't actually broken those out in the past. But clearly, if you look at those us a portfolio of services, those are growing ahead of, in general, ahead of company average and we expect that those will continue to do so over the coming quarters.

I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% year-over-year. We maintained our non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our target range, and we achieved record cash flow level. For the third straight quarter, application development grew faster than application maintenance by a strong margin. Maintenance grew 6% sequentially, while development, an indicator of discretionary spending, grew 14%. Again this quarter, our growth was broad based across sectors, geographies and service offerings.
A portion of the growth in discretionary spending in the third quarter was the tail end of pent-up demand created by two years of cost-cutting and conservative spending. But we think more significantly, the overall increase in spending over the last two quarters, three quarters, is a validation of our view that our clients are dealing with more than the after effects of a cyclical downturn. As I've said on past calls, the major industry that we serve are going to fundamental secular changes. 
The secular changes that we see clients addressing are driven by three global trends that are rapidly reshaping the way forward-thinking companies operate. These trends represent three pillars upon which a new normal in some senses for companies is defined.
The first pillar is a new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. These models are pushing global talent integration to new levels in search of dramatically better efficiency and effectiveness. The second pillar is a new generation of technologies. Loosely labeled under the umbrella of cloud computing, these technologies, including Web 2.0 mobile computing and social computing and cloud computing, that are once again changing the price performance curve of technology and are redefining the range of business problems that technology can help address. And the third pillar is a new generation of workers and consumers, so-called millennials, who grew up with technology and have dramatically different expectations about the how they interact with companies both as employees and also as consumers. 
These three pillars that is new business models, new technologies and a new generation of workers and consumers form the foundation of a new Future of Work. We see clients increasingly turning to Cognizant as they make the investments necessary to adapt to these structural changes as evidenced by our strong performance over the past few quarters. This morning, I want to elaborate on these three pillars and highlight how Cognizant's heritage and investment have prepared us to help client address these challenges. Gordon will then present our detailed financial and operating results. And as always, we'll close with your questions.
So let's jump into the Future of Work. The first pillar that I spoke about is new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. And while globalization of services is not new, we see clients pushing the envelope on what activities they feel comfortable outsourcing and increasingly demanding a more variablized cost and consumption model. Traditional organizational boundaries have given way as work migrates to its right location worldwide allowing companies to leverage expertise anywhere and everywhere it resides.
Complex and Dynamic end-to-end processes that were once performed by self-contained workforce are now performed by globally distributed virtual teams that regularly include outside partners. We see this clearly from the rapid growth of new services, such as IT infrastructure services, business process outsourcing, engineering and manufacturing services and enterprise analytics. Clients are outsourcing or partnering on activities that two to three years ago stayed well within the walls of the corporation. Our ability to successfully deploy and orchestrate these new business models, a part of investments, differentiates us.
Investments in sophisticated technology, like Cognizant 2.0 or our on-target infrastructure management platform that seamlessly connect our virtual workforce with that of our clients. Our investment in large-scale program management and Pfizer capabilities, such as those our business consulting group offers with the support of our recent acquisition of PIPC, are also investment in this area.
The second pillar is the rapid growth and adoption of a new generation of technologies that are social, mobile and cloud-enabled. Consumer technologies now far surpass the capabilities found in many enterprises. The Monday morning corporate technology experience is far different from the ease and richness of communication, collaboration and connectedness experienced on Sunday night by the consumer. The technologies that have had a transformative effect on people's personal lives remain largely absent from most workplaces.
In response, we are helping our clients create a consumer-grade experience within the enterprise, which is possible with these new technologies. We offer clients a range of pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-need business models, including softwares of service and business processes of service, to help companies variablized cost and dramatically improve the end-user experience. A great example of this is our recently announced contract extension with 3M, where we've implemented a novel, new-IT-as-a-service model that gives 3M the ability to consume our services on demand.
Another example is Cognizant's proprietary platform for pharmaceutical sales force planning that we have developed and host. Based on Cognizant proprietary intellectual property, the platform allows clients to dramatically improve the effectiveness of their sales operations. We currently have commitments from several leading global pharmaceutical companies to manage thousands of sales professionals through either a software as a service or business process as a service-based model, which allows us to create completely variable, user-based pricing structures for our clients.
And finally, through deep collaborative partnerships with leading cloud providers, including firms like Microsoft Salesforce.com and Amazon, we are helping clients adopt these technologies by leveraging infrastructure as a service and platform as a service models. For example, we recently helped a leading information company develop a strategy to move their applications off their own infrastructure and into the cloud. We're now in the process of deploying the first of those applications on Amazon Easy 2, which is their cloud-computing platform of choice.
All of this brings us to the third pillar of change, which is the rise of the millennial generation. A major shift in the nature of work coincides with growing presence of consumers and employees that are millennials. People roughly between the ages of 18 and 29. This first generation of digital natives brings a mindset of collaborative problem solving shipped by high-bandwidth always-on connectivity and Web 2.0 technologies. This perspective, less related to age than behavior, is reshaping everything from recruiting and retention, to communications and innovation. 
To help clients adapt to this collaborative mindset, CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting and our customer solutions practice, have been engaging with customers to add a social layer on top of core business processes. A classic example of this is designing Social Customer Relationship Management Systems or Social CRM.  These systems incorporate public social media tools, like Facebook or Twitter, to engage customers in a two-way dialogue to influence purchasing decisions or resolve customer problems. The consult of these three unstoppable forces, coupled with a highly dynamic regulatory environment will have a profound impact on how work is conducted and how value is created, especially in the complex knowledge-intensive businesses that we serve. We call this the Future of Work, and it's no longer in the future.
Cognizant recently commissioned a survey of more than 400 senior executives who revealed that the Future of Work is not on the distant horizon, they're already embracing more global and virtualized operating models. One in three respondents said that they're already seeing or expected that collaborative virtual environments would have a measurable return on investment within a year.
We also recognized that the future of work is an ever-evolving concept. And that's why Cognizant recently announced the joint initiative with Carnegie Mellon University to establish the Future of Work Research Center. The center will study the technological and social system enablers of next-generation organization. The goal is to continue to develop ideas that will extend the use of social platforms in ways that will help advance the many systems of the world.
Let me now turn quickly to our 2010 guidance and outlook for the near future. Looking ahead for the rest of 2010, we are cautious about the macro environment and regulatory climate in key economies, but remain optimistic. Given strong Q3 performance, we've increased our revenue guidance to at least $1.27 billion for next quarter or at least $4.55 billion for the full year.
Beyond this year, we see three demand drivers over the medium term. The first is the growth of traditional outsourcing across IT business process and infrastructure. Clients continue to search for cost savings in order to fund growth and innovation in other areas. At the same time, the industry is mature to a point where the benefit from labor arbitrage is strongly complemented by the improved efficiency and effectiveness that third-party providers like Cognizant are delivering. Taken together, these two factors are stimulating companies to reconsider what is core to their business and what should be outsourced. 
The second driver is the new slate of domestic and international regulations. This is particularly prevalent in the financial services and healthcare industries, two industries where we are extremely strong. 
And the third demand driver is near-term Future of Work projects. Although the Future of Work is a long-term journey for clients, we've already started to see clients take the first steps. As I mentioned earlier, the traction over the past few quarters in new services we have invested in, like IT IS, BPO, Social CRM and so on, are evidence of this. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gordon who'll explain our financial and operating results in more detail before we move into the Q&A section. Gordon?

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. During the third quarter, we continued to experience strength i",2061,"Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. 
During the third quarter, we continued to experience strength in our Financial Services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing. This segment grew 10.5% on a sequential basis and 42.9% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 42.8% of revenue for the quarter.
The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad based across our client base. We're seeing continued focus on initiatives to drive cost efficiencies and operational effectiveness; projects related to regulatory-compliance and risk management; discretionary innovation initiatives to enhance competitive positioning; and finally, M&A integration work, which we expected to ramp down during the quarter was extended through the latter part of 2010.
Healthcare continued its growth during the quarter with 7.4% sequential growth and 33.9% growth compared to the third quarter of 2009. This segment represented 24.9% of revenues for the quarter. We experienced similar sequential strength among both our Healthcare Insurance clients and our Life Sciences clients. Demand within these clients was driven by data warehousing and analytics services to better understand the controlled medical costs; expansion of BPO services, including clinical operations, claims benefits coding and enrollment; IDC 10 code set and 5010 assessment remediation work; and platform modernization initiatives.
Retail manufacturing logistics were once again very strong during the quarter. This segment continue to build on the growth from the first half of the year and 2009, growing 13.3% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. It represented 18.9% of revenues for the quarter. Demand within this segment was driven by an increase in large-scale transformational and system integration projects among our major manufacturing clients. For our retail clients, we've seen an increase in business transformation projects, such as service platform development, modernization of core retail systems and multichannel expansion, especially in e-commerce.
In addition, we have seen an increased interest in customer segmentation initiatives, which we refer to as Know Your Customer projects. And finally, this segment continues to benefit from the ramp-up of new strategic accounts, one in the past year.
The reigning 13.4% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high-tech, which grew 9.5% sequentially and 40.4% on a year-over-year basis. For the quarter, application management represented 50% of revenues and grew 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Application development was 50% of revenues and grew 59% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The strength in application development was driven in part by the final stages of pent-up demand resulting from clients having under-invested in their businesses during 2008 to 2009 due to the economic uncertainty.
During the quarter, 77.7% of revenue came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.9% of total revenue and 3.4% of revenue came from the Asia Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. 
On a reported basis, Europe grew by 14.7% sequentially and 39.8% year-over-year. During the third quarter, European revenue was positively impacted by approximately $6.4 million compared to the second quarter due to the strengthening of the European currencies in the quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, Europe grew 11.6% sequentially.
Pricing on a sequential basis was up 1% on-site and flat offshore. We continue to have success in our pricing discussions with our existing client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in.
We did gross additions of 87 new customers during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 697 active customers. During the quarter, the number of accounts, which we consider to be strategic, increased by five. This brings the total number of strategic clients to 160. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant's services earlier in the relationship.
Turning to cost. On a GAAP basis, cost to revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $700 million for the quarter and included approximately $2.8 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 6,400 during the quarter and ended the quarter with over 83,100 technical staff. 
Third quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expense, was $289 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $11.3 million of stock-based compensation. 
Our GAAP operating margin was 18.8% for the quarter and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 19.9% within our target range of 19% to 20%. The average rate for the rupee was 46.4 in the third quarter of 2010 versus 45.5 in the second quarter of 2010 and 48.3 in the third quarter of last year. $165 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the third quarter. This resulted in a $8.4 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses.
As of September 30, 2010, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $165 million and a weighted-average forward rate of 48.8 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in Q4 of 2010. We had $780 million at a rate of 48 scheduled to mature in 2011. And we have another $780 million at 48.1, scheduled to mature in 2012. And finally, we have $360 million at a rate of 50.1 for 2013.
We had $7 million of interest income during the quarter. In addition, we had a net gain of $7.9 million of other nonoperating expenses, which included $7.6 million of net foreign exchange gains, related to balance sheet remeasurements primarily associated with movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro and certain balance sheet hedges.
Our GAAP tax rate to the third quarter was 16.3%, slightly below our original expectations, due primarily to the favorable impact of our foreign exchange hedges in Q3 and certain discrete items, relating to our ongoing operations recorded in the quarter. We expect the full year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact related to our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with over $1.9 billion of cash and investments, up approximately $277 million from the end of the second quarter. 
During the third quarter, operating activities generated over $234 million of cash. Financing activities generated almost $62 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of our employee equity programs and related tax benefits as well as our employee stock purchase plan. We spent approximately $3 million for acquisitions and $45 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million of capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction. 
Based on our $1.06 billion balance as of September 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 80.5 days, up from 77 days in the second quarter. The quality of our receivables portfolio remains very strong. However, we're disappointed in the DSO increase during the quarter. 80-plus days like the industry, and we can do better. 
To be clear, this is not a quality of receivables issue, rather due to the strength of demand that we've seen over the past two consecutive quarters and the result in double-digit sequential growth, our client teams has been principally focused on revenue generation and business development. As a result, working with the clients to clear payments do not receive its normal level of attention. We have implemented additional processes to refocus our team on DSO and expect that the trends of increasing DSO will reverse in Q4.
The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $146 million at the end of the third quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services. Approximately 63% of the Q3 unbilled balance was billed in October, compared to 60% of our Q2 balance, which billed in August.
During the third quarter, 31.2% of our revenue came from fixed-bid contracts, essentially flat from second quarter of 2010. Net headcount increased by close to 7,000 people during the third quarter, of which approximately 53% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 47% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 95,600 employees globally.
Similar to others in the industry, we expected and experienced increased levels of attrition during the third quarter. As we've discussed in the past, there's no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition numbers. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary.  This number increased sequentially to 21.8%. Much of the industry calculates turnover on a trailing 12-month basis. Calculated this way, our attrition was 18.2% during the quarter. It is also important to note that our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. We believe this pickup in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors. Combined with the catch-up of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009 and early 2010, but were unable due to the economy. The attrition was primarily at the junior levels. We remain very focused on addressing this spike in attrition. We are making it clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them. This includes implementing a record number of promotions, including a promotion round that was completed today. 
In addition, we continue our efforts on employee engagement, transparent communication ensuring that we continue to foster a collaborative entrepreneurial culture, which our associates tell us is the secret source at Cognizant or what we simply refer to as Cognizant DNA.  
Finally, we will certainly share the success of this year's performance with our employees through a very strong, variable compensation payouts for the year. Based on the attrition data so for this quarter, we expect attrition to decline in Q4 as compared to Q3.
During the quarter, we accelerated the hiring of both recent college graduates and experienced professionals. In total, our gross additions were close to 12,000. Offshore utilization was approximately 75% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates, who were in our training program during the quarter was approximately 83%. On-site utilization was partially 92% for the quarter. At the end of Q3, we had over 7,100 unbilled people in our training program.
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q4 and full year 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.27 billion. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects our view that there will be no budget flush this year. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we've increased our guidance per revenue to at least $4.55 billion. This represents growth of approximately 39%.
As previously mentioned during the Q3, we met our margin targets. And for the remainder of the year, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we're currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.68, which excludes estimates stock-based compensation expenses of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q4 share count of approximately 311.6 million shares and a tax rate for the fourth quarter of 17%. This guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses in the fourth quarter.
For full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to $2.35 and now expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be $2.50, excluding $0.15 of estimated stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a full year tax rate of 16.5%. This guidance excludes any fourth quarter, nonoperating FX gains or losses.
We'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator?

If I would summarize it, what I would say is that as we've gone out there and we've looked at this and started to actually do work for our clients across the range of technologies, I think that our view is that the nature of demand is different. It's a different wave like when we saw other technology shifts in the past, we have to make sure that we retool ourselves, and we're doing that actively for the new generation of technologies that are out there. But we think that the same drivers that drove demand for customization and systems integration in the past will continue to be the case with this new breed of technologies. In the end, the new technologies need to be put to work for clients, and that requires customization. It requires implementation. It requires systems integration. And those things will be done differently, but will still need to be done, and we think that will drive demand for our services.

And we feel very confident now of having watched this trend for three or four quarters, that, that is in fact, the case. The clients are really dealing with these three big forces. There's a whole new generation of technologies that are out there, that are creating new opportunities for them that are changing the price performance curve of technology. There's a new generation of workers and consumers. The millennial generation, they are really demanding a different technology experience than a year or two or three ago. And finally, there's this new generation of highly distributed and globalized business models that clients are beginning to adopt and feel very comfortable with. All of this is driving new development, application development systems integration, what you might think of as the more discretionary side of our business. And we think those are long-term trends across the industries that we serve. Specifically in Financial Services, I think that as growth returns to that industry and more stability returns, what we're seeing is a demand that's driven by some of these Future of Work concepts. So when you think about new generation of consumers that are demanding more integrated online banking experiences, a better or more robust mobile banking experiences, and so on and so forth, you're starting to see that kind of demand. And then of course, there's a lot of technology deployment that's being driven in Financial Services as a result of the regulatory initiatives, FinReg and son on and so forth that's requiring Financial Services institutions to put in new technology around risk management and so on and so forth to be able to address the regulatory compliance issues here in the U.S. and also internationally.

Look, I think that it's still early in the budget cycle. Let me say a couple of things about budget. First of all, this year, we're seeing the timing of budgets have gone back to being what I would call, a more normal cycle. So we expect that our clients will finalize budgets as they have in more normal times at the latest during the middle of the first quarter of next year. So with that schedule in mind, it's important to know that we're still relatively early in most clients' budget cycles. But based on what we've seen so far in the early conversations we're having, as Gordon pointed out earlier, we do think that budgets for next year will have their -- their indications are that budgets are poised for a slight increase next year. Hard to say exactly how much that increase is at this point, but we do think budgets will be up. IT budgets will be up next year over 2010 levels. Within that though, I think that the trend of offshore, in general, or outsourcing more broadly, will have a greater share of that. I think it's definitely the case. We're seeing clients pushing the envelope on the traditional services in terms of looking at areas of even application outsourcing or application development that they may not have traditionally outsourced. But then there's this whole new set of services, IT Infrastructure Services, Business Process Outsourcing, Engineering and Manufacturing Services, Enterprise Analytics, that historically three or four years ago or two or three years ago even, clients would not have considered outsourcing or offshoring. Those are now viable candidates. And so, I think that you'll see the trend to offshore in capturing a greater share of the IT wallet and the IT budget, continuing strongly.

I think that some of it clearly will clearly cannibalize dollars that clients would otherwise have spend on other things. So the business is usual dollars or the maintenance dollars might move more towards regulatory-related enhancements and fixes. But I think that there's some amount of work that needs to be done, particularly the work that's needed to drive new capabilities that will require incremental funding. We think that, that's actually a great opportunity for us because what we see is that in current situations, what clients are doing is outsourcing more of their business as usual initiatives to use the savings that they generate from offshoring and outsourcing to fund the investment that they need in new capabilities and in regulatory enhancements. So we think that overall, that's going to be a positive for us because it'll drive more work offshore to be able to fund the investment that clients need to make in these new capabilities.

But look, we're on the eve of President Obama's trip to India. And I think that there's been some statements, some briefings out of the White House, which have in preparation for his trip, which I think have put the issue in perspective. I think that the India-U.S. relationship is a very strong bilateral relationship, which outsourcing is one piece. But as you may know, exports of U.S. production to India have grown dramatically over the last few years, I think now accounting for something like $27 billion to $30 billion a year. I think that Indian companies in the United States account for employment of about 60,000 people in the United States. And so, I think that there's a broad recognition that the India-U.S. relationship needs to be a strong bilateral one based on trade going in both directions. I think that's going to be a big part of the discussion that happens when President Obama visits India in a few days here. And I think that that's context in which we believe the outsourcing discussion needs to be had, which is flow of goods and services in both directions.

Our view with M&A is that, for a while, we've said that our approach -- let me start with our approach. Our approach to M&A is to look at small tuck-under acquisitions that add capability in specific areas. For us, when we think about the size of Cognizant today, and we think about what our tuck-under acquisition means, our sweet spot really is probably in the $20 million to $80 million range, may be going up as big as $200 million in revenue, but really $20 million to $80 million is sort of our sweet spot of revenue for an acquisition. We like to that size of acquisition because we feel it's easier to get our arms around cultural integration is easier with those kinds of acquisitions. When it starts to get larger than that, then the risks of both acquisition become more significant. And frankly at this point, we're looking to add capabilities. We're not looking to acquire for growth. When we think about the kind of capabilities that we're looking to add, certainly the emerging service offerings is a key area. So IT Infrastructure Services, Vertical Business Process Outsourcing and then some of the new ones, like EMS and Analytics and EMS of Engineering and Manufacturing Services or Analytics, would be areas that we look at. We also would be looking at acquisitions from a geographical expansion standpoint. So we did the acquisition of Galileo some time a couple of quarters ago. In France, we'll do those kinds of acquisitions that give us specific geographic capabilities and footprints, and then potentially look at acquisitions that deepen or broaden our industry footprint. So that's really our screen and how we're looking at. In terms of the emerging services, your first question and the percent of revenue, we haven't actually broken those out in the past. But clearly, if you look at those us a portfolio of services, those are growing ahead of, in general, ahead of company average and we expect that those will continue to do so over the coming quarters. Although, some of that is because they're off a smaller base at this point.

Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant. Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% year",1627,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% year-over-year. We maintained our non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our target range, and we achieved a record cash flow level. For the third straight quarter, application development grew faster than application maintenance by a strong margin. Maintenance grew 6% sequentially, while development, an indicator of discretionary spending, grew 14%. Again this quarter, our growth was broad based across sectors, geographies and service offerings.
A portion of the growth in discretionary spending in the third quarter was the tail end of pent-up demand created by two years of cost-cutting and conservative spending. But we think more significantly, the overall increase in spending over the last  three quarters is a validation of our view that our clients are dealing with more than the aftereffects of a cyclical downturn. As I've said on past calls, the major industries that we serve are going to fundamental secular changes. 
The secular changes that we see clients addressing are driven by three global trends that are rapidly reshaping the way forward-thinking companies operate. These trends represent three pillars upon which a new normal in some senses for companies is defined.
The first pillar is a new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. These models are pushing global talent integration to new levels in search of dramatically better efficiency and effectiveness. The second pillar is a new generation of technologies. Loosely labeled under the umbrella of cloud computing, these technologies, including Web 2.0 mobile computing and social computing and cloud computing, that are once again changing the price performance curve of technology and are redefining the range of business problems that technology can help address. And the third pillar is a new generation of workers and consumers, so-called millennials, who grew up with technology and have dramatically different expectations about the how they interact with companies both as employees and also as consumers. 
These three pillars, that is new business models, new technologies and a new generation of workers and consumers form the foundation of a new Future of Work. We see clients increasingly turning to Cognizant as they make the investments necessary to adapt to these structural changes as evidenced by our strong performance over the past few quarters. This morning, I want to elaborate on these three pillars and highlight how Cognizant's heritage and investments have prepared us to help client address these challenges. Gordon will then present our detailed financial and operating results. And as always, we'll close with your questions.
So let's jump into the Future of Work. The first pillar that I spoke about is new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. And while globalization of services is not new, we see clients pushing the envelope on what activities they feel comfortable outsourcing and increasingly demanding a more variablized cost and consumption model. Traditional organizational boundaries have given way as work migrates to its right location worldwide, allowing companies to leverage expertise anywhere and everywhere it resides.
Complex and dynamic end-to-end processes that were once performed by self-contained workforce are now performed by globally distributed virtual teams that regularly include outside partners. We see this clearly from the rapid growth of new services, such as IT infrastructure services, business process outsourcing, engineering and manufacturing services and enterprise analytics. Clients are outsourcing or partnering on activities that two to three years ago stayed well within the walls of the corporation. Our ability to successfully deploy and orchestrate these new business models, a product of our investments, differentiates us.
Investments in sophisticated technology, like Cognizant 2.0 or our on-target infrastructure management platform that seamlessly connect our virtual workforce with that of our clients. Our investment in large-scale program management advisory capabilities, such as those our business consulting group offers with the support of our recent acquisition of PIPC, are also investments in this area.
The second pillar is the rapid growth and adoption of a new generation of technologies that are social, mobile and cloud-enabled. Consumer technologies now far surpass the capabilities found in many enterprises. The Monday morning corporate technology experience is far different from the ease and richness of communication, collaboration and connectedness experienced on Sunday night by the consumer. The technologies that have had a transformative effect on peoples' personal lives remain largely absent from most workplaces.
In response, we are helping our clients create a consumer-grade experience within the enterprise, which is possible with these new technologies. We offer clients a range of pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-need business models, including Software-as-a-Service and Business Processes as a Service, to help companies variablize costs and dramatically improve the end-user experience. A great example of this is our recently announced contract extension with 3M, where we've implemented a novel, new IT as a service model that gives 3M the ability to consume our services on demand.
Another example is Cognizant's proprietary platform for pharmaceutical sales force planning that we have developed and host. Based on Cognizant proprietary intellectual property, the platform allows clients to dramatically improve the effectiveness of their sales operations. We currently have commitments from several leading global pharmaceutical companies to manage thousands of sales professionals through either a Software-as-a-Service or Business Process as a Service based model, which allows us to create completely variable, user-based pricing structures for our clients.
And finally, through deep collaborative partnerships with leading cloud providers, including firms like Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Amazon, we are helping clients adopt these technologies by leveraging Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service models. For example, we recently helped a leading information company develop a strategy to move their applications off their own infrastructure and into the cloud. We're now in the process of deploying the first of those applications on Amazon Easy-to, which is their cloud-computing platform of choice.
All of this brings us to the third pillar of change, which is the rise of the millennial generation. A major shift in the nature of work coincides with growing presence of consumers and employees that are millennials, people roughly between the ages of 18 and 29. This first generation of digital natives brings a mindset of collaborative problem solving shaped by high-bandwidth, always-on connectivity and Web 2.0 technologies. This perspective, less related to age than behavior, is reshaping everything from recruiting and retention, to communications and innovation. 
To help clients adapt to this collaborative mindset, CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting and our customer solutions practice, have been engaging with customers to add a social layer on top of core business processes. A classic example of this is designing Social Customer Relationship Management Systems or Social CRM.  These systems incorporate public social media tools, like Facebook or Twitter, to engage customers in a two-way dialogue to influence purchasing decisions or resolve customer problems. The confluence of these three unstoppable forces, coupled with a highly dynamic regulatory environment will have a profound impact on how work is conducted and how value is created, especially in the complex knowledge-intensive businesses that we serve. We call this the Future of Work, and it's no longer in the future.
Cognizant recently commissioned a survey of more than 400 senior executives who revealed that the Future of Work is not on the distant horizon, they're already embracing more global and virtualized operating models. One in three respondents said that they're already seeing or expected that collaborative virtual environments would have a measurable return on investment within a year.
We also recognize that the Future of Work is an ever-evolving concept. And that's why Cognizant recently announced the joint initiative with Carnegie Mellon University to establish the Future of Work research center. The center will study the technological and social system enablers of next-generation organization. The goal is to continue to develop ideas that will extend the use of social platforms in ways that will help advance the many systems of the world.
Let me now turn quickly to our 2010 guidance and outlook for the near future. Looking ahead for the rest of 2010, we are cautious about the macro environment and regulatory climate in key economies, but remain optimistic. Given strong Q3 performance, we've increased our revenue guidance to at least $1.27 billion for next quarter or at least $4.55 billion for the full year.
Beyond this year, we see three demand drivers over the medium term. The first is the growth of traditional outsourcing across IT business process and infrastructure. Clients continue to search for cost savings in order to fund growth and innovation in other areas. At the same time, the industry has matured to a point where the benefit from labor arbitrage is strongly complemented by the improved efficiency and effectiveness that third-party providers like Cognizant are delivering. Taken together, these two factors are stimulating companies to reconsider what is core to their business and what should be outsourced. 
The second driver is the new slate of domestic and international regulations. This is particularly prevalent in the financial services and healthcare industries, two industries where we are extremely strong. 
And the third demand driver is near-term Future of Work projects. Although the Future of Work is a long-term journey for clients, we've already started to see clients take the first steps. As I mentioned earlier, the traction over the past few quarters in new services we have invested in, like IT IS, BPO, Social CRM and so on, are evidence of this. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gordon who'll explain our financial and operating results in more detail before we move into the Q&A section. Gordon?"

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand.

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. 
During the third quarter, we continued to experience strength in our Financial Services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing. This segment grew 10.5% on a sequential basis and 42.9% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 42.8% of revenue for the quarter.
The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad based across our client base. We're seeing continued focus on initiatives to drive cost efficiencies and operational effectiveness; projects related to regulatory compliance and risk management; discretionary innovation initiatives to enhance competitive positioning; and finally, M&A integration work, which we expected to ramp down during the quarter was extended through the latter part of 2010.
Healthcare continued its growth during the quarter with 7.4% sequential growth and 33.9% growth compared to the third quarter of 2009. This segment represented 24.9% of revenues for the quarter. We experienced similar sequential strength among both our Healthcare Insurance clients and our Life Sciences clients. Demand within these clients was driven by data warehousing and analytics services to better understand the controlled medical costs; expansion of BPO services, including clinical operations, claims, benefits coding and enrollment; ICD-10 code set and 5010 assessment remediation work; and platform modernization initiatives.
Retail manufacturing logistics were once again very strong during the quarter. This segment continued to build on the growth from the first half of the year and 2009, growing 13.3% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. It represented 18.9% of revenues for the quarter. Demand within this segment was driven by an increase in large-scale transformational and system integration projects among our major manufacturing clients. For our retail clients, we've seen an increase in business transformation projects, such as service platform development, modernization of core retail systems and multichannel expansion, especially in e-commerce.
In addition, we have seen an increased interest in customer segmentation initiatives, which we refer to as Know Your Customer projects. And finally, this segment continues to benefit from the ramp-up of new strategic accounts won in the past year.
The remaining 13.4% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high-tech, which grew 9.5% sequentially and 40.4% on a year-over-year basis. For the quarter, application management represented 50% of revenues and grew 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Application development was 50% of revenues and grew 59% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The strength in application development was driven in part by the final stages of pent-up demand resulting from clients having under-invested in their businesses during 2008 to 2009 due to the economic uncertainty.
During the quarter, 77.7% of revenue came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.9% of total revenue and 3.4% of revenue came from the Asia Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. 
On a reported basis, Europe grew by 14.7% sequentially and 39.8% year-over-year. During the third quarter, European revenue was positively impacted by approximately $6.4 million compared to the second quarter due to the strengthening of the European currencies in the quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, Europe grew 11.6% sequentially.
Pricing on a sequential basis was up 1% on-site and flat offshore. We continue to have success in our pricing discussions with our existing client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in.
We did gross additions of 87 new customers during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 697 active customers. During the quarter, the number of accounts, which we consider to be strategic, increased by five. This brings the total number of strategic clients to 160. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant's services earlier in the relationship.
Turning to cost. On a GAAP basis, cost to revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $700 million for the quarter and included approximately $2.8 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 6,400 during the quarter and ended the quarter with over 83,100 technical staff. 
Third quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expense, was $289 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $11.3 million of stock-based compensation. 
Our GAAP operating margin was 18.8% for the quarter and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 19.9% within our target range of 19% to 20%. The average rate for the rupee was 46.4 in the third quarter of 2010 versus 45.5 in the second quarter of 2010 and 48.3 in the third quarter of last year. $165 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the third quarter. This resulted in a $8.4 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses.
As of September 30, 2010, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $165 million and a weighted-average forward rate of 48.8 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in Q4 of 2010. We have $780 million at a rate of 48 scheduled to mature in 2011. And we have another $780 million at 48.1, scheduled to mature in 2012. And finally, we have $360 million at a rate of 50.1 for 2013.
We had $7 million of interest income during the quarter. In addition, we had a net gain of $7.9 million of other non-operating expenses, which included $7.6 million of net foreign exchange gains, related to balance sheet remeasurements primarily associated with movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro and certain balance sheet hedges.
Our GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 16.3%, slightly below our original expectations, due primarily to the favorable impact of our foreign exchange hedges in Q3 and certain discrete items relating to our ongoing operations recorded in the quarter. We expect the full year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact related to our foreign exchange hedge program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with over $1.9 billion of cash and investments, up approximately $277 million from the end of the second quarter. 
During the third quarter, operating activities generated over $234 million of cash. Financing activities generated almost $62 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of our employee equity programs and related tax benefits as well as our employee stock purchase plan. We spent approximately $3 million for acquisitions and $45 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million in capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction. 
Based on our $1.06 billion balance as of September 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 80.5 days, up from 77 days in the second quarter. The quality of our receivables portfolio remains very strong. However, we're disappointed in the DSO increase during the quarter. 80-plus days lags the industry, and we can do better. 
To be clear, this is not a quality of receivables issue, rather due to the strength of demand that we've seen over the past two consecutive quarters and the resulting double-digit sequential growth, our client teams have been principally focused on revenue generation and business development. As a result, working with clients to clear payments did not receive its normal level of attention. We have implemented additional processes to refocus our team on DSO and expect that the trend of increasing DSO will reverse in Q4.
The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $146 million at the end of the third quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services. Approximately 63% of the Q3 unbilled balance was billed in October, compared to 60% of our Q2 balance, which billed in August.
During the third quarter, 31.2% of our revenue came from fixed-bid contracts, essentially flat from second quarter of 2010. Net headcount increased by close to 7,000 people during the third quarter, of which approximately 53% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 47% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 95,600 employees globally.
Similar to others in the industry, we expected and experienced increased levels of attrition during the third quarter. As we've discussed in the past, there's no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition numbers. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary.  This number increased sequentially to 21.8%. Much of the industry calculates turnover on a trailing 12-month basis. Calculated this way, our attrition was 18.2% during the quarter. It is also important to note that our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. We believe this pickup in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors. Combined with the catch-up of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009 and early 2010, but were unable due to the economy. The attrition was primarily at the junior levels. We remain very focused on addressing this spike in attrition. We are making it clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them. This includes implementing a record number of promotions, including a promotion round that was completed today. 
In addition, we continue our efforts on employee engagement, transparent communication ensuring that we continue to foster a collaborative entrepreneurial culture, which our associates tell us is the secret sauce at Cognizant or what we simply refer to as Cognizant DNA.  
Finally, we will certainly share the success of this year's performance with our employees through very strong variable compensation payouts for the year. Based on the attrition data so for this quarter, we expect attrition to decline in Q4 as compared to Q3.
During the quarter, we accelerated the hiring of both recent college graduates and experienced professionals. In total, our gross additions were close to 12,000. Offshore utilization was approximately 75% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program during the quarter was approximately 83%. On-site utilization was approximately 92% for the quarter. At the end of Q3, we had over 7,100 unbilled people in our training program.
I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q4 and full year 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.27 billion. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects our view that there will be no budget flush this year. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we've increased our guidance for revenue to at least $4.55 billion. This represents growth of approximately 39%.
As previously mentioned during the Q3, we met our margin targets. And for the remainder of the year, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we're currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.68, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expenses of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q4 share count of approximately 311.6 million shares and a tax rate for the fourth quarter of 17%. This guidance excludes any non-operating FX gains or losses in the fourth quarter.
For full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to $2.35 and now expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be $2.50, excluding $0.15 of estimated stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a full year tax rate of 16.5%. This guidance excludes any fourth quarter, non-operating FX gains or losses.

If I would summarize it, what I would say is that as we've gone out there and we've looked at this and started to actually do work for our clients across the range of technologies, I think that our view is that the nature of demand is different. It's a different wave like when we saw other technology shifts in the past, we have to make sure that we retool ourselves, and we're doing that actively for the new generation of technologies that are out there. But we think that the same drivers that drove demand for customization and systems integration in the past will continue to be the case with this new breed of technologies. In the end, the new technologies need to be put to work for clients, and that requires customization. It requires implementation. It requires systems integration. And those things will be done differently, but will still need to be done, and we think that will drive demand for our services."

And we feel very confident now, having watched this trend for three or four quarters, that, that is in fact, the case. The clients are really dealing with these three big forces. There's a whole new generation of technologies that are out there, that are creating new opportunities for them that are changing the price performance curve of technology. There's a new generation of workers and consumers, the millennial generation, that are really demanding a different technology experience than a year or two or three ago. And finally, there's this new generation of highly distributed and globalized business models that clients are beginning to adopt and feel very comfortable with. All of this is driving new development, application development, systems integration, what you might think of as the more discretionary side of our business. And we think those are long-term trends across the industries that we serve. Specifically in Financial Services, I think that as growth returns to that industry and more stability returns, what we're seeing is demand that's driven by some of these Future of Work concepts. So when you think about a new generation of consumers that are demanding more integrated online banking experiences, a better, more robust mobile banking experience, and so on and so forth, you're starting to see that kind of demand. And then of course, there's a lot of technology deployment that's being driven in Financial Services as a result of the regulatory initiatives, FinReg and so on and so forth that's requiring Financial Services institutions to put in new technology around risk management and so on and so forth to be able to address the regulatory compliance issues here in the U.S. and also internationally."

And other than -- obviously, we do -- people get promoted in the fourth quarter, get a salary increase. But besides that, there is no additional wage increases. So we had a one-time cycle this year, which I believe, pretty much everyone else in the industry has done. And I think people have largely been fairly disciplined on wage inflation. Certainly it was up from 2009. We would expect to do our next wage increase during the second quarter of 2011. So we expect to continue on an annual cycle. A little too early to know how big it'll be next year and a lot of that will depend on what the competition does. Today's competition has been very disciplined in wages because I think everyone understands that it's not possible to gain competitive advantage on wages."

Look, I think that it's still early in the budget cycle. Let me say a couple of things about budget. First of all, this year, we're seeing the timing of budgets has gone back to being what I would call, a more normal cycle. So we expect that our clients will finalize budgets as they have in more normal times at the latest during the middle of the first quarter of next year. So with that schedule in mind, it's important to know that we're still relatively early in most clients' budget cycles. But based on what we've seen so far in the early conversations we're having, as Gordon pointed out earlier, we do think that budgets for next year will have -- indications are that budgets are poised for a slight increase next year. Hard to say exactly how much that increase is at this point, but we do think budgets will be up, IT budgets will be up next year over 2010 levels. Within that though, I think that the trend of offshore, in general, or outsourcing more broadly, will have a greater share of that, I think is definitely the case. We're seeing clients pushing the envelope on the traditional services in terms of looking at areas of even application outsourcing or application development that they may not have traditionally outsourced. But then there's this whole new set of services, IT Infrastructure Services, Business Process Outsourcing, Engineering and Manufacturing Services, Enterprise Analytics, that historically three or four years ago or two or three years ago even, clients would not have considered outsourcing or offshoring. Those are now viable candidates. And so, I think that you'll see the trend to offshoring capturing a greater share of the IT wallet and the IT budget, continuing strongly."

And our sense right now is that there isn't a lot of -- budget flush tends to happen when clients have a little bit of extra money at the end of the year in their budgets and they want to get it used in the fiscal or the calendar year.

I think that some of it clearly will clearly cannibalize dollars that clients would otherwise have spent on other things. So the business as usual dollars or the maintenance dollars might move more towards regulatory-related enhancements and fixes. But I think that there's some amount of work that needs to be done, particularly the work that's needed to drive new capabilities that will require incremental funding. We think that, that's actually a great opportunity for us because what we see is that in crunch situations, what clients are doing is outsourcing more of their business as usual initiatives to use the savings that they generate from offshoring and outsourcing to fund the investment that they need in new capabilities and in regulatory enhancements. So we think that overall, that's going to be a positive for us because it'll drive more work offshore to be able to fund the investment that clients need to make in these new capabilities."

Our view with M&A is that, for a while, we've said that our approach -- let me start with our approach. Our approach to M&A is to look at small tuck-under acquisitions that add capability in specific areas. For us, when we think about the size of Cognizant today, and we think about what a tuck-under acquisition means, our sweet spot really is probably in the $20 million to $80 million range, maybe going up as big as $200 million in revenue, but really $20 million to $80 million is sort of our sweet spot of revenue for an acquisition. We like that size of acquisition because we feel it's easier to get our arms around, cultural integration is easier with those kinds of acquisitions. When it starts to get larger than that, then the risks of those acquisitions become more significant. And frankly at this point, we're looking to add capabilities. We're not looking to acquire for growth. When we think about the kinds of capabilities that we're looking to add, certainly the emerging service offerings is a key area. So IT Infrastructure Services, Vertical Business Process Outsourcing and then some of the new ones, like EMS and Analytics and EMS of Engineering and Manufacturing Services or Analytics, would be areas that we look at. We also would be looking at acquisitions from a geographical expansion standpoint. So we did the acquisition of Galileo sometime a couple of quarters ago in France. We'll do those kinds of acquisitions that give us specific geographic capabilities and footprints, and then potentially look at acquisitions that deepen or broaden our industry footprint. So that's really our screen and how we're looking at. In terms of the emerging services, your first question and the percent of revenue, we haven't actually broken those out in the past. But clearly, if you look at those us a portfolio of services, those are growing ahead of, in general, ahead of company average and we expect that those will continue to do so over the coming quarters.

Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant. Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% yea",1629," Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Q3 was another strong quarter performance for Cognizant.
 Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, a sequential increase of 10% and an increase of 43% year-over-year. We maintained our non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our target range, and we achieved record cash flow level. For the third straight quarter, application development grew faster than application maintenance by a strong margin. Maintenance grew 6% sequentially, while development, an indicator of discretionary spending, grew 14%. Again this quarter, our growth was broad based across sectors, geographies and service offerings.
 A portion of the growth in discretionary spending in the third quarter was the tail end of pent-up demand created by two years of cost-cutting and conservative spending. But we think more significantly, the overall increase in spending over the last two quarters, three quarters, is a validation of our view that our clients are dealing with more than the after effects of a cyclical downturn. As I've said on past calls, the major industry that we serve are going to fundamental secular changes.
 The secular changes that we see clients addressing are driven by three global trends that are rapidly reshaping the way forward-thinking companies operate. These trends represent three pillars upon which a new normal in some senses for companies is defined.
 The first pillar is a new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. These models are pushing global talent integration to new levels in search of dramatically better efficiency and effectiveness. The second pillar is a new generation of technologies. Loosely labeled under the umbrella of cloud computing, these technologies, including Web 2.0 mobile computing and social computing and cloud computing, that are once again changing the price performance curve of technology and are redefining the range of business problems that technology can help address. And the third pillar is a new generation of workers and consumers, so-called millennials, who grew up with technology and have dramatically different expectations about the how they interact with companies both as employees and also as consumers.
 These three pillars that is new business models, new technologies and a new generation of workers and consumers form the foundation of a new Future of Work. We see clients increasingly turning to Cognizant as they make the investments necessary to adapt to these structural changes as evidenced by our strong performance over the past few quarters. This morning, I want to elaborate on these three pillars and highlight how Cognizant's heritage and investment have prepared us to help client address these challenges. Gordon will then present our detailed financial and operating results. And as always, we'll close with your questions.
 So let's jump into the Future of Work. The first pillar that I spoke about is new generation of highly distributed and virtualized business models. And while globalization of services is not new, we see clients pushing the envelope on what activities they feel comfortable outsourcing and increasingly demanding a more variablized cost and consumption model. Traditional organizational boundaries have given way as work migrates to its right location worldwide allowing companies to leverage expertise anywhere and everywhere it resides.
 Complex and Dynamic end-to-end processes that were once performed by self-contained workforce are now performed by globally distributed virtual teams that regularly include outside partners. We see this clearly from the rapid growth of new services, such as IT infrastructure services, business process outsourcing, engineering and manufacturing services and enterprise analytics. Clients are outsourcing or partnering on activities that two to three years ago stayed well within the walls of the corporation. Our ability to successfully deploy and orchestrate these new business models, a part of investments, differentiates us.
 Investments in sophisticated technology, like Cognizant 2.0 or our on-target infrastructure management platform that seamlessly connect our virtual workforce with that of our clients. Our investment in large-scale program management and Pfizer capabilities, such as those our business consulting group offers with the support of our recent acquisition of PIPC, are also investment in this area.
 The second pillar is the rapid growth and adoption of a new generation of technologies that are social, mobile and cloud-enabled. Consumer technologies now far surpass the capabilities found in many enterprises. The Monday morning corporate technology experience is far different from the ease and richness of communication, collaboration and connectedness experienced on Sunday night by the consumer. The technologies that have had a transformative effect on people's personal lives remain largely absent from most workplaces.
 In response, we are helping our clients create a consumer-grade experience within the enterprise, which is possible with these new technologies. We offer clients a range of pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-need business models, including softwares of service and business processes of service, to help companies variablized cost and dramatically improve the end-user experience. A great example of this is our recently announced contract extension with 3M, where we've implemented a novel, new-IT-as-a-service model that gives 3M the ability to consume our services on demand.
 Another example is Cognizant's proprietary platform for pharmaceutical sales force planning that we have developed and host. Based on Cognizant proprietary intellectual property, the platform allows clients to dramatically improve the effectiveness of their sales operations. We currently have commitments from several leading global pharmaceutical companies to manage thousands of sales professionals through either a software as a service or business process as a service-based model, which allows us to create completely variable, user-based pricing structures for our clients.
 And finally, through deep collaborative partnerships with leading cloud providers, including firms like Microsoft Salesforce.com and Amazon, we are helping clients adopt these technologies by leveraging infrastructure as a service and platform as a service models. For example, we recently helped a leading information company develop a strategy to move their applications off their own infrastructure and into the cloud. We're now in the process of deploying the first of those applications on Amazon Easy 2, which is their cloud-computing platform of choice.
 All of this brings us to the third pillar of change, which is the rise of the millennial generation. A major shift in the nature of work coincides with growing presence of consumers and employees that are millennials. People roughly between the ages of 18 and 29. This first generation of digital natives brings a mindset of collaborative problem solving shipped by high-bandwidth always-on connectivity and Web 2.0 technologies. This perspective, less related to age than behavior, is reshaping everything from recruiting and retention, to communications and innovation.
 To help clients adapt to this collaborative mindset, CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting and our customer solutions practice, have been engaging with customers to add a social layer on top of core business processes. A classic example of this is designing Social Customer Relationship Management Systems or Social CRM.  These systems incorporate public social media tools, like Facebook or Twitter, to engage customers in a two-way dialogue to influence purchasing decisions or resolve customer problems. The consult of these three unstoppable forces, coupled with a highly dynamic regulatory environment will have a profound impact on how work is conducted and how value is created, especially in the complex knowledge-intensive businesses that we serve. We call this the Future of Work, and it's no longer in the future.
 Cognizant recently commissioned a survey of more than 400 senior executives who revealed that the Future of Work is not on the distant horizon, they're already embracing more global and virtualized operating models. One in three respondents said that they're already seeing or expected that collaborative virtual environments would have a measurable return on investment within a year.
 We also recognized that the future of work is an ever-evolving concept. And that's why Cognizant recently announced the joint initiative with Carnegie Mellon University to establish the Future of Work Research Center. The center will study the technological and social system enablers of next-generation organization. The goal is to continue to develop ideas that will extend the use of social platforms in ways that will help advance the many systems of the world.
 Let me now turn quickly to our 2010 guidance and outlook for the near future. Looking ahead for the rest of 2010, we are cautious about the macro environment and regulatory climate in key economies, but remain optimistic. Given strong Q3 performance, we've increased our revenue guidance to at least $1.27 billion for next quarter or at least $4.55 billion for the full year.
 Beyond this year, we see three demand drivers over the medium term. The first is the growth of traditional outsourcing across IT business process and infrastructure. Clients continue to search for cost savings in order to fund growth and innovation in other areas. At the same time, the industry is mature to a point where the benefit from labor arbitrage is strongly complemented by the improved efficiency and effectiveness that third-party providers like Cognizant are delivering. Taken together, these two factors are stimulating companies to reconsider what is core to their business and what should be outsourced.
 The second driver is the new slate of domestic and international regulations. This is particularly prevalent in the financial services and healthcare industries, two industries where we are extremely strong.
 And the third demand driver is near-term Future of Work projects. Although the Future of Work is a long-term journey for clients, we've already started to see clients take the first steps. As I mentioned earlier, the traction over the past few quarters in new services we have invested in, like IT IS, BPO, Social CRM and so on, are evidence of this.
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gordon who'll explain our financial and operating results in more detail before we move into the Q&A section. Gordon?

As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand. During the third quarter, we continued to experience strength",2061," Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. As Francisco mentioned, our strong revenue performance is broad based with all of our major industry segments experiencing strong demand.
 During the third quarter, we continued to experience strength in our Financial Services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing. This segment grew 10.5% on a sequential basis and 42.9% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 42.8% of revenue for the quarter.
 The current demand within Financial Services continues to be fairly broad based across our client base. We're seeing continued focus on initiatives to drive cost efficiencies and operational effectiveness; projects related to regulatory-compliance and risk management; discretionary innovation initiatives to enhance competitive positioning; and finally, M&A integration work, which we expected to ramp down during the quarter was extended through the latter part of 2010.
 Healthcare continued its growth during the quarter with 7.4% sequential growth and 33.9% growth compared to the third quarter of 2009. This segment represented 24.9% of revenues for the quarter. We experienced similar sequential strength among both our Healthcare Insurance clients and our Life Sciences clients. Demand within these clients was driven by data warehousing and analytics services to better understand the controlled medical costs; expansion of BPO services, including clinical operations, claims benefits coding and enrollment; IDC 10 code set and 5010 assessment remediation work; and platform modernization initiatives.
 Retail manufacturing logistics were once again very strong during the quarter. This segment continue to build on the growth from the first half of the year and 2009, growing 13.3% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. It represented 18.9% of revenues for the quarter. Demand within this segment was driven by an increase in large-scale transformational and system integration projects among our major manufacturing clients. For our retail clients, we've seen an increase in business transformation projects, such as service platform development, modernization of core retail systems and multichannel expansion, especially in e-commerce.
 In addition, we have seen an increased interest in customer segmentation initiatives, which we refer to as Know Your Customer projects. And finally, this segment continues to benefit from the ramp-up of new strategic accounts, one in the past year.
 The reigning 13.4% of our revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high-tech, which grew 9.5% sequentially and 40.4% on a year-over-year basis. For the quarter, application management represented 50% of revenues and grew 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Application development was 50% of revenues and grew 59% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The strength in application development was driven in part by the final stages of pent-up demand resulting from clients having under-invested in their businesses during 2008 to 2009 due to the economic uncertainty.
 During the quarter, 77.7% of revenue came from clients in North America. Europe was 18.9% of total revenue and 3.4% of revenue came from the Asia Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets.
 On a reported basis, Europe grew by 14.7% sequentially and 39.8% year-over-year. During the third quarter, European revenue was positively impacted by approximately $6.4 million compared to the second quarter due to the strengthening of the European currencies in the quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, Europe grew 11.6% sequentially.
 Pricing on a sequential basis was up 1% on-site and flat offshore. We continue to have success in our pricing discussions with our existing client base and expect to see the benefits of these ongoing discussions over the coming quarters as rate increases start to kick in.
 We did gross additions of 87 new customers during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 697 active customers. During the quarter, the number of accounts, which we consider to be strategic, increased by five. This brings the total number of strategic clients to 160. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant's services earlier in the relationship.
 Turning to cost. On a GAAP basis, cost to revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $700 million for the quarter and included approximately $2.8 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional technical staff, both on-site and offshore required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 6,400 during the quarter and ended the quarter with over 83,100 technical staff.
 Third quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expense, was $289 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $11.3 million of stock-based compensation.
 Our GAAP operating margin was 18.8% for the quarter and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 19.9% within our target range of 19% to 20%. The average rate for the rupee was 46.4 in the third quarter of 2010 versus 45.5 in the second quarter of 2010 and 48.3 in the third quarter of last year. $165 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges settled during the third quarter. This resulted in a $8.4 million gain, which was recognized in operating expenses.
 As of September 30, 2010, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $165 million and a weighted-average forward rate of 48.8 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in Q4 of 2010. We had $780 million at a rate of 48 scheduled to mature in 2011. And we have another $780 million at 48.1, scheduled to mature in 2012. And finally, we have $360 million at a rate of 50.1 for 2013.
 We had $7 million of interest income during the quarter. In addition, we had a net gain of $7.9 million of other nonoperating expenses, which included $7.6 million of net foreign exchange gains, related to balance sheet remeasurements primarily associated with movement of the dollar versus the rupee, pound and euro and certain balance sheet hedges.
 Our GAAP tax rate to the third quarter was 16.3%, slightly below our original expectations, due primarily to the favorable impact of our foreign exchange hedges in Q3 and certain discrete items, relating to our ongoing operations recorded in the quarter. We expect the full year 2010 tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. This projected rate for the year does not take into account any future tax impact related to our foreign exchange hedge program.
 Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with over $1.9 billion of cash and investments, up approximately $277 million from the end of the second quarter.
 During the third quarter, operating activities generated over $234 million of cash. Financing activities generated almost $62 million of cash, comprised of the proceeds of our employee equity programs and related tax benefits as well as our employee stock purchase plan. We spent approximately $3 million for acquisitions and $45 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. As previously mentioned, for 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million of capital expenditures, the substantial majority of which will support another wave of facility expansion as we finish absorbing our last wave of construction.
 Based on our $1.06 billion balance as of September 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 80.5 days, up from 77 days in the second quarter. The quality of our receivables portfolio remains very strong. However, we're disappointed in the DSO increase during the quarter. 80-plus days like the industry, and we can do better.
 To be clear, this is not a quality of receivables issue, rather due to the strength of demand that we've seen over the past two consecutive quarters and the result in double-digit sequential growth, our client teams has been principally focused on revenue generation and business development. As a result, working with the clients to clear payments do not receive its normal level of attention. We have implemented additional processes to refocus our team on DSO and expect that the trends of increasing DSO will reverse in Q4.
 The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $146 million at the end of the third quarter. The growth in our unbilled balance resulted in part from the strong growth in our development services. Approximately 63% of the Q3 unbilled balance was billed in October, compared to 60% of our Q2 balance, which billed in August.
 During the third quarter, 31.2% of our revenue came from fixed-bid contracts, essentially flat from second quarter of 2010. Net headcount increased by close to 7,000 people during the third quarter, of which approximately 53% of the gross additions were hired directly from college and 47% were lateral hires of experienced IT professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 95,600 employees globally.
 Similar to others in the industry, we expected and experienced increased levels of attrition during the third quarter. As we've discussed in the past, there's no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition numbers. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary.  This number increased sequentially to 21.8%. Much of the industry calculates turnover on a trailing 12-month basis. Calculated this way, our attrition was 18.2% during the quarter. It is also important to note that our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. We believe this pickup in attrition resulted from a rapid return to hiring by many of our competitors. Combined with the catch-up of pent-up demand from those who were considering departing during 2009 and early 2010, but were unable due to the economy. The attrition was primarily at the junior levels. We remain very focused on addressing this spike in attrition. We are making it clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them. This includes implementing a record number of promotions, including a promotion round that was completed today.
 In addition, we continue our efforts on employee engagement, transparent communication ensuring that we continue to foster a collaborative entrepreneurial culture, which our associates tell us is the secret source at Cognizant or what we simply refer to as Cognizant DNA.
 Finally, we will certainly share the success of this year's performance with our employees through a very strong, variable compensation payouts for the year. Based on the attrition data so for this quarter, we expect attrition to decline in Q4 as compared to Q3.
 During the quarter, we accelerated the hiring of both recent college graduates and experienced professionals. In total, our gross additions were close to 12,000. Offshore utilization was approximately 75% during the quarter. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates, who were in our training program during the quarter was approximately 83%. On-site utilization was partially 92% for the quarter. At the end of Q3, we had over 7,100 unbilled people in our training program.
 I'd now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q4 and full year 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.27 billion. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects our view that there will be no budget flush this year. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we've increased our guidance per revenue to at least $4.55 billion. This represents growth of approximately 39%.
 As previously mentioned during the Q3, we met our margin targets. And for the remainder of the year, we expect to operate within our target margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we're currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.68, which excludes estimates stock-based compensation expenses of $0.04. This guidance anticipates a Q4 share count of approximately 311.6 million shares and a tax rate for the fourth quarter of 17%. This guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses in the fourth quarter.
 For full year 2010, based on current business trends, we have increased our GAAP EPS guidance to $2.35 and now expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be $2.50, excluding $0.15 of estimated stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a full year tax rate of 16.5%. This guidance excludes any fourth quarter, nonoperating FX gains or losses.
 We'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator?

If I would summarize it, what I would say is that as we've gone out there and we've looked at this and started to actually do work for our clients across the range of technologies, I think that our view is that the nature of demand is different. It's a different wave like when we saw other technology shifts in the past, we have to make sure that we retool ourselves, and we're doing that actively for the new generation of technologies that are out there. But we think that the same drivers that drove demand for customization and systems integration in the past will continue to be the case with this new breed of technologies. In the end, the new technologies need to be put to work for clients, and that requires customization. It requires implementation. It requires systems integration. And those things will be done differently, but will still need to be done, and we think that will drive demand for our services.

And we feel very confident now of having watched this trend for three or four quarters, that, that is in fact, the case. The clients are really dealing with these three big forces. There's a whole new generation of technologies that are out there, that are creating new opportunities for them that are changing the price performance curve of technology. There's a new generation of workers and consumers. The millennial generation, they are really demanding a different technology experience than a year or two or three ago. And finally, there's this new generation of highly distributed and globalized business models that clients are beginning to adopt and feel very comfortable with. All of this is driving new development, application development systems integration, what you might think of as the more discretionary side of our business. And we think those are long-term trends across the industries that we serve. Specifically in Financial Services, I think that as growth returns to that industry and more stability returns, what we're seeing is a demand that's driven by some of these Future of Work concepts. So when you think about new generation of consumers that are demanding more integrated online banking experiences, a better or more robust mobile banking experiences, and so on and so forth, you're starting to see that kind of demand. And then of course, there's a lot of technology deployment that's being driven in Financial Services as a result of the regulatory initiatives, FinReg and son on and so forth that's requiring Financial Services institutions to put in new technology around risk management and so on and so forth to be able to address the regulatory compliance issues here in the U.S. and also internationally.

Hard to say exactly how much that increase is at this point, but we do think budgets will be up. IT budgets will be up next year over 2010 levels. Within that though, I think that the trend of offshore, in general, or outsourcing more broadly, will have a greater share of that. I think it's definitely the case. We're seeing clients pushing the envelope on the traditional services in terms of looking at areas of even application outsourcing or application development that they may not have traditionally outsourced. But then there's this whole new set of services, IT Infrastructure Services, Business Process Outsourcing, Engineering and Manufacturing Services, Enterprise Analytics, that historically three or four years ago or two or three years ago even, clients would not have considered outsourcing or offshoring. Those are now viable candidates. And so, I think that you'll see the trend to offshore in capturing a greater share of the IT wallet and the IT budget, continuing strongly.

Look, the pent-up demand question, there isn't a scientific way around this. This is based on our conversations with clients and our own intuition about what's going on in the marketplace. The reality was that, we saw quite a consideration, as you know, very strong Q2 and Q3 spending from our clients. And our sense right now is that there isn't a lot of -- budget flush tends to happen when clients have a little bit of extra money at the end of the year in their budgets and they want to get it used in the fiscal, the calendar year. Given this strong spending we saw in Q2 and Q3, I don't think that there's a lot of extra money out there that clients are going to spend in Q4. So based on that and conversations with clients, we don't think that there's a lot of pent-up or rather budget flush that's waiting to happen at the end of the quarter.

However, in the last couple of months, the new government has made it clear that the reduction in the actual tax rate in India won't happen to 2012. So those two things kind of offset each other. And at this point, we're still expecting a tax rate due to the expiration of holidays in 2011 of somewhere between 23% and 25%. At this point, I think most people have modeled in the high end of that range. And I think that's probably appropriate.

I think that these are longer-term initiatives lines. Clients are taking steps in terms of implementation. There are some deadlines out there or will be some deadlines out there, which may drive spending patterns. But in general, our view right now is that these are going to be more incremental spending over '11 and '12. In terms of how they've been funded, I think there's going to be a mix. I think that some of it clearly will clearly cannibalize dollars that clients would otherwise have spend on other things. So the business is usual dollars or the maintenance dollars might move more towards regulatory-related enhancements and fixes. But I think that there's some amount of work that needs to be done, particularly the work that's needed to drive new capabilities that will require incremental funding. We think that, that's actually a great opportunity for us because what we see is that in current situations, what clients are doing is outsourcing more of their business as usual initiatives to use the savings that they generate from offshoring and outsourcing to fund the investment that they need in new capabilities and in regulatory enhancements. So we think that overall, that's going to be a positive for us because it'll drive more work offshore to be able to fund the investment that clients need to make in these new capabilities.

I think that Indian companies in the United States account for employment of about 60,000 people in the United States. And so, I think that there's a broad recognition that the India-U.S. relationship needs to be a strong bilateral one based on trade going in both directions.

Our view with M&A is that, for a while, we've said that our approach -- let me start with our approach. Our approach to M&A is to look at small tuck-under acquisitions that add capability in specific areas. For us, when we think about the size of Cognizant today, and we think about what our tuck-under acquisition means, our sweet spot really is probably in the $20 million to $80 million range, may be going up as big as $200 million in revenue, but really $20 million to $80 million is sort of our sweet spot of revenue for an acquisition. We like to that size of acquisition because we feel it's easier to get our arms around cultural integration is easier with those kinds of acquisitions. When it starts to get larger than that, then the risks of both acquisition become more significant. And frankly at this point, we're looking to add capabilities. We're not looking to acquire for growth. When we think about the kind of capabilities that we're looking to add, certainly the emerging service offerings is a key area. So IT Infrastructure Services, Vertical Business Process Outsourcing and then some of the new ones, like EMS and Analytics and EMS of Engineering and Manufacturing Services or Analytics, would be areas that we look at. We also would be looking at acquisitions from a geographical expansion standpoint. So we did the acquisition of Galileo some time a couple of quarters ago. In France, we'll do those kinds of acquisitions that give us specific geographic capabilities and footprints, and then potentially look at acquisitions that deepen or broaden our industry footprint. So that's really our screen and how we're looking at. In terms of the emerging services, your first question and the percent of revenue, we haven't actually broken those out in the past. But clearly, if you look at those us a portfolio of services, those are growing ahead of, in general, ahead of company average and we expect that those will continue to do so over the coming quarters.

The pent-up demand being finished that was important because there was a big driver in Q2 and Q3 sequentially, and we don't view that as a driver in Q4. So I know we wanted to keep people's expectations for Q4 sequential growth in check. A little to early to know for 2011. Until we clients finished their budget cycle, we understand what impact will the regulatory changes have. Obviously we won't benefit in 2011 the way we did in the first half or first three quarters of 2010 of the same level of search and development spending from pent-up demand, but obviously, there's some other important growth drivers out there. But we just have to get a little further in the budget cycle to have a view on 2011. But Q4 2010 obviously, that pent-up demand is finished.

In Q3, we still have substantial growth in M&A work, where we're not expecting that. It's clear we won't have that growth in Q4. But the important point in Q4 is we certainly don't expect the same level of new project kick-offs on development work that we experienced for the last couple of quarters. All that being said, demand's still healthy, but there's some surges that we would not expect to reoccur in Q4.

Is some of that seasonality or is it more than just normal seasonality in terms of project kickoff being not quite as strong as in the last two quarters?
