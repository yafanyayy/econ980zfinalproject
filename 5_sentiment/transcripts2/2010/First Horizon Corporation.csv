Looking beyond our bottom line fourth quarter and full year loss, we made progress in executing our strategic plan to reposition First Horizon for consistent, significant, and long term profitability. A healthy balance sheet is critical to long term success and we believe that 2009 actions materially bolstered our balance sheet. We have substantially improved liquidity, our core deposits grew significantly last year enabling us to reduce reliance on wholesale funding and retired debt. Additionally, our capital and reserve position is currently one of the strongest in the industry.
We continue to identify and aggressively deal with credit issues. We increased our allowance to loans for the year, recognized problem loans, and wrote them down to net realizable value. As a result of the work performed on our loan portfolios, non-performers and net charge-offs began to decline in the second half of 2009. In fact, non-performing assets have now been steady to declining for three consecutive quarters, indicative of the hard work and success of strength and credit policies implemented and overseen by Greg and his very experienced team.
We reduced risk by shrinking our balance sheet through the ongoing wind down of our national specialty lending and mortgage businesses. Since December 2007 we have reduced our national wind down loans by 40% including an 85% reduction in our national residential construction portfolios. As part of de-risking our balance sheet and as a continuation of efforts to exit non-core businesses we sold $14 billion of mortgage servicing in 2009. Our servicing portfolio is down from a peak of $108 billion to $40 billion at the end of 2009.
Competitive business model is also critical to long term success and in 2009 we focused on strengthening our core businesses, regional banking and capital markets. Emphasis on customer service helped grow our regional banks average core deposits 12% in 2009. Relationship banking and greater pricing discipline enabled the regional banks net interest margin to expand 15 basis points in 2009.
We remain committed to serving our core customers and made nearly $2 billion of new and renewed loans in 2009. Soft demand, weak line usage, credit related actions, and normal portfolio run off led to a decline in loans outstanding over the course of the year, however.
During 2009 we also implemented new line of business structure in our regional bank to incorporate improved performance discipline, support consistent execution across geographies and increase scalability.
FTN Financial is an attractive business for us with high returns on capital. In 2009 our capital markets business had an outstanding year. Fixed income revenues were a record $600 million up 22% from 2008. Fixed income revenues began to normalize in the second half of 2009 but remained very strong relative to historical levels. During 2009 we also identified cost cutting and efficiency measures that we’ve already begun to implement. B.J. will provide more insight in a few minutes.
Turning to the fourth quarter on slide four, we took several actions that negatively affected the bottom line but should be beneficial over the long term. We exited a couple of non-core business locations and terminated contracts that had diminished in value as we exited our national businesses. These actions resulted in a fourth quarter pre-tax impact of $31 million or 35% of our pre-tax loss.
Additionally, as part of our focused monitoring of credit issues we increased our mortgage re-purchase reserve, resulting in $59 million of expense significantly driving up our environmental costs for the fourth quarter.
Credit quality trends, which Greg will detail for you, were encouraging. Length quarter provisioning expense declined $50 million and charge-offs decline $19 million and the allowance for credit losses was a strong 4.95% despite a $48 million reserve decrease. Our capital ratios ended the year on strong footing with tangible common equity to tangible assets at 7.8% and Tier 1 common at 9.8%.
Consolidated net interest margin expanded 23 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter levels as we concentrated on better pricing and growing customer deposits, while the impact of non-accruals lessened. All in all, 2009 was a year during which we took major steps towards accomplishing our goals of returning First Horizon to sustained profitability and driving solid shareholder returns.
I’ll be back later for some closing comments. B.J. will now take you through the fourth quarter financial results.

As Bryan mentioned, our fourth quarter EPS was a loss of $0.32 after discontinued operations and we had net loss of $71 million including $31 million in restructuring related costs. As you can see, there were a lot of moving parts this quarter and so I’ll try to go over them in a little more detail over the next few minutes.
If you turn to slide seven, our pre-tax, pre-provision highlights by business. You can see our core businesses of regional banking and capital markets posted solid results while high expenses in our wind-down businesses as well as in our corporate segment negatively impacted pre-tax, pre-provision. You can see fourth quarter showed some positive trends in the bank and capital markets business with solid pre-tax, pre-provision earnings, good margin expansion in the bank, good fee income, and reduced non-interest expenses. 
If you look specifically at the regional bank, our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings were up 42% from the third quarter as expenses were lower including reduced foreclosure costs in the bank. NII remained steady in the bank as well as the impact from lower loan balances was offset by improved net interest margin. In fact, in the bank, the margin expanded 17 basis points to 497 and average core deposits were up 4% in the bank.
In capital markets, our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings remained solid and steady. Fixed income revenues were slightly down from last quarter as the average daily revenues declined to $1.8 million a day from $1.9 million. Commensurate with that, expenses declined 5% due to lower variable comp. Going forward; we expect continued positive trends in regional banking and further normalization over time in capital markets revenues.
Mortgage and national specialty lending were a significant drag on our consolidated earnings for the quarter with higher environmental costs from the mortgage repurchase reserve which I’ll give a little more detail on in a few minutes. 
During the quarter we took several actions to better position our company for the long term, contributing to a $32 million pre-tax loss that shows up in the corporate segment. I’ll detail these items on slide eight. If we turn to slide eight, consistent with what we’ve talked about previously and our overall focus on driving efficiencies as well as a review we undertook in 2009 of all of our businesses to better position us for sustained profitability going forward, we took several restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. You can see the pre-tax cash and non-cash impacts shown on slide eight.
The first one, we cancelled a significant vendor contract that resulted in a $13 million charge. We divested our First Horizon Insurance business in Atlanta and we sold a non-strategic remittance processing business. Collectively these actions negatively impacted pre-tax income by $17 million and included various other smaller charges these items totaled $31 million pre-tax impact. Although these actions negatively impacted the fourth quarter pre-tax earnings, they should improve our efficiency and performance over the long term, beginning in 2010.
If you flip to slide nine, total expenses rose nearly 12% from last quarter due to higher environmental costs and restructuring and efficiency charges. These offset lower expenses in the regional bank that were down 9% and lower capital markets expenses which were down 5%.
In terms of our efficiency actions that we’ve talked to you about previously, we’ve now identified over $100 million in efficiency expense savings, up from an earlier $50 to $75 million target. These cost saves will be achieved by streamlining operations and improving processes. In 2009 we’ve implemented about two thirds of these actions and expect the remainder to be fully implemented in 2010.
We’re still facing significant environmental costs which totaled about $73 million in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter’s $47 million. We incurred $13 million of foreclosure costs and $59 million of expense related to our mortgage repurchase provision. The addition to our mortgage repurchase reserve is based on an increase in repurchase submissions we’ve seen coming into the pipeline and slower resolutions in the existing, resulting in higher estimated inherent losses.
We had $17 million of actual realized charge-offs in the fourth quarter in repurchase and the total mortgage repurchase reserve now stands at $106 million. Going forward, we’ll continue to carefully monitor changes in the dynamics of this risk. Going forward, overall our operating expenses should come down as we focus on the efficiency initiatives but the environmental costs which totaled around $250 million for all of 2009 are expected to remain sizeable and volatile in 2010.
Flip over to page 10, our balance sheet showed some positive trends this quarter. National specialty lending loan portfolio shrank by another $500 million or so in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated average core deposits increased 3% in the quarter and during the fourth quarter we repatriated more than $400 million in wealth management customer deposits back onto our balance sheet. 
Our consolidated net interest margin expanded again five basis points to 3.19% from the third quarter as the average rate paid on core deposits decreased 11 basis points and loan yields improved nine basis points from last quarter. Notably, our weighted average cost of deposits is below 100 basis points now, 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. Our wholesale funding has been reduced further, in fact, it’s been reduced by about $4 billion over the past 12 months. We believe the balance sheet in total is most likely near its low point. Our balance sheet mix is asset sensitive which we believe gives us flexibility in the current rate environment and benefits us if rates rise.
To wrap up, I think the challenges are certainly not behind us. We believe there were a number of encouraging underlying fourth quarter trends. As Bryan said, we believe we’re entering 2010 with a strong balance sheet. We’re making progress in building our core businesses, we’ve strengthened our net interest margin, we’re identifying and realizing productivity and efficiency benefits, and as Greg’s now going to talk to you about, credit quality is improving though related costs are likely to remain elevated in 2010.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Greg.

As an overarching statement, asset quality improvements are gaining some positive momentum at First Horizon as more portfolios shows signs of stabilization and progress in winding down the national portfolio continues.
Net charge-offs decreased again in the quarter to $183 million. The decrease is driven by lower losses in the consumer portfolios including one time close, mortgage and home equity lending. Commercial charge-offs were flat overall, with lower C&I losses offset by higher commercial real estate losses. The loan loss reserve declined $48 million driven primarily by a decrease in reserves held for the one time close portfolio due to better than expected disposition results. The level of required reserves for the residential pre and home equity portfolios also decreased in the fourth quarter.
At 4.95% of total loans, our reserve remains high relative to peers but down somewhat from the 5.1% coverage in the previous quarter. Provision expense totaled $135 million, a $50 million decrease from the third quarter and the second consecutive quarter of meaningfully lower provisioning expense.
Turning to slide 13, we experienced a third consecutive quarter of non-performing asset reduction with NPAs down 14% on a linked quarter basis. Non-performing loan inflows slowed significantly while dispositions continue to increase and execute at close to carrying value. NPL levels were down significantly and the one time close and residential pre-books and down marginally in the C&I and income CRE portfolio.
ORE balances were up $13 million to $114 million. This increase was expected and should be expected in future quarters as some portion of non-performing loans inevitably cycle through foreclosure process. We continued focus on minimizing the average age of our ORE inventory and keeping carrying values current as evidenced by our evaluation adjustments. Single asset dispositions continue to be made at or close to carrying value. With respect to distressed loan and ORE management in 2010, we will continue to balance the dual goals of decreased problem assets while making the best economic decisions for our shareholders.
I’ll quickly go through the trends by portfolio beginning on slide 14 with Income CRE. As expected, charge-offs were up from last quarter to $28 million. While some charge-off activity was associated with new non-performing loans, a significant portion was related to adjusting values on previously identified problems. Income CRE non-performers were down marginally in the quarter. The increase in accruing delinquencies influenced by one larger transaction. Reserves were flat compared to the third quarter after being an increase substantially in prior quarters.
We expect Income CRE to remain challenging for the next couple of years with elevated levels of problem assets, reserves, and charge-offs but with a risk profile less severe then we were realizing on the residential CRE portfolio. We feel we are managing this portfolio proactively and have its credit risk profile properly assessed and adequately reserved for.
Moving on to slide 15, we continue to see signs of stabilization in the overall C&I portfolio. Delinquencies declined 29 basis points and non-performing loans declined 23 basis points. Excluding the bank and TRUPS exposures we saw an improvement in the weighted average risk rating in this book which resulted in incrementally lower required reserves.
C&I charge-offs totaled $21 million for the quarter, $23 million lower then last quarter. The decrease in charge-offs was greater then our expectations due to the fact that no losses were taken on the TRUPS or other bank exposures in the quarter.
On to slide 16, we continue to focus significant attention on our TRUPS preferred loan portfolio, on loans extended to bank holding companies and on other loans secured by bank stock. Due to the stressed financial services industry is under, the risk profile of loans in these portfolios is assessed quarterly to ensure proper risk management and the adequacy of reserves.
Here we disclose the risk profile of these portfolios and the level of reserves or low com associated with them. The balances remained flat from last quarter. We increased reserves for this book again this quarter in response to negative grade migration and management’s qualitative assessment of the state of the industry.
Moving on to slide 17, home equity balances were $6.9 billion for the fourth quarter. Our core portfolio remained flat at $2.6 billion and our national portfolio continued in slow run off, decreasing $171 million to $4.3 billion. Charge-offs decreased modestly from last quarter to $52 million and we decreased home equity reserves by $15 million in response to incrementally lower balances and delinquency trends moderating.
We expect home equity losses to remain flat to recent quarterly results in the first half of 2010 and decrease slightly in the second half of the year. The home equity portfolio has consistently performed better than market expectations due to the higher quality characteristics of this portfolio. We expect this stable performance to continue barring any further severe economic shocks.
On to slide 18, you can see the national wind-down portfolios remain on track. Again this quarter, balances declined almost $500 million and required reserves decreased by $65 million. OTC balances were down $130 million from last quarter and now stand at $230 million with negligible un-drawn commitments remaining. Recall that two years ago, one time close commitments were $3 billion. OTC charge-offs were down $11 million and reserves decreased $48 million but remain substantial at 27% of loans.
National residential CRE balances were down $137 million from last quarter to $340 million. Charge-offs for the entire residential CRE book were above expectations due to the continued write down of non-performing loans as a result of declining collateral values, the same issue that was discussed earlier in our income CRE commentary.
Permanent mortgage balances remained relatively flat for the quarter despite some migration of completed OTC loans to this book. While delinquency was up slightly we have seen positive trends in entry level low rate and see deterioration in this portfolio moderating. Charge-offs were down for the quarter, however, we build reserves due to increases in observed severities and problem asset dispositions and the impact extended foreclosure periods are having on loss content. We are proud of the progress we’ve made winding down the national construction portfolios and expect most of these loans to be worked through in 2010.
On slide 19, fourth quarter in aggregate was a little better then expected from a charge-off perspective but about as expected from a reserve perspective, although there was some variation from expectations of the sub-portfolio level. Overall, 2009 played out as we through it might last January. Assuming current economic trends continue we expect a further trend of lower losses and lower required reserves in aggregate throughout 2010.
We do see the possibility of more quarter to quarter volatility in results, however, as the portfolios most at risk; TRUPS, bank exposures, and income CRE tend to be less granular then the other segments of our portfolio.
Now I’ll turn it back to Bryan for some final comments.

Thanks to the hard work of our team we were able to reduce risk in our balance sheet, get ahead of our credit challenges and improve our capital and liquidity. 
In 2010 we expect continued progress towards reaching sustained profitability but as B.J. said, the challenges aren’t over. The economic recovery is likely to be slow and environmental and credit costs are anticipated to remain elevated, although below 2009 levels. Nonetheless we anticipate a gradually improving bottom line as we move through the year, assuming the economic recovery remains in tact. 
We have more work to do, deepening customer relationships, building on our core businesses and improving our operating efficiency. Longer term, I’m increasingly confident in First Horizon’s ability to consistently deliver solid, high quality returns for shareholders.

What we saw this quarter was higher inflows into the pipeline so higher put backs from our investors as well as slower resolutions coming out of the pipeline. We’ve done a pretty good job; we have a very experienced team that works these pretty hard. 
Moving them through the pipeline does take a little bit longer. With that, we had larger pipeline and therefore looking at both historical loss as well as what we think inherent loss could be from those that’s how we set the reserve and we thought it was appropriate to increase the reserve fairly substantially for that.
In terms of the metrics that we look at, we obviously look at the pipeline growth; we look at what’s called the rescission rate which is when a repurchase request is made of us, how often do we put it back to the investors so to speak. That has remained fairly steady. We obviously look at the severity of loss coming back in which has come down a little bit over the last couple quarters but not alarmingly. Really most of our repurchase reserve increase was related to the increase in the pipeline.
Looking at it, we feel like we’ve done a very good job working the repurchase, we’ve done a very good job of building the reserve and being appropriately reserved for it. If you look at our numbers, we actually had actual charge offs and losses of about $17 million or about $5 million a month and we have a repurchase reserve of $106 million. We feel like we have pretty good coverage on it.

We’d like to say that we’ll see sequential quarter to quarter decreases in charge-offs and reserves and that would be what we’d expect. This issue with 2010 is that we’re dealing with portfolios, the ones that are most under stress now tend to be less granular then the balance of our portfolio. 
From a quarter to quarter basis we could have a surprise in one direction or the other, better than expected or worse than expected. We think if we drew a trend line through 2010 it would be a progression line that decreased quarter to quarter through the year. Again, we said this last quarter, we’ll say it again this quarter, I think the improvement we’ll see will be incremental quarter to quarter, and we don’t see a sudden turnabout or any major release in any particular quarter but just steady improvement.

I commented earlier, one of the difficulties in estimating these reserves is not having any precedent for them. As B.J. and I both have pointed out, we originated our last loan in August 2008. One of the factors that intuitively believe is that a problem that is based on a fraud or a mis rep is going to surface earlier in the cycle. If something performs for an 18 month period or thereabouts it may be something other then a fraud or a mis rep. 
There’s a strong incentive for a lot of these loans to be pushed back to the originator, particularly on a rep and warranty claim and force us to fight our way through the rescission process. There’s not a lot of good history. As B.J. pointed out we lost roughly $5 million per month in the fourth quarter, $17 million I think was the number. We increased our reserve by about $45 million in the quarter, taking it from roughly $60 to $106 million. 
That’s a long way of saying there’s not a lot of history. We think that we’re getting a lot of the potential volume through the pipeline in 2009.

One other thing I’ll mention on Bryan, what we said about what we’ve originated. As you obviously know, once its refied away from the investor we don’t have further rep and warranty on that.

I would guess that on our commercial real estate loans where we’ve got something like 8.6% or 8.7% reserves they will likely remain elevated for a period of time. With the improvement we’ve seen in C&I and some of these other portfolios like home equity where we reduce reserve slightly this quarter, there’s a chance that they will come down throughout 2010.
As Greg said to the question earlier, we expect to see reserve levels trend down in the aggregate across 2010. As we’ve said in the past, over time we migrate back down to a reserve level that’s probably in the 2% or less range.

Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Although challenging, 2009 was a year of positive change for First Horizon.

Although challenging, 2009 was a year of positive change for First Horizon. Looking beyond our bottom line fourth quarter and full year loss, we made progress in executing our strategic plan to reposition First Horizon for consistent, significant and long-term profitability.  A healthy balance sheet is critical to long-term success, and we believe that 2009's actions materially bolstered our balance sheet.  We have substantially improved liquidity. Our core deposits grew significantly last year, enabling us to reduce reliance on wholesale funding and retire debt. Additionally, our capital and reserve position is currently one of the strongest in the industry. We continue to identify and aggressively deal with credit issues. We increased our allowance to loans for the year, recognized problem loans and wrote them down to net realizable value. As a result of the work performed on our loan portfolios, non-performers and net charge-offs began to decline in the second half of 2009. In fact, non-performing assets have now been steady to declining for three consecutive quarters, indicative of the hard work and success of strengthened credit policies implemented and overseen by Greg and his very experienced team.We reduced risk by strengthening our balance sheet through the ongoing wind-down of our National Specialty Lending and Mortgage businesses. Since December 2007, we have reduced our National wind-down loans by 40%, including an 85% reduction in our National residential construction portfolios.  As part of derisking our balance sheet and as a continuation of efforts to exit non-core businesses, we sold $14 billion of mortgage servicing in 2009. Our servicing portfolio is down from a peak $108 billion to $40 billion at the end of 2009.Competitive business model is also critical to long-term success, and in 2009, we focused on strengthening our core businesses, Regional Banking and Capital Markets. Emphasis on customer service helped grow our Regional Bank's average core deposits 12% in 2009. Relationship banking and greater pricing discipline enabled the Regional Bank's net interest margin to expand 15 basis points in 2009. We remain committed to serving our core customers and made nearly $2 billion of new and renewed loans in 2009. Soft demand, weak line usage, credit-related actions and normal portfolio runoff led to a decline in loans outstanding over the course of the year, however. During 2009, we also implemented a new line of business structure in our Regional Bank to incorporate improved performance discipline, support consistent execution across geographies and increase scalability.  FTN Financial is an attractive business for us, with high returns on capital. In 2009, our Capital Markets business had an outstanding year. Fixed income revenues were a record $600 million, up 22% from 2008. Fixed income revenues began to normalize in the second half of 2009 but remained very strong relative to historical levels. During 2009, we also identified cost-cutting and efficiency measures that we've already begun to implement. BJ will provide more insight in a few minutes.Turning to the fourth quarter on Slide 4, we took several actions that negatively affected the bottom line but should be beneficial over the long term. We exited a couple of non-core business locations and terminated contracts that had diminished in value as we exited our National businesses. These actions resulted in a fourth quarter pre-tax impact of $31 million or 35% of our pre-tax loss. Additionally, as part of our focused monitoring of credit issues, we increased our mortgage repurchase reserve, resulting in $59 million of expense, significantly driving up our environmental cost for the fourth quarter.Credit quality trends, which Greg will detail for you, were encouraging. Linked-quarter provision expense declined $50 million and charge-offs declined $19 million and the allowance for credit losses was a strong 4.95% despite a $48 million reserve decrease. Our capital ratios ended the year on strong footing, with Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets at 7.8% and Tier 1 Common at 9.8%. Consolidated net interest margin expanded 23 basis points from last year's fourth quarter levels, as we concentrated on better pricing and growing customer deposits while the impact of non-accruals lessen. All in all, 2009 was a year during which we took major steps towards accomplishing our goals of returning First Horizon to sustained profitability and driving solid shareholder returns. I'll be back later for some closing comments. BJ will now take you through the fourth quarter financial results. BJ?"

Let me quickly go over the quarter's consolidated financials on Slide 6.  As Bryan mentioned, our fourth quarter EPS was a loss of $0.32 after discontinued operations. And we had a net loss of $71 million, including",1043,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Let me quickly go over the quarter's consolidated financials on Slide 6.  As Bryan mentioned, our fourth quarter EPS was a loss of $0.32 after discontinued operations. And we had a net loss of $71 million, including $31 million in restructuring-related costs. As you can see, there were a lot of moving parts this quarter, and so I'll try to go over them in a little more detail over the next few minutes. If you turn to Slide 7, our pre-tax, pre-provision highlights by business, you can see our core businesses, Regional Banking and Capital Markets, posted solid results, while high expenses in our wind-down businesses, as well as in our Corporate segment negatively impacted pre-tax, pre-provision. You can see fourth quarter showed some positive trends in the Bank, and Capital Markets business was solid pre-tax, pre--provision earnings, good margin expansion in the Bank, good fee income and reduced non-interest expenses. If you look specifically at the Regional Bank, our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings were up 42% from the third quarter, as expenses were lower, including reduced foreclosure costs in the Bank. NII remains steady in the Bank, as well as the impact from lower loan balances was offset by improved net interest margin. And in fact, in the Bank, the margin expanded 17 basis points to 4.97%. And average core deposits were up 4% in the Bank. In Capital Markets, our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings remain solid and steady. Fixed income revenues were slightly down from last quarter, as the average daily revenues declined to $1.8 million a day from $1.9 million. And commensurate with that, expenses declined 5% due to lower variable comp. Going forward, we expect continued positive trends in Regional Banking and further normalization over time in Capital Markets' revenues. Mortgage and National Specialty Lending were a significant drag on our consolidated earnings for the quarter, with higher environmental costs for the mortgage repurchase reserve, which I'll give a little more detail on in a few minutes.  During the quarter, we took several actions to better position our company for the long term, contributing to a $32 million pre-tax loss that shows up in the Corporate segment, and I'll detail these items on Slide 8. So if we turn to Slide 8, consistent with what we've talked about previously in our overall focus on driving efficiencies, as well as a review we undertook in 2009 of all of our businesses to better position us for sustained profitability going forward, we took several restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. And you can see the pre-tax, cash and non-cash impact shown on Slide 8. First one, we canceled a significant vendor contract that resulted in a $13 million  charge. We divested our First Horizon Insurance business in Atlanta, and we sold a non-strategic remittance processing business. Collectively, these actions negatively impacted pre-tax income by $17 million. And included various other smaller charges, these items totaled $31 million pre-tax impact. And although these actions negatively impacted fourth quarter pre-tax earnings, they should improve our efficiency and performance over the long term, beginning in 2010.If you flip to Slide 9, total expenses rose nearly 12% from last quarter due to higher environmental costs and restructuring and efficiency charges. These offset lower expenses in the Regional Bank that were down 9% and lower Capitals Markets' expenses, which were down 5%.  In terms of our efficiency actions that we've talked to you about previously, we've now identified over $100 million in efficiency expense savings, up from an earlier $50 million to $75 million target. These cost saves will be achieved by streamlining operations and improving processes. In 2009, we've implemented about 2/3 of these actions and expect the remainder to be fully implemented in 2010.We're still facing significant environmental costs, which totaled about $73 million in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter's $47 million. We incurred $13 million of foreclosure costs and $59 million of expense related to our mortgage repurchase provision. The addition to our mortgage repurchase reserve is based on an increase in repurchase submissions we've seen coming into the pipeline and slower resolutions in the existing, resulting in higher estimated inherent losses. We had $17 million of actual realized charge-offs in the fourth quarter and repurchase. And the total mortgage repurchase reserve now stands at $106 million.  Going forward, we'll continue to carefully monitor changes in the dynamics of this risk.  Going forward overall, our operating expenses should come down as we focus on the efficiency initiatives. But the environmental costs, which totaled around $250 million for all of 2009, are expected to remain sizable and volatile in 2010.Flip over to Page 10, our balance sheet showed some positive trends this quarter. National Specialty Lending's loan portfolio shrank by another $500 million or so in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated average core deposits increased 3% linked quarter. And during the fourth quarter, we repatriated more than $400 million in wealth management customer deposits back on to our balance sheet.Our consolidated net interest margin expanded, again, 5 basis points to 3.19% from the third quarter, as the average rate paid on core deposits decreased 11 bps and loan yields improved 9 basis points from last quarter. Notably, our weighted average cost of deposits is below 100 basis points now, 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. And our wholesale funding has been reduced further. In fact, it's been reduced by about $4 billion over the past 12 months.  We believe the balance sheet in total is most likely near its low point, and our balance sheet mix is asset-sensitive, which we believe gives us flexibility in the current rate environment and benefits us if rates rise.So to wrap up, I think the challenges are certainly not behind us, but we believe there were a number of encouraging underlying fourth quarter trends. As Bryan said, we believe we're entering 2010 with a strong balance sheet. We're making progress in building our core businesses. We've strengthened our net interest margin. We're identifying and realizing productivity and efficiency benefits. And as Greg is now going to talk to you about, credit quality is improving. The related costs are likely to remain elevated in 2010. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

Our asset quality comments start on Slide 12. As an overarching statement, asset quality improvements are gaining some positive momentum at First Horizon, as most portfolios show signs of stabilization and progress of winding-down the National portfolio continues.Net charge-offs decreased again in the quarter to $183 million. The decrease is driven by lower losses in the consumer portfolios, including one-time close mortgage and home equity lending. Commercial charge-offs were flat overall, with lower C&I [Commercial & Industrial] losses offset by higher commercial real estate losses.The loan loss reserve declined $48 million, driven primarily by a decrease in reserves held for the one-time close portfolio due to better-than-expected disposition results. The level of required reserves for the Residential CRE [Commercial Real Estate] and home equity portfolios also decreased in the fourth quarter. At 4.95% of total loans, our reserve remains high relative to peers but down somewhat from the 5.1% coverage in the previous quarter. Provision expense totaled $135 million, a $50 million decrease from the third quarter and the second consecutive quarter of meaningfully-lower provision expense. Turning to Slide 13, we experienced a third consecutive quarter of non-performing asset reduction, with NPAs down 14% on a linked-quarter basis. Non-performing loan inflows slowed significantly, while dispositions continue to increase and execute at close to carrying value. NPL levels were down significantly in the one-time close and Residential CRE books and down marginally in the C&I and Income CRE portfolio.ORE balances were up $13 million to $114 million. This increase was expected and should be expected in future quarters, as some portion of non-performing loans inevitably cycle through foreclosure process. We continue to focus on minimizing the average age of our ORE inventory and keeping carrying values current, as evidenced by our valuation adjustments. Single-asset dispositions continue to be made at or close to carrying value. With respect to distressed loan and ORE management in 2010, we will continue to balance the dual goals of decreased problem assets while making the best economic decisions for our shareholders.I'll quickly go through the trends by portfolio, beginning on Slide 14 with Income CRE. As expected, charge-offs were up from last quarter to $28 million. While some charge-off activity was associated with new non-performing loans, a significant portion was related to adjusting values on previously-identified problems. Income CRE non-performers were down marginally in the quarter. And the increase in accruing delinquency is influenced by one larger transaction. Reserves are flat compared to the third quarter after being increased substantially in prior quarters.We expect Income CRE to remain challenging for the next couple of years, with elevated levels of problem assets, reserves and charge-offs, but with a risk profile less severe than we are realizing now on the Residential CRE portfolio. We feel we are managing this portfolio proactively and have its credit risk profile properly assessed and adequately reserved for. Moving on to Slide 15, we continue to see signs of stabilization in the overall C&I portfolio. Delinquencies declined 29 basis points and non-performing loans declined 23 basis points. Excluding the bank and TRUP (sic) TRUPS [Trust Preferred Securities] exposures, we saw an improvement in the weighted average risk rate in munis TRUPS [ph] (38:02), which resulted in incrementally-lower required reserves.  C&I charge-offs totaled $21 million for the quarter, $23 million lower than last quarter. The decrease in charge-offs was greater than our expectations due to the fact that no losses were taken on the TRUPS or other bank exposures in the quarter.On to Slide 16, we continue to focus significant attention on our Trust Preferred loan portfolio, on loans extended to bank holding companies and on other loans secured by bank stock. Due to distressed financial services industry is under, the risk profile of loans in these portfolios is assessed quarterly to ensure proper risk management and the adequacy of reserves. Here, we disclosed the risk profile of these portfolios and the level of reserves or lower com [ph](38:50) associated with them. Balances remained flat from last quarter. We increased reserves for this book again this quarter in response to negative-grade migration and management's qualitative assessment of the state of the industry.Moving on Slide 17, home equity balances were $6.9 billion for the fourth quarter. Our core portfolio remained flat at $2.6 billion, and our National portfolio continued in slow runoff, decreasing $171 million to $4.3 billion. Charge-offs decreased modestly from last quarter to $52 million, and we decreased home equity reserves by $15 million in response to incrementally-lower balances and delinquency trends moderating. We expect home equity losses to remain flat to recent quarterly results in the first half of 2010 and decrease slightly in the second half of the year. The home equity portfolio has consistently performed better than market expectations due to the higher-quality characteristics of this portfolio.  We expect the stable performance to continue, barring any further severe economic shocks.On to Slide 18, you can see the National Wind-Down portfolio has remained on track. Again, this quarter, balances declined by almost $500 million and required reserves decreased by $65 million. OTC balances were down $130 million from last quarter and now stand at $230 million with negligible undrawn commitments remaining. Recall that two years ago, one-time close commitments were $3 billion. OTC charge-offs were down $11 million and reserves decreased $48 million but remained substantial at 27% of loans.National Residential CRE balances were down $137 million from last quarter to $340 million. Charge-offs for the entire Residential CRE book were above expectations due to the continued write-down of non-performing loans as a result of decline in collateral values, same issue that was discussed earlier in our Income CRE commentary. Permanent Mortgage balances remained relatively flat for the quarter despite some migration of completed OTC loans to this book. While delinquency was up slightly, we have seen positive trends in entry-level lower [ph](41:12) rates and see deterioration in this portfolio moderating. Charge-offs were down for the quarter. However, we built reserves due to increases in observed severities and problem-asset dispositions and the impact extended foreclosure periods are having on loss content.  We are proud of the progress we have made winding-down the National construction portfolios and expect most of these loans to be worked through in 2010.  On Slide 19, fourth quarter on aggregate was a little better than expected from a charge-off perspective but about as expected from a reserve perspective, although there was some variation from expectations at the sub-portfolio level. Overall, 2009 played out as we thought it might last January.  Assuming current economic trends continue, we expect to further trend of lower losses and lower required reserves in aggregate throughout 2010. We do see the possibility of more quarter-to-quarter volatility in results, however, as the portfolios most at risk, TRUPS bank exposures, and Income CRE, tend to be less granular than the other segments of our portfolio. Now I'll turn it back to Bryan for some final comments."

The economic recovery is likely to be slow, and environmental and credit costs are anticipated to remain elevated, although below 2009's level. Nonetheless, we anticipate a gradually-improving bottom line as we move through the year, assuming the economic recovery remains intact. We have more work to do in deepening customer relationships, building on our core businesses and improving our operating efficiency. But longer term, I'm increasingly confident in First Horizon's ability to consistently deliver solid, high-quality returns for shareholders. Thank you. Now, operator, we'll open the call for questions please."

Mortgage repurchase, we obviously look at that closely every month actually, instead of for the quarter. What we saw this quarter was higher inflows into the pipeline, so higher put-backs from our investors, as well as slower resolutions coming out of the pipeline. So we've done a pretty good job. We have a very experienced team that works these pretty hard, but moving up through the pipeline does take a little bit longer. And so with that, we had a larger pipeline. And therefore, looking at both historical loss as well as what we think inherent loss could be from those, that's how we set the reserve. And we thought it was appropriate to increase the reserve fairly substantially for that. In terms of the metrics that we look at, we obviously look at the pipeline growth. We look at what's called the rescission rate, which is when a repurchase request is made of us, how often do we put it back to the investors so to speak. That has remained fairly steady. And we obviously look at the severity of loss coming back in, which has come down a little bit over the last couple of quarters but not alarmingly. So really, most of our repurchase reserve increase was related to the increase in the pipeline. Looking at it, we feel like we've done a very good job working the repurchase. We've done a very good job of building the reserve and being appropriately reserved for it. If you look at our numbers, we actually had actual charge-offs and losses of about $17 million or about $5 million a month, and we have a repurchase reserve of $106 million. So we feel like we have a pretty good coverage on it."

We will probably see incremental improvement in that as we allow CDs to run off, and that will certainly help, but we're getting close to the point where there's just a natural floor on it. So that will be tougher to improve. We've also been pretty pleased with what we've seen on improving loan yields. But again, that takes a lot of work through the portfolio. I think now we're getting to the point where we've taken a lot of the organic steps, so to speak, to put us on the right track for sustained improved NIM. But going forward, we'll probably need a little more help from the rate environment. Meaning, as rates rise, we think that's when we'll start to see more NIM expansion over time, but until then, it will probably be much more modest than you've seen in the last couple quarters."

I commented earlier, one of the difficulties in estimating these reserves is not having any precedent form. And as BJ and I both have pointed out, we originated our last loan in August of 2008. One of the factors that intuitively believe is that a problem that is based on a fraud or a misrep is going to surface earlier in the cycle. If something performs for an 18-month period or thereabouts, it may be something other than a fraud or a misrep. But there is strong incentive for a lot of these loans to be pushed back to the originator, particularly on a rep and warranty claim and force us to fight our way through the rescission process. So there's not a lot of good history. As BJ pointed out, we lost roughly $5 million per month in the fourth quarter of $17 million, I think was the number. We increased our reserve by about 45 million in the quarter, taking it from roughly $60 million to $106 million. That's a long way of saying there's not a lot of history, we think, that we're getting a lot of the potential volume through the pipeline in 2009, and we're not sure quite where it goes in 2010, but we'll stay on top of it and we'll continue to evaluate.

One other thing I'll mention, Bryan's, to what he said about what we've originated, as you obviously know, once it's refi-ed away from the investor, we don't have further rep in warranty on that. So as we try to look at total inherent loss content, it's not quite as easy as just saying how much did we originate and so on.

In terms of performance by category, you can see there in the bottom right, land is clearly the worst performing asset class. My comments earlier around the losses that were realized in fourth quarter, about 2/3 or so of the losses that we experienced were related, and that's a rough estimate, to reassessing values of existing non-performers rather than new inflows, and the larger contributor there was where there's land because the values have dropped more precipitously on that. You can see the category performance by other income CRE types, and I think we're, safe to say, we're elevated across the board. We're concerned about all of income CRE. I think where we get comfort in terms of our guidance and as the loss levels and reserve levels of 2010, is we have pretty aggressively or appropriately migrated grades down, our loans down to the grading process in 2009 and built reserves for these loans, the balances are decreasing.

Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Although challenging, 2009 was a year of positive change for First Horizon. Looking beyond our bottom line fourth quarter and full year loss, we made progress in executing our strategic plan",732,"Thank you, Aarti. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Although challenging, 2009 was a year of positive change for First Horizon. Looking beyond our bottom line fourth quarter and full year loss, we made progress in executing our strategic plan to reposition First Horizon for consistent, significant and long-term profitability.  A healthy balance sheet is critical to long-term success, and we believe that 2009's actions materially bolstered our balance sheet.  We have substantially improved liquidity. Our core deposits grew significantly last year, enabling us to reduce reliance on wholesale funding and retire debt. Additionally, our capital and reserve position is currently one of the strongest in the industry. We continue to identify and aggressively deal with credit issues. We increased our allowance to loans for the year, recognized problem loans and wrote them down to net realizable value. As a result of the work performed on our loan portfolios, non-performers and net charge-offs began to decline in the second half of 2009. In fact, non-performing assets have now been steady to declining for three consecutive quarters, indicative of the hard work and success of strengthened credit policies implemented and overseen by Greg and his very experienced team.We reduced risk by strengthening our balance sheet through the ongoing wind-down of our National Specialty Lending and Mortgage businesses. Since December 2007, we have reduced our National wind-down loans by 40%, including an 85% reduction in our National residential construction portfolios.  As part of derisking our balance sheet and as a continuation of efforts to exit non-core businesses, we sold $14 billion of mortgage servicing in 2009. Our servicing portfolio is down from a peak $108 billion to $40 billion at the end of 2009.Competitive business model is also critical to long-term success, and in 2009, we focused on strengthening our core businesses, Regional Banking and Capital Markets. Emphasis on customer service helped grow our Regional Bank's average core deposits 12% in 2009. Relationship banking and greater pricing discipline enabled the Regional Bank's net interest margin to expand 15 basis points in 2009. We remain committed to serving our core customers and made nearly $2 billion of new and renewed loans in 2009. Soft demand, weak line usage, credit-related actions and normal portfolio run off led to a decline in loans outstanding over the course of the year, however. During 2009, we also implemented a new line of business structure in our Regional Bank to incorporate improved performance discipline, support consistent execution across geographies and increase scalability.  FTN Financial is an attractive business for us, with high returns on capital. In 2009, our Capital Markets business had an outstanding year. Fixed income revenues were a record $600 million, up 22% from 2008. Fixed income revenues began to normalize in the second half of 2009 but remained very strong relative to historical levels. During 2009, we also identified cost-cutting and efficiency measures that we've already begun to implement. BJ will provide more insight in a few minutes.Turning to the fourth quarter on Slide 4, we took several actions that negatively affected the bottom line but should be beneficial over the long term. We exited a couple of non-core business locations and terminated contracts that had diminished in value as we exited our National businesses. These actions resulted in a fourth quarter pre-tax impact of $31 million or 35% of our pre-tax loss. Additionally, as part of our focused monitoring of credit issues, we increased our mortgage repurchase reserve, resulting in $59 million of expense, significantly driving up our environmental cost for the fourth quarter.Credit quality trends, which Greg will detail for you, were encouraging. Linked-quarter provision expense declined $50 million and charge-offs declined $19 million, and the allowance for credit losses was a strong 4.95% despite a $48 million reserve decrease. Our capital ratios ended the year on strong footing, with Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets at 7.8% and Tier 1 Common at 9.8%. Consolidated net interest margin expanded 23 basis points from last year's fourth quarter levels, as we concentrated on better pricing and growing customer deposits while the impact of non-accruals lessened. All in all, 2009 was a year during which we took major steps towards accomplishing our goals of returning First Horizon to sustained profitability and driving solid shareholder returns. I'll be back later for some closing comments. BJ will now take you through the fourth quarter financial results. BJ?"

Let me quickly go over the quarter's consolidated financials on Slide 6.  As Bryan mentioned, our fourth quarter EPS was a loss of $0.32 after discontinued operations. And we had a net loss of $71 million, including",1043,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Let me quickly go over the quarter's consolidated financials on Slide 6.  As Bryan mentioned, our fourth quarter EPS was a loss of $0.32 after discontinued operations. And we had a net loss of $71 million, including $31 million in restructuring-related costs. As you can see, there were a lot of moving parts this quarter, and so I'll try to go over them in a little more detail over the next few minutes. If you turn to Slide 7, our pre-tax, pre-provision highlights by business, you can see our core businesses, Regional Banking and Capital Markets, posted solid results, while high expenses in our wind-down businesses, as well as in our Corporate segment negatively impacted pre-tax, pre-provision. You can see fourth quarter showed some positive trends in the Bank and Capital Markets business, with solid pre-tax, pre--provision earnings, good margin expansion in the Bank, good fee income and reduced non-interest expenses. If you look specifically at the Regional Bank, our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings were up 42% from the third quarter, as expenses were lower, including reduced foreclosure costs in the Bank. NII remains steady in the Bank, as well as the impact from lower loan balances was offset by improved net interest margin. And in fact, in the Bank, the margin expanded 17 basis points to 4.97%. And average core deposits were up 4% in the Bank. In Capital Markets, our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings remain solid and steady. Fixed income revenues were slightly down from last quarter, as the average daily revenues declined to $1.8 million a day from $1.9 million. And commensurate with that, expenses declined 5% due to lower variable comp. Going forward, we expect continued positive trends in Regional Banking and further normalization over time in Capital Markets' revenues. Mortgage and National Specialty Lending were a significant drag on our consolidated earnings for the quarter, with higher environmental costs for the mortgage repurchase reserve, which I'll give a little more detail on in a few minutes.  During the quarter, we took several actions to better position our company for the long term, contributing to a $32 million pre-tax loss that shows up in the Corporate segment, and I'll detail these items on Slide 8. So if we turn to Slide 8, consistent with what we've talked about previously in our overall focus on driving efficiencies, as well as a review we undertook in 2009 of all of our businesses to better position us for sustained profitability going forward, we took several restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. And you can see the pre-tax, cash and non-cash impact shown on Slide 8. First one, we canceled a significant vendor contract that resulted in a $13 million  charge. We divested our First Horizon Insurance business in Atlanta, and we sold a non-strategic remittance processing business. Collectively, these actions negatively impacted pre-tax income by $17 million. And included various other smaller charges, these items totaled $31 million pre-tax impact. And although these actions negatively impacted fourth quarter pre-tax earnings, they should improve our efficiency and performance over the long term, beginning in 2010.If you flip to Slide 9, total expenses rose nearly 12% from last quarter due to higher environmental costs and restructuring and efficiency charges. These offset lower expenses in the Regional Bank that were down 9% and lower Capitals Markets expenses, which were down 5%.  In terms of our efficiency actions that we've talked to you about previously, we've now identified over $100 million in efficiency expense savings, up from an earlier $50 million to $75 million target. These cost saves will be achieved by streamlining operations and improving processes. In 2009, we've implemented about 2/3 of these actions and expect the remainder to be fully implemented in 2010.We're still facing significant environmental costs, which totaled about $73 million in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter's $47 million. We incurred $13 million of foreclosure costs and $59 million of expense related to our mortgage repurchase provision. The addition to our mortgage repurchase reserve is based on an increase in repurchase submissions we've seen coming into the pipeline and slower resolutions in the existing, resulting in higher estimated inherent losses. We had $17 million of actual realized charge-offs in the fourth quarter in repurchase, and the total mortgage repurchase reserve now stands at $106 million.  Going forward, we'll continue to carefully monitor changes in the dynamics of this risk.  Going forward overall, our operating expenses should come down as we focus on the efficiency initiatives. But the environmental costs, which totaled around $250 million for all of 2009, are expected to remain sizable and volatile in 2010.Flip over to Page 10, our balance sheet showed some positive trends this quarter. National Specialty Lending's loan portfolio shrank by another $500 million or so in the fourth quarter. Our consolidated average core deposits increased 3% linked quarter. And during the fourth quarter, we repatriated more than $400 million in wealth management customer deposits back on to our balance sheet.Our consolidated net interest margin expanded, again, five basis points to 3.19% from the third quarter, as the average rate paid on core deposits decreased 11 bps and loan yields improved nine basis points from last quarter. Notably, our weighted average cost of deposits is below 100 basis points now, 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. And our wholesale funding has been reduced further. In fact, it's been reduced by about $4 billion over the past 12 months.  We believe the balance sheet in total is most likely near its low point, and our balance sheet mix is asset-sensitive, which we believe gives us flexibility in the current rate environment and benefits us if rates rise.So to wrap up, I think the challenges are certainly not behind us, but we believe there were a number of encouraging underlying fourth quarter trends. As Bryan said, we believe we're entering 2010 with a strong balance sheet. We're making progress in building our core businesses. We've strengthened our net interest margin. We're identifying and realizing productivity and efficiency benefits. And as Greg is now going to talk to you about, credit quality is improving, though related costs are likely to remain elevated in 2010. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg."

Our asset quality comments start on Slide 12. As an overarching statement, asset quality improvements are gaining some positive momentum at First Horizon, as most portfolios show signs of stabilization and progress of winding-down the National portfolio continues.Net charge-offs decreased again in the quarter to $183 million. The decrease is driven by lower losses in the consumer portfolios, including one-time close mortgage and home equity lending. Commercial charge-offs were flat overall, with lower C&I [Commercial & Industrial] losses offset by higher commercial real estate losses.The loan loss reserve declined $48 million, driven primarily by a decrease in reserves held for the one-time close portfolio due to better-than-expected disposition results. The level of required reserves for the Residential CRE [Commercial Real Estate] and home equity portfolios also decreased in the fourth quarter. At 4.95% of total loans, our reserve remains high relative to peers, but down somewhat from the 5.1% coverage in the previous quarter. Provision expense totaled $135 million, a $50 million decrease from the third quarter and the second consecutive quarter of meaningfully-lower provision expense. Turning to Slide 13, we experienced a third consecutive quarter of non-performing asset reduction, with NPAs down 14% on a linked-quarter basis. Non-performing loan inflows slowed significantly, while dispositions continue to increase and execute at close to carrying value. NPL levels were down significantly in the one-time close in Residential CRE books and down marginally in the C&I and Income CRE portfolio.ORE balances were up $13 million to $114 million. This increase was expected and should be expected in future quarters, as some portion of non-performing loans inevitably cycle through foreclosure process. We continue to focus on minimizing the average age of our ORE inventory and keeping carrying values current, as evidenced by our valuation adjustments. Single-asset dispositions continue to be made at or close to carrying value. With respect to distressed loan and ORE management in 2010, we will continue to balance the dual goals of decreased problem assets while making the best economic decisions for our shareholders.I'll quickly go through the trends by portfolio, beginning on Slide 14 with Income CRE. As expected, charge-offs were up from last quarter to $28 million. While some charge-off activity was associated with new non-performing loans, a significant portion was related to adjusting values on previously-identified problems. Income CRE non-performers were down marginally in the quarter. And the increase in accruing delinquency is influenced by one larger transaction. Reserves are flat compared to the third quarter after being increased substantially in prior quarters.We expect Income CRE to remain challenging for the next couple of years, with elevated levels of problem assets, reserves and charge-offs, but with a risk profile less severe than we are realizing now on the Residential CRE portfolio. We feel we are managing this portfolio proactively and have its credit risk profile properly assessed and adequately reserved for. Moving on to Slide 15, we continue to see signs of stabilization in the overall C&I portfolio. Delinquencies declined 29 basis points and non-performing loans declined 23 basis points. Excluding the bank and TRUP (sic) TruPS [Trust Preferred Securities] exposures, we saw an improvement in the weighted average risk rate in munis TRupS [ph], which resulted in incrementally-lower required reserves.  C&I charge-offs totaled $21 million for the quarter, $23 million lower than last quarter. The decrease in charge-offs was greater than our expectations due to the fact that no losses were taken on the TRUPS or other bank exposures in the quarter.On to Slide 16, we continue to focus significant attention on our Trust Preferred loan portfolio, on loans extended to bank holding companies and on other loans secured by bank stock. Due to distressed financial services industry is under, the risk profile of loans in these portfolios is assessed quarterly to ensure proper risk management and the adequacy of reserves. Here, we disclosed the risk profile of these portfolios and the level of reserves or low com associated with them. Balances remained flat from last quarter. We increased reserves for this book again this quarter in response to negative-grade migration and management's qualitative assessment of the state of the industry.Moving on Slide 17, home equity balances were $6.9 billion for the fourth quarter. Our core portfolio remained flat at $2.6 billion, and our National portfolio continued in slow runoff, decreasing $171 million to $4.3 billion. Charge-offs decreased modestly from last quarter to $52 million, and we decreased home equity reserves by $15 million in response to incrementally-lower balances and delinquency trends moderating. We expect home equity losses to remain flat to recent quarterly results in the first half of 2010 and decrease slightly in the second half of the year. The home equity portfolio has consistently performed better than market expectations due to the higher-quality characteristics of this portfolio.  We expect this stable performance to continue, barring any further severe economic shocks.On to Slide 18, you can see the National Wind-Down portfolio has remained on track. Again, this quarter, balances declined almost $500 million and required reserves decreased by $65 million. OTC balances were down $130 million from last quarter and now stand at $230 million with negligible undrawn commitments remaining. Recall that two years ago, one-time close commitments were $3 billion. OTC charge-offs were down $11 million and reserves decreased $48 million but remained substantial at 27% of loans.National Residential CRE balances were down $137 million from last quarter to $340 million. Charge-offs for the entire Residential CRE book were above expectations due to the continued write-down of non-performing loans as a result of decline in collateral values, same issue that was discussed earlier in our Income CRE commentary. Permanent Mortgage balances remained relatively flat for the quarter despite some migration of completed OTC loans to this book. While delinquency was up slightly, we have seen positive trends in entry-level lower [ph] rates and see deterioration in this portfolio moderating. Charge-offs were down for the quarter. However, we built reserves due to increases in observed severities in problem-asset dispositions and the impact extended foreclosure periods are having on loss content.  We are proud of the progress we have made winding-down the National construction portfolios and expect most of these loans to be worked through in 2010.  On Slide 19, fourth quarter on aggregate was a little better than expected from a charge-off perspective but about as expected from a reserve perspective, although there was some variation from expectations at the sub-portfolio level. Overall, 2009 played out as we thought it might last January.  Assuming current economic trends continue, we expect the further trend of lower losses and lower required reserves and aggregate throughout 2010. We do see the possibility of more quarter-to-quarter volatility in results, however, as the portfolios most at risk, TruPS, bank exposures and Income CRE, tend to be less granular than the other segments of our portfolio. Now I'll turn it back to Bryan for some final comments."

The economic recovery is likely to be slow, and environmental and credit costs are anticipated to remain elevated, although below 2009's level. Nonetheless, we anticipate a gradually-improving bottom line as we move through the year, assuming the economic recovery remains intact.

Mortgage repurchase, we obviously look at that closely every month actually, instead of for the quarter. What we saw this quarter was higher inflows into the pipeline, so higher put-backs from our investors, as well as slower resolutions coming out of the pipeline. So we've done a pretty good job. We have a very experienced team that works these pretty hard, but moving up through the pipeline does take a little bit longer. And so with that, we had a larger pipeline. And therefore, looking at both historical loss, as well as what we think inherent loss could be from those, that's how we set the reserve. And we thought it was appropriate to increase the reserve fairly substantially for that. In terms of the metrics that we look at, we obviously look at the pipeline growth. We look at what's called the rescission rate, which is when a repurchase request is made of us, how often do we put it back to the investors so to speak. That has remained fairly steady. And we obviously look at the severity of loss coming back in, which has come down a little bit over the last couple of quarters but not alarmingly. So really, most of our repurchase reserve increase was related to the increase in the pipeline. Looking at it, we feel like we've done a very good job working the repurchase. We've done a very good job of building the reserve and being appropriately reserved for it. If you look at our numbers, we actually had actual charge-offs and losses of about $17 million or about $5 million a month, and we have a repurchase reserve of $106 million. So we feel like we have a pretty good coverage on it."

With respect to the aggregate balance sheet, we've seen the significant runoff and the rapid portions of the national portfolios, about $500 million decline this past quarter, a lot of that coming in our construction portfolios, income CRE, residential construction and one-time close. We'd  expect that to be more stable. So I would guess that the size of the balance sheet is going to be reasonably stable, plus or minus just $26 billion level, with a little bit of growth showing up in the bank in the early part of 2010."

I commented earlier, one of the difficulties in estimating these reserves is not having any precedent form. And as BJ and I both have pointed out, we originated our last loan in August of 2008. One of the factors that intuitively believe is that a problem that is based on a fraud or a misrep is going to surface earlier in the cycle. If something performs for an 18-month period or thereabouts, it may be something other than a fraud or a misrep. But there is strong incentive for a lot of these loans to be pushed back to the originator, particularly on a rep and warranty claim and force us to fight our way through the rescission process. So there's not a lot of good history. As BJ pointed out, we lost roughly $5 million per month in the fourth quarter of $17 million, I think was the number. We increased our reserve by about 45 million in the quarter, taking it from roughly $60 million to $106 million. That's a long way of saying there's not a lot of history, we think, that we're getting a lot of the potential volume through the pipeline in 2009, and we're not sure quite where it goes in 2010, but we'll stay on top of it and we'll continue to evaluate.

I think where we get comfort in terms of our guidance and as the loss levels and reserve levels of 2010, is we have pretty aggressively or appropriately migrated grades down, our loans down to the grading process in 2009 and built reserves for these loans, the balances are decreasing.

First quarter results showed continued progress toward returning to sustained profitability. We significantly narrowed our bottom-line loss, further de-risked our balance sheet and made headway in positioning the regional bank to take full advantage of an economic upturn.First quarter's net loss of $0.12 per share was a notable improvement compared to fourth quarter's loss. As you can see on Slide 3, Regional Banking and Capital Markets produced solid results. Although factors such as higher compensation expense and increased foreclosure costs negatively affected linked-quarter comparisons.Our non-strategic businesses impact on results declined because of our proactive approach to credit issues. As nonperforming assets and our outlook for credit continued to improve, we were able to reduce provision expense for the fourth consecutive quarter.Provision expense declined $30 million from last quarter to $105 million as nonperforming assets and charge-offs continue to gradually improve. Additionally, while still elevated, environmental costs improved linked quarter. Although they can be volatile, we're encouraged that first quarter's environmental expenses dropped $21 million from fourth quarter's level.We remain dedicated to improving First Horizon's credit quality and reducing related costs to normal levels. This is critical to returning to sustained profitability. Capital markets will continue to be a high return-on-capital business for us. We are also increasingly focused on building our bank and positioning it so it has the people, product capabilities, procedures and infrastructure to profitably grow revenue as the economy picks up. For example, in recent months, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to hire additional experienced lenders on our footprint. These lenders are creating new customer relationships and along with our overall group of talented lenders, helping us deepen existing relationships and actively pursue additional creditworthy borrowers.During the first quarter, our bankers made more than 100,000 calls to customers and prospects. While we've seen some encouraging signs that customer activity is picking up, overall loan demand remains soft with pay downs, runoff and credit-related actions still more than offsetting new bookings.But once demand improves, and it will as the economy recovers, we'll be set to prudently grow our loan portfolio and related revenue. Customer retention rates remain industry-leading and consolidated average core deposits increased 4.5% from last quarter, suggesting we're well-positioned to fund an eventual upturn in loan demand. All in all, I feel good about our ability to grow revenue as the economy turns up.BJ will now take you through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll be back as we take your questions."

Lower provision and lower expenses were the main drivers, which I'll discuss a little bit on the next",1046,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. On Slide 5, you can see, as Bryan talked about, our net loss narrowing to $28 million with an EPS loss of $0.12. Lower provision and lower expenses were the main drivers, which I'll discuss a little bit on the next slide.And as we turn to the next slide, a quick reminder for you on Slide 6. As you saw last week, we modified our segments to better reflect ongoing focus on our Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses. Key changes again included the addition of the Non-strategic segment, which combines the former Mortgage Banking and National Specialty Lending segments as well as the TruPS portfolio. Correspondent Banking has been moved from Capital Markets to Regional Banking. And third, Regional Banking now includes First Lien Mortgage Production within the footprint. And just as a reminder, the new segment structure is shown in the Appendix, if you want to take a look at that.So again in first quarter '10, the regional bank booked pretax pre-provision earnings of $47 million, down from 4Q '09's levels. First quarter results were negatively impacted by a seasonality from lower NSF fees as well as higher compensation expenses. However, the bank showed some solid trends as average core deposits were up 8%, benefiting from our continued success in repatriating customer deposits through our Wealth Management Group, as well as the seasonal build up during tax season.Our Capital Markets business showed pretax income of $33 million with continued strong average daily revenue of $1.7 million, down just slightly from last quarter's $1.8 million. Expenses are up linked quarter due to the resumption of a normal rate of incentive provisioning and a seasonal increase in FICA expenses. Although we have seen normalization within fixed income, revenues are still strong compared to historical levels.In our Corporate segment, we have a pretax income of $11 million compared to last quarter's loss of $15 million. The improvement was driven primarily by a debt repurchase gain and a termination of related hedging relationships totaling a $17.1 million number, as well as lower repositioning costs. In our Non-Strategic segment, lower mortgage repurchase provision expense, which I'll cover in a minute, as well as lower repositioning costs contributed to the significant decline in loss there.And if we turn to Slide 7, we'll talk a little bit about expenses. Consolidated expenses were $343 million, down 12% from 4Q '09 driven by those lower Non-Strategic segment costs, a decline in environmental costs and reduced repositioning costs from the fourth quarter. Repositioning charges mainly from the shutdown of our Institutional Equity Research business were $11 million, compared to $31 million in fourth quarter of 2009.Moving on to Slide 8. Environmental costs dropped to $52 million this quarter from 4Q '09's $73 million driven by a lower foreclosure and mortgage repurchase provision expenses. Foreclosure costs declined 20% linked quarter or to about $10.5 million from $13 million. The mortgage repurchase provision fell to $41 million from the prior period's $59 million.Although environmental costs were down in the first quarter, they still remain elevated specifically relative to our mortgage repurchased request. Related net charge-offs were $20 million. And we increased the reserve by about $20 million in the first quarter or to about $126 million due to the increase in the aggregate size of the pipeline. The pipeline of requests ended the quarter at $304 million compared to year-end 2009's $260 million. Our rescission rate is about 40% to 50% and remains there and has held constant from previous quarters, as has loss severity. As a reminder, on our process here, when we repurchase alone, it is marked down to fair value and classified as held for sale. And the majority are categorized as nonperforming or the investors may hold [ph] (24:19) for the losses incurred.Currently, 17% of the pipeline is from '06, 60% of vast majority is from '07 and 14% from 2008. As you know, we sold our national mortgage origination platform in August 2008 and ceased national origination at that time. Though the new request pipeline was down slightly this quarter, MI rescissions have increased and could present additional uncertainty. We'll continue to closely monitor environmental costs and expect the continued volatility.So if you turn to Slide 9 and talk about first quarter balance sheet trends and margin. Loans in our Non-Strategic segment shrank 3% or $200 million as we continue to take actions to de-risk our portfolio. As Bryan said, loan demand remains soft but we're seeing a few encouraging signs. Line utilization, although at a low level, has seemingly stabilized. And the pipeline for corporate and asset-based lending activity in particular is actually pretty good. But keep in mind, that typically we don't see net loan growth resume until we're several quarters into an economic recovery. So while we are pleased with the calling activity of our bankers, we are realistic in our outlook for meaningful growth.Consolidated average core deposits were up 4.5%, reflecting positive customer trends in the regional bank. Notably, our loan-to-core deposits ratio improved to 114% at the end of the first quarter from 4Q's 122% and a year ago 149%. And our funding mix continues to improve with low-cost core deposits now representing 96% of total deposits.Loan pricing continues to improve. Spreads in the regional bank were up 12 basis points from 4Q '09 and 75 basis points from a year ago, reflecting better pricing ability. Also, our bankers are now more engaged in implementing rate floors in our commercial loan portfolio.First quarter's consolidated net interest margin was unchanged linked quarter at 3.19%, but up 30 basis points from a year ago. Regional bank's NIM was a strong 4.96%, up about a basis point linked quarter. And we do not expect much margin expansions until interest rates start to move higher.In summary, the first quarter showed steady progress towards our return to sustained profitability. Our balance sheet remains strong with a TCE to TA at 7:7, a Tier 1 to common improved to Tier 9.9. Net interest margin is stable and expense is declining.Our ongoing focus on profitably expanding our customer base as well as deepening existing customer relationships should position us well for renewed revenue growth as the economy improves. And now, Greg will take you through the credit trends."

In the first quarter, net charge-offs were flat to fourth quarter overall but a little better than they looked. Charge-offs were previously off balance sheet. Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage loans now flow through our charge-off line rather than being accounted for within their respective securitizations. These additional charge-offs totaled about $3.5 million for the quarter. We also took $13.5 million in losses because we accelerated charge-off recognition in the Permanent Mortgage portfolio. This was provision expense neutral.Reserves decreased $53 million driven primarily by reserve releases in the OTC and Permanent Mortgage portfolios. We had a modest, just over 1% reserve build in the commercial portfolios, driven by an increasing mix of individually impaired credits, for which holding reserves, as opposed to immediately charging down, is the appropriate action.Despite the overall reserve decrease, we remain well-reserved versus industry peers, and are comfortable with the level of reserves we hold relative to the inherent risk content we see in the portfolio.Moving on to Slide 12. Nonperforming assets declined 17% year-over-year and we saw a modest decline linked quarter, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of NPA decline. The decrease in the quarter was driven by a continued progress in the OTC portfolio, where nonperforming loans declined 47%. Offset by NPL growth in the Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage portfolios due to increased loan modification activity, and commercial portfolios, due to continued deterioration in financial services related exposures and soft landing strategies in commercial real estate.Soft landing is how we refer to situations where we are able to restructure certain real estate loans with viable long-term customers. However, the restructure results in non-accrual status per regulatory guidance.Nonperforming levels decreased over the quarter but at a slower rate than our exceptional fourth quarter results. Inflows edged up largely due to two additional trust preferred interest deferrals, deterioration and bank-related exposures and one large soft landing relationship in the bank.Outflows declined from very active fourth quarter levels. ORE inflows slowed and our overall level of ORE remained flat to last quarter. Valuation adjustments, which are ongoing marks to ensure our carrying values remain reflective of market values, decreased during the quarter, a positive reflection of our diligence in this area in past periods.For the past several quarters, we had said that we expect the mix of our NPAs to shift a bit and include proportionally more ORE relative to nonperforming loans and has been the case in recent periods. Lengthening foreclosure processes have pushed this event out somewhat, but we now expect ORE levels to peak during the second and third quarters of 2010, then begin a gradual decline.Now, I'll give you a little color on each of our major sub-portfolios, starting with our Income CRE portfolio on Slide 13. This portfolio remains stressed but is exhibiting some stability with both delinquency rates in nonperforming balances flat in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs were down $9 million to $19 million. But we expect that some quarter-to-quarter volatility in this portfolio, so no trend should be inferred yet. Reserve levels decreased slightly as balances declined. We continue to see some deterioration in the risk profile of this portfolio, but at a decreasing rate compared to 2009. Land exposures, retail properties and apartments remain the poorest performing property types in the Income CRE portfolio. In summary, we feel that we have the risk in this portfolio well-identified, and that we are adequately reserved. We continue to expect industry-wide conditions for Income CRE to remain stressed over the next 18 to 24 months.Moving to Slide 14. Recall that our C&I portfolio is a diversified granular portfolio of loans to many different industries but it also houses our exposure to the financial services industries, including loans to bank holding companies, which represent 3% of this portfolio and trust preferred loans which represents 7% of the C&I book. Remember also that on our new presentation format, essentially all of the core C&I is housed in the Regional Bank segment, along with bank-related exposures. Trust preferred loans are now accounted for in the Non-Strategic segment.I'll first speak to the core C&I portfolio, where the portion of the book that excludes trust preferred and bank-related exposures. Conditions in this book are stable to improving, although charge-off and non-accrual results for first quarter appear to contradict this statement. Indicators of an improvement include an improving weighted average internal risk rate into the portfolio, improving watch list trends, increased upgrade activity, stable delinquency, and positive field level intelligence. Overall C&I charge-offs increased from $21 million in the fourth quarter to $28 million in the first quarter, however $19 million of first quarter charge-offs were bank-related while none of the fourth quarters were. Core C&I charge-offs actually decreased for the fourth quarter. C&I nonperforming loans rose in the first quarter even for the non-bank-related exposures. We do not think this is a long-term trend for core C&I, but rather, is reflective of the continued deterioration of credits to weaker companies that are not seeing the same positive trends as better positioned ones.It's important to note that an increasing number of our nonperforming C&I loans remain current on principal and interest payments and are judged to be impaired due to an inability to demonstrate a continued capacity to maintain their historic payment record. Reserve levels for the core C&I portfolio increased because the impairment assessment methodology employed for the majority of troubled C&I assets typically calls for holding reserves for inherent losses rather than the immediate charge-down process that typically it follow when troubled assets are collateral dependent.With respect to trust preferred and bank-related exposures, you'll find more detail on Slide 15. As expected, these portfolios continue to show very significant stress. In the first quarter, we had two additional banks elect interest deferral on their trust preferred loans for a total of six financial institutions now in deferral, totaling $64 million. As I just noted, $19 million of our $28 million of first quarter's C&I charge-offs were associated with our bank-related loan portfolio. We continue to be vigilant in management of these portfolios and prudent with our reserve coverage which stands at 17.25%. Given the fact that many of the loans in these portfolios are to strong profitable operations, we are very comfortable with this level of reserve. Expect continued deterioration and potential quarter-to-quarter volatility in reported results for this book.On Slide 16, you'll see that the Home Equity portfolio delinquency trends are stable to improving, particularly in the regional bank and that non-strategic balances continue their slow runoff. Note, about $200 million of home equity loans that were previously accounted for and off balance sheet securitization began to be accounted for in the Non-Strategic segment in January. This caused a small increase in delinquency as that performs worse than the balance of the portfolio.The primary external driver of delinquency remains unemployment. Underlying origination characteristics that drive performance remain vintage, origination channel, credit score and lien position.Slide 17 provides an update on the major components of the Non-Strategic portfolios. One-time closed balances are down to $105 million as we near completion of a very successful wind-down of this book. These commitments totaled $3 billion in the beginning of 2008.Balances in the Permanent Mortgage portfolio are expected to decline from this point forward, as the inflow of a proportion of the performing completed OTC loans ceases. Delinquency trends are improving and the level of required reserves at quarter end decreased as a result. Non-performers were up due to increased loan modification activity and because the foreclosure process has becoming extended in many geographies. We accelerated loss recognition practices in this portfolio during the quarter, resulting in a $13.5 million increase over what losses would have been without this change.Progress continues in winding down the Non-strategic Residential CRE or homebuilder portfolio, with commitments down 86% since announcing our exit from this business line. Charge-offs and non-performing balances decreased in this portfolio during the quarter.Wrapping up on Slide 18. Our first quarter results with respect to losses in reserve levels were largely as expected, and our expectations for 2010 remain intact. We will experience an improving trend, meaning lower losses and required reserves as we progress through the year. However, there's potential for quarter-to-quarter volatility due to the lumpy nature of our most stressed portfolios. This expectation does assume, however, that the current economic trends continue. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

This quarter was influenced by some lumpiness, particularly, we talked about soft lending relationship that was a pretty sizable relationship. We opted to take a strategy with that long-term customer, that was the appropriate thing to do. But per regulatory guidance, needed to be called a non-performing loan. It's an increasing number of non-performers that are on current on principal and interest. So there's a number of factors driving first quarter results.

I would say that we've seen a little bit of some mixed trends this quarter, which doesn't mean that it's getting better overall, it just means that we have a few more things that have been encouraging. Though the negative still outweigh the positives. So for instance, if you look at 4Q '09 to 1Q '10 on Slide 8, our new requests are actually slightly down. The mix of those requests has changed a little bit, meaning more towards MI rescissions, which could pose additional losses to us. But that's actually a cautious positive trend. We also have a lot more focus, loss mitigation efforts than even we had in the past, to make sure that we are pushing back as much as possible. So it's kind of hard to predict as we sit here today.

But there's almost a natural floor, as you know, to where you can go in an extended low rate environment. So as I said previously, we expect our margin to be flat throughout the rest of the year, borrowing interest rate increases from the Fed."

If you think about the two segments of the portfolio that you pointed out, we do feel pretty good about where the bank portfolio is and the opportunity to see that grow over the course of the year. The non-strategic, or these wind-down portfolios, a lot of the rapid decline that you've seen in them over the last couple of years is essentially the decline in the construction portfolios, which totaled about $4 billion in outstandings in January of 2008. They're down to $350 million or so today. But $250 million on homebuilder and about $100 million in one-time close. So there's not a lot of room for those to continue to decline. We will work through them and they will go away, largely over the course of this year. The Home Equity portfolio has been running off. It was probably $200 million or so this quarter. It's amortizing at about a 15%, 16% CPR over the last couple of quarters. So it will be a little bit more stable. Over time, that will wind down as not being replenished. It will wind down towards zero. But over that time, we will see growth and deployment of capital in the Banking business. So it should somewhat offset."

It looks like the loss-sharing levels are going to be increased or reduced depending on which size of the table you're looking at it from. I think that's good, as from an FDIC fund perspective and as somebody that pays part of the cost of that, we think that's a positive. We think it makes the deals marginally less attractive.

First quarter results showed continued progress toward returning to sustained profitability. We significantly narrowed our bottom-line loss, further de-risked our balance sheet and made headway in positioning the regional bank to take full advantage of an economic upturn.
First quarter's net loss of $0.12 per share was a notable improvement compared to fourth quarter's loss. As you can see on Slide 3, Regional Banking and Capital Markets produced solid results. Although factors such as higher compensation expense and increased foreclosure costs negatively affected linked-quarter comparisons.
Our non-strategic businesses impact on results declined because of our proactive approach to credit issues. As nonperforming assets and our outlook for credit continued to improve, we were able to reduce provision expense for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Provision expense declined $30 million from last quarter to $105 million as nonperforming assets and charge-offs continue to gradually improve. Additionally, while still elevated, environmental costs improved linked quarter. Although they can be volatile, we're encouraged that first quarter's environmental expenses dropped $21 million from fourth quarter's level.
We remain dedicated to improving First Horizon's credit quality and reducing related costs to normal levels. This is critical to returning to sustained profitability. Capital markets will continue to be a high return-on-capital business for us. 
We are also increasingly focused on building our bank and positioning it so that it has the people, product capabilities, procedures and infrastructure to profitably grow revenue as the economy picks up. For example, in recent months, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to hire additional experienced lenders in our footprint. These lenders are creating new customer relationships and along with our overall group of talented lenders, helping us deepen existing relationships and actively pursue additional creditworthy borrowers.
During the first quarter, our bankers made more than 100,000 calls to customers and prospects. While we've seen some encouraging signs that customer activity is picking up, overall loan demand remains soft with pay downs, runoff and credit-related actions still more than offsetting new bookings.
But once demand improves, and it will as the economy recovers, we'll be set to prudently grow our loan portfolio and related revenue. Customer retention rates remain industry-leading and consolidated average core deposits increased 4.5% from last quarter, suggesting we're well-positioned to fund an eventual upturn in loan demand. All in all, I feel good about our ability to grow revenue as the economy turns up.
BJ will now take you through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll be back as we take your questions."

Good morning, everybody. On Slide 5, you can see, as Bryan talked about, our net loss narrowing to $28 million with an EPS loss of $0.12. Lower provision and lower expenses were the main drivers, which I'll discuss a little bit on the next",1054,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. On Slide 5, you can see, as Bryan talked about, our net loss narrowing to $28 million with an EPS loss of $0.12. Lower provision and lower expenses were the main drivers, which I'll discuss a little bit on the next slide.
And as we turn to the next slide, a quick reminder for you on Slide 6. As you saw last week, we modified our segments to better reflect ongoing focus on our Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses. Key changes again included the addition of the Non-Strategic segment, which combines the former Mortgage Banking and National Specialty Lending segments as well as the TruPS portfolio. Correspondent Banking has been moved from Capital Markets to Regional Banking. And third, Regional Banking now includes First Lien Mortgage Production within the footprint. And just as a reminder, the new segment structure is shown in the Appendix, if you want to take a look at that.
So again in first quarter '10, the regional bank booked pretax pre-provision earnings of $47 million, down from 4Q '09's levels. First quarter results were negatively impacted by seasonality from lower NSF fees as well as higher compensation expenses. However, the bank showed some solid trends as average core deposits were up 8%, benefiting from our continued success in repatriating customer deposits through our Wealth Management Group, as well as the seasonal build up during tax season.
Our Capital Markets business showed pretax income of $33 million with continued strong average daily revenue of $1.7 million, down just slightly from last quarter's $1.8 million. Expenses are up linked quarter due to the resumption of a normal rate of incentive provisioning and a seasonal increase in FICA expenses. Although we have seen normalization within fixed income, revenues are still strong compared to historical levels.
In our Corporate segment, we had pretax income of $11 million compared to last quarter's loss of $15 million. The improvement was driven primarily by a debt repurchase gain and a termination of related hedging relationships totaling a $17.1 million number, as well as lower repositioning costs. 
In our Non-Strategic segment, lower mortgage repurchase provision expense, which I'll cover in a minute, as well as lower repositioning costs contributed to the significant decline in loss there.
And if we turn to Slide 7, talk a little bit about expenses. Consolidated expenses were $343 million, down 12% from 4Q '09 driven by those lower Non-Strategic segment costs, a decline in environmental costs and reduced repositioning costs from the fourth quarter. Repositioning charges mainly from the shutdown of our Institutional Equity Research business were $11 million, compared to $31 million in fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving on to Slide 8. Environmental costs dropped to $52 million this quarter from 4Q '09's $73 million driven by a lower foreclosure and mortgage repurchase provision expenses. Foreclosure costs declined 20% linked quarter or to about $10.5 million from $13 million. The mortgage repurchase provision fell to $41 million from the prior period's $59 million.
Although environmental costs were down in the first quarter, they still remain elevated specifically relative to our mortgage repurchased request. Related net charge-offs were $20 million. And we increased the reserve by about $20 million in the first quarter or to about $126 million due to the increase in the aggregate size of the pipeline. 
The pipeline of requests ended the quarter at $304 million compared to year-end 2009's $260 million. Our rescission rate is about 40% to 50% and remains there and has held constant from previous quarters, as has loss severity. As a reminder, on our process here, when we repurchase alone, it is marked down to fair value and classified as held for sale. And the majority are categorized as nonperforming or the investors may hold [ph] (24:19) for the losses incurred.
Currently, 17% of the pipeline is from '06, 60% of vast majority is from '07 and 14% from 2008. As you know, we sold our national mortgage origination platform in August 2008 and ceased national origination at that time. Though the new request pipeline was down slightly this quarter, MI rescissions have increased and could present additional uncertainty. We'll continue to closely monitor environmental costs and expect the continued volatility.
So if you turn to Slide 9 and talk about first quarter balance sheet trends and margin. Loans in our Non-Strategic segment shrank 3% or $200 million as we continue to take actions to de-risk our portfolio. As Bryan said, loan demand remains soft but we're seeing a few encouraging signs. Line utilization, although at a low level, has seemingly stabilized. And the pipeline for corporate and asset-based lending activity in particular is actually pretty good. But keep in mind, that typically we don't see net loan growth resume until we're several quarters into an economic recovery. So while we are pleased with the calling activity of our bankers, we are realistic in our outlook for meaningful growth.
Consolidated average core deposits were up 4.5%, reflecting positive customer trends in the regional bank. Notably, our loan-to-core deposits ratio improved to 114% at the end of the first quarter from 4Q's 122% and a year ago 149%. And our funding mix continues to improve with low-cost core deposits now representing 96% of total deposits.
Loan pricing continues to improve. Spreads in the regional bank were up 12 basis points from 4Q '09 and 75 basis points from a year ago, reflecting better pricing ability. Also, our bankers are now more engaged in implementing rate floors in our commercial loan portfolio.
First quarter's consolidated net interest margin was unchanged linked quarter at 3.19%, but up 30 basis points from a year ago. Regional bank's NIM was a strong 4.96%, up about a basis point linked quarter. And we do not expect much margin expansion until interest rates start to move higher.
In summary, first quarter showed steady progress towards our return to sustained profitability. Our balance sheet remained strong with a TCE to TA at 7:7, a Tier 1 to common improved to Tier 9.9, net interest margins stable and expenses declining.
Our ongoing focus on profitably expanding our customer base as well as deepening existing customer relationships should position us well for renewed revenue growth as the economy improves. And now, Greg will take you through the credit trends."
272721,100068035,56463,"First Horizon National Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2010",2010-04-16,"Earnings Calls","First Horizon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, BJ. I'll start on Slide 11. In the first quarter, net charge-offs were flat to fourth quarter overall but a little better than they look. Charge-offs for previously off balance sheet. Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage loans now flow through our c",1420,"Thanks, BJ. I'll start on Slide 11. In the first quarter, net charge-offs were flat to fourth quarter overall but a little better than they look. Charge-offs for previously off balance sheet. Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage loans now flow through our charge-off line rather than being accounted for within their respective securitizations. These additional charge-offs totaled about $3.5 million for the quarter. 
We also took $13.5 million in losses because we accelerated charge-off recognition in the Permanent Mortgage portfolio. This was provision expense neutral.
Reserves decreased $53 million driven primarily by reserve releases in the OTC and Permanent Mortgage portfolios. We had a modest, just over 1% reserve build in the commercial portfolios, driven by an increasing mix of individually impaired credits, for which holding reserves, as opposed to immediately charging down, is the appropriate action.
Despite the overall reserve decrease, we remain well-reserved versus industry peers, and are comfortable with the level of reserves we hold relative to the inherent risk content we see in the portfolio.
Moving on to Slide 12. Nonperforming assets declined 17% year-over-year and we saw a modest decline linked quarter, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of NPA decline. The decrease in the quarter was driven by a continued progress in the OTC portfolio, where nonperforming loans declined 47%. Offset by NPL growth in the Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage portfolios due to increased loan modification activity, and commercial portfolios, due to continued deterioration in financial services related exposures and soft landing strategies in commercial real estate.
Soft landing is how we refer to situations where we are able to restructure certain real estate loans with viable long-term customers. However, the restructure results in non-accrual status per regulatory guidance.
Nonperforming levels decreased over the quarter but at a slower rate than our exceptional fourth quarter results. Inflows edged up largely due to two additional trust preferred interest deferrals, deterioration and bank-related exposures and one large soft landing relationship in the bank.
Outflows declined from very active fourth quarter levels. ORE inflows slowed and our overall level of ORE remained flat to last quarter. Valuation adjustments, which are ongoing marks to ensure our carrying values remain reflective of market values, decreased during the quarter, a positive reflection of our diligence in this area in past periods.
For the past several quarters, we had said that we expect the mix of our NPAs to shift a bit and include proportionally more ORE relative to nonperforming loans and has been the case in recent periods. Lengthening foreclosure processes have pushed this event out somewhat, but we now expect ORE levels to peak during the second and third quarters of 2010, then begin a gradual decline.
Now, I'll give you a little color on each of our major sub-portfolios, starting with our Income CRE portfolio on Slide 13. This portfolio remains stressed but is exhibiting some stability with both delinquency rates in nonperforming balances flat in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs were down $9 million to $19 million. But we expect that some quarter-to-quarter volatility in this portfolio, so no trend should be inferred yet. Reserve levels decreased slightly as balances declined. 
We continued to see some deterioration in the risk profile of this portfolio, but at a decreasing rate compared to 2009. Land exposures, retail properties and apartments remain the poorest performing property types in the Income CRE portfolio. 
In summary, we feel that we have the risk in this portfolio well-identified, and that we are adequately reserved. We continue to expect industry-wide conditions for Income CRE to remain stressed over the next 18 to 24 months.
Moving to Slide 14. Recall that our C&I portfolio is a diversified granular portfolio of loans to many different industries but it also houses our exposure to the financial services industries, including loans to bank holding companies, which represent 3% of this portfolio and trust preferred loans which represent 7% of the C&I book. 
Remember also that on our new presentation format, essentially all of the core C&I is housed in the Regional Bank segment, along with bank-related exposures. Trust preferred loans are now accounted for in the Non-Strategic segment.
I'll first speak to the core C&I portfolio, where the portion of the book that excludes trust preferred and bank-related exposures. Conditions in this book are stable to improving, although charge-off and non-accrual results for first quarter appear to contradict this statement. Indicators of improvement include an improving weighted average internal risk rate into the portfolio, improving watch list trends, increased upgrade activity, stable delinquency, and positive field level intelligence. 
Overall C&I charge-offs increased from $21 million in the fourth quarter to $28 million in the first quarter, however $19 million of first quarter charge-offs were bank-related while none of the fourth quarter’s were. Core C&I charge-offs actually decreased for the fourth quarter. 
C&I nonperforming loans rose in the first quarter even for the non-bank-related exposures. We do not think this is a long-term trend for core C&I, but rather, is reflective of the continued deterioration of credits to weaker companies that are not seeing the same positive trends as better positioned ones.
It's important to note that an increasing number of our nonperforming C&I loans remain current on principal and interest payments and are judged to be impaired due to an inability to demonstrate a continued capacity to maintain their historic payment record. 
Reserve levels for the core C&I portfolio increased because the impairment assessment methodology employed for the majority of troubled C&I assets typically calls for holding reserves for inherent losses rather than the immediate charge-down process that typically it follow when troubled assets are collateral dependent.
With respect to trust preferred and bank-related exposures, you'll find more detail on Slide 15. As expected, these portfolios continue to show very significant stress. In the first quarter, we had two additional banks elect interest deferral on their trust preferred loans for a total of six financial institutions now in deferral, totaling $64 million. As I just noted, $19 million of our $28 million of first quarter's C&I charge-offs were associated with our bank-related loan portfolio. 
We continue to be vigilant in management of these portfolios and prudent with our reserve coverage which stands at 17.25%. Given the fact that many of the loans in these portfolios are to strong profitable operations, we are very comfortable with this level of reserve. Expect continued deterioration and potential quarter-to-quarter volatility in reported results for this book.
On Slide 16, you'll see that the Home Equity portfolio delinquency trends are stable to improving, particularly in the regional bank and that non-strategic balances continue their slow runoff. Note, about $200 million of home equity loans that were previously accounted for and off balance sheet securitization began to be accounted for in the Non-Strategic segment in January. This caused a small increase in delinquency as that performs worse than the balance of the portfolio.
The primary external driver of delinquency remains unemployment. Underlying origination characteristics that drive performance remain vintage, origination channel, credit score and lien position.
Slide 17 provides an update on the major components of the Non-Strategic portfolios. One-time closed balances are down to $105 million as we near completion of a very successful wind-down of this book. These commitments totaled $3 billion in the beginning of 2008.
Balances in the Permanent Mortgage portfolio are expected to decline from this point forward, as the inflow of a proportion of the performing completed OTC loans ceases. Delinquency trends are improving and the level of required reserves at quarter end decreased as a result. Non-performers were up due to increased loan modification activity and because the foreclosure process has becoming extended in many geographies. We accelerated loss recognition practices in this portfolio during the quarter, resulting in a $13.5 million increase over what losses would have been without this change.
Progress continues in winding down the Non-strategic Residential CRE or homebuilder portfolio, with commitments down 86% since announcing our exit from this business line. Charge-offs and non-performing balances decreased in this portfolio during the quarter.
Wrapping up on Slide 18. Our first quarter results with respect to losses in reserve levels were largely as expected, and our expectations for 2010 remain intact. We will experience an improving trend, meaning lower losses and required reserves as we progress through the year. However, there's potential for quarter-to-quarter volatility due to the lumpy nature of our most stressed portfolios. This expectation does assume, however, that the current economic trends continue. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

We look at it every quarter and see what our inflows are and how are our loss mitigations are going. We thought this quarter was prudent to again, build the reserve based on the aggregate size of the pipeline. What I might say though is that where the last two quarters we've seen virtually all negative trends. I would say that we've seen a little bit of some mixed trends this quarter, which doesn't mean that it's getting better overall, it just means that we have a few more things that have been encouraging. Though the negative still outweigh the positives. So for instance, if you look at 4Q '09 to 1Q '10 on Slide 8, our new requests are actually slightly down. The mix of those requests has changed a little bit, meaning more towards MI rescissions, which could pose additional losses to us. But that's actually a cautious positive trend. We also have a lot more focus, loss mitigation efforts than even we had in the past, to make sure that we are pushing back as much as possible. So it's kind of hard to predict as we sit here today. We feel like we have a pretty good reserve relative to what the inherent loss content is in the pipeline, plus trying to look forward a little bit. So we'll just continue to monitor it, as I said."

And utilization on existing commitments out there would certainly help us, in terms of, loan balances going forward. Some of the market shares that we think we're generating, or will generate from the pipelines, that are growing from these lenders that we've hired, coupled with some of the bright spots in corporate and ABL, we think it largely offsets some of that. So we don't have a lot of expectations of large growth. We're probably looking at flat to slightly down. But not precipitously down is what we're looking at."

If you think about the two segments of the portfolio that you pointed out, we do feel pretty good about where the bank portfolio is and the opportunity to see that grow over the course of the year. The non-strategic, or these wind-down portfolios, a lot of the rapid decline that you've seen in them over the last couple of years is essentially the decline in the construction portfolios, which totaled about $4 billion in outstandings in January of 2008. They're down to $350 million or so today. But $250 million on homebuilder and about $100 million in one-time close. So there's not a lot of room for those to continue to decline. We will work through them and they will go away, largely over the course of this year. The Home Equity portfolio has been running off. It was probably $200 million or so this quarter. It's amortizing at about a 15%, 16% CPR over the last couple of quarters. So it will be a little bit more stable. Over time, that will wind down as not being replenished. It will wind down towards zero. But over that time, we will see growth and deployment of capital in the Banking business. So it should somewhat offset."

In absolute sense, I guess you've seen what would appear to be more troubled signals of troubled institutions in the marketplace. It's in and around Tennessee. I'm not sure that changes our thinking about the opportunities an awful lot. I think the other big dynamic is change. And it's, sort of, a positive and a negative as I think about it. The FDIC bidding process has clearly gotten more competitive. It looks like the loss-sharing levels are going to be increased or reduced depending on which size of the table you're looking at it from. I think that's good, as from an FDIC fund perspective and as somebody that pays part of the cost of that, we think that's a positive. We think it makes the deals marginally less attractive. So back to my comments earlier, we're most focused on making sure that, whether it's FDIC in the future or regular way deal, we're doing something that makes sense from the franchise that we're trying to build. Where we can build the density we'd like to operate with, where we can build the focus in markets that look like Tennessee markets.

First quarter results showed continued progress toward returning to sustained profitability. We significantly narrowed our bottom-line loss, further de-risked our balance sheet and made headway in positioning the regional bank to take full advantage of an economic upturn.
First quarter's net loss of $0.12 per share was a notable improvement compared to fourth quarter's loss. As you can see on Slide 3, Regional Banking and Capital Markets produced solid results. Although factors such as higher compensation expense and increased foreclosure costs negatively affected linked-quarter comparisons.
Our non-strategic businesses impact on results declined because of our proactive approach to credit issues. As nonperforming assets and our outlook for credit continued to improve, we were able to reduce provision expense for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Provision expense declined $30 million from last quarter to $105 million as nonperforming assets and charge-offs continue to gradually improve. Additionally, while still elevated, environmental costs improved linked quarter. Although they can be volatile, we're encouraged that first quarter's environmental expenses dropped $21 million from fourth quarter's level.
We remain dedicated to improving First Horizon's credit quality and reducing related costs to normal levels. This is critical to returning to sustained profitability. Capital markets will continue to be a high return-on-capital business for us. 
We are also increasingly focused on building our bank and positioning it so that it has the people, product capabilities, procedures and infrastructure to profitably grow revenue as the economy picks up. For example, in recent months, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to hire additional experienced lenders in our footprint. These lenders are creating new customer relationships and along with our overall group of talented lenders, helping us deepen existing relationships and actively pursue additional creditworthy borrowers.
During the first quarter, our bankers made more than 100,000 calls to customers and prospects. While we've seen some encouraging signs that customer activity is picking up, overall loan demand remains soft with pay downs, runoff and credit-related actions still more than offsetting new bookings.
But once demand improves, and it will as the economy recovers, we'll be set to prudently grow our loan portfolio and related revenue. Customer retention rates remain industry-leading and consolidated average core deposits increased 4.5% from last quarter, suggesting we're well-positioned to fund an eventual upturn in loan demand. All in all, I feel good about our ability to grow revenue as the economy turns up.
BJ will now take you through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll be back as we take your questions."

Good morning, everybody. On Slide 5, you can see, as Bryan talked about, our net loss narrowing to $28 million with an EPS loss of $0.12. Lower provision and lower expenses were the main drivers, which I'll discuss a little bit on the next",1052,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. On Slide 5, you can see, as Bryan talked about, our net loss narrowing to $28 million with an EPS loss of $0.12. Lower provision and lower expenses were the main drivers, which I'll discuss a little bit on the next slide.
And as we turn to the next slide, a quick reminder for you on Slide 6. As you saw last week, we modified our segments to better reflect ongoing focus on our Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses. Key changes again included the addition of the Non-Strategic segment, which combines the former Mortgage Banking and National Specialty Lending segments as well as the TruPS portfolio. Correspondent Banking has been moved from Capital Markets to Regional Banking. And third, Regional Banking now includes First Lien Mortgage Production within the footprint. And just as a reminder, the new segment structure is shown in the Appendix, if you want to take a look at that.
So again in first quarter '10, the regional bank booked pretax pre-provision earnings of $47 million, down from 4Q '09's levels. First quarter results were negatively impacted by seasonality from lower NSF fees as well as higher compensation expenses. However, the bank showed some solid trends as average core deposits were up 8%, benefiting from our continued success in repatriating customer deposits through our Wealth Management Group, as well as the seasonal build up during tax season.
Our Capital Markets business showed pretax income of $33 million with continued strong average daily revenue of $1.7 million, down just slightly from last quarter's $1.8 million. Expenses are up linked quarter due to the resumption of a normal rate of incentive provisioning and a seasonal increase in FICA expenses. Although we have seen normalization within fixed income, revenues are still strong compared to historical levels.
In our Corporate segment, we had pretax income of $11 million compared to last quarter's loss of $15 million. The improvement was driven primarily by a debt repurchase gain and a termination of related hedging relationships totaling a $17.1 million number, as well as lower repositioning costs. 
In our Non-Strategic segment, lower mortgage repurchase provision expense, which I'll cover in a minute, as well as lower repositioning costs contributed to the significant decline in loss there.
And if we turn to Slide 7, talk a little bit about expenses. Consolidated expenses were $343 million, down 12% from 4Q '09 driven by those lower Non-Strategic segment costs, a decline in environmental costs and reduced repositioning costs from the fourth quarter. Repositioning charges mainly from the shutdown of our Institutional Equity Research business were $11 million, compared to $31 million in fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving on to Slide 8. Environmental costs dropped to $52 million this quarter from 4Q '09's $73 million driven by a lower foreclosure and mortgage repurchase provision expenses. Foreclosure costs declined 20% linked quarter or to about $10.5 million from $13 million. The mortgage repurchase provision fell to $41 million from the prior period's $59 million.
Although environmental costs were down in the first quarter, they still remain elevated specifically relative to our mortgage repurchased request. Related net charge-offs were $20 million. And we increased the reserve by about $20 million in the first quarter or to about $126 million due to the increase in the aggregate size of the pipeline. 
The pipeline of requests ended the quarter at $304 million compared to year-end 2009's $260 million. Our rescission rate is about 40% to 50% and remains there and has held constant from previous quarters, as has loss severity. As a reminder, on our process here, when we repurchase alone, it is marked down to fair value and classified as held for sale. And the majority are categorized as nonperforming or the investors made whole for the losses incurred.
Currently, 17% of the pipeline is from '06, 60% of vast majority is from '07 and 14% from 2008. As you know, we sold our national mortgage origination platform in August 2008 and ceased national origination at that time. Though the new request pipeline was down slightly this quarter, MI rescissions have increased and could present additional uncertainty. We'll continue to closely monitor environmental costs and expect the continued volatility.
So if you turn to Slide 9 and talk about first quarter balance sheet trends and margin. Loans in our Non-Strategic segment shrank 3% or $200 million as we continue to take actions to de-risk our portfolio. As Bryan said, loan demand remains soft but we're seeing a few encouraging signs. Line utilization, although at a low level, has seemingly stabilized. And the pipeline for corporate and asset-based lending activity in particular is actually pretty good. But keep in mind, that typically we don't see net loan growth resume until we're several quarters into an economic recovery. So while we are pleased with the calling activity of our bankers, we are realistic in our outlook for meaningful growth.
Consolidated average core deposits were up 4.5%, reflecting positive customer trends in the regional bank. Notably, our loan-to-core deposits ratio improved to 114% at the end of the first quarter from 4Q's 122% and a year ago 149%. And our funding mix continues to improve with low-cost core deposits now representing 96% of total deposits.
Loan pricing continues to improve. Spreads in the regional bank were up 12 basis points from 4Q '09 and 75 basis points from a year ago, reflecting better pricing ability. Also, our bankers are now more engaged in implementing rate floors in our commercial loan portfolio.
First quarter's consolidated net interest margin was unchanged linked quarter at 3.19%, but up 30 basis points from a year ago. Regional bank's NIM was a strong 4.96%, up about a basis point linked quarter. And we do not expect much margin expansion until interest rates start to move higher.
In summary, first quarter showed steady progress towards our return to sustained profitability. Our balance sheet remained strong with a TCE to TA at 7:7, a Tier 1 to common improved to Tier 9.9, net interest margins stable and expenses declining.
Our ongoing focus on profitably expanding our customer base as well as deepening existing customer relationships should position us well for renewed revenue growth as the economy improves. And now, Greg will take you through the credit trends."

In the first quarter, net charge-offs were flat to fourth quarter overall but a little better than they look. Charge-offs for previously off balance sheet. Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage loans now flow through our charge-off line rather than being accounted for within their respective securitizations. These additional charge-offs totaled about $3.5 million for the quarter. 
We also took $13.5 million in losses because we accelerated charge-off recognition in the Permanent Mortgage portfolio. This was provision expense neutral.
Reserves decreased $53 million driven primarily by reserve releases in the OTC and Permanent Mortgage portfolios. We had a modest, just over 1% reserve build in the commercial portfolios, driven by an increasing mix of individually impaired credits, for which holding reserves, as opposed to immediately charging down, is the appropriate action.
Despite the overall reserve decrease, we remain well-reserved versus industry peers, and are comfortable with the level of reserves we hold relative to the inherent risk content we see in the portfolio.
Moving on to Slide 12. Nonperforming assets declined 17% year-over-year and we saw a modest decline linked quarter, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of NPA decline. The decrease in the quarter was driven by a continued progress in the OTC portfolio, where nonperforming loans declined 47%. Offset by NPL growth in the Home Equity and Permanent Mortgage portfolios due to increased loan modification activity, and commercial portfolios, due to continued deterioration in financial services related exposures and soft landing strategies in commercial real estate.
Soft landing is how we refer to situations where we are able to restructure certain real estate loans with viable long-term customers. However, the restructure results in non-accrual status per regulatory guidance.
Nonperforming levels decreased over the quarter but at a slower rate than our exceptional fourth quarter results. Inflows edged up largely due to two additional trust preferred interest deferrals, deterioration and bank-related exposures and one large soft landing relationship in the bank.
Outflows declined from very active fourth quarter levels. ORE inflows slowed and our overall level of ORE remained flat to last quarter. Valuation adjustments, which are ongoing marks to ensure our carrying values remain reflective of market values, decreased during the quarter, a positive reflection of our diligence in this area in past periods.
For the past several quarters, we had said that we expect the mix of our NPAs to shift a bit and include proportionally more ORE relative to nonperforming loans and has been the case in recent periods. Lengthening foreclosure processes have pushed this event out somewhat, but we now expect ORE levels to peak during the second and third quarters of 2010, then begin a gradual decline.
Now, I'll give you a little color on each of our major sub-portfolios, starting with our Income CRE portfolio on Slide 13. This portfolio remains stressed but is exhibiting some stability with both delinquency rates in nonperforming balances flat in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs were down $9 million to $19 million. But we expect that some quarter-to-quarter volatility in this portfolio, so no trend should be inferred yet. Reserve levels decreased slightly as balances declined. 
We continued to see some deterioration in the risk profile of this portfolio, but at a decreasing rate compared to 2009. Land exposures, retail properties and apartments remain the poorest performing property types in the Income CRE portfolio. 
In summary, we feel that we have the risk in this portfolio well-identified, and that we are adequately reserved. We continue to expect industry-wide conditions for Income CRE to remain stressed over the next 18 to 24 months.
Moving to Slide 14. Recall that our C&I portfolio is a diversified granular portfolio of loans to many different industries but it also houses our exposure to the financial services industries, including loans to bank holding companies, which represent 3% of this portfolio and trust preferred loans which represent 7% of the C&I book. 
Remember also that on our new presentation format, essentially all of the core C&I is housed in the Regional Bank segment, along with bank-related exposures. Trust preferred loans are now accounted for in the Non-Strategic segment.
I'll first speak to the core C&I portfolio, where the portion of the book that excludes trust preferred and bank-related exposures. Conditions in this book are stable to improving, although charge-off and non-accrual results for first quarter appear to contradict this statement. Indicators of improvement include an improving weighted average internal risk rate into the portfolio, improving watch list trends, increased upgrade activity, stable delinquency, and positive field level intelligence. 
Overall C&I charge-offs increased from $21 million in the fourth quarter to $28 million in the first quarter, however $19 million of first quarter charge-offs were bank-related while none of the fourth quarter’s were. Core C&I charge-offs actually decreased for the fourth quarter. 
C&I nonperforming loans rose in the first quarter even for the non-bank-related exposures. We do not think this is a long-term trend for core C&I, but rather, is reflective of the continued deterioration of credits to weaker companies that are not seeing the same positive trends as better positioned ones.
It's important to note that an increasing number of our nonperforming C&I loans remain current on principal and interest payments and are judged to be impaired due to an inability to demonstrate a continued capacity to maintain their historic payment record. 
Reserve levels for the core C&I portfolio increased because the impairment assessment methodology employed for the majority of troubled C&I assets typically calls for holding reserves for inherent losses rather than the immediate charge-down process that typically it follow when troubled assets are collateral dependent.
With respect to trust preferred and bank-related exposures, you'll find more detail on Slide 15. As expected, these portfolios continue to show very significant stress. In the first quarter, we had two additional banks elect interest deferral on their trust preferred loans for a total of six financial institutions now in deferral, totaling $64 million. As I just noted, $19 million of our $28 million of first quarter's C&I charge-offs were associated with our bank-related loan portfolio. 
We continue to be vigilant in management of these portfolios and prudent with our reserve coverage which stands at 17.25%. Given the fact that many of the loans in these portfolios are to strong profitable operations, we are very comfortable with this level of reserve. Expect continued deterioration and potential quarter-to-quarter volatility in reported results for this book.
On Slide 16, you'll see that the Home Equity portfolio delinquency trends are stable to improving, particularly in the regional bank and that non-strategic balances continue their slow runoff. Note, about $200 million of home equity loans that were previously accounted for and off balance sheet securitization began to be accounted for in the Non-Strategic segment in January. This caused a small increase in delinquency as that performs worse than the balance of the portfolio.
The primary external driver of delinquency remains unemployment. Underlying origination characteristics that drive performance remain vintage, origination channel, credit score and lien position.
Slide 17 provides an update on the major components of the Non-Strategic portfolios. One-time closed balances are down to $105 million as we near completion of a very successful wind-down of this book. These commitments totaled $3 billion in the beginning of 2008.
Balances in the Permanent Mortgage portfolio are expected to decline from this point forward, as the inflow of a proportion of the performing completed OTC loans ceases. Delinquency trends are improving and the level of required reserves at quarter end decreased as a result. Non-performers were up due to increased loan modification activity and because the foreclosure process is becoming extended in many geographies. We accelerated loss recognition practices in this portfolio during the quarter, resulting in a $13.5 million increase over what losses would have been without this change.
Progress continues in winding down the Non-strategic Residential CRE or homebuilder portfolio, with commitments down 86% since announcing our exit from this business line. Charge-offs and non-performing balances decreased in this portfolio during the quarter.
Wrapping up on Slide 18. Our first quarter results, with respect to losses in reserve levels, were largely as expected and our expectations for 2010 remain intact. We will experience an improving trend, meaning lower losses and required reserves, as we progress through the year. However, there's potential for quarter-to-quarter volatility due to the lumpy nature of our most stressed portfolios. This expectation does assume, however, that the current economic trends continue. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

There's an increasing number of non-performers that are current on principal and interest. So there's a number of factors driving first quarter results.

We thought this quarter was prudent to again, build the reserve based on the aggregate size of the pipeline. What I might say though, is that where the last two quarters, we've seen virtually all negative trends. I would say that we've seen a little bit of some mixed trends this quarter, which doesn't mean that it's getting better overall, it just means that we have a few more things that have been encouraging. Though the negative still outweigh the positives. So for instance, if you look at 4Q '09 to 1Q '10 on Slide 8, our new requests are actually slightly down. The mix of those requests has changed a little bit, meaning more towards MI rescissions, which could pose additional losses to us. But that's actually a cautious positive trend. We also have a lot more focus, loss mitigation efforts than even we had in the past, to make sure that we are pushing back as much as possible. So it's kind of hard to predict as we sit here today.

They're down to $350 million or so today. But $250 million on homebuilder and about $100 million in one-time close. So there's not a lot of room for those to continue to decline. We will work through them and they will go away, largely over the course of this year. The Home Equity portfolio has been running off. It was probably $200 million or so this quarter.

In absolute sense, I guess you've seen what would appear to be more troubled signals of troubled institutions in the marketplace. It's in and around Tennessee. I'm not sure that changes our thinking about the opportunities an awful lot. I think the other big dynamic is change. And it's, sort of, a positive and a negative as I think about it. The FDIC bidding process has clearly gotten more competitive. It looks like the loss-sharing levels are going to be increased or reduced depending on which size of the table you're looking at it from. I think that's good, as from an FDIC fund perspective and as somebody that pays part of the cost of that, we think that's a positive. We think it makes the deals marginally less attractive. So back to my comments earlier, we're most focused on making sure that, whether it's FDIC in the future or regular way deal, we're doing something that makes sense from the franchise that we're trying to build. Where we can build the density we'd like to operate with, where we can build the focus in markets that look like Tennessee markets. And so I don't think much has changed in the last several months that make it more or less attractive other than the items that I just mentioned."

Second quarter's results demonstrate that the successful execution of our strategic plan is paying off. Our proactive approach to credit quality, aggressive de-risking efforts and the re-focus on core businesses have resulted on First Horizon's first bottom-line profit since the first quarter of 2008.
Income from continuing operations was $20 million, a significant turnaround both year over year and linked quarter. Improved credit quality was a major driver. Linked quarter, provision expense decreased to $70 million, charge-offs were down 27% and NPAs declined 14%.
We also benefited from our re-focus on the Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses as both showed good performance in the second quarter. FTN Financial remains a high return on capital business for us.
Average daily revenue declined towards normalized levels but is still solid. Regional bank profitability was sharply improved due to lower credit costs and higher revenue. The Regional Bank continues to demonstrate customer deposit growth, improved fee revenue and strengthening net interest margin.
Loan demand remains soft but we've seen signs of increased borrowing activity in our corporate lending line of business and from mortgage warehouse lending. Additionally, the loan pipeline is improving.
We are proud of the profitability we achieved this quarter but mindful that the economic and operating environment will remain tough near-term. We believe that the economy will continue to recover but at a gradual pace. High unemployment and a weak housing market are likely to remain, restraining organic growth prospects and keeping environmental costs elevated.
Against a backdrop of likely low single-digit economic growth and - excuse me - low single digit economic growth, we expect interest rates to remain low for an extended period and we also expect loan growth to be low overall but benefiting from our customer acquisition efforts. And while we support financial regulatory reform, the legislation is expected to pressure industry revenue and elevate expenses.
There are still a lot of unknowns but we are already taking steps to mitigate revenue losses. The new rules are not expected to adversely affect our capital markets business. The elimination of trust preferred securities as a source of Tier 1 capital should not materially affect our capital position.
Our TRUPS account for only $300 million of Tier 1 capital or 144 basis points of our strong Tier 1 ratio of 16.8%. Although a slow economy and regulatory reform provide uncertainty and challenges, they also provide opportunities, opportunities that we are fully prepared to take advantage of. We have the team, the product capability, the systems and the capital.
We have made significant progress in reducing our balance sheet risk and cleaning up problem loans. We've made headway in lowering operating costs and improving efficiency. Near-term, modest organic growth, credit cost reduction and efficiency improvements will likely drive our bottom-line improvement.
I'm confident in our ability to take market share as revenue growth opportunities surface. BJ will now take you through the financial results for the quarter and I'll be back as we take your questions. BJ.

272721,108553259,67599,"First Horizon National Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2010",2010-07-16,"Earnings Calls","First Horizon Corporation","Executives","Thanks Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Starting on slide five, to give you an idea of our consolidated earnings view, second quarter net income available to common shareholders was $3 million for an EPS of a penny, an improvement from first quarter's loss",850,"Thanks Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Starting on slide five, to give you an idea of our consolidated earnings view, second quarter net income available to common shareholders was $3 million for an EPS of a penny, an improvement from first quarter's loss of about $0.12 a share. Our pretax net income was $18 million.
Second quarter's results were driven by improvement in credit quality and better hedging results, partially offset by continued elevated mortgage repurchase expense. If you turn to slide six, our core businesses, again, Regional Banking, Capital Markets and our Corporate segment had a combined pre-tax income of $52 million in the second quarter, up from $39 million in the first. Consolidated pre-tax income again was $18 million.
Looking at the Regional Bank, we had pre-tax income of $29 million compared to last quarter's loss of five, reflecting a nearly 50% decrease in the Regional Bank's provision to $28 million in the second quarter. This decrease in provision was driven by stabilizing trends in the bank's core C&I portfolio.
Pre-tax pre-provision income increased $10 million linked quarter to $57 million. Revenues were up 4% from last quarter, benefiting from higher net interest income and a seasonal rebound in NSF/OD fees. Same time, non-interest expenses declined about 1%.
Our bankers focus on superior customer service and calling efforts paid off as average core deposits were up 3%. Loan demand continues to be muted and average loans in the regional bank were down about 1% for the quarter.
On the capital markets side, we had another good quarter as pre-tax income was $28 million. Fixed income revenues continued to normalize, declining 13% linked quarter. Our average daily revenue was down from $1.7 million in the first quarter to $1.5 million in the second quarter. Expenses declined 7%, mostly related to those lower revenues.
In our Corporate segment, we had a pre-tax loss this quarter of $5 million compared to last quarter's pretax income of $11 million. As you will remember, we had a debt repurchase gain of $17 million in the first quarter.
Our Corporate NII dropped $4 million due to a decline in yield and the size of the securities portfolio, combined with the changing consolidated balance sheet mix.
Our non-strategic segment posted a 41% increase in revenues from last quarter, reflecting positive mortgage hedging results of $44 million, primarily due to rate movements favorably affecting fair value of the MSR hedges. At the end of the second quarter, our servicing portfolio was down to about $32 billion. We believe that this is a manageable size for us and the associated cash flow stream that it provides will give us somewhat of an offset to the mortgage repurchase expenses.
If you move to slide seven quickly, our consolidated expenses were flat linked quarter at about $342 million. While we continue to focus on efficiency efforts, we are still facing significant headwinds from environmental costs in our non-strategic segment, driven by mortgage repurchase.
So if you move to slide eight, I'll get into details a little bit more on the mortgage repurchase reserve. After flattening in the fourth quarter to the first quarter, our new requests again increased in the second, while resolutions remained flat causing our aggregate pipeline to increase to $411 million.
In the second quarter, we built the reserve to $162 million and had a mortgage repurchase provision expense of $56 million, a $15 million increase from 1Q ‘10 and back to levels we saw in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs remained stable at $20 million, with our rescission rates and loss severities remaining steady to prior quarters as well.
Notifications of rescissions of coverage from mortgage insurers continue to increase and could present additional uncertainty in the volatility of our mortgage repurchase expenses. Moving to slide nine, looking at the margin, our consolidated net interest margin remained flat at 3.19%. The margin was negatively impacted from carrying excess balances at the Fed this quarter and the non-strategic portfolio also continues to be a drag on overall margin.
On the bright side, the regional bank's net interest margin was up 14 basis points linked quarter to 5.10, due to improved loan pricing and a lessening impact of non-accruals in our Regional Bank. In this low interest rate environment, we do expect the margin to remain somewhat stable for the remainder of this year, absent interest rate increases.
In summary, we are certainly not declaring victory, as the non-strategic businesses continue to create near-term volatility and we have a long road to go to meet our bonefish targets for returns and profitability. With that said, we are pleased with second quarter's progress and will continue to work diligently to sustain and improve profitability.
As Bryan said, any near-term profit gains are likely to be driven by our efforts to reduce credit-related costs and expenses. And at the same time, we will continue to work to make sure that we are fully prepared to take advantage of profitable lending and other revenue growth opportunities.
Now, I will turn the call over to Greg to discuss second quarter's improved credit results.

I'll start with slide 11. The second quarter showed good credit metrics. Net charge-offs were $133 million, down 27% linked-quarter and down 45% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio improved 103 basis points from last",874,"Thanks, BJ and good morning, all. I'll start with slide 11. The second quarter showed good credit metrics. Net charge-offs were $133 million, down 27% linked-quarter and down 45% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio improved 103 basis points from last quarter.
Charge-offs were lower from reduced balances in our non-strategic construction portfolios and stabilizing trends in our core C&I portfolio. Reserves decreased $63 million, driven by reserve releases in our national CRE - our national res CRE, one-time close, Permanent Mortgage and consumer portfolios are early actions of identifying problem loans to get ahead of the curve with credit issues.
Moving on to slide 12, as Bryan mentioned earlier, non-performing assets declined 14% from last quarter and were down 27% from a year ago. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of NPA decline. Second quarter decrease was primarily driven by less inflow of non-performers and fewer downgrades. Overall, non-performing trends improved in the second quarter, but going forward, the quarter-to-quarter statistics could show some volatility from inherent lumpiness in our commercial portfolios.
Our ending balance of ORE was slightly down as well in the second quarter. We will continue to have better success in asset disposition with individual transactions. We did have a small bulk sale this quarter. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of our non-strategic assets as it makes financial sense.
Now, I'll go through our portfolios in detail, starting with income CRE on slide 13. Our income CRE balances were $1.6 billion at second quarter or about 9% of our total loan portfolio. Charge-offs were $12 million, down $6 million from first quarter.
We have approximately one-third of our income CRE portfolio maturing over the next 18 months. Weakening market conditions could potentially impact performance. However, stress performance could be minimized by strong sponsors and cash flows. Our reserve levels have been at 8% or higher for four quarters in this portfolio and reserve coverage is currently 9%.
I'll discuss our C&I portfolio on slide 14. In the second quarter, C&I had balances of $7 billion, nearly three-fourths of these balances comprise our core C&I portfolio of general commercial loans. TRUPS, bank-related and mortgage warehouse lending make up the remainder. Charge-offs in the C&I portfolio were $20 million, down $8 million from first-quarter levels. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some stability in the core part of our C&I portfolio.
Slide 15 gives some detail on the TRUPS and bank-related loan exposures. We have $465 million in TRUPS and $137 million in bank holding company loans. We have eight TRUPS on interest deferral and one TRUP elected deferral in second quarter. The average size of a TRUP is $9 million. Although we did not experience any charge-offs in the TRUP book this quarter, we do not expect this trend to continue. We will continue to monitor this portfolio carefully as it will likely show volatility and will maintain a healthy reserve.
On slide 16, you will see that our home portfolio or our home equity portfolio trends remain stable. Second quarter's charge-offs declined $5 million linked-quarter to $40 million. Delinquencies were fairly stable in both our regional bank and non-strategic portfolios.
We decreased reserves by about $11 million in the home equity portfolio. This was the second consecutive quarter that we released reserves in the home equity portfolios. This quarter's reserve decrease was from a combination of lower balances, continued lower entry roll rates, lower total delinquencies and relatively flat charge-off rates.
The borrower characteristics of this book remain strong. 86% of the loans were retail originated. The average refresh FICO is 726 and we ceased national originations in early 2008, limiting the loss content by vintage. We expect continued stable trends in the home equity portfolio, assuming ongoing economic recovery as consumer delinquency and loss rates are highly correlated with unemployment rates.
Now, moving to slide 17, it shows an update on our non-strategic portfolios. The national residential CRE book was down 34% from first quarter to $177 million in second quarter. As expected, we had a $4 million reserve release 2Q 2010. Permanent Mortgage balances declined 5% linked quarter to $1 billion. Charge-offs declined 46% to $15 million linked quarter.
Recall, in the first quarter, much of Perm Mortgage losses were related to an acceleration of net charge-off recognition of loans in process of foreclosure. Reserves were 7% of loans. We expect flat to improving trends in this portfolio. As we have largely eliminated the one-time closed portfolio, few of the remaining loans are likely to modify into the Perm Mortgage portfolio.
On slide 18, credit quality in the second quarter was as expected. We saw positive metrics with lower provision expense, a decline in charge-offs and non-performing assets and a reserve decrease. Over the long-term, charge-off and reserve levels should continue to decline as we complete the wind-down of our construction portfolios, home equity and C&I should also continue their steady trends. Although we may see some quarter-to-quarter volatility with credit trends in the commercial portfolios.
Finally, I’d like to say I'm excited in my new role as a Chief Credit Officer. I look forward to getting to know our investors, analysts and other members of our investment community. I'll turn it over to Bryan.

Two questions, Bryan, BJ, it really revolves around mortgage repurchase. Is there any additional color you can give us in terms of how you guys are analyzing the flow, the light at the end of the tunnel? What are the drivers here? We are seeing a sort of an increase in the pipeline growth. So that's one question. And the other question is just around the size of the balance sheet earning assets. We see cash building up. In the supplement, you see the loan pipeline slowing down in terms of the runoff. Home equity - I think is a misnomer out there by the market. Can you give us some color on those two items? Thanks.

Obviously, we had seen a flattening from 4Q to 1Q in new requests and then there was a pretty material increase in requests in the second quarter. At the same time, our resolutions have stayed roughly flat. So most of our repurchase provisioning and reserve is related to what the aggregate size of the pipeline is. We know that we've got to get through these portfolios and get some more resolution. So we expect to see more resolutions, which will then lead to more charge-offs and at some point, a flattening of the reserve.
Now, I think it's important to keep in mind that this is obviously still an issue for us and the industry. But we ceased originations in August of 2008. So there's going to be a finite point at which our volumes start to slow. And so we are watching this very closely. We feel like we are well reserved and we will always be as proactive as we can on getting through it as quickly as we can.
On your second piece, the cash buildup, I think what we had, was in the second quarter, a significant dollar balance of excess reserves at the Fed. I think with the volatility in the markets, particularly of what was going on in Europe and so on, we didn't see a great entry point to buy anything into our investment securities portfolio. We will look for ways to put a little bit of money to work there, particularly if we still see loan growth being muted. We would obviously rather put it to work for customers, but we are going to try to do a little bit of both going into the second half of the year.
The third piece, I think, was the level of earning assets, which stayed roughly flat at $26 billion. And what I think we've all said before is that we do think that it flattens out anywhere between $25 billion and $26 billion for our company. As the national strategic wind off, we do think that, over the next couple of quarters, we could see some modest growth in the regional bank that could partially or wholly offset that. So we feel like we're bottoming out around this number.

I've got a lot of confidence in our ability to put earning asset on the balance sheet at the appropriate time. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we are starting to see some pickup in loan demand. I feel good about the pipelines for new or incremental credit that we are seeing today. I think we are seeing a lot of very positive signs in customer activity and in customer acquisition. But I'd say loan demand, on the whole, is still reasonably low. It is not all that strong. And I would also add that the market is becoming a little bit more competitive in terms of the loan demand that's out there, particularly on the C&I side.
So I'm pretty confident in our ability to grow earning asset. There will be plenty of opportunities. I mentioned that a couple of times in the prepared remarks. I think there are going to be a lot of opportunities that come out of all the changes going on from financial regulatory reform, coupled with a lower growth, low interest rate environment. They are going to be tough to find, but we are going to look for them and we are going to put capital to work.
And then, to reemphasize BJ's point, the real rapid decline in our national portfolios is behind us. The construction portfolios, which, 2.5 years ago, totaled over $4 billion, today total something in the neighborhood of $250 million. The home equity portfolio is running off but at a very slow rate and as Greg said, performing well. So I think, as BJ said, we will see our balance sheet bottoming somewhere in this $26 billion, $25 billion range.

So with that, in the different types of properties that we have, we would expect to see some continued pressure there. 60% of our book was originated in '05 through '07. Those were more peak years in terms of what's happening with cap rates in the market right now.
So that's why the expectation is that it will be nothing like the res CRE, but it will be a disturbed portfolio.

And the pipelines are building in a number of different areas, everything from large corporate and commercial real estate to some of the - actually, in some of the areas of the consumer portfolio. We are seeing a good mixture of new customers and a mixture of increased borrowings from existing customers.
And the pipeline reports that I was looking at earlier this week was just incremental demand from existing customers or new customers. And they appeared to be building very, very nicely. I talked a little bit about pricing and structure. We are starting to see spreads tighten a little bit, particularly in the C&I space. That's really a function of, I think, lower loan demand and everybody looking for good opportunities in a market with low loan demand.
I commented on structure. We're starting to see some degradation or movement towards later-cycle types of structures in the C&I portfolio. That's not so much the larger banks, it tends to come from the smaller competitors in the marketplace. So, as a general observation, C&I, in particular, pricing and structure, has come under a little bit of pressure here in the last call it 2.5 - 2.5 months.

But if you think about what has happened since August of 2008, in particular, because that's when we cut off origination in that business, you've gone through a 30-year high in unemployment; you've gone through a historic drop in real estate prices.
And one of the things that we believe is that, with those external market dynamics, if there are problems or fraudulent loans in the portfolio, they are going to default and come to the surface reasonably fast. So we think that it will build as it has and at some point it will turn and start to drop off, just based on those dynamics.

As I described in the prepared or the opening comments, I think we think that the environment is going to be a reasonably difficult operating environment, reasonably low growth in the economy, low interest rates, a lot of change from a regulatory perspective, need to get more capital into the industry.
All of that, in some sense, sets up for some amount if not a significant amount of consolidation in the industry.

The asset-based business has probably got - I would characterize as more competitive in terms of the competitive dynamics around it. You've got a lot of change, people getting in, people getting out of that business. We are seeing opportunities to grow that. Steve Hawkins and our team do a really good job of knowing their customers and building the business and building long-term relationships and so we are seeing progress there.
Commercial real estate, as Greg commented earlier - The deals, the opportunities that we are seeing in the pipeline are, I would say, very strong deals. A lot of equity in these deals are very seasoned, very well-capitalized borrowers. And that market is probably not as competitive as some others because of concentrations around the industry. It hasn't been as competitive. So we think there are opportunities in both. We think that, over the course of the remainder of 2010, we have the opportunity to close a fair number of deals.
Greg, I don't know what you want to add to that, if anything.

Second quarter's results demonstrate that the successful execution of our strategic plan is paying off. Our proactive approach to credit quality, aggressive derisking efforts and the refocus on core businesses have resulted in First Horizon's first bottom line profits since the first quarter of 2008. Income from continuing operations was $20 million, a significant turnaround both year-over-year and linked quarter. Improved credit quality was a major driver, linked quarter, provision expense decreased to $70 million, charge-offs were down 27% and NPAs declined 14%. 
We also benefited from our refocus on the Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses as both showed good performance in the second quarter. FTN Financial remained a high return on capital business for us. Average daily revenue decline towards normalized levels, but it's still solid. Regional Bank profitability was sharply improved due to lower credit costs and higher revenue. The Regional Bank continues to demonstrate customer deposit growth, improved fee revenue and strengthening net interest margin.
Loan demand remained soft, but we've seen signs of increased borrowing activity in our Corporate Lending line of business and from mortgage warehouse lending. Additionally, the loan pipeline is improving.
We are proud of the profitability we achieved this quarter, but mindful that the economic and operating environment will remain tough near-term. We believe that the economy will continue to recover, but at a gradual pace. Higher unemployment and a weak housing market are likely to remain, restraining organic growth prospects and keeping environmental costs elevated. Against the backdrop of likely low-single digit economic growth, we expect interest rates to remain low for an extended period and we also expect loan growth to be low overall, but benefiting from our customer acquisition efforts.
And while we support financial regulatory reform, the legislation is expected to pressure industry revenue and elevate expenses. There's still a lot of unknowns, but we are already taking steps to mitigate revenue losses. The new rules are not expected to adversely affect our Capital Markets business. The elimination of Trust Preferred Securities as a source of Tier 1 capital should not materially affect our capital position. Our TRUPs account only for $300 million of Tier 1 capital or 144 basis points of our strong Tier 1 ratio of 16.8%.
Although a slow economy and regulatory reform provide uncertainty and challenges, they also provide opportunities. Opportunities that we are fully prepared to take advantage of. We have the team, the product capability, the systems and the capital. We've made significant progress in reducing our balance sheet risk and cleaning up problem loans. We've made headway in lowering operating costs and improving efficiency. Near term, modest organic growth, credit cost reduction and efficiency improvements will likely drive our bottom line improvement. I'm confident in our ability to take market share's revenue growth opportunity surface.
BJ will now take you through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll be back as we take your questions. BJ?"

Good morning, everybody. Starting on Slide 5, give you an idea of our consolidated earnings view.

Starting on Slide 5, give you an idea of our consolidated earnings view. Second quarter net income available to common shareholders was $3 million, for an EPS of $0.01, an improvement from first quarter's loss of about $0.12 a share. Our pretax net income was $18 million. Second quarter's results were driven by improvement in credit quality and better hedging results, partially offset by continued elevated mortgage repurchase expense.
To turn to Slide 6. Our core businesses, again, Regional Banking, Capital Markets and our Corporate segment, had a combined pretax income of $52 million in the second quarter, up from $39 million in the first. Consolidated pretax income again was $18 million. Looking at the Regional Bank, we had pretax income of $29 million compared to last quarter's loss of $5 million, reflecting a nearly 50% decrease in the Regional Bank's provision to $28 million in the second quarter. This decrease in provision was driven by stabilizing trends in the bank's core C&I portfolio. Pretax pre-provision income increased $10 million linked quarter to $57 million. Revenues were up 4% from last quarter, benefiting from higher net interest income and a seasonal rebound in NSF/OD fees. Same time, non-interest expenses declined about 1%. 
Our banker's focused on superior customer service and calling efforts paid off, as average core deposits were up 3%. Loan demand continues to be muted and average loans in the Regional Bank were down about 1% for the quarter.
On the Capital Markets side, we've had another good quarter as pretax income was $28 million. Fixed income revenues continue to normalize, declining 13% linked quarter. Our average daily revenue was down from $1.7 million in the first quarter to $1.5 million in the second. Expenses declined 7%, mostly related to those lower revenues.
In our Corporate segment, we had a pretax loss this quarter of $5 million compared to last quarter's pretax income of $11 million. As you'll remember, we had a debt repurchase gain of $17 million in the first quarter. Our Corporate NII dropped $4 million due to a decline in yield and the size of the securities portfolio combined with the changing consolidated balance sheet mix.
Our Non-Strategic segment posted a 41% increase in revenues from last quarter, reflecting positive mortgage hedging results of $44 million, primarily due to rate movements favorably affecting fair value of the MSR hedges. At the end of the second quarter, our servicing portfolio was down to about $32 billion. We believe that this is a manageable size for us, and the associated cash flow stream that it provides will give us somewhat of an offset to the mortgage repurchase expenses.
To move to Slide 7 quickly, our consolidated expenses were flat linked quarter, at about $342 million. While we continue to focus on efficiency efforts, we are still facing significant headwinds from environmental costs in our Non-Strategic segment, driven by mortgage repurchase.
If you move to Slide 8, I'll get into details a little bit more on the mortgage repurchase reserve. After flattening in the fourth quarter to the first quarter, our new requests again increased in the second, while resolutions remained flat, causing our aggregate pipeline to increase to $411 million. In the second quarter, we built the reserve to $162 million and had a mortgage repurchase provision expense of $56 million, a $15 million increase from 1Q '10 and back to levels we saw in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs remain stable with $20 million, with our rescission rates and loss severities remaining steady to prior quarters as well. Notifications of rescissions of coverage from mortgage insurers continue to increase and could present additional uncertainty in the volatility of our mortgage repurchase expenses.
Moving to Slide 9, looking at the margin. Our consolidated net interest margin remained flat at 3.19%. The margin was negatively impacted from carrying excess balances at the Fed this quarter, and the Non-Strategic portfolio also continues to be a drag on overall margin. On the bright side, the Regional Bank's net interest margin was up 14 basis points linked quarter to 5.10%, due to improve loan pricing and the lessening impact of non-accruals in our Regional Bank. In this low interest rate environment, we do expect the margin to remain somewhat stable for the remainder of this year, absent interest rate increases.
In summary, we're certainly not declaring victory as the Non-Strategic businesses continue to create near-term volatility, and we have a long road to go to meet our bonefish targets for returns and profitability. With that said, we're pleased with second quarter's progress and will continue to work diligently to sustain and improve profitability. As Bryan said, any near-term profit gains are likely to be driven by our efforts to reduce credit-related costs and expenses. And at the same time, we'll continue to work to ensure that we're fully prepared to take advantage of profitable lending and other revenue growth opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg to discuss second quarter's improved credit results."

I'll start with Slide 11. The second quarter showed good credit metrics. Net charge-offs were $133 million, down 27% linked quarter and down 45% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio improved 103 basis points from l",870,"Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all. I'll start with Slide 11. The second quarter showed good credit metrics. Net charge-offs were $133 million, down 27% linked quarter and down 45% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio improved 103 basis points from last quarter. Charge-offs were lower from reduced balances in our non-strategic construction portfolios and stabilizing trends in our core C&I portfolio. Reserves decreased $63 million, driven by reserve releases in our national res CRE, one-time close, permanent mortgage and consumer portfolios. Our early actions of identifying problem loans to get ahead of the curve with credit issues.
Moving on to Slide 12, as Bryan mentioned earlier, non-performing assets declined 14% from last quarter and were down 27% from a year ago. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of NPA decline. Second quarter decrease was primarily driven by less inflow of non-performers and fewer downgrades. Overall, non-performing trends improved in the second quarter. But going forward, the quarter-to-quarter statistics could show some volatility from inherent lumpiness in our commercial portfolios.
Our ending balance of ORE was slightly down as well in the second quarter. We will continue to have better success in asset disposition with individual transactions. We did have a small bulk sale this quarter. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of our non-strategic assets as it makes financial sense.
Now I'll go through our portfolios in detail, starting with Income CRE on Slide 13. Our Income CRE balances were $1.6 billion at second quarter or about 9% of our total loan portfolio. Charge-offs were $12 million, down $6 million from first quarter. We have approximately 1/3 of our Income CRE portfolio maturing over the next 18 months, weakening market conditions could potentially impact performance. However, stress performance could be minimized by strong sponsors and cash flows. Our reserve levels have been at 8% or higher for four quarters in this portfolio, and reserve coverage is currently 9%.
I'll discuss our C&I portfolio on Slide 14. In the second quarter, C&I had balances of $7 billion, nearly 3/4 of this balances comprise our core C&I portfolio of general commercial loans. TRUPs, bank-related and mortgage warehouse lending make up the remainder. Charge-offs in the C&I portfolio were $20 million, down $8 million from first quarter levels. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some stability in the core part of our C&I portfolio.
Slide 15, gives some detail on the TRUPs and bank-related loan exposures. We have $465 million in TRUPs and $137 million in bank holding company loans. We have eight TRUPs on interest deferral and one TRUP elected deferral in the second quarter. The average size of a TRUP is $9 million. Although we did not experience any charge-offs in the TRUP book this quarter, we do not expect this trend to continue. We will continue to monitor this portfolio carefully, as it will likely show volatility and will maintain a healthy reserve.
On Slide 16, you'll see that our Home Equity portfolio trends remain stable. Second quarter's charge-offs declined $5 million linked quarter to $40 million. Delinquencies were fairly stable in both our Regional Bank and Non-Strategic portfolios. We decreased reserves by about $11 million in the Home Equity portfolio. This was the second consecutive quarter that we released reserves in the Home Equity portfolios.
This quarter's reserve decrease was from a combination of lower balances, continued lower entry roll rates, lower total delinquencies and relatively flat charge-off rates. The borrower characteristics of this book remains strong. 86% of the loans were retail originated, the average refreshed FICO is 726 and we see national originations in early 2008, limiting the loss content by vintage. We expect continued stable trends in the Home Equity portfolio, assuming ongoing economic recovery as consumer delinquency and loss rates are highly correlated with unemployment rates.
Now moving to Slide 17. It shows an update on our Non-Strategic portfolios. The national Residential CRE book was down 34% from first quarter to $177 million in second quarter. As expected, we had a $4 million reserve release 2Q 2010. Permanent Mortgage balances declined 5% linked quarter to $1 billion. Charge-offs declined 46% to $15 million linked quarter. Recall, in the first quarter, much of Perm Mortgage losses were related to an acceleration of net charge-off recognition of loans in process of foreclosure. Reserves were 7% of loans. We expect flat to improving trends in this portfolio, as we've largely eliminated the one-time close portfolio, few of the remaining loans are likely to modify into the Perm Mortgage portfolio.
On Slide 18, credit quality in the second quarter was as expected. We saw positive metrics, with lower provision expense, a decline in charge-offs and non-performing assets and a reserve decrease. Over the long term, charge-off and reserve levels should continue to decline as we complete the wind down of our Construction portfolio, Home Equity and C&I should also continue their steady trends. Although we may see some quarter-to-quarter volatility with credit trends in the Commercial portfolios.
Finally, I'd like to say I'm excited in my new role as a Chief Credit Officer. I look forward to getting to know our investors, analysts and other members of our investment community. I'll turn it over to Bryan."

Is there any additional color you can give us in terms of how you guys are analyzing the flow, the light at the end of the tunnel, what are the drivers here? We're seeing sort of an increase in the pipeline growth, so that's one question. And the other question is, just around the size of the balance sheet earning assets. We see cash building up. In the supplement, you see the loan pipeline kind of slowing down in terms of the runoff. Home equity, I think is a misnomer out there about the market. Can you give us some color on those two items?"

And then there was a pretty material increase in requests in the second quarter. At the same time, our resolutions have stayed roughly flat. So most of our repurchase provisioning and reserve is related to what the aggregate size of the pipeline is. We know that we've got to get through these portfolios and get some more resolutions. So we expect to see more resolutions, which will then lead to more charge-offs and at some point, a flattening of the reserves. Now I think, it's important to keep in mind that this is obviously still an issue for us and the industry, but we ceased originations in August of 2008. So there's going to be a finite point at which our volumes start to slow. And so, we're watching this very closely. We feel like we're well reserved, and we'll always be as proactive as we can on getting through it as quickly as we can. On your second piece, the cash buildup. I think what we had was, in the second quarter, a significant dollar balance of excess reserves at the Fed. I think with the volatility in the markets, particularly of what was going on in Europe and so on, we didn't see a great entry point to buy anything into our investment securities portfolio. We will look for ways to put a little bit of money to work there, particularly if we still see loan growth being muted. We've obviously rather put it to work for customers, but we're going to try to do a little bit of both going into the second half of the year. Third piece, I think, was the level of earning assets, which stayed roughly flat at $26 billion. And what I think we've all said before is, that we do think that it flattens out anywhere between $25 billion and $26 billion for our company. As the national strategics wind off, we do think that over the next couple of quarters, we could see some modest growth in the Regional Bank that could partially or wholly offset that. So we feel like we're bottoming out around this number."

As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're starting to see some pick up in loan demand. I feel good about the pipelines for new or incremental credit that we're seeing today. I think we're seeing a lot of very positive signs in customer activity and in customer acquisition. But I'd say loan demand, on the whole, is still reasonably low. It is not all that strong. And I would also add that the market is becoming a little bit more competitive in terms of the loan demand that's out there, particularly on the C&I side. So I'm pretty confident in our ability to grow earning assets. There'll be plenty of opportunities. I mentioned that a couple of times in the prepared remarks. I think there are going to be a lot of opportunities that come out of all the changes going on from a financial regulatory reform, coupled with a lower growth, low interest rate environment. They're going to be tough to find, but we're going to look for them and we're going to put capital to work. And then to re-emphasize BJ's point, the real rapid decline in our national portfolios is behind us. The Construction portfolios, which two and a half years ago, totaled over $4 billion today, totaled something in the neighborhood of $250 million. The Home Equity portfolio is running off at a very slow rate and as Greg said, performing well. So I think, as BJ said, we'll see our balance sheet bottoming somewhere in this $26 billion, $25 billion range."

I talked a little bit about pricing and structure. We are starting to see spreads tighten a little bit, particularly in the C&I space. That's really a function of, I think, lower loan demand and everybody looking for good opportunities in a market with low loan demand. I commented on structure. We're starting to see some degradation or movement towards later-cycle types of structures in the C&I portfolio.

Second quarter's results demonstrate that the successful execution of our strategic plan is paying off. Our proactive approach to credit quality, aggressive derisking efforts and the refocus on core businesses have resulted in First Horizon's first bottom line profits since the first quarter of 2008. Income from continuing operations was $20 million, a significant turnaround both year-over-year and linked quarter. Improved credit quality was a major driver. Linked quarter, provision expense decreased to $70 million, charge-offs were down 27% and NPAs declined 14%. 
We also benefited from our refocus on the Regional Banking and Capital Markets businesses, as both showed good performance in the second quarter. FTN Financial remains a high return on capital business for us. Average daily revenue declined towards normalized levels, but it's still solid. Regional Bank profitability was sharply improved due to lower credit costs and higher revenue. The Regional Bank continues to demonstrate customer deposit growth, improved fee revenue and strengthening net interest margin.
Loan demand remained soft, but we've seen signs of increased borrowing activity in our Corporate Lending line of business and from mortgage warehouse lending. Additionally, the loan pipeline is improving.
We are proud of the profitability we achieved this quarter, but mindful that the economic and operating environment will remain tough near term. We believe that the economy will continue to recover but at a gradual pace. High unemployment and a weak housing market are likely to remain, restraining organic growth prospects and keeping environmental costs elevated. Against the backdrop of likely low-single digit economic growth, we expect interest rates to remain low for an extended period and we also expect loan growth to be low overall, but benefiting from our customer-acquisition efforts.
And while we support financial regulatory reform, the legislation is expected to pressure industry revenue and elevate expenses. There's still a lot of unknowns, but we are already taking steps to mitigate revenue losses. The new rules are not expected to adversely affect our Capital Markets business. The elimination of trust-preferred securities as a source of Tier 1 capital should not materially affect our capital position. Our TruPS account only for $300 million of Tier 1 capital or 144 basis points of our strong Tier 1 ratio of 16.8%.
Although a slow economy and regulatory reform provide uncertainty and challenges, they also provide opportunities. Opportunities that we are fully prepared to take advantage of. We have the team, the product capability, the systems and the capital. We've made significant progress in reducing our balance sheet risk and cleaning up problem loans. We've made headway in lowering operating costs and improving efficiency. Near term, modest organic growth, credit cost reduction and efficiency improvements will likely drive our bottom line improvement. I'm confident in our ability to take market share's revenue growth opportunity surface.
BJ will now take you through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll be back as we take your questions. BJ?"

Second quarter net income available to common shareholders was $3 million, for an EPS of $0.01, an improvement from first quarter's loss of ab",839,"Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Starting on Slide 5, give you an idea of our consolidated earnings view. Second quarter net income available to common shareholders was $3 million, for an EPS of $0.01, an improvement from first quarter's loss of about $0.12 a share. Our pretax net income was $18 million. Second quarter's results were driven by improvement in credit quality and better hedging results, partially offset by continued elevated mortgage repurchase expense.
To turn to Slide 6. Our core businesses, again, Regional Banking, Capital Markets and our Corporate segment, had a combined pretax income of $52 million in the second quarter, up from $39 million in the first. Consolidated pretax income again was $18 million. 
Looking at the Regional Bank, we had pretax income of $29 million compared to last quarter's loss of $5 million, reflecting a nearly 50% decrease in the Regional Bank's provision to $28 million in the second quarter. This decrease in provision was driven by stabilizing trends in the bank's core C&I portfolio. Pretax pre-provision income increased $10 million linked quarter to $57 million. Revenues were up 4% from last quarter, benefiting from higher net interest income and a seasonal rebound in NSF/OD fees. Same time, non-interest expenses declined about 1%. 
Our banker's focused on superior customer service and calling efforts paid off, as average core deposits were up 3%. Loan demand continues to be muted and average loans in the Regional Bank were down about 1% for the quarter.
On the Capital Markets side, we had another good quarter as pretax income was $28 million. Fixed income revenues continued to normalize, declining 13% linked quarter. Our average daily revenue was down from $1.7 million in the first quarter to $1.5 million in the second. Expenses declined 7%, mostly related to those lower revenues.
In our Corporate segment, we had a pretax loss this quarter of $5 million compared to last quarter's pretax income of $11 million. As you will remember, we had a debt repurchase gain of $17 million in the first quarter. Our Corporate NII dropped $4 million due to a decline in yield and the size of the securities portfolio combined with the changing consolidated balance sheet mix.
Our Non-Strategic segment posted a 41% increase in revenues from last quarter, reflecting positive mortgage hedging results of $44 million, primarily due to rate movements favorably affecting fair value of the MSR hedges. 
At the end of the second quarter, our servicing portfolio was down to about $32 billion. We believe that this is a manageable size for us, and the associated cash flow stream that it provides will give us somewhat of an offset to the mortgage repurchase expenses.
To move to Slide 7 quickly, our consolidated expenses were flat linked quarter at about $342 million. While we continue to focus on efficiency efforts, we are still facing significant headwinds from environmental costs in our Non-Strategic segment, driven by mortgage repurchase.
If you move to Slide 8, I'll get into details a little bit more on the mortgage repurchase reserve. After flattening in the fourth quarter to the first quarter, our new requests again increased in the second while resolutions remained flat, causing our aggregate pipeline to increase to $411 million. 
In the second quarter, we built the reserve to $162 million and had a mortgage repurchase provision expense of $56 million, a $15 million increase from 1Q '10 and back to levels we saw in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs remain stable with $20 million, with our rescission rates and loss severities remaining steady to prior quarters as well. Notifications of rescissions of coverage from mortgage insurers continue to increase and could present additional uncertainty in the volatility of our mortgage repurchase expenses.
Moving to Slide 9, looking at the margin. Our consolidated net interest margin remained flat at 3.19%. The margin was negatively impacted from carrying excess balances at the Fed this quarter, and the Non-Strategic portfolio also continues to be a drag on overall margin. 
On the bright side, the Regional Bank's net interest margin was up 14 basis points linked quarter to 5.10%, due to improve loan pricing and the lessening impact of nonaccruals in our Regional Bank. In this low interest rate environment, we do expect the margin to remain somewhat stable for the remainder of this year, absent interest rate increases.
In summary, we're certainly not declaring victory as the Non-Strategic businesses continue to create near-term volatility, and we have a long road to go to meet our bonefish targets for returns and profitability. With that said, we're pleased with second quarter's progress and will continue to work diligently to sustain and improve profitability. As Bryan said, any near-term profit gains are likely to be driven by our efforts to reduce credit-related costs and expenses. And at the same time, we'll continue to work to ensure that we're fully prepared to take advantage of profitable lending and other revenue growth opportunities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg to discuss second quarter's improved credit results."

I'll start with Slide 11. The second quarter showed good credit metrics. Net charge-offs were $133 million, down 27% linked quarter and down 45% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio improved 103 basis points from l",870,"Thanks, BJ, and good morning to all. I'll start with Slide 11. The second quarter showed good credit metrics. Net charge-offs were $133 million, down 27% linked quarter and down 45% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio improved 103 basis points from last quarter. Charge-offs were lower from reduced balances in our non-strategic construction portfolios and stabilizing trends in our core C&I portfolio. Reserves decreased $63 million, driven by reserve releases in our national res CRE. Onetime close, permanent mortgage and consumer portfolios are early actions of identifying problem loans to get ahead of the curve with credit issues.
Moving on to Slide 12. As Bryan mentioned earlier, nonperforming assets declined 14% from last quarter and were down 27% from a year ago. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of NPA decline. Second quarter decrease was primarily driven by less inflow of nonperformers and fewer downgrades. Overall, nonperforming trends improved in the second quarter. But going forward, the quarter-to-quarter statistics could show some volatility from inherent lumpiness in our commercial portfolios.
Our ending balance of ORE was slightly down as well in the second quarter. We will continue to have better success in asset disposition with individual transactions. We did have a small bulk sale this quarter. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of our non-strategic assets as it makes financial sense.
Now I'll go through our portfolios in detail, starting with Income CRE on Slide 13. Our Income CRE balances were $1.6 billion at second quarter or about 9% of our total loan portfolio. Charge-offs were $12 million, down $6 million from first quarter. We have approximately 1/3 of our Income CRE portfolio maturing over the next 18 months. Weakening market conditions could potentially impact performance. However, stress performance could be minimized by strong sponsors and cash flows. Our reserve levels have been at 8% or higher for four quarters in this portfolio, and reserve coverage is currently 9%.
I'll discuss our C&I portfolio on Slide 14. In the second quarter, C&I had balances of $7 billion, nearly 3/4 of this balances comprise our core C&I portfolio of general commercial loans. TruPS, bank-related and mortgage warehouse lending make up the remainder. Charge-offs in the C&I portfolio were $20 million, down $8 million from first quarter levels. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some stability in the core part of our C&I portfolio.
Slide 15, gives some detail on the TruPS and bank-related loan exposures. We have $465 million in TruPS and $137 million in bank holding company loans. We have eight TruPS on interest deferral and one TruP elected deferral in the second quarter. The average size of a TruP is $9 million. Although we did not experience any charge-offs in the TruP book this quarter, we do not expect this trend to continue. We will continue to monitor this portfolio carefully, as it will likely show volatility and will maintain a healthy reserve.
On Slide 16, you'll see that our Home Equity portfolio trends remain stable. Second quarter's charge-offs declined $5 million linked quarter to $40 million. Delinquencies were fairly stable in both our Regional Bank and Non-Strategic portfolios. We decreased reserves by about $11 million in the Home Equity portfolio. This was the second consecutive quarter that we released reserves in the Home Equity portfolios.
This quarter's reserve decrease was from a combination of lower balances, continued lower entry roll rates, lower total delinquencies and relatively flat charge-off rates. The borrower characteristics of this book remains strong. 86% of the loans were retail originated, the average refreshed FICO is 726 and we see national originations in early 2008, limiting the loss content by vintage. We expect continued stable trends in the Home Equity portfolio, assuming ongoing economic recovery as consumer delinquency and loss rates are highly correlated with unemployment rates.
Now moving to Slide 17. It shows an update on our Non-Strategic portfolios. The national Residential CRE book was down 34% from first quarter to $177 million in second quarter. As expected, we had a $4 million reserve release 2Q 2010. Permanent Mortgage balances declined 5% linked quarter to $1 billion. Charge-offs declined 46% to $15 million linked quarter. Recall, in the first quarter, much of Perm Mortgage losses were related to an acceleration of net charge-off recognition of loans in process of foreclosure. Reserves were 7% of loans. We expect flat to improving trends in this portfolio, as we've largely eliminated the one-time close portfolio, few of the remaining loans are likely to modify into the Perm Mortgage portfolio.
On Slide 18, credit quality in the second quarter was as expected. We saw positive metrics, with lower provision expense, a decline in charge-offs and nonperforming assets and a reserve decrease. Over the long term, charge-off and reserve levels should continue to decline as we complete the wind down of our Construction portfolio, Home Equity and C&I should also continue their steady trends. Although we may see some quarter-to-quarter volatility with credit trends in the Commercial portfolios.
Finally, I'd like to say I'm excited in my new role as a Chief Credit Officer. I look forward to getting to know our investors, analysts and other members of our investment community. I'll turn it over to Bryan."

Is there any additional color you can give us in terms of how you guys are analyzing the flow, the light at the end of the tunnel, what are the drivers here? We're seeing sort of an increase in the pipeline growth, so that's one question. And the other question is, just around the size of the balance sheet earning assets. We see cash building up. In the supplement, you see the loan pipeline kind of slowing down in terms of the runoff. Home equity, I think is a misnomer out there about the market. Can you give us some color on those two items?"

And then there was a pretty material increase in requests in the second quarter. At the same time, our resolutions have stayed roughly flat. So most of our repurchase provisioning and reserve is related to what the aggregate size of the pipeline is. We know that we've got to get through these portfolios and get some more resolutions. So we expect to see more resolutions, which will then lead to more charge-offs and at some point, a flattening of the reserves. Now I think, it's important to keep in mind that this is obviously still an issue for us and the industry, but we ceased originations in August of 2008. So there's going to be a finite point at which our volumes start to slow. And so, we're watching this very closely. We feel like we're well reserved, and we'll always be as proactive as we can on getting through it as quickly as we can. On your second piece, the cash buildup. I think what we had was, in the second quarter, a significant dollar balance of excess reserves at the Fed. I think with the volatility in the markets, particularly of what was going on in Europe and so on, we didn't see a great entry point to buy anything into our investment securities portfolio. We will look for ways to put a little bit of money to work there, particularly if we still see loan growth being muted. We've obviously rather put it to work for customers, but we're going to try to do a little bit of both going into the second half of the year. Third piece, I think, was the level of earning assets, which stayed roughly flat at $26 billion. And what I think we've all said before is, that we do think that it flattens out anywhere between $25 billion and $26 billion for our company. As the national strategics wind off, we do think that over the next couple of quarters, we could see some modest growth in the Regional Bank that could partially or wholly offset that. So we feel like we're bottoming out around this number."

I've got a lot of confidence in our ability to put earning assets on the balance sheet at the appropriate time. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're starting to see some pick up in loan demand. I feel good about the pipelines for new or incremental credit that we're seeing today. I think we're seeing a lot of very positive signs in customer activity and in customer acquisition. But I'd say loan demand, on the whole, is still reasonably low. It is not all that strong. And I would also add that the market is becoming a little bit more competitive in terms of the loan demand that's out there, particularly on the C&I side. So I'm pretty confident in our ability to grow earning assets. There'll be plenty of opportunities. I mentioned that a couple of times in the prepared remarks. I think there are going to be a lot of opportunities that come out of all the changes going on from a financial regulatory reform, coupled with a lower growth, low interest rate environment. They're going to be tough to find, but we're going to look for them and we're going to put capital to work. And then to re-emphasize BJ's point, the real rapid decline in our national portfolios is behind us. The Construction portfolios, which two and a half years ago, totaled over $4 billion today, totaled something in the neighborhood of $250 million. The Home Equity portfolio is running off at a very slow rate and as Greg said, performing well. So I think, as BJ said, we'll see our balance sheet bottoming somewhere in this $26 billion, $25 billion range."

You've gone through a historic drop in real estate prices. And one of the things that we believe is that with those external market dynamics, if there are problems or fraudulent loans in the portfolio, they're going to default and come to the surface reasonably fast. So we think that it'll build as it has, and at some point, it will turn and start to drop off just based on those dynamics.

As I described in the prepared, the opening comments, we think that the environment is going to be a reasonably difficult operating environment, reasonably low growth in the economy, low interest rates, a lot of change from a regulatory perspective, need to get more capital in the industry. All of that, in some sense, sets up for some amount, if not a significant amount, of consolidation in the industry, and so we think there'll be opportunities, whether they be FDIC assisted or a regular way. We're going to be patient. We're going to try to be targeting.

We view third quarter results as another step forward in executing our strategic plan. Net income available to common shareholders was $16 million, a $13 million improvement over the second quarter. Actions taken to refocus on our core businesses, restructure our balance sheet and proactively deal with problem credits are paying off.
Third quarter's improved results reflect lower credit-related cost as well as better performance from our core businesses in Regional Banking and Capital Markets. Our core businesses give us a competitive advantage in our markets. The Regional Bank's pretax income rose 63% linked quarter to $48 million, driven by a lower provision, improved net interest income and relatively stable fees. Capital Market's pretax income grew $15 million second to third quarter or 56% due to stronger revenues driven by depository customer's increased activity.
We saw positive results from our focus on growing our middle Tennessee market share. According to the recent FDIC deposit market share survey, our deposits in national increased 16% year-over-year, twice the rate of overall market growth.
Low loan demand coupled with runoff in our Non-Strategic portfolios resulted in a small decline in period-end loans. We're encouraged by third quarter solid pipeline of corporate, asset-based and commercial real estate loans. There is some seen in our pricing competition. But in general, we are seeing better pricing in our loan portfolio as yields were up six basis points from last quarter, and up 28 basis points year-over-year.
Third quarter's bottom line was also helped by a $20 million linked quarter reduction in our credit provision. Continued reductions in higher risk loan portfolios, along with generally stable credit quality, enabled us to reduce provisioning for the sixth consecutive quarter. Even so, our loan loss reserve is at 4.22%. Net charge-offs declined for the fifth consecutive quarter. Nonperforming assets, although down 25% below a year ago, increased to 2% second to third quarter due to fewer resolutions and lower paydowns. The total end flow of new NPA is steady despite a couple of larger commercial credits going on non-accrual. Greg will give you more details later in the call.
It is important to keep in mind that with the winding down of our Non-Strategic loans, we may experience a little more quarterly fluctuation in credit quality metrics, given the size of our C&I and commercial real estate credits and the cyclicality of commercial portfolios. Overall, we believe that our credit quality trend will be improved. 
I'm pleased with our third quarter progress but a slow growth economy, low interest rates, elevated environmental expenses and implementation of the Dodd-Frank bill are likely to present challenges for the financial services industry and us. We believe we're well positioned to meet the challenges ahead as well as take advantage of the opportunities that will ultimately arrive.
On the regulatory front, it's too early to know the full impact of reforms on revenue or expenses, but we believe that they will be manageable for us. We will continue to focus on improving our efficiency and productivity to help offset the impact of reform. Additionally, we will prudently revisit pricing of effective products and services as circumstances warrant.
Let me take a minute to address some of the industry issues around the mortgage foreclosure process. We deal with foreclosures in residential mortgages and in home equity loans. As a reminder, we saw with our national residential mortgages servicing and origination platform to MetLife Bank in August 2008 and have a subservicing agreement with them for the servicing rights that we still own. We were working with MetLife and allowing them in the terms of the subservicing agreement to ensure that proper policies and procedures are being followed. Through September, 2010, MetLife has foreclosed roughly 4,500 loans year-to-date, with approximately another 8,200 loans currently in the foreclosure process. MetLife is currently reviewing its overall foreclosure process and working with outside foreclosure counsel and agencies as appropriate. 
On the Home Equity side, our portfolio is mostly second liens and thus, the number of foreclosures remained relatively small. Currently, there are roughly 200 foreclosures in process on Home Equity loans. We believe that our risk with this issue should be manageable. Foreclosures are an unfortunate and less-than-desirable outcome for everyone involved: investors, servicers and especially homeowners. For that reason, like others, we believe that it is important that foreclosures, when necessary, be handled properly.
Finally, we built a strong balance sheet with solid capital base, another advantage for us in our footprint. At September 30, tangible common equity and tangible assets was 8%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was over 10%. We believe that we will be well positioned for the newly issued Basel III requirements as they become the new standards. 
Now BJ will take you through the financial results and then Greg will discuss credit quality, and I'll be back for some final comments. BJ?"

Good morning, everybody. If you flip to Slide 5, this just shows our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. EPS again was $0.07, up from last quarter's $0.01. You'll find all of our key highlights on this slide, but I'",894,"Great. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. If you flip to Slide 5, this just shows our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. EPS again was $0.07, up from last quarter's $0.01. You'll find all of our key highlights on this slide, but I'll talk about them in more detail on the following pages.
So if you take a look at Slide 6, we'll look at our overall and business segment trends. Our consolidated pretax income increased $19 million linked quarter to $37 million. Regional Bank, Capital Markets and our Corporate segments, which we call our core businesses, produced combined pretax income of $77 million, up 50% from second quarter's levels. 
Linked quarter, the Regional Banks pretax income was up 63% to $48 million, driven by an $18 million decline in provision. Revenues rose 1%, but NII and the bank was up 4%, reflecting higher spreads in our loan portfolio. Fees were down a couple of percent as we saw continued negative impact from Reg E, which was somewhat offset by other income.
On the Capital Markets side, we booked another strong quarter as pretax income climbed $15 million to $43 million linked quarter. Fixed incomes average daily revenue improved to $1.7 million from the prior period's $1.5 million. The improvement in what is historically a soft quarter was driven by increased activity from depository customers.
In our Corporate segment, the pretax loss widened to $14 million, primarily due to higher expenses and lower NII. On expense side linked quarter, the expenses were up $8 million with the brands primarily driven by the inclusion of a $5 million benefit related to a VISA litigation liability reversal in the second quarter. 
And on the NII side, our securities portfolio remains stable at about $2.6 billion. However, reinvestment rates are lower pressuring yields, which drops about 26 basis points in the third quarter. 
On the Non-Strategic segment, we posted a 15% decline in revenue as servicing income declined 29% to $44 million in the quarter, reflecting lower net hedging results to full effect of second quarter servicing sales and the reduced size of our servicing portfolios to approximately $30 million. Net hedging results decreased 28% to $32 million due mostly to interest rate movements and credit marks. On the expense side, mortgage repurchase provision expense decreased from $56 million to $49 million in the third quarter, and I'll go into more detail on this on the next slide.
So if you click there to Slide 7, if you look at the bottom left chart, in the third quarter, the active pipeline grew to $469 million. New requests were fairly stable from last quarter's levels, that's the dark blue bar, with the vast majority continuing to come from the GSEs. If you look at the light blue bar, resolutions nearly doubled to $146 million from second quarter's $74 million and are reflected in higher net realized losses of $36 million. As you can see on the bottom right chart, requests are still concentrated in the 2007 vintage. Our rescission rates have held steady at 40% to 50%, and our loss severity remains at approximately 55%. 
Going forward, we will have continued emphasis on increasing resolutions. And a note, though we've seen negligible put-back activity from private securitizations, we know that there has been increased industry discussion on this topic. And we here continue to review and monitor this very closely. As you know, the standards for reps and warranty somewhat differ between GSEs and private labels. And as such, it may cause differing trends in both request activity and the resolution process. 
As a point of reference on our historical put-backs, which again is largely GSEs, that is a roughly $60 million of our GSE originations from 2005 to 2008, our total repurchase request to date has been approximately $800 million or roughly 1% of originations, and we have successfully resolved in our favor 40% to 50% of this request.
Moving on to Slide 8, you'll see margin and the balance sheet trends. Our consolidated NIM increased four basis points to 3.23%. Core business NIM, Regional Banks, Capital Markets and our Corporate segment, remained solid at 3.57%. Third quarter's consolidated margin benefited from better loan pricing, lower deposit costs and less drag from our non-accruals. These positives were somewhat offset by the negative impact of our excess-said balances that we carried during the quarter, as well as those lower reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio. But looking at all of these factors in aggregate, we do believe that the NIM could modestly benefit in the short term as we reduce the excess balances that we carry at the Fed and continue to improve our loan pricing. But we generally expect little opportunity from meaningful improvement in our consolidated margin until interest rates increase.
As Bryan discussed earlier, we view our balance sheet as well positioned. Core deposits were relatively stable. Linked quarter, we saw Non-Strategic loans declined 6% as expected. But going forward, we expect the rate of runoff to slow as the shorter duration construction portfolios are eliminated. 
Overall, we're pleased with our progress and positioning for this environment. We're focused financially on further strengthening our balance sheet, improving our pricing and our margins, as well as our productivity and efficiency. Now I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss some of our asset quality trends."

Overall, third quarter showed continued stabilization in credit quality. Although not surprisingly, there were some volatility. Charge-offs decreased 16% to $111 million from last quarter. Aggregate reserve declined 8% to $720 million due to lower loan balances from runoff, paydowns and charge-offs.
Now moving to Slide 11. We saw some lumpiness in our non-performers, which rose 2% from last quarter, but were nonetheless down 25% year-over-year. Inflow stayed steady, and the percent of NPLs was basically flat from last quarter at 4.31%. The linked quarter increase was driven by a handful of large credits and fewer payments in resolutions in the NPA portfolio. We're seeing a reduction in resolutions as the compositions of non-performers is changing from more dated, non-strategic assets to commercial ones. Additionally, commercial TDRs increased, reflecting efforts to mitigate loss potentials by working with our distressed borrowers and adjusting as the industry moves forward with more consistent practices.
I'll now discuss key trends by portfolios, starting with income CRE on Slide 12. Income CRE balances were $1.5 billion or 9% of our loan portfolio. Linked quarter, net charge-off declined $22 million to $11 million. Non-performers were up at 10.1%. And as we progressed through the maturity cycle of commercial real estate, we expect continued deterioration in 2011. At third quarter, reserves in our income CRE portfolio were at 9.5%, and the reserves has been about 8% for seven quarters now.
Moving on to the C&I portfolio on Slide 13. Ending balances were at $7.3 billion, up 5% from 2Q '10. Linked quarter charge-offs increased from $20 million to $24 million. This included an $11 million fraud-related credit that we charged off in the third quarter. 
As you can see on Slide 14, the C&I portfolio also includes approximately $700 million of TRUPs, bank holding company and other bank-related loans. About $300 million are bank TRUPs, including seven loans on interest referral at quarter end. Interest TRUPs comprised $164 million, $136 million were loans to bank holding companies and $96 million for other loans secured by bank stock. Financial institutions remain stressed, and we will continue to monitor this portion of the C&I portfolio very carefully.
I'll talk about our Home Equity portfolio on Slide 15. Home Equity balances were at $5.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. 30-day delinquencies were 2.33%, up 14 basis points or $5 million linked quarter, which was driven by more borrowers in the foreclosure review process. Non-performers in the Home Equity portfolio were up 11 basis points to 0.46%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to work with borrowers on modifications.
Net charge-offs were up $40 million in the second quarter to $46 million in the third quarter. This increase includes $9 million of charge-offs related to accelerating loss recognition of charge-offs for clients who were nonresponsive for 60 days. Due to the vintage mix and strong borrower characteristics, we expect relative stability in the Home Equity portfolio over the near term. Noting the consumer delinquency and loss rates remain highly correlated with unemployment trends. We continue to assume the economic recovery and employment gains will remain slow.
I'll wrap up on Slide 16. Third quarter demonstrated generally positive credit metrics, including lower provision expense and a decline in charge-off. There was some fluctuation in non-performers as we are at a stage in the credit cycle when some commercial loans are experiencing greater stress. And given their size, this can lead to lumpiness in charge-offs and NPAs. Also as our Non-Strategic portfolios wind down, the magnitude of our reserve decreases is likely to lessen, especially in our consumer and construction portfolios.
As Bryan earlier noted, we believe that our overall credit quality trend will remain improving. I'll now turn it over to Bryan for some closing comments."

What we're trying to do with our securities portfolio is make sure that structure is right of what we're buying as opposed to looking for yields. So our durations are staying very short, well probably, in the 2 ½ year range. And we want to make sure that we don't get caught upside down on the carry trade, if rates suddenly move up. So our reinvestment rates right now are right in the 2.5% range. And if you look at our maturity stacks going forward into next year and next few years, there certainly is going to be a drag if interest rates stay where they are and our reinvestment rates stay where they are. But as you know, our securities portfolio percentage of our assets is relatively small versus peers. So we think that, that drag is manageable, and we would rather not reach for yield there. We do think with the pipeline that we have on the loan side, we'd much rather put some money to work there and try to get some loan yields, which we think could happen over the next several quarters. So like I said on the NIM overall, we think it can modestly improve over the near-term. And then it will take some interest rates in general to make it move up meaningfully. In terms of the pre-payment risk on MSR, I think our CPR this quarter was 13%. So it's still very, very low. You're exactly right. If that started to increase, we'd have it running down. But as we sit here today, we think that servicing portfolio is very manageable at this size. We very much like how we're able to hedge it and the knowledge and expertise that we have around hedging it. And so we think it's a good asset for us to help us somewhat offset some of the mortgage repurchase expense that we have. So as we sit here today, we're pretty comfortable with it."

We view third quarter results as another step forward in executing our strategic plan. Net income available to common shareholders was $16 million, a $13 million improvement over the second quarter. Actions taken to refocus on our core businesses, restructure our balance sheet and proactively deal with problem credits are paying off.
Third quarter's improved results reflect lower credit-related cost as well as better performance from our core businesses in Regional Banking and Capital Markets. Our core businesses give us a competitive advantage in our markets. The Regional Bank's pretax income rose 63% linked quarter to $48 million, driven by a lower provision, improved net interest income and relatively stable fees. Capital Market's pretax income grew $15 million second to third quarter, or 56%, due to stronger revenues driven by depository customers' increased activity.
We saw positive results from our focus on growing our middle Tennessee market share. According to the recent FDIC deposit market share survey, our deposits in national increased 16% year-over-year, twice the rate of overall market growth.
Low loan demand coupled with runoff in our Non-Strategic portfolios resulted in a small decline in period-end loans. We're encouraged by third quarter's solid pipeline of corporate, asset-based and commercial real estate loans. There is some C&I pricing competition, but in general, we are seeing better pricing in our loan portfolio, as yields were up six basis points from last quarter and up 28 basis points year-over-year.
Third quarter's bottom line was also helped by a $20 million linked quarter reduction in our credit provision. Continued reductions in higher-risk loan portfolios along with generally stable credit quality enabled us to reduce provisioning for the sixth consecutive quarter. Even so, our loan loss reserve is at 4.22%. Net charge-offs declined for the fifth consecutive quarter. Nonperforming assets, although down 25% below a year ago, increased to 2% second to third quarter due to fewer resolutions and lower paydowns. The total end flow of new NPA is steady despite a couple of larger commercial credits going on non-accrual. Greg will give you more details later in the call.
It is important to keep in mind that with the winding down of our Non-Strategic loans, we may experience a little more quarterly fluctuation in credit quality metrics, given the size of our C&I and commercial real estate credits and the cyclicality of commercial portfolios. Overall, we believe that our credit quality trend will be improved. 
I'm pleased with our third quarter progress, but a slow growth economy, low interest rates, elevated environmental expenses and implementation of the Dodd-Frank bill are likely to present challenges for the financial services industry and us. We believe we're well-positioned to meet the challenges ahead as well as take advantage of the opportunities that will ultimately arise.
On the regulatory front, it's too early to know the full impact of reforms on revenue or expenses, but we believe that they will be manageable for us. We will continue to focus on improving our efficiency and productivity to help offset the impact of reform. Additionally, we will prudently revisit pricing of effective products and services as circumstances warrant.
Let me take a minute to address some of the industry issues around the mortgage foreclosure process. We deal with foreclosures in residential mortgages and in home equity loans. As a reminder, we sold our national residential mortgages servicing and origination platform to MetLife Bank in August 2008 and have a subservicing agreement with them for the servicing rights that we still own. We were working with MetLife and are allowing them in the terms of the subservicing agreement to ensure that proper policies and procedures are being followed. Through September, 2010, MetLife has foreclosed roughly 4,500 loans year-to-date, with approximately another 8,200 loans currently in the foreclosure process. MetLife is currently reviewing its overall foreclosure process and working with outside foreclosure counsel and agencies as appropriate. 
On the Home Equity side, our portfolio is mostly second liens, and, thus, the number of foreclosures remained relatively small. Currently, there are roughly 200 foreclosures in process on Home Equity loans. We believe that our risk with this issue should be manageable. Foreclosures are an unfortunate and less-than-desirable outcome for everyone involved: investors, servicers and, especially, homeowners. For that reason, like others, we believe that it is important that foreclosures, when necessary, be handled properly.
Finally, we built a strong balance sheet with solid capital base, another advantage for us in our footprint. At September 30, tangible common equity and tangible assets was 8%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was over 10%. We believe that we will be well positioned for the newly issued Basel III requirements as they become the new standards. 
Now BJ will take you through the financial results and then Greg will discuss credit quality, and I'll be back for some final comments. BJ?"

Good morning, everybody. If you flip to Slide 5, this just shows our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. EPS again was $0.07, up from last quarter's $0.01. You'll find all of our key highlights on this slide, but I'",891,"Great. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. If you flip to Slide 5, this just shows our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. EPS again was $0.07, up from last quarter's $0.01. You'll find all of our key highlights on this slide, but I'll talk about them in more detail on the following pages.
So if you take a look at Slide 6, we'll look at our overall and business segment trends. Our consolidated pretax income increased $19 million linked quarter to $37 million. Regional Bank, Capital Markets and our Corporate segments, which we call our core businesses, produced combined pretax income of $77 million, up 50% from second quarter's levels. 
Linked quarter, the Regional Banks pretax income was up 63% to $48 million, driven by an $18 million decline in provision. Revenues rose 1%, as NII in the bank was up 4%, reflecting higher spreads in our loan portfolio. Fees were down a couple of percent as we saw continued negative impact from Reg E, which was somewhat offset by other income.
On the Capital Markets side, we booked another strong quarter as pretax income climbed $15 million to $43 million linked quarter. Fixed incomes average daily revenue improved to $1.7 million from the prior period's $1.5 million. The improvement in what is, historically, a soft quarter was driven by increased activity from depository customers.
In our Corporate segment, the pretax loss widened to $14 million, primarily due to higher expenses and lower NII. On expense side linked quarter, the expenses were up $8 million with the variance primarily driven by the inclusion of a $5 million benefit related to a VISA litigation liability reversal in the second quarter. 
And on the NII side, our securities portfolio remains stable at about $2.6 billion. However, reinvestment rates are lower, pressuring yields, which drops about 26 basis points in the third quarter. 
On the Non-Strategic segment, we posted a 15% decline in revenue as servicing income declined 29% to $44 million in the quarter, reflecting lower net hedging results, the full effect of second quarter servicing sales and the reduced size of our servicing portfolios to approximately $30 billion. Net hedging results decreased 28% to $32 million, due mostly to interest rate movements and credit marks. On the expense side, mortgage repurchase provision expense decreased from $56 million to $49 million in the third quarter, and I'll go into more detail on this on the next slide.
So if you click there to Slide 7, if you look at the bottom left chart, in the third quarter, the active pipeline grew to $469 million. New requests were fairly stable from last quarter's levels, that's the dark blue bar, with the vast majority continuing to come from the GSEs. If you look at the light blue bar, resolutions nearly doubled to $146 million from second quarter's $74 million and are reflected in higher net realized losses of $36 million. As you can see on the bottom right-chart, requests are still concentrated in the 2007 vintage. Our rescission rates have held steady at 40% to 50%, and our loss severity remains at approximately 55%. 
Going forward, we will have continued emphasis on increasing resolutions. And a note, though we've seen negligible put-back activity from private securitizations, we know that there has been increased industry discussion on this topic. And we here continue to review and monitor this very closely. As you know, the standards for reps and warranty somewhat differ between GSEs and private labels. And as such, it may cause differing trends in both request activity and the resolution process. 
As a point of reference on our historical put-backs, which again is largely GSEs, out of the roughly $60 billion of our GSE originations from 2005 to 2008, our total repurchase request to date has been approximately $800 million, or roughly 1% of originations, and we have successfully resolved in our favor 40% to 50% of this request.
Moving on to Slide 8, you'll see margin and the balance sheet trends. Our consolidated NIM increased four basis points to 3.23%. Core business NIM, Regional Banks, Capital Markets and our Corporate segment, remained solid at 3.57%. Third quarter's consolidated margin benefited from better loan pricing, lower deposit costs and less drag from our non-accruals. These positives were somewhat offset by the negative impact of our excess-said balances that we carried during the quarter as well as those lower reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio. But looking at all of these factors in aggregate, we do believe that the NIM could modestly benefit in the short term as we reduce the excess balances that we carry at the Fed and continue to improve our loan pricing. But we generally expect little opportunity for meaningful improvement in our consolidated margin until interest rates increase.
As Bryan discussed earlier, we view our balance sheet as well-positioned. Core deposits were relatively stable. Linked quarter, we saw Non-Strategic loans decline 6%, as expected. But going forward, we expect the rate of runoff to slow as the shorter-duration construction portfolios are eliminated. 
Overall, we're pleased with our progress and positioning for this environment. We're focused financially on further strengthening our balance sheet, improving our pricing and our margins as well as our productivity and efficiency. Now I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss some of our asset quality trends."

I'll start with Slide 10. Overall, third quarter showed continued stabilization in credit quality. Although not surprisingly, there was some volatility.

Overall, third quarter showed continued stabilization in credit quality. Although not surprisingly, there was some volatility. Charge-offs decreased 16% to $111 million from last quarter. Aggregate reserve declined 8% to $720 million due to lower loan balances from runoff, paydowns and charge-offs.
Now moving to Slide 11. We saw some lumpiness in our non-performers, which rose 2% from last quarter but were nonetheless down 25% year-over-year. Inflow stayed steady, and the percent of NPLs was basically flat from last quarter at 4.31%. The linked quarter increase was driven by a handful of large credits and fewer payments in resolutions in the NPA portfolio. We're seeing a reduction in resolutions as the compositions of non-performers is changing from more dated, non-strategic assets to commercial loans. Additionally, commercial TDRs increased, reflecting efforts to mitigate loss potentials by working with our distressed borrowers and adjusting as the industry moves forward with more consistent practices.
I'll now discuss key trends by portfolios, starting with income CRE on Slide 12. Income CRE balances were $1.5 billion, or 9% of our loan portfolio. Linked quarter, net charge-offs declined $22 million to $11 million. Non-performers were up at 10.1%. And as we progress through the maturity cycle of commercial real estate, we expect continued deterioration in 2011. At third quarter, reserves in our income CRE portfolio were at 9.5%, and the reserves have been about 8% for seven quarters now.
Moving on to the C&I portfolio on Slide 13. Ending balances were at $7.3 billion, up 5% from 2Q '10. Linked quarter charge-offs increased from $20 million to $24 million. This included an $11 million fraud-related credit that we charged off in the third quarter. 
As you can see on Slide 14, the C&I portfolio also includes approximately $700 million of TruPS, bank holding company and other bank-related loans. About $300 million are bank TruPS, including seven loans on interest referral at quarter end. Insurance TruPS comprised $164 million, $136 million were loans to bank holding companies and $96 million for other loans secured by bank stock. Financial institutions remain stressed, and we will continue to monitor this portion of the C&I portfolio very carefully.
I'll talk about our Home Equity portfolio on Slide 15. Home Equity balances were at $5.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. 30-day delinquencies were 2.33%, up 14 basis points or $5 million linked quarter, which was driven by more borrowers in the foreclosure review process. Non-performers in the Home Equity portfolio were up 11 basis points to 0.46%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to work with borrowers on modifications.
Net charge-offs were up $40 million in the second quarter to $46 million in the third quarter. This increase includes $9 million of charge-offs related to accelerating loss recognition of charge-offs for clients who were nonresponsive for 60 days. Due to the vintage mix and strong borrower characteristics, we expect relative stability in the Home Equity portfolio over the near term. Noting the consumer delinquency and loss rates remain highly correlated with unemployment trends. We continue to assume the economic recovery and employment gains will remain slow.
I'll wrap up on Slide 16. Third quarter demonstrated generally positive credit metrics, including lower provision expense and a decline in charge-off. There was some fluctuation in non-performers as we are at a stage in the credit cycle when some commercial loans are experiencing greater stress. And given their size, this can lead to lumpiness in charge-offs and NPAs. Also as our Non-Strategic portfolios wind down, the magnitude of our reserve decreases is likely to lessen, especially in our consumer and construction portfolios.
As Bryan earlier noted, we believe that our overall credit quality trend will remain improving. I'll now turn it over to Bryan for some closing comments."

And we think that we've got a very strong capital base, which really enables us to do things, one, to work with our regulators as we think about how we repay the TARP, to do it in a reasonable fashion and a reasonable timeframe. And we would expect to continue to work with our regulators in that regard. With respect to the M&A environment, we think that's an opportunity for us to put capital to work. We're going to be very focused and measured in how and when we'd execute on that. We want to make sure that we have the right kind of opportunity and the right kind of market, and it helps us build the franchise for the long-term. And we think there will be opportunities there. We don't feel any particular urgency around the M&A environment right now, simply because we see ourselves making very good progress on the things that we're focused on day to day, growing customers, getting more productive in the way we produce revenue and more efficient in the way that we produce that revenue. And so we think we've got a lot of opportunities in a number of different avenues, and so we're very encouraged about what we think the next several quarters and several years hold in terms of our ability to grow the business."

And then kind of a tag-on to that is how do we kind of think about the pre-payment risk in the mortgage side if you go from what is an inflated level but not really where we should be, given where interest rates are at. And if we were to lose some of the servicing possibility as well as some of the national HELOC volume and, also, more reinvestment risk and investment portfolio, how do we handle that comps on our yields as well."

Our yield's declined about 26 basis points there. What we're trying to do with our securities portfolio is make sure that the structure is right of what we're buying, as opposed to looking for yields.",347,"On the reinvestment risk, I think I talked about that. Our yield's declined about 26 basis points there. What we're trying to do with our securities portfolio is make sure that the structure is right of what we're buying, as opposed to looking for yields. So our durations are staying very short, we're probably in the 2 ½ year range. And we want to make sure that we don't get caught upside down on the carry trade if rates suddenly move up. So our reinvestment rates right now are right in the 2.5% range. And if you look at our maturity stacks going forward into next year and next few years, there certainly is going to be a drag if interest rates stay where they are and our reinvestment rates stay where they are. But as you know, our securities portfolio percentage of our assets is relatively small versus peers. So we think that, that drag is manageable, and we would rather not reach for yield there. We do think with the pipeline that we have on the loan side, we'd much rather put some money to work there and try to get some loan yields, which we think could happen over the next several quarters. So, like I said, on the NIM overall, we think it can modestly improve over the near-term. And then it will take some interest rates in general to make it move up meaningfully. In terms of the pre-payment risk on MSR, I think our CPR this quarter was 13%. So it's still very, very low. You're exactly right. If that started to increase, we'd have it running down. But as we sit here today, we think that servicing portfolio is very manageable at this size. We very much like how we're able to hedge it and the knowledge and expertise that we have around hedging it. And so we think it's a good asset for us to help us somewhat offset some of the mortgage repurchase expense that we have. So as we sit here today, we're pretty comfortable with it."
