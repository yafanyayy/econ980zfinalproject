Good evening and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin the call by saying how pleased we are with our performance in the quarter, which capped a solid year for PerkinElmer. In a moment, Andy will go into more detail",987,"Thanks, Dave. Good evening and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin the call by saying how pleased we are with our performance in the quarter, which capped a solid year for PerkinElmer. In a moment, Andy will go into more detail on our financial results. But first, let me provide you with an overview of the fourth quarter.Turning first to the financials, we continued to see sequential topline improvement across the company and solid profitability and cash flow performances. Both our revenue and EPS were ahead of our expectations as we experienced improvement in all of our end markets and benefited from our robust pipeline of products, introducing almost as many new products in 2009 than we did in the previous two years combined. In addition, our solid financial performance in the fourth quarter, we also made significant strides in driving growth opportunities in attractive end markets, investing in innovative technologies and continuing to expand our global footprint.  In Human Health, during the quarter we expanded newborn screening in China through our recent SYM-BIO acquisition and also advanced adoption and capacity of first trimester prenatal screening, setting up national labs in New Zealand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.We leveraged our genetic screening technology into child health with the launch of our new steroid profiling kit, which is the first commercially available kit designed to help diagnose hormonal imbalances and endocrinal-based diseases. During the quarter, NTD Labs joined the Aetna network, becoming the first exclusive provider of a first trimester Down Syndrome screening protocol using the free-beta hCG biomarker. We also made excellent progress with our continued investment in diagnostic and research technologies. In diagnostics, we launched the only first trimester test available for early onset pre-eclampsia in Europe and Asia Pacific. And with our new DELFIA Xpress kit, PerkinElmer is well-positioned in the early onset market, reducing the risks, disabilities and expense caused by the condition.In the research markets, we are having early success with expanding beyond traditional high throughput screening of drug compounds into the rapidly growing Biologics market. Our innovative AlphaLISA no-wash reagent technology, which is comprised of a series of advance assays has now been expanded to 140 kits to aid in the detection of cancer, diabetes, neurological and other critical disease states. In addition, we entered into a strategic alliance with Corning to advance the development of next generation label-free technologies, which will provide researchers with deeper insights into biomolecular and cellular interactions through direct observation.We also launched our enhanced EnSpire Multilabel Plate Readers with luminescence for enabling broader access to improve the primary and stem cell research. In the quarter, we also addressed critical environmental food and consumer safety concerns and continued to partner with our customers to help them meet new more stringent detection requirements as a result of new regulations. In Europe, we launched new phthalate detection solutions, which were developed specifically to ensure compliance with new laws. In greater China, we grew our partnership with the Beijing Food Safety Monitoring Center as the center significantly increased its food monitoring geographical reach. We also expanded our service partnership with the Taiwan EPA Air Monitoring division as they expanded to 12 sites. We were pleased with the continued uptake of our latest Environmental Health innovations such as our proprietary Swafer technology in the environmental market and our Viper differential scanning calorimeter systemsfor materials characterization as well as the advancement of hyphenated technologies in the pharmaceutical and academic class. For example, the new DSC-Raman system combines the strength of our thermal analysis with Raman spectroscopy to provide greater insight into material changes at a molecular level. We also shipped our first single quad mass spec to Gilson who we are collaborating with as part of our long term strategy to expand our mass spec offerings to key global market segments. So the fourth quarter brought to close a year where global economic conditions created a significant head wind, but one that I feel good about our performance. First of all, we expanded adjusted gross margins by 50 basis points despite a decline in revenue of approximately $150 million as compared to the prior year, which was a bigger drop than we expected. In addition, we we're able to generate adjusted earnings per share $0.02 above the midpoint of our original full year guidance provided in January of 2009, which also included approximately $0.04 of dilution from a higher than expected tax rate.Our strategy of deploying a balanced approach of effectively managing cost and continuing to invest in innovative technologies has served us well, enabling us to exceed our goals and to exit 2009 as a much stronger company financially and better positioned strategically. As we begin 2010, our focus will be in three areas. First, to increase the growth profile of the company to expanding our global footprint, aggressively increasing our reach through partnerships, collaborations and acquisitions and leveraging our technology and capabilities into adjacent markets. Second, continuing to investing and introducing new innovative technologies for better detection and prevention in Human and Environmental Health. And third, achieving good financial returns through strong cash flows and maintaining a focused approach on driving operating margin improvement.Before turning the call over to Andy, let me briefly discuss our financial outlook for 2010. At this time, we believe the worst is behind us but the recovery will be modest and slow to develop. As such, we expect to accelerate our rate of growth for both revenue and adjusted earnings per share as economic conditions improve and we cycle up against somewhat easier comparisons as we progress through the year. For the full year, we expect organic revenue to increase at a low- to mid-single digit rate and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42.  I would now like to call over to Andy to give more details on our Q4 performance and 2010 guidance."

I'll now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter results and after my prepared remarks, we'll open up the call up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I would like to clarify that",1943,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter results and after my prepared remarks, we'll open up the call up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I would like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.As Rob mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we were able to deliver a solid earnings and cash flow performance. Revenue for the fourth quarter was flat as compared to same period last year. The favorable impact of foreign exchange was 4% and the favorable impact from acquisitions was 1%. Therefore, organic revenue was down 5% versus the prior year. The remaining analysis in my prepared remarks will be presented net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions.By segment, organic revenue declined by 5% and 6% in the Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. By geography, organic revenue in the Americas declined at a high single-digit rate and organic revenue in Europe declined low double-digit. Although we experienced sequential improvement in Europe, the Americas and Europe continue to be impacted by economic challenges as well as delays in the release of stimulus moneys. Organic revenue at Asia grew low double-digits, with all major product lines contributing to the growth. Within the Asia region, organic revenue in China and India both grew well above 20%.From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 39% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we served two end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 21% of total revenue; and research, which represented 18% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business declined to the mid-single digit rate in the fourth quarter as continued strength in our genetic screening business was offset by double-digit declines in our Medical Imaging business. Organic revenue in genetic screening grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter driven by continued strength of our neonatal and prenatal screening systems. Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business was down approximate 30% in the quarter. However, we experienced sequential improvement across all served markets. With demand trends improving on the base business and solid traction on new OEM relationships, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in organic revenue growth for the full year 2010.In the fourth quarter, organic revenue in our research business declined at a low single-digit rate as the business cycled up against a difficult comparison from the fourth quarter of 2008. Consistent with our experience in the third quarter, demand for reagents and low end instrumentation was fueled by customer's continuing need to spend on basic research. However, this growth was more than offset by softness in the high end instrument demand, a result of stimulus-related delays. The Environmental Health business represented 61% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter. Within the Environmental Health business, we serve four end markets: Laboratory services; environmental; safety and security; and industrial. Our Lab Services business represented approximately 20% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue grew at a high single-digit rate. OneSource, our customer-focused multi-vendor offering was a key contributor to this growth in the quarter and delivered a very strong performance for the year. In addition to OneSource, we continue to be encouraged by improving demand trends in our traditional service offerings, which we believe are indicative of improving economic confidence in customer labs. The Environmental market represented approximately 17% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, with organic revenue declining low double-digit. We were encouraged by continued sequential improvement in the quarter. However, constrained capital spending in this customer segment continues to dampen demand. Offsetting this decline was a strong growth in China, a result of the impact of stimulus moneys and as Rob stated earlier, key wins for our air monitoring solutions.Additionally, on a global basis, we continued to see strength in the development, production and usage of renewable energy technologies, driving demand across a broad array of our analytical technology offerings. The Safety and Security market represented approximately 13% of total revenues in the fourth quarter, with organic revenues declining at high single-digit rate. In this segment, as Rob mentioned, we achieved key food safety wins with government agencies in China and the new regulations in food and consumer safety recently adopted in the U.S. will continue to drive strong demand in these key markets.Additionally, in the quarter, we saw strong follow-on demand for our thermal power sensors in response to the H1N1 virus. Offsetting this growth is the continued weak demand in fire detection and intrusion alarms and a very difficult comparison in the defense-related business related to a lifetime buy of optical sensors in 2008.Our industrial markets represented approximately 11% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue declined high teens. These markets, which include chemicals, semiconductor and petroleum refining, experienced a significant as much as sequential improvement in the rate of decline. We are pleased to see continued stabilization in these markets and are encouraged by our customers beginning to rebuild capacity. Turning to our financial performance. Adjusted gross margin was down 10 basis points in the fourth quarter as benefits of our cost containment actions were offset by unfavorable product mix in the period. Adjusted research and development expenses were $27.1 million or 5.4% of revenue in the quarter, up 40 basis points from the prior year. We have increased our rate of investment in innovative technologies throughout the year despite the difficult economic environment to fuel future growth in our existing end markets as well as attractive adjacent markets.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.7 million versus the prior year, of which approximately $4 million was attributable to foreign exchange and the remainder due to primarily to selling and marketing investments and higher variable-based compensation. Adjusted SG&A expenses were up as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as cost containment initiatives were offset by the aforementioned items. GAAP operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus $72.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating profit was $74.6 million versus $85.8 million in the fourth quarter 2008, which as a percentage of sales, represented a decline of 220 basis points year-over-year to 15%.Interest expense net of interest income for the fourth quarter was $3.9 million as compared to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter 2008. This decrease was primarily due to a one-time expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $17.7 million related to the acquisition of ViaCell. Excluding this one-time expense, the remaining reduction in net interest expense is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances.Other income was $800 million in the quarter as compared to an expense of $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The expense in the prior year was primarily related to increased foreign exchange cost due to high exchange rate volatility in the fourth quarter of 2008.For the fourth quarter of 2009, we had an effective tax rate of 28.8% on a reported bases versus a previously communicated tax rate of 31% as we experienced a positive shift in geographic mix and income as well as the timing of favorable tax settlements. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.33 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter 2008. Our adjusted EPS was $0.43 in the fourth quarter 2009, down 7% from the same period a year ago. Regarding the weighted average diluted share count, we had 116.9 million shares outstanding in the quarter, which was essentially flat, sequentially.Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the fourth quarter with approximately $379 million of net debt, which we define as short and long term debt minus cash. Adjusted net debt, which excludes the impact of the termination of our accounts receivable securitization program in the second quarter of 2009 increased approximately $9 million as compared to the prior year as we were able to utilize our strong operating cash flows to fund our strategic acquisitions throughout the year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $180 million of cash and approximately $230 million of undrawn availability under our revolving line of credit with no mandatory maturities due until 2012.Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $64.2 million as compared to $93.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of payments for restructuring and compensation expenses. For the full year 2009, we generated $198.3 million of adjusted operating cash flow as compared to $214.5 million in 2008. Working capital turns were essentially flat year-over-year.  In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the full year. Let me now reiterate our 2010 guidance and provide some further detail. As Rob mentioned, we expect economic conditions to gradually improve throughout 2010. These underlying economic assumptions, coupled with easier comparisons, will allow us to accelerate our revenue and earnings growth as we progress through the year.Organic revenue performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2008, a performance due in part to the extra days reflected in the first quarter of 2009. Therefore, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult organic growth comparison. Overall, we expect to see continued growth in the markets that have been fairly resilient in the economic downturn, specifically screening, lab services and food and consumer safety testing. Within our Research business, we expect continued steady performances from our reagents and low end instrumentation offering. And we now expect to see the impact of stimulus-related growth in our high end instrumentation beginning in the second quarter.As mentioned previously, we are encouraged by demand trends in our Medical Imaging business and we anticipate that this business will be able to deliver organic revenue growth by the end of 2010. The environmental and industrial markets are expected to continue to improve sequentially as our customers deploy capital to meet growing economic activity. So to reiterate what Rob shared earlier, we expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid single-digit range for the full year and expect the first quarter of 2010 to be essentially flat, including the impact of the extra days in the first quarter 2009. Regarding adjusted operating margins, given the expected leverage from anticipated revenue growth and other productivity gains, we expect operating margins to expand in the range of 50 to 100 basis points in 2010. Additionally, we expect our geographic distribution of income in 2010 to reduce our effective tax rate. And therefore, we are estimating our effective tax rate to be approximately 29%. Bringing all of these factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2010 to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42, with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.29. Once again, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and for the year. The organization executed very well, delivering on the financial commitment set at the beginning of the year for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow. So that's the end of the prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave."

And I think we will grow for the full year, but we probably won't see positive growth in this business until probably the middle of the year. Part of that is because we do have a difficult comparison in Q1. And as we talked about it before, it was more of a function of how our ordering and our contract patterns work, so that the -- our customers, it was difficult for them to take their orders down in Q1 '09 as rapidly as what was happening in the market. So we still -- I would say artificially high in Q1 of '09 and we're going to cycle up against that. But we do think we will return to positive growth probably around the middle of the year.

As far as increasing our investments into the industrial area, I think what we're trying to do is be more and more focused in those end markets and those applications, where we see the highest growth prospects. So I think if we saw higher revenue and we wanted to do some more investments, I would say the industrial area would probably not be an area of significant focus for us. We'll probably be in some of the other areas like the food safety, like the environmental area. I think we'd probably see the investment before some of the industrial areas."

I'd like to begin the call by saying how pleased we are with our performance in the quarter, which capped a solid year for PerkinElmer. In a moment, Andy will go into more detail on our financial results. But first, let me provide you with an overview of the fourth quarter.Turning first to the financials, we continued to see sequential topline improvement across the company and solid profitability and cash flow performances. Both our revenue and EPS were ahead of our expectations as we experienced improvement in all of our end markets and benefited from our robust pipeline of products, introducing almost as many new products in 2009 than we did in the previous two years combined. In addition, our solid financial performance in the fourth quarter, we also made significant strides in driving growth opportunities in attractive end markets, investing in innovative technologies and continuing to expand our global footprint.  In Human Health, during the quarter we expanded newborn screening in China through our recent SYM-BIO acquisition and also advanced adoption and capacity of first trimester prenatal screening, setting up national labs in New Zealand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.We leveraged our genetic screening technology into child health with the launch of our new steroid profiling kit, which is the first commercially available kit designed to help diagnose hormonal imbalances and endocrinal-based diseases. During the quarter, NTD Labs joined the Aetna network, becoming the first exclusive provider of a first trimester Down Syndrome screening protocol using the free-beta hCG biomarker. We also made excellent progress with our continued investment in diagnostic and research technologies. In diagnostics, we launched the only first trimester test available for early onset pre-eclampsia in Europe and Asia Pacific. And with our new DELFIA Xpress kit, PerkinElmer is well-positioned in the early onset market, reducing the risks, disabilities and expense caused by the condition.In the research markets, we are having early success with expanding beyond traditional high throughput screening of drug compounds into the rapidly growing Biologics market. Our innovative AlphaLISA no-wash reagent technology, which is comprised of a series of advance assays has now been expanded to 140 kits to aid in the detection of cancer, diabetes, neurological and other critical disease states. In addition, we entered into a strategic alliance with Corning to advance the development of next generation label-free technologies, which will provide researchers with deeper insights into biomolecular and cellular interactions through direct observation.We also launched our enhanced EnSpire Multilabel Plate Readers with luminescence for enabling broader access to improve the primary and stem cell research. In the quarter, we also addressed critical environmental food and consumer safety concerns and continued to partner with our customers to help them meet new more stringent detection requirements as a result of new regulations. In Europe, we launched new phthalate detection solutions, which were developed specifically to ensure compliance with new laws. In greater China, we grew our partnership with the Beijing Food Safety Monitoring Center as the center significantly increased its food monitoring geographical reach. We also expanded our service partnership with the Taiwan EPA Air Monitoring division as they expanded to 12 sites. We were pleased with the continued uptake of our latest Environmental Health innovations such as our proprietary Swafer technology in the environmental market and our Viper differential scanning calorimeter systemsfor materials characterization as well as the advancement of hyphenated technologies in the pharmaceutical and academic class. For example, the new DSC-Raman system combines the strength of our thermal analysis with Raman spectroscopy to provide greater insight into material changes at a molecular level. We also shipped our first single quad mass spec to Gilson who we are collaborating with as part of our long term strategy to expand our mass spec offerings to key global market segments. So the fourth quarter brought to close a year where global economic conditions created a significant head wind, but one that I feel good about our performance. First of all, we expanded adjusted gross margins by 50 basis points despite a decline in revenue of approximately $150 million as compared to the prior year, which was a bigger drop than we expected. In addition, we we're able to generate adjusted earnings per share $0.02 above the midpoint of our original full year guidance provided in January of 2009, which also included approximately $0.04 of dilution from a higher than expected tax rate.Our strategy of deploying a balanced approach of effectively managing cost and continuing to invest in innovative technologies has served us well, enabling us to exceed our goals and to exit 2009 as a much stronger company financially and better positioned strategically. As we begin 2010, our focus will be in three areas. First, to increase the growth profile of the company to expanding our global footprint, aggressively increasing our reach through partnerships, collaborations and acquisitions and leveraging our technology and capabilities into adjacent markets. Second, continuing to investing and introducing new innovative technologies for better detection and prevention in Human and Environmental Health. And third, achieving good financial returns through strong cash flows and maintaining a focused approach on driving operating margin improvement.Before turning the call over to Andy, let me briefly discuss our financial outlook for 2010. At this time, we believe the worst is behind us but the recovery will be modest and slow to develop. As such, we expect to accelerate our rate of growth for both revenue and adjusted earnings per share as economic conditions improve and we cycle up against somewhat easier comparisons as we progress through the year. For the full year, we expect organic revenue to increase at a low- to mid-single digit rate and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42.  I would now like to call over to Andy to give more details on our Q4 performance and 2010 guidance."

I'll now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter results and after my prepared remarks, we'll open up the call up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I would like to clarify that",1943,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter results and after my prepared remarks, we'll open up the call up for questions. Before moving into the financial details, I would like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I'm referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.As Rob mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we were able to deliver a solid earnings and cash flow performance. Revenue for the fourth quarter was flat as compared to same period last year. The favorable impact of foreign exchange was 4% and the favorable impact from acquisitions was 1%. Therefore, organic revenue was down 5% versus the prior year. The remaining analysis in my prepared remarks will be presented net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions.By segment, organic revenue declined by 5% and 6% in the Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. By geography, organic revenue in the Americas declined at a high single-digit rate and organic revenue in Europe declined low double-digit. Although we experienced sequential improvement in Europe, the Americas and Europe continue to be impacted by economic challenges as well as delays in the release of stimulus moneys. Organic revenue at Asia grew low double-digits, with all major product lines contributing to the growth. Within the Asia region, organic revenue in China and India both grew well above 20%.From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 39% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we served two end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 21% of total revenue; and research, which represented 18% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business declined to the mid-single digit rate in the fourth quarter as continued strength in our genetic screening business was offset by double-digit declines in our Medical Imaging business. Organic revenue in genetic screening grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter driven by continued strength of our neonatal and prenatal screening systems. Organic revenue in our Medical Imaging business was down approximate 30% in the quarter. However, we experienced sequential improvement across all served markets. With demand trends improving on the base business and solid traction on new OEM relationships, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in organic revenue growth for the full year 2010.In the fourth quarter, organic revenue in our research business declined at a low single-digit rate as the business cycled up against a difficult comparison from the fourth quarter of 2008. Consistent with our experience in the third quarter, demand for reagents and low end instrumentation was fueled by customer's continuing need to spend on basic research. However, this growth was more than offset by softness in the high end instrument demand, a result of stimulus-related delays. The Environmental Health business represented 61% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter. Within the Environmental Health business, we serve four end markets: Laboratory services; environmental; safety and security; and industrial. Our Lab Services business represented approximately 20% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue grew at a high single-digit rate. OneSource, our customer-focused multi-vendor offering was a key contributor to this growth in the quarter and delivered a very strong performance for the year. In addition to OneSource, we continue to be encouraged by improving demand trends in our traditional service offerings, which we believe are indicative of improving economic confidence in customer labs. The Environmental market represented approximately 17% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, with organic revenue declining low double-digit. We were encouraged by continued sequential improvement in the quarter. However, constrained capital spending in this customer segment continues to dampen demand. Offsetting this decline was a strong growth in China, a result of the impact of stimulus moneys and as Rob stated earlier, key wins for our air monitoring solutions.Additionally, on a global basis, we continued to see strength in the development, production and usage of renewable energy technologies, driving demand across a broad array of our analytical technology offerings. The Safety and Security market represented approximately 13% of total revenues in the fourth quarter, with organic revenues declining at high single-digit rate. In this segment, as Rob mentioned, we achieved key food safety wins with government agencies in China and the new regulations in food and consumer safety recently adopted in the U.S. will continue to drive strong demand in these key markets.Additionally, in the quarter, we saw strong follow-on demand for our thermal power sensors in response to the H1N1 virus. Offsetting this growth is the continued weak demand in fire detection and intrusion alarms and a very difficult comparison in the defense-related business related to a lifetime buy of optical sensors in 2008.Our industrial markets represented approximately 11% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and organic revenue declined high teens. These markets, which include chemicals, semiconductor and petroleum refining, experienced a significant as much as sequential improvement in the rate of decline. We are pleased to see continued stabilization in these markets and are encouraged by our customers beginning to rebuild capacity. Turning to our financial performance. Adjusted gross margin was down 10 basis points in the fourth quarter as benefits of our cost containment actions were offset by unfavorable product mix in the period. Adjusted research and development expenses were $27.1 million or 5.4% of revenue in the quarter, up 40 basis points from the prior year. We have increased our rate of investment in innovative technologies throughout the year despite the difficult economic environment to fuel future growth in our existing end markets as well as attractive adjacent markets.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.7 million versus the prior year, of which approximately $4 million was attributable to foreign exchange and the remainder due to primarily to selling and marketing investments and higher variable-based compensation. Adjusted SG&A expenses were up as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as cost containment initiatives were offset by the aforementioned items. GAAP operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus $72.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating profit was $74.6 million versus $85.8 million in the fourth quarter 2008, which as a percentage of sales, represented a decline of 220 basis points year-over-year to 15%.Interest expense net of interest income for the fourth quarter was $3.9 million as compared to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter 2008. This decrease was primarily due to a one-time expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $17.7 million related to the acquisition of ViaCell. Excluding this one-time expense, the remaining reduction in net interest expense is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances.Other income was $800 million in the quarter as compared to an expense of $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The expense in the prior year was primarily related to increased foreign exchange cost due to high exchange rate volatility in the fourth quarter of 2008.For the fourth quarter of 2009, we had an effective tax rate of 28.8% on a reported bases versus a previously communicated tax rate of 31% as we experienced a positive shift in geographic mix and income as well as the timing of favorable tax settlements. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.33 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter 2008. Our adjusted EPS was $0.43 in the fourth quarter 2009, down 7% from the same period a year ago. Regarding the weighted average diluted share count, we had 116.9 million shares outstanding in the quarter, which was essentially flat, sequentially.Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the fourth quarter with approximately $379 million of net debt, which we define as short and long term debt minus cash. Adjusted net debt, which excludes the impact of the termination of our accounts receivable securitization program in the second quarter of 2009 increased approximately $9 million as compared to the prior year as we were able to utilize our strong operating cash flows to fund our strategic acquisitions throughout the year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $180 million of cash and approximately $230 million of undrawn availability under our revolving line of credit with no mandatory maturities due until 2012.Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $64.2 million as compared to $93.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of payments for restructuring and compensation expenses. For the full year 2009, we generated $198.3 million of adjusted operating cash flow as compared to $214.5 million in 2008. Working capital turns were essentially flat year-over-year.  In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the full year. Let me now reiterate our 2010 guidance and provide some further detail. As Rob mentioned, we expect economic conditions to gradually improve throughout 2010. These underlying economic assumptions, coupled with easier comparisons, will allow us to accelerate our revenue and earnings growth as we progress through the year.Organic revenue performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2008, a performance due in part to the extra days reflected in the first quarter of 2009. Therefore, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult organic growth comparison. Overall, we expect to see continued growth in the markets that have been fairly resilient in the economic downturn, specifically screening, lab services and food and consumer safety testing. Within our Research business, we expect continued steady performances from our reagents and low end instrumentation offering. And we now expect to see the impact of stimulus-related growth in our high end instrumentation beginning in the second quarter.As mentioned previously, we are encouraged by demand trends in our Medical Imaging business and we anticipate that this business will be able to deliver organic revenue growth by the end of 2010. The environmental and industrial markets are expected to continue to improve sequentially as our customers deploy capital to meet growing economic activity. So to reiterate what Rob shared earlier, we expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid single-digit range for the full year and expect the first quarter of 2010 to be essentially flat, including the impact of the extra days in the first quarter 2009. Regarding adjusted operating margins, given the expected leverage from anticipated revenue growth and other productivity gains, we expect operating margins to expand in the range of 50 to 100 basis points in 2010. Additionally, we expect our geographic distribution of income in 2010 to reduce our effective tax rate. And therefore, we are estimating our effective tax rate to be approximately 29%. Bringing all of these factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2010 to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42, with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.29. Once again, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and for the year. The organization executed very well, delivering on the financial commitment set at the beginning of the year for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow. So that's the end of the prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave."

Clearly, there's been some recovery in the capital expenditures in hospitals, and so I would say we will see growth for 2010. It probably won't occur until sort of the middle of the year, though. And I think we will grow for the full year, but we probably won't see positive growth in this business until probably the middle of the year. Part of that is because we do have a difficult comparison in Q1. And as we talked about it before, it was more of a function of how our ordering and our contract patterns work, so that the -- our customers, it was difficult for them to take their orders down in Q1 '09 as rapidly as what was happening in the market. So we still -- I would say artificially high in Q1 of '09 and we're going to cycle up against that. But we do think we will return to positive growth probably around the middle of the year. And we do think we'll see positive growth for the full year in Medical Imaging for 2010."

Having said that, while we clearly would have some of it drops through the bottom line, we see opportunities to invest. And the way we've tried to build our 2010 operating plan is with sort of a gated view of investments. So as we see the growth, I think we've, hopefully, have been conservative from a top line forecast, to the extent that we see higher growth. Some of that will flow through. But some of that will clearly be invested back in the opportunities we see, to continue to expand that into these adjacencies we talked about.

Let me begin by saying that we are pleased by our first quarter financial performance. We started the year strong and believe that we are very well positioned strategically in attractive end markets and innovative technologies.  
Our results on the top line exceeded our expectations, as many of the most challenged markets in the economic downturn returned to growth in the quarter.  We are particularly pleased with these results given the difficult comparisons from the first quarter of 2009, including the impact of the extra selling days that we had in the first quarter last year.  
Additionally we were able to significantly expand operating margins and generate strong growth in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow.  Amy will provide more details on the financial performance shortly.  I would now like to share some of our first quarter highlights regarding progress on our key initiatives to increase the growth profile of the company and expand detection and prevention capabilities to advance human and environmental health. 
Starting with human health, we recently announced our intent to acquire Signature Genomic deepening our commitment to the diagnostics market.  Signature brings complimentary services to our existing diagnostics profile with cutting edge cytogenetic technology providing unmatched accuracy and comprehensive [vista] results.  
In addition to complimenting our current business, Signature provides expansion opportunities in the diagnostic oncology with an offering that combines multiple key detection elements in a single assay.  We launched our new backs-on-beads technology, a multi-plex diagnostic tool that can detect markers of multiple diseases from a single serum sample, to the European market this quarter with strong early receptivity resulting in key customer wins in large hospitals and labs. 
Additionally we are piloting a new diagnostic technology program for detecting severe combined immunodeficiency disorder or SCIDS.  A primary deficiency in the immune system that results in the onset of serious infections, even life threatening ones, within the first few months of life. 
This pilot project for SCIDS screening provides significant opportunity going forward as it is expected to be the first edition to the next menu expansion of mandated newborn tests in U.S. markets.  
In our research business we have seen continued strength from our region portfolio including increased demand for our AlphaWise technology due primarily to the migration to biologic-based drug discovery research.  
We are finding that pre-clinical research laboratories are now standardizing their equipment around AlphaWise to aid in the detection of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, and neurological diseases.
In environmental health, we continue to address critical environmental health and consumer safety concerns with market driven innovation and response to increased global regulatory mandates and the identification of new contaminants. 
In Asia [inaudible] regulatory enforcement has driven increased demand for environmental and food safety monitoring systems as this region migrates toward Western compliance standards.  For instance, an effort to address food safety concerns in China, we are providing the government authority with more than 100 atomic absorption spectrometers for toxic-metal contamination testing.  
In addition, we are seeing strong demand trends in other developing regions within Southeast Asia to impose the stricter quality [work] standards.  In regard to our strategic initiative to expand our mass spec capabilities, I am pleased to report that we have finalized the purchase of the remaining interests of the joint venture.  
Our continued commitment in innovation in this technology will provide our customers with solutions that support the analysis of component elements, trace elements, or contaminants in samples of interest leaning to improved products and applications to their end markets. 
The new Nexion IC-PMS system recently launched at Pittcon advances this trace element analysis with three modes of operation within one instrument creating a highly efficient lab environment.  Additionally we have partnered with Abbott in the area of pathogen detection through the incorporation of our time-of-flight Mas-Tec technology and Abbott’s Plex-ID Pathogen Detection system.  
The Plex-ID system can rapidly and accurately identify pathogens, as well as alert health officials to new disease strains, help guard against bio terrorism, and help hospitals identify antibiotic resistant bacteria in their facilities.  
In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year financially, as well as the progress made on our growth initiatives toward the advancement of human and environmental health.  As mentioned, we are encouraged by the improving trends that we are seeing in our end markets as visibility slowly improves throughout our businesses.  
Given this, we have decided to increase our guidance reflecting our revised estimates for the full year of mid-single digit, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.43 to $1.48.  
I will now turn the call over to Andy to give more details on our Q1 performance and guidance.

I will now provide some additional color in our first quarter results.  After my prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.
Before moving into the financial details, I would like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I’m referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. 
As Rob mentioned earlier, we were pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter as we were able to deliver solid revenue, earnings and cash-flow growth over the prior year, particularly considering the extra selling days during the first quarter of 2009. 
As discussed last year, the increased number of selling days in the baseline contributed to a couple of points of growth in the first quarter of 2009 and this growth had a disproportional impact on our service, reageant and consumable offerings.  
Revenue for the first quarter increased 7% as compared to the same period last year.  The favorable impact of foreign exchange was 4%.  The favorable impact from acquisitions was 1%.  Therefore, organic revenue increased by 2% versus the prior year.  The remaining revenue analyses in my prepared remarks will be presented net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions.  
By segment organic revenue increased by 2% and 3% in the human health and environmental health segments, respectfully.  By geography organic revenue in the Americas was flat.  Europe was up low-single digit and Asia grew at a low double-digit rate.  Within the Asian region, organic revenue in China grew in the high teens.  We experienced solid low double-digit growth in the emerging territories throughout southeast Asia.  
From an in-market perspective, PerkinElmer’s human health segment represented approximately 41% of total revenue in the quarter.  Within human health we served two in-markets diagnostics, which represented 24% of total revenue and research with represented 17% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our diagnostic’s business grew at a mid single-digit rate for the first quarter with our medical imaging business returning to positive growth after considerable contraction in 2009. 
In the first quarter, organic revenue in our research business was flat as this business cycled up after a difficult comparison from the first quarter of 2009 growing low double-digit in the prior year.  We did have [inaudible] demand in our reagent portfolio but this strength was offset by limited capital investment in our high-end instrumentation.  
The environmental health business represented 59% of our total revenue in the first quarter.  Within environmental health we served 4 end markets; laboratory services, environmental, safety and security, and industrial.  Our lab services business represented approximately 20% total revenue in the first quarter and organic revenue grew at a low single-digit rate.  
OneSource our customer-focused, multi-vendor offering maintained strong momentum proving another solid quarter of organic revenue growth.  The environmental market represented approximately 17% of total revenue in the first quarter with organic revenue increasing at a mid single-digit rate.  
As Rob mentioned, we saw strong growth in Asia due to increased demand and response to local regulatory requirements, primarily around water quality migrating to western compliance standards.  Additionally we experienced continued strong demand for our renewable energy offering, particularly in the development of photovoltaic cells used in solar panels.  
This growth was partially offset by continued capital constraints impacting some of our smaller customers.  The safety and security market represented approximately 15% of total revenue in the first quarter with organic revenues increasing at a mid single-digit rate.  
We continue to see improving growth opportunities in food and consumer safety testing as regulatory requirements around the world become more stringent and safety concerns extend to food additives and packaging materials.  Additionally in the quarter, we saw continued strong demand for our thermal power sensors in response to the H1N1 virus.
Lastly, we are beginning to see signs of recovery in extra [inaudible] offerings related to fire protection and intrusion alarms as the housing market stabilizes.  Industrial markets represented approximately 7% total revenue in the first quarter and organic revenues increased at a low single-digit rate.  
We are encouraged to see these markets begin to stabilize and return to growth.  We continue to see traction in chemical opportunities as well as materials prioritization primarily related to research on new materials.  
Turning to our financial performance, adjusted operating margins were up 100 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to successful ongoing cost initiatives and volume leverage.  GAAP operating profit was $39.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $25.3 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Adjusted operating profit was $55.6 million versus $48 million in the first quarter of 2009. 
For the first quarter, we had an effective tax rate of 27.6% on a reported basis versus a previously communicated tax rate of 29% as we experienced a positive shift in the geographic mix of income.  GAAP for EPS for continuing operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $0.22 compared to $0.13 in the first quarter of 2009.  Adjusted EPS was $0.31 in the first quarter of 2010, up 19% from the prior year.  
Regarding our weighted-average diluted share account, we had 117.9 million shares outstanding in the quarter, which was up substantially by approximately 1 million shares due to the issuance under existing stock compensation plans. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with approximately $347 million net debt, which we defined as short and long-term debt minus cash.  This reflects a decrease and adjusted net debt of approximately $66 million as compared to the prior year.  At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $182 million of cash.    
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $52.1 million, this compared to $18 million in the first quarter of 2009.  If you remember the call on the first of 2009, we reduced the amount drawn under our accounts receivable securization facility by $10 million resulting in an unfavorable impact to operating cash flow in the quarter.  
The remaining year-over-year increase and operating cash flow was primarily attributable to solid working capital performance as well as the timing of tax payments.  Working capital turns for the quarter improved slightly year-over-year.  
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, driving strong earnings growth and solid cash flow generation and we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our assertive markets.  
Let me now discuss our 2010 guidance and provide some further detail.  Regarding invested earnings per share, we incorporated 4 key elements into our full-year outlook.  First, we now anticipate full-year revenues to grow organically at a mid single-digit rate versus our previously communicated low to mid single digit growth expectation with the second quarter growing mid-to-high single digits.  
Second, given the traction that we experience in our modern expansion efforts in the first quarter, we are raising the low end of our forecasted improvement by 25 basis points and now expect adjusted operating margins to increase by 75 to 100 basis points for the full year.  
Third, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 200 basis points lower than we previously communicated primarily due to more favorable geographic distribution of income and anticipated beneficial tax legislation.  
Fourth, offsetting these upsides is a couple of pennies of expected dilution from the acquisition of Signature Genomics.  Bringing all of these factors together, we now estimate our full adjusted earnings per share for 2010 to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.48 versus our previously communicated range of $1.35 to $1.42 with adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter expected to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.34. 
Once again, we are pleased with our financial performance in the quarter.  It is clearly a solid start to the year, particularly given the strong baseline for the first quarter of 2009.  
That is the end of my prepared remarks. So now I would like to turn the call back over to Dave.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the PerkinElmer Q2 2010 earnings call.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the PerkinElmer Q2 2010 earnings call. This afternoon I will briefly cover three topics: our financial performance in the Q2, the trends we are seeing in our end markets, and describe some of the progress we have made in advancing our strategic priorities.
    Turning first to our financial results we were quite pleased with our performance as we generated strong revenue growth of 14% and also expanded adjusted operating margins over 120 basis points. This resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.38 which represents a significant growth over our adjusted earnings per share in the Q2 of last year.
    Regarding our top line performance in the quarter we saw broad based growth across all our businesses and geographies. The more resilient elements of our business, such as diagnostic screening, reagents, and service, continued to build off the strength we have seen in the last few quarters and performed well in the period. In addition, the end markets that were hit hard last year are experiencing strong growth and benefiting from both the economic recovery and easier comps.
    In Human Health, our businesses continue to benefit from global health trends driving the need for earlier and more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic solutions in both the developed and the developing regions of the world. In our Diagnostic businesses, newborn screenings experienced modest growth in the US and European markets with much stronger growth outside the US and Europe although volumes are small relative to the base business.
    We believe our launch of the SCIDs pilot is an encouraging sign for adoption of the next set of mandated tests in the US market, and we continue to see significant opportunity in developing markets that are expanding their newborn screening policies. The growth prospects in prenatal continue to be very exciting, however growth this quarter was negatively impacted by the startup of a large program in Q2 of last year.
    Additionally the acquisition of SYM-BIO in September of last year added infectious disease screening to our portfolio and with the recent completion of our new manufacturing and R&D facility near Shanghai we now have a regional hub of scientific excellence. This expanded footprint provides a base to leverage our position within China as well as capture our share of the Chinese government’s commitment to broader access to diagnostic services in the region.
    Our Medical Imaging business is benefiting from the recovery in spending due to pent-up demand for diagnostic capital equipment in hospitals around the world. Additionally, we experienced strong growth from our efforts to expand panel usage beyond our well-established medical applications into industrial imaging needs to diversify our customer base and grow in these adjacencies. We’ve good visibility into demand patterns in this business and see strong growth for the balance of the year, as the film to digital conversion resumes for x-ray technologies.
    In the research market of our Human Health business major pharmaceutical consolidations and site closures are continuing to challenge capital purchases, which are negatively impacting our high through-put screening and automation products. Offsetting this is increasing reagent spend amongst this customer segment and solid growth in the academic sector, as we are seeing clinically relevant research migrating to academic institutions. In addition, as some of this work is moving to lower cost reasons we had some key wins in Southeast Asia, as researchers turn to our leading imaging and detection technologies such as Operetta® and ViewLux to further advance research in stem cells, yeast molecular biology, and preclinical evaluations of potential diagnostics and therapeutics.
    I’m also pleased to note that earlier this year we announced the acquisition of VisEn, an in vivo molecular cellular imaging technology company located in Bedford, Massachusetts. This acquisition broadens our imaging and reagent profiles through the addition of proprietary chemistries in the emerging and fast-growing space of translational biomarker reagents. VisEn deepens our commitment to the drug discovery process by moving downstream into preclinical research, thereby enabling safer and more effective drugs brought to market faster. It also increases our offerings to academic research in areas such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.
    In Environmental Health the rapid rate of industrialization and globalization continues to put pressures on the environment and food supply chain. This is resulting in an increased number of unregulated contaminants and a growing need for standards regulation and analytical testing. Consequently, our analytical sciences offerings are seeing good growth as global testing demands continue to increase in volume and level of specificity. Our application expertise and tailored solutions support these growing needs in both the developed and emerging regions of the world.
    As an example, we’re seeing strong market demand for our new products for safety-related applications within food such as our Flexar UHPLC and our single-quad and Time of Flight mass spec systems. In addition we have had several key wins in China and Southeast Asia for both environmental monitoring and food safety applications with large governmental customers. These customers are turning to us for necessary regulatory compliance knowledge as well as the technology and solutions required to meet their needs.
    Our sensor components also experienced strong, broad based demand with particular strength in safety and security, and in the industrial markets we are seeing a recovery as customers in this segment are rebuilding capacity after an extended period of limited capital investments. We experienced strong organic revenue growth in this end market, which include manufacturers of fine chemicals, polymers, and semiconductor components.
    Lastly in our service business, OneSource® continues to grow significantly by increasing the scope of its offering within its major pharmaceutical accounts. This customized solution provides customers with the ability to drive overall laboratory productivity and reduce costs into the lab’s utilization of assets and the corresponding workflow. Additionally, as a result of the integration of our lab services business with our analytical sciences business we are seeing increasing pull through opportunities for our instrumentation through this channel.
    As we look to the back half of the year we expect the level of organic revenue growth that we’ve experienced in the first half to continue into the second half. And unlike the first half, where the growth in Environmental Health was stronger than in Human Health, we expect our growth in the second half will be more balanced with both businesses growing high single digits.
    Based on this organic revenues outlook we’ve increased our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.49 to $1.54. And while the results and momentum for the first six months are clearly influencing our decision to increase our guidance, more importantly is the progress we have made against our strategic priorities of increasing the growth profile of the company through leveraging adjacent markets and geographic expansion as well as establishing a framework to drive higher profitability.
    As we look ahead we believe that our end markets possess attractive long-term growth profiles and we are very well positioned to continue to benefit from these trends. Now let me turn the call over to Andy, who will walk through our financial performance in more detail.

Before moving into the financial details I’d like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down I’m referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the Q2 2010 compared to the Q2 2009.
    As Rob mentioned earlier we are pleased with our financial performance in the Q2, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth over the prior year as well as strong cash flow in the period. Revenue for the Q2 increased 14% as compared to the same period last year. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was 2% and the favorable impact from acquisitions was 2%, therefore organic revenue increased by 14% versus the prior year.
    The remaining revenue analyses in my prepared remarks will be presented net of the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the favorable impact of acquisitions. By segment, organic revenue increased by 6% and 19% in the Human Health and Environmental Health segments respectively. By geography, organic revenue in the Americas was up mid-teens, Europe was up high single digits and Asia grew at a high teens rate. Within the Asian region, organic revenue in China grew over 20%.
 
  From an in market perspective PerkinElmer’s Human Health segment represented approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health we served two end markets: Diagnostics, which represented 24% of total revenue; and Research, which represented 16% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business grew at a mid single-digit rate in the Q2 with our Medical Imaging business delivering another strong quarter, due in part to the expansion of our panel offering into industrial applications.
    In the Q2 organic revenue in our Research business increased at a mid single-digit rate. We are encouraged by the strengths we are experiencing in academia, driven by a robust demand for our high-end Operetta® cellular imaging systems and our low-end EnSpireTM plate readers, as well as the corresponding pull through of our alpha reagent portfolio. As Rob mentioned, this strength was partially offset by continued pressure on capital spending, principally within pharma.
    The Environmental Health business represented 60% of our total revenue in the Q2. Within the Environmental Health business we served four end markets: Laboratory Services, Environmental, Safety and Security, and Industrial. Our Lab Services business represented approximately 21% of our total revenue in the Q2 and organic revenue grew in the mid-teens. OneSource, our comprehensive, multi-vendor offering, continued its momentum, delivering significant organic revenue growth in the quarter as the business continues to expand the scope of its service offerings.
    The Environmental market represented approximately 19% of total revenue in the quarter with organic revenue increasing in the high teens. Continued expansion of environmental testing regulations and pent-up demand due to weak capital spending amongst labs in the prior year were the primary contributors to this performance. Our inorganic portfolio continues to gain broad market acceptance, particularly in the area of toxic metal detection in the analysis of water. Additionally we saw strong growth in China driven by the impact of the continued SEPA regulatory enforcement measures, particularly related to contaminate analysis of the region’s main rivers and air pollutant analysis in its larger cities.
    The Safety and Security market represented approximately 12% of total revenues in the Q2 with organic revenues increasing in the high teens. As Rob mentioned, we experienced strong growth in the quarter from our new Flexar UHPLC as well as our single-quad and Time of Flight match spec systems for safety related applications within food, pharma, and neutraceuticals. Also within the quarter we saw a continued strong demand for our thermopile sensors despite a difficult year-over-year comparison driven by the response to the H1N1 virus in the prior year.
    Our Industrial markets represented approximately 9% of total revenues in the Q2 and organic revenues increased by over 20%. We were particularly pleased to see increased demand from many of our chemical and petrochemical customers, which we believe is a sign of renewed capacity expansion, a result of both the cyclical recovery and an extended period of delayed capital investment.
    Turning to our financial performance, adjusted operating margin was up 120 basis points in the Q2, due primarily to volume leverage and productivity, offset by unfavorable mix in the period. GAAP operating profit was $42.6 million in the quarter versus $38.2 million in the Q2 of 2009. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $65.8 million versus $52.5 million in the same period a year ago.
    For the Q2 we had a GAAP tax rate of 15.8% versus a previously communicated tax rate of 27%. The lower rate is primarily the result of the tax treatment associated with our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MDS Sciex, which was consummated earlier this year. On a non-GAAP basis our adjusted tax rate was 26.3%, which was approximately 70 basis points better than we anticipated and a result of the geographic mix of profits.
    GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the Q2 of 2010 was $0.46 compared to $0.20 in the Q2 of 2009. Adjusted EPS was $0.38 in the Q2, up 36% from the prior year; and our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 118,300,000 shares.
    Turning to the balance sheet we finished the Q2 with approximately $405 million of net debt which we define as short- and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in adjusted net debt of approximately $26 million as compared to year end. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $216 million of cash.
    Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continued operations was $69 million as compared to $40.2 million in the Q2 of 2009. As you may recall in the Q2 of 2009 we terminated our accounts receivable securitization facility and repaid the outstanding balance of $30 million. This resulted in an unfavorable impact to operating cash flow in the Q2 of last year. Working capital turns improved by approximately ½ turn on a year-over-year basis.
    In summary we’re pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, driving strong revenue and earnings growth as well as solid cash flow generation. Before I discuss the details of our financial guidance let me just highlight a few additional items in the quarter.
    First, our margin improvement initiatives continued to gain momentum, though we are clearly in the early innings of this multi-year project. Our efforts to date to streamline our logistics processes had a positive impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter, helping to offset a somewhat negative shift in product mix. We also undertook additional restructuring actions to further align our cost structure with our long-term profitability goals. These actions were targeted primarily at side consolidation and general costs rationalization.
    Second, we booked two gains in the quarter, one related to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the MDS Sciex joint venture, and the other related to an asset sale completed in the period. Lastly, I’m pleased to report that we completed the divestiture of our Flash business during the quarter.
    Now let me discuss our 2010 guidance and provide some further detail. As Rob mentioned earlier we continue to see positive trends in many of our served markets, and we now expect organic revenue growth to grow in the high single-digit range for the full year and expect the Q3 of 2010 to grow at high single digits as well.
    Regarding adjusted earnings per share, the restructuring actions taken in the Q2 will provide some benefit in the back half of the year but will be offset by additional costs to integrate recent acquisitions, such as VisEn. As a result we now estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2010 to be in the range of $1.49 to $1.54 versus our previous guidance of $1.43 to $1.48, which represents year-over-year growth in the range of 17% to 21%. Additionally, we estimate our adjusted earnings per share for the Q3 to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.35.
    Once again we’re pleased with our financial performance in the quarter as well as the progress we’ve made on our strategic initiatives. This concludes my prepared remarks. I’ll now turn the call back over to Dave.

    So I think that’s what we’re seeing in the Q2 and you know, early indications for the Q3 is that’s continuing. And that’s really given us the confidence to talk about high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year.

I think you see that in the gross margins, that because the Environmental area, which has a tendency to have lower gross margins, with that being up some 19% and the Human Health side not being up as strong that does provide a little bit of a negative mix. The offset to that on the operating side, though, is they have a tendency to carry a little bit lower operating expenses; and the other thing is, interesting enough is that mix actually helps us on the tax rate because what we find is those businesses have a tendency to be produced in the areas that drive a lower tax rate. So though we get a little bit of a negative mix on the operating side we actually make up a good portion of that on the tax rate.

And so I would say that’s an area that comes under fairly constant pricing pressure. Now in some of the other areas of our business, you know, we get some positive price. But I would say the areas where we continue to run up against pricing pressure is the analytical instrument space, we talked about in the past the Medical Imaging – obviously as the volume goes up there we contractually give pricing concessions there.
    So I don’t think price was a significant impact on the gross margins in this quarter because to balance that, it might have been slightly negative but not significantly. The biggest contributor to the flat gross margins on the higher volume was the mix. As I sort of mentioned previously, when you have Environmental going up 19% and Human Health only going up around 6%, the percentage swing is putting pressure on the gross margins.

    So it’s hard to tell when we come out of the pharma consolidation but like I said that was, we had a difficult quarter there and I think it’s going to be at least for the next couple quarters. But our strategy around that is to focus in on the reagent side, focus more on the academic side and then of course the service area, which continues to grow very strong. Because despite the consolidation I think they’re still looking to outsource a lot of that work because of some of the benefits they see in the productivity side.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the PerkinElmer third quarter 2010 earnings call.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the PerkinElmer third quarter 2010 earnings call. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter, delivering another strong quarter of both top and bottom line growth. Organic revenue grew 10%, adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points and adjusted net income increased 20%.
In addition to exceeding our financial commitments, I am especially pleased with our progress on two of our key strategic priorities; increasing the growth profile of the company and expanding operating margins.
Touching briefly on our end markets in Environmental Health, we experienced 14% organic growth with the growth being fairly broad-based as all of our market segments and geographic regions grew double digits.
In Human Health, organic revenue grew 5% as our diagnostic businesses grew in the high single-digits, lead by medical imaging, maternal and fetal health and infectious disease diagnostics in China. However, in the research markets, we were flat as growth in academic labs was offset by lower CapEx spending in pharma.
Given, Andy, will discuss our growth in the individual segments and specific financial results in more detail, I would like to focus my remarks on our recent progress in increasing the growth profile of the company and our success in expanding our operating margins.
Turning first to growth, as we have mentioned throughout the year, we are focused on four areas to improve our top line growth rate. These include emerging territories expansion, leveraging our capabilities into adjacent markets, new product innovation and business development.
In the third quarter, we made significant progress in all of these areas. In the emerging territories, we continued to experience strong growth as our revenue from China, India and Brazil grew over 20%, and we had several significant customer wins.
For example, last week, we received a major purchase commitment in western China to ensure pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with recently implemented Chinese quality assurance regulations. China’s State Food and Drug Administration is in the process of outfitting 130 labs with over 200 PerkinElmer instruments to make sure that drug companies meet the new quality assurance standards.
Through our relationship with the SFDA and their recognition of our commitment to quality and service, we are able to help ensure safer drugs through our Western China. This win represents a strong validation of our ability to combine our analytical technologies and application-based expertise into a turnkey solution for our customers.
This quarter we also made progress in expanding into adjacent markets. For example, our medical imaging business continued to expand into new applications, adding 16 new OEMs since the beginning of the year and our OneSource service offering continues to expand outside of the farm industry, diversifying our customer base and expanding our addressable market.
During the third quarter, we continued to invest in innovative new products and I thought I would highlight a few products recently introduced. Our new NexION ICP-MS is targeted at environmental analysis needs and has an innovative orthogonal geometry, and also allows samples to be analyzed directly or following programs collisions with either neutral or reactive gases.
We also expanded our ATPLite, our homogeneous assay system to include epigenetic markers, which is one of the newest trends in biomedical research and drug development and is valuable in an understanding gene regulation.
We are seeing strong demand in the academic markets for our new EnSpire multimode reader, and through our previously announced collaboration with Corning, we will provide our customers the unique dimension of label-free technology on our platform.
Finally in the business development area, we completed our acquisition of VisEn Medical in the third quarter. VisEn is a pioneer in fluorescence-based molecular imaging.
By combining VisEn in vivo imaging expertise and PerkinElmer’s strengthen in cellular imaging, we can bring innovative solutions to monitoring cancer drug efficacy and penetrate further down the drug discovery process.
Regarding operating margins, every quarter this year we have expanded adjusted operating margins at least 75 basis points over the comparable prior year period.
While the volume leverage is contributing, we are benefiting from good traction in our operating margin expansion initiative that is focused on increasing productivity and simplification as well as improving our product mix to higher value offerings. As a result, we continue to be encouraged with our ability to achieve our goal of 17.5% adjusted operating margins by 2014.
During the third quarter, we also announced the definitive agreement to sale our Illumination and Detection Solutions business which we anticipate will close by year end.
By selling IDS reduce the Complexity of the company and free up capital to increase our capabilities in our remaining businesses. In addition, we believe the sale will reduce the cyclicality of the company, improve our growth profile, as well as increase the percentage of our revenue coming from service and consumables to 60%.
As we look at the end of the year, we expect our organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter to continue at a high-single digit rate, despite cycling up against a more difficult prior year comparison.
Based on this outlook and coupled with the progress we have made on our long-term productivity initiatives, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted EPS from $1.24 to $1.29 to $1.29 to $1.31, representing greater than 20% growth over the prior year.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance and our progress against our strategic initiatives through target investments, portfolio repositioning and a tremendous amount of excellent work by the organization. We continue to deliver strong financial results and solidify PerkinElmer’s position as a leader in human and environmental health.
I will now turn the call over to Andy to talk you through our end market and financial performance in more detail.

I’ll now provide some additional details on our third quarter results, and after my prepared remarks we’ll open it up for questions.
Before moving into the financial details, I’d like to clarify that whenever I talk about a particular measure being up or down, I’m referring to an increase or decrease in that measure during the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Additionally, as a reminder, our results from continuing operations exclude the financial results of our Illumination and Detection Solutions business, as that business is now classified as a discontinued operation. Remaining commentary of my prepared remarks will be presented for our continuing operations unless otherwise specified.
As Rob mentioned, we had another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth over the prior year period. Revenue for the third quarter increased 11% as compared to the same period last year. The 11% was comprised of 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a 2% favorable impact from acquisitions, resulting in organic revenue growth of 10% versus the prior year. The remaining revenue analysis in my prepared remarks will be presented net of the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the favorable impact of acquisitions.
By segment, organic revenue increased by 5% and 14% in the Human Health and Environmental Health segments respectively. By product category, our recurring revenue which includes our reagents, consumables and services represented at approximately 60% of total revenue in the quarter and organic revenue grew at a high single-digit rate.
Estimates and components represented approximately 40% of total revenue in third quarter and organic revenue grew in the mid-teens. By geography, organic revenue in both the Americas and Asia were up low double-digit and Europe grew at a high single-digit rate.
From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer’s Human Health segment represented approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve two end markets; diagnostics, which represented 28% of total revenue and research, which represented 18% of total revenue.
Organic revenue from our diagnostics business grew at a high single-digit rate in the third quarter, with the strong contribution from our medical imaging business. This business continues to benefit from the accommodation of pent-up demand for capital equipment in major hospitals, deeper penetration into nonmedical applications and an easy comparison from the prior year.
During the quarter, we’re pleased to announce our joint development program with LinaTech, a leading cancer and radio therapeutic device manufacturer. This collaboration will include the development of digital imaging subsystems for OEM sales as well as products allowing clinicians to upgrade their legacy film-based systems.
Within our screening business, we continue to see strong growth from our maternal and disease screening offerings. However, as Rob mentioned, offsetting this growth was the unfavorable impact from lower U.S. birth rates and state and national cost pressures impacting our neonatal screening business.
In our research business, we experienced solid growth in the academic sector in the third quarter. Our academic customers continue to prioritize their capital allocation to critical technologies that will help them maximize their research productivity. As a result, we continue to see demand for our high end Opera cellular imaging systems and our EnSpire plate readers that are targeted specifically for this market.
Additionally, our investment in emerging territories has gained traction through close connectivity with government-backed research institutes and academic labs. In Brazil, a rapidly evolving base for pharmaceutical research, we’ve won a number of large contracts with government funded labs for automated sample-handling and drug discovery research.
These early wins are providing a foundation for future growth in these attractive markets and geographies. However, for the quarter, pharma capital spending remain weak, and a result, organic revenue for our research business in total was essentially flat in the period.
The Environmental Health business represented 54% of our total revenue in the third quarter. As the IDS business is now reported as a discontinued operation, we have decided to reduce the number of reported market segments within Environmental Health from four to three by combining the environmental market with the safety and security market.
We have enacted this change to better reflect our addressable markets based on two fundamental reasons; first, we no long have exposure to the security market as a result of the IDS divestiture, and second, the environmental and safety markets have much greater connectivity in the analytical instrument business within the addressed applications, and in certain cases, the customers themselves.
As a result, we will now report three end markets, environmental and safety, laboratory services and industrial. Our lab services business represented approximately 20% of our total revenue in the third quarter and organic revenue grew in the mid-teens.
OneSource continued its strong top line performance with another quarter of robust organic revenue growth as the business further leverages its ability to tailor its unique offering to the challenging asset management needs of major laboratories around the world.
The environmental and safety market represented approximately 18% of total revenue in the third quarter with organic revenue increasing at a low double digit rate as we experienced strong growth across all analytical technologies.
The continued global need for robust contaminate identification solutions particularly for trace metals analysis and water drove demand for our leading inorganic analysis solution such as our Optima 7000 and our recently launched NexION ICP-MS.
In addition, we saw continued demand for the identification and monitoring of volatile organic compounds, particularly related to air quality. During the quarter, we won a major order from a large southern state, as we continue to expand their capabilities to comply with the strict standards of the Clean Air Act.
Our Ozone Precursor Analyzers, which combined our Clarus Gas Chromatography System with our leading TurboMatrix Thermal Desorber, were chosen for their unique ability to capture low concentrations of organic compounds in the atmosphere to monitor air quality in urban and industrial areas.
Furthermore, we continue to experience robust demand for quality and safety assurance testing in food and pharmaceuticals throughout the global supply chain.
As with our Human Health business, our investments in emerging regions continue to gain traction in Environmental Health as well, particularly around the build-out of improved testing and monitoring programs in remote areas of the world, an example of which was the recent SFDA win in China, Rob highlighted earlier in the call.
Our industrial markets represented approximately 8% of total revenue in the third quarter and organic revenues increased at a high-teens rate. The industrial market continues to benefit from the cyclical recovery, with strong demand from our chemical, petrochemical and semiconductor customers requiring analytical testing perpetuity at the nanometric level.
Turning to our financial performance, adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points in the third quarter due primarily to volume leverage and productivity gains. GAAP operating profit was $44.1 million in the third quarter of 2010 versus $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $57.5 million, 21% higher than the same period a year ago.
For the third quarter, we had a GAAP tax rate of 23.6% and on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 26.8%, consistent with our full-year guidance. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2010 was $0.22 as compared to $0.11 in the third quarter of 2009.
Adjusted EPS was $0.31 in the third quarter of 2010, up 15% from the prior year and our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 118.2 million shares.
Regarding discontinued operations as Rob mentioned, the divestiture of IDS remains on track to close prior to year end. This business continues to perform very well benefiting from the rebound in their served markets. As a result, IDS operating results exceeded our expectations in the quarter.
However, upon discontinuing the IDS business, certain adjustments were required in the U.S. GAAP that resulted in a net after tax loss in the period. This loss was predominantly the result of tax expense recorded in the period required under U.S. GAAP as the accumulated unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries no longer qualify for deferral as permanently reinvested.
This tax expense is essentially the differential between the U.S. corporate tax rate and the tax provision of certain foreign subsidiaries applied to all unremitted earnings since inception.
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with approximately $419 million of net debt, which we define as short and long-term debt minus cash. This reflects an increase in net debt of approximately $16 million as compared to the second quarter of 2010. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $251 million of cash.
Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $6.9 million as compared to $22.2 million in the third quarter of 2009.
During the third quarter of 2010, our operating cash flow was impacted by a $30 million contribution to our U.S-based defined benefit pension plan. This voluntary contribution provided a dual benefit of improving the funded status of the defined benefit plan as well as allowing us to realize a beneficial tax provision included in the Worker, Homeownership & Business Assistance Act of 2009. Working capital returns improved slightly year-over-year.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we drove strong revenue and earnings growth as well as solid cash flow generation.
Now, let me discuss our 2010 guidance to provide some further detail. As Rob mentioned earlier, we’re continuing to see positive trends in many of our served markets and we expect organic revenue to grow in the high single-digit range for the fourth quarter, resulting in full year 2010 growth in the high single-digits as well.
Regarding adjusted earnings per share, we continue to gain traction on our multi-year operating margin improvement initiatives and expect to finish the full year on the higher end of our 2010 margin expansion goals.
As a result, excluding IDS, we now estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2010 to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.31 versus our previous guidance of our $1.24 to $1.29, which represents year-over-year growth of adjusted earnings per share in the 22% to 24% range. This full year guidance assumes adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.42.
Before I turn the call back over to Dave, I want to highlight that as convenience to our analysts and our investors, we have placed on our Web site under the Investor Section, our historical results excluding the IDS business, including GAAP results as well as a reconciliation to adjusted results.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Dave.

Clearly from a geographic perspective, continuing to build out capabilities in China and India because I think there is going to higher growth there.
And then the third area, strategically, as you know a lot of our products historically have been around high-throughput screening and we need to move those into sort of downstream into the preclinical area, because there is not lot of investment going into drug discovery around high-throughput screening. So you’ve seen that in the way of cellular imaging with the Opera and Operetta and some of the moves with our reagents going into cellular analysis and of course now with VisEn. So again, what you’ll see is a move into the preclinical area, into academics and into the developing areas.

We had another $5 million approved by the board in the quarter and our philosophy right now is we do have an opportunity to buy back shares, but we also have what I think our preference would be and that’s an opportunity to add via acquisition to our earnings. So I think that’s our first priority, I think we are looking at possibly taking some load out, but I think overall I think acquisitions are going to be number one.

Rob, you talked about building out India and China and I’ve heard other company say this, but how do you actually do this organically?
Second question is can you comment about the plan in diagnostics given that segment is so western focused? You’ve made some illusions about growth in emerging markets, but I would argue that or I would submit that that might take a vast number of years before it can really gain traction or am I wrong? Thanks a lot.

So, our intentions would be to do it both inorganically and organically, and as you recall, we bought some biosciences last year that added a significant amount of capability to us not only in people but in contacts and facilities in China, and we’ve acquired a small lab in India.
So, I would say, first of all and clearly, we would like to see some portion of the acquisitions done in the future in the emerging areas, and how you do it organically is just to continue to hire people and to build out the capability from a local perspective. As you know, we had Dan Marshak, our Chief Scientific Officer over in Shanghai for two years and he was instrumental in continuing to build out our infrastructure there in China. So, I think for us it’s a combination of both organic and inorganic.
With regard to your second question, I think you’re seeing very significant growth in the diagnostic markets today, and I think you’ll continue to see it, and I am sure you’ve seen the statistics as well; they spend right now about $1 per person in China on diagnostic test, and in developed areas, it’s a significant multiple of that.
So, I think you are going to see and you are seeing a significant ramp up in, whether it’s infectious disease testing or oncology in China. I mean to give you a perspective there is more people in China that smoke cigarettes than our total population in United States. So I think there is going to be a significant growth in China in diagnostic testing, and so we are investing there to capture our fair share of that growth.
