Summarizing our overall company performance for",1652,"Thank you, Jackie. In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations 2009 Year-End Press Release. Summarizing our overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter decreased 5.9% to $1.6 billion, due primarily to lower paint volume demand resulting from continued weak economic condition in the U.S. and abroad. For the full year, sales declined 11.1% to $7.09 billion. Sales from acquisition had no material effect on sales for the quarter or the year. Currency translation rate changes increased consolidated net sales 2% in the quarter and decreased consolidated net sales 1.3% in the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 47.4% of sales from 46.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, gross margin increased to 46% of sales from 43.8% in 2008. Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars decreased $14.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but increased as a percent of sales to 38.7% from 37.3% in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2009, SG&A expense decreased $108.8 million, but increased as a percent of sales to 35.7% from 33.1% in 2008. Tight expense management across all operating divisions could not fully offset the effect of the decline in sales on SG&A percentages for the quarter and the year.In the fourth quarter of 2009, asset impairment charges and a loss on dissolution of a foreign subsidiary reduced diluted net income per common share approximately $0.13 per share. Interest expense for the quarter decreased by $5.7 million to $9 million, due primarily to a reduction in short-term interest rate. Interest and net investment income was down approximately $1 million in the quarter at $580,000. For the year, interest expense decreased $25.7 million due to lower short-term borrowing rates and lower average borrowings.Interest in net investment income decreased $1.5 million in the year due to lower overall rates and lower average investment compared to 2008. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2009 decreased to 19.5% from 36.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to the tax effect of the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary. For the year, our effective tax rate was 30% compared to 33.2% in 2008.Consolidated net income for the quarter increased by $15.1 million, or 30.1% to $65.3 million from $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, net income decreased $41.1 million, or 8.6%. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 4.1% in the fourth quarter this year from 3% in the fourth quarter last year. This increase was due primarily to year-over-year reduction in our fourth quarter effective tax rate and higher gross margin.  For the year, net income as a percent of sales improved to 6.1% in 2009 from 6% in 2008 largely for the same reason. Diluted net income per common share for fourth quarter 2009 was $0.58 per share, including the $0.13 per share impairment charge compared to $0.42 per share in fourth quarter 2008, which included an $0.18 per share impairment charge. For the year, diluted net income per common share decreased 5.5% to $3.78 from $4 per share in 2008. Now I'd like to review our performance by segment.Sales for our Paint Stores Group in fourth quarter 2009 decreased 11.4% to $920.2 million. For the year, net sales decreased 12.9% to $4.21 billion. For the quarter and year, decreased paint volume sales reflected weakness across most customer segments.Comparable store sales also decreased 11.4% in the quarter and 12.9% in the year. Regionally in the fourth quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by Eastern division, Midwestern division and Southeastern division. Sales by all four Paint Stores division declined in the fourth quarter and full year.Segment operating profit for the Paint Stores Group increased 5.9% to $119.9 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to reduced SG&A expense and lower impairment charges that more than offset the decline in sales. For full year, Paint Stores Group operating profit decreased 7.4% to $600.2 million, due primarily to the effect of lower paint sales volume.Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter increased to 13% of sales from 10.9% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2009 increased to 14.3% from 13.4% in 2008. The increase in profit margin for the quarter and the year was due primarily to higher gross margin and lower SG&A and impairment charges.Turning now to the Consumer Group, fourth quarter external net sales decreased 2.2% to $240.1 million from $245.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, Consumer Group sales were down 3.7% to $1.23 billion from $1.27 billion in 2008. The sales declines were due primarily to weak end market demand most to the group's retail customers. Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased $7.7 million, primarily due to the effect of lower sales and manufacturing volume partially offset by a reduction in impairment charges in the quarter. Segment operating profit for the year increased 12.2% to $157.4 million, due primarily to good expense control, reduced asset impairment charges and favorable freight and other distribution costs that were partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption from reduced manufacturing and distribution volume. As a percent of net sales, Consumer Group's operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased to 1.9% from 5% last year. For the year, operating margin improved to 12.8% from 11% in 2008.For our Global Finishes Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.5% to $437.1 million, primarily as a result of favorable currency translation. Sales for the year decreased 11.4% to $1.65 billion, due primarily to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by acquisitions and selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes before acquisitions increased sales in U.S. dollars by 7.8% in the quarter and reduced sales in U.S. dollars by 4.8% in the year. Acquisition increased the group's sales in U.S. dollars by 7/10 of a percent in the quarter and 1.5% in the year.Global Finishes Group segment operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased $16.9 million to a loss of $1.1 million, due primarily to $25 million of asset impairment charges and a loss on dissolution of a foreign subsidiary. Segment operating profit for the full year decreased $87.2 million or 57.3% to $65 million, primarily as a result of reduced sales volume, impairment charges and the loss on dissolution of a foreign subsidiary that were partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.A fourth quarter pretax loss of $21.9 million resulted from the dissolution of a European subsidiary. This loss combined with asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter totaled $25 million for the quarter and the year. This compares with no impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $800,000 for the full year 2008.Currency translation and acquisitions increased segment profit $3.9 million in the quarter and reduced segment profit $5.9 million for the year. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit decreased to 3.9% for the year from 8.2% in '08.I'd now like to comment briefly on our balance sheet items. You'll find more balance sheet information on our website under sherwin.com, Investor Relations press releases. Our total debt on December 31, 2009, was $817.6 million including short-term borrowings of $22.7 million. The increase in long-term debt resulted from the issuance of $500 million in five-year bonds at 3.125%, the second lowest rate paid on five-year notes this year and the 14th lowest in history for an A-rated company. In January, we entered into a new three-year $500 million credit agreement to be used for general corporate purposes, including to finance working capital requirements and to support commercial paper borrowings. This agreement includes a provision to increase the size of the facility subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in such increase up to an aggregate amount of $750 million. The new credit agreement replaces Sherwin-Williams' $845 million five-year revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire on July 20, 2010. Our cash balance at year-end 2009 was $69.3 million compared to $26.2 million in 2008. Capital expenditures were $27.8 million in the fourth quarter and $91.3 million for the year compared to $117.2 million for the year in 2008.Depreciation expense was $35.6 million in the quarter and $145.2 million for the year, and amortization expense was $6.9 million in the quarter and $25.7 million for the year. In 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $100 million to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization would be about $26 million.I'll conclude this review with two brief comments on the status of our Lead Litigation. In California, the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingent fee counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufacturers of Lead Pigment. Briefing has been completed, oral arguments should not take place until at least the first quarter of 2010 and most likely not until the second quarter, with the decision most likely coming in late 2010.The Gaines case, a single plaintiff personal injury suit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and the company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. Briefing has not yet begun and a decision is not expected until late 2010 or early 2011. That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2009. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2010. Chris?"

Thanks for joining us today. It's hard to be satisfied with the past year when many of the metrics we use to measure our performance went backwards. The culture of our company is one of growth and continues improve",965,"Thanks, Bob and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. It's hard to be satisfied with the past year when many of the metrics we use to measure our performance went backwards. The culture of our company is one of growth and continues improvement and that doesn't change simply because the economy is faltering.If there is a silver lining to this dark cloud is that result show steady improvement over the course of 2009 and we ended on a relatively positive note in the fourth quarter. Our earnings per share, for example, in the first half of this year trailed first half of 2008 at $0.42 per share. Second half earnings, on the other hand, this year was $0.17 ahead of last year. I think this positive trend is a function of two noteworthy factors. First, the hard work of our people have done all year to manage expenses, improve margins, reduce working capital and minimize our effective tax rate. These efforts have made us a more efficient and profitable company. And second, the moderation in the rate of year-over-year sales declines we experienced in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter. Although, we don't believe our fourth quarter sales result signal a sustainable pick up in end market demand. They do suggest that some of the market segments are approaching bottom.Throughout the year, we made steady progress in streamlining our supply chain and managing gross margin and SG&A expense. These efforts combined with lower interest expense, lower effective tax rate, resulted in a 110 basis point improvement in fourth quarter net income as a percent of sales and a 10 basis point improvement in full year net income as a percent of sales. Our cash flow also increased as a percent of sales. For the year, we generated $859.2 million in net operating cash, slightly more than 12% of sales. This marks the fourth straight year of cash flow in excess of 10% of net sales. This strong cash flow performance was due in large part to a decrease in year-end working capital. Our working capital ratio improved to 10.7% of sales at year end from 11.2% at the end of 2008. This has two important ramifications. First, the decrease in working capital requirements increased net operating cash by $136 million. And secondly, Sean will have to stop insisting that 11% working capital ratio is optimal. Free cash flow for the year, which is operating cash minus capital expenditures and dividends increased more than $9 million to an all-time record high of $603 million as we appropriately paired back our capital expenditures.In the fourth quarter, we acquired 4.12 million shares of the company stock for Treasury, bringing our full year total to 9 million shares for an investment of $530 million. At year end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 10.75 million shares. Over the past year, we've returned nearly $165 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2009 marked our 31st consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue.This year at our February meeting at the Board of Directors, I'll recommend approval of a dividend payout rate for 2010 that will keep our record of consecutive annual dividend increases intact. I base this recommendation on our strong net operating cash performance and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. In 2009, we continue to invest in our controlled distribution platform opening 53 stores to new markets because we believe new stores drive market penetration and share growth even in a down market. At the same time, we consolidated an additional 45 redundant locations for a net increase of eight new stores for the year. Our Paint Store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean now stands at 3,354 locations compared to 3,346 a year ago. Our plan for 2010 calls for net new store openings in the range of 20 to 30 locations.Our Global Group continued to appropriately manage our automotive and OEM product finishes branches, opening 18 new locations and closing 20 for a net reduction of two. We ended the year with 539 branches in operation compared to 541 one year ago. Across all of our divisions in 2009, we've recruited 550 high-caliber people into our respected management training program and we invested more than $100 million in research, development and commercialization of new product technologies. We are confident these investments will benefit the company in the near term and deliver appropriate returns in the long term.Looking ahead to 2010, the steep decline in coatings demand appears to be moderating in some market segments in the U.S. and abroad and we are guardedly optimistic that will continue. However, there are still some end markets, most notably the commercial segments that are likely to continue to deteriorate in the better part of the coming year. Our exposure to these late cycle markets combined with the normal seasonal weakness in first quarter should result in our first quarter consolidated net sales being flat to down slightly compared to the first quarter of 2009. With sales of that level, we have estimated diluted net income per common share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.40 per share compared to $0.32 per share earned in the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect net sales will increase in the low- to mid-single digits versus 2009. With annual sales of that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2010 will be in the range of $4.05 to $4.45 per share compared to the $3.78 per share earned in 2009. Again, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and now the team will be happy to take your questions."

Assuming the energy costs remained constant at current levels, we would expect that petrochemical based raw material to stabilize at or slightly above the current level. We are also seeing upward pressure on titanium dioxide largely driven by some capacity rationalization in the industry and we believe that some of the titanium dioxide price increases taken in the industry have been successfully implemented in the market. Overall, I think that it's difficult to forecast going forward because of volatility in energy prices and petrochemical products.

But we think what makes sense to us would be total residential starts and completions to be up in the mid-teen for full year 2010 and probably with growing momentum over the course of the year. So a lot of that that volume would be second half loaded. In the non-residential arena, the square footage decline that we experienced in 2009 for the industry within the mid-40% range. So we think that the rate of decline should moderate somewhat during 2010, but we think it's still likely to finish the year down mid- to high-teens in square footage. And we are late cycle on those projects, so we're probably still going to face pretty stiff headwinds in the non-residential arena. We think that existing home turnover perhaps will run perhaps not quite as strong as it did at the end of 2009 but we would expect it on a full year basis to be up over 2009 in terms of total transactions. We also would love to see the percentage of total transactions being foreclosure and distress sale related decline although that it's been pretty stubbornly in that 30% range, 30-plus percent range. So as we've indicated in the past, those kinds of transaction don't benefit us as immediately as an owner occupant selling to a new owner occupant. So we're rooting for the tax credit for both the first time-buyer and the step-up buyers to push volume early in the year."

Let me just share with you the way we think about that. Clearly this year, as reports have come out, we have seen the CapEx numbers for many of these commercial-type applications cut back just as we have at our company. It does have an impact on maintenance. If companies have done a nice job with cash across the United States, so to the expect that they would feel a little better about getting back on some of the CapEx spending for next year, that's a possibility. We're more focused, however, on the fact that these assets do need to be maintained over time. And failure to coat corrosive environment to protect steel and concrete, eventually ends up being a much bigger ticket than repairing with paint. And so we are aware that many of these projects and customers have extended already what a normal repaint cycle will be. This is very consistent to the 2001, 2002 time period, where this business segment went through a similar process. There maybe a little more of a tail to it yet, Ivy, but at some point in time, we think this'll come back. And I think it's back to Eric's point about the second half guidance is a little stronger than the first half, that should start to play a role then."

I think that the investors that are buying those homes are certainly not doing so with the anticipation of being landlords long term. When the markets recover, when we start seeing home values move back up, I believe they're going to -- a large percentage of them are going to flip those properties for profit. And at that point in time, when they're really investing in premium upgrades for the properties, we should see a benefit. In the meantime, in many of these markets, they are parking these homes on the rental market and putting minimal cash investment in them. And a lot of the pros that are working on these properties are not only doing paint work and maintenance work but they're replacing floor covering and doing minimal electrical and plumbing upgrades or bringing them up to the code in those regards, and maybe a little landscaping. And these are primarily remodelers and handymen that are buying their supplies at one-stop outlet. And we think that some of this relative strength we've seen behind the home centers has been a reflection of that type of investment in these foreclosed properties."

Our store count expectations, John, for next year, would be a net increase of around 20 to 30 in that Canada, U.S., Caribbean group that the stores is responsible for that geography. That'll be made up of fewer store closings than we've experienced the last couple of years. We're nearing the end of this redundant process we've been on to try to get out some of the recent acquisitions that are in a very, very close proximity to existing Sherwin stores. So we're slowing down just the gross new store openings, far fewer closings and that'll bring us in at that 20, 30 net. Our sense is that they're somewhere in the neighborhood of around 50,000-plus locations that sell paint in the United States. And that the independent company-owned paint store channel were somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 locations prior to the downturn that we've gone through the last year and a half. Don't have good numbers on that, at this point in time, to share with you, but I think your expectations are probably accurate. We've seen quite a number of them, primarily the smaller, what we would call the mom and pops, struggle to make it through. We've always said that 4,000 stores is our next kind of mile market. We think the geography clearly supports that. And that won't be a net addition, but rather a number of these other facilities will have to go out to keep that kind of 10,000 to 12,000 location constant.

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release.
Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2010 versus first quarter 2009, consolidated net sales increased 1% to $1.565 billion due primarily to favorable foreign currency translation rate changes partially offset by a decline in domestic paint sales volume. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $11.4 million for the quarter to $692 million. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 43.9% in the first quarter last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were essentially flat compared to first quarter 2009 at $612.9 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 39.1% in the first quarter this year from 39.3% last year.
Interest expense decreased $600,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $8.6 million or 16.8% to $59.5 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 45.2% compared to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter rate this year reflects the one-time increase in income tax expense of $11.4 million related to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in March of this year, which raised our effective rate by 19.2% for the quarter. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 35%, including the effect of the health care legislation. Last year's rates was 30%.
Consolidated net income decreased $4.7 million to $32.6 million from $37.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to the health care tax effect. Net income as a percent of sales was 2.1% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased to $0.30 per share from $0.32 per share in 2009. The tax impact of the health care legislation reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.10 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2010 decreased 5.3% to $850.9 million. Comparable store sales or sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months declined 5.4%. The decrease in sales for this segment was due primarily to a decline in paint sales volume and non-paint sales volume. 
Regionally in the first quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern division. Segment profit for the group decreased 15.6% to $47.8 million in the first quarter 2010, due primarily to lower volume. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.6% from 6.3% in the first quarter last year due primarily to lower volume and raw material cost increases that were partially offset by reductions in SG&A.
Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter increased 1.4% to $292.1 million. The increase was due primarily to new product introductions, partially offset by soft DIY demand at some retail customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 24% in the quarter to $37.5 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 12.8% from 10.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued stringent expense control and cost reductions related to facility closings completed during the past year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases and reduced fixed cost absorption from lower manufacturing and distribution volumes.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 16.2% to $421.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, favorable currency translation rate changes increased net sales for the group by 10.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 333% to $23 million due to higher sales volume and good expense control. Foreign currency rate changes reduced segment profit by $1.1 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 5.5% from 1.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and tight expense control that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency rate changes.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2010 was $1,041,000,000. Including total short-term borrowings of $245 million. Total debt on March 31, 2009 was $1.08 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $91.2 million compared to $42.2 million at the end of first quarter '09. Total borrowings to capitalization were 41% at the end of the quarter versus 40.5% at the end of first quarter 2009.
Long-term debt to capitalization was 34.7% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 16.5% last year due to the issuance of $500 million in 3.8% [ph] (13:29) senior notes in December 2009 used to retire short-term debt. In the first quarter 2010, the company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock in the open market. At March 31, 2010, the company had remaining authorizations to purchase 10.35 million shares of its common stock.
Also, in the first quarter 2010, we spent $25.4 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $33.1 million and amortization expense was $6.7 million. For the full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 million to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization will be approximately $26 million.
I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In California, the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufacturers of lead pigment. Briefing in this case is completed, all arguments is now scheduled for May 5, 2010, with a decision most likely coming in the summer of 2010. In the Gaines' case, a single-plaintiff personal injury suit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. Briefing has now begun with our opening brief due by May 27. Further briefing of the parties will continue into the fall. No hearing date has been set yet in that case. A decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011.
That concludes our review of the results for first quarter of 2010. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?"
303104,99773687,57281,"Sherwin-Williams Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year, and our profit was tracking well as sort of",1226,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year, and our profit was tracking well as sort of planned. Judging by our first quarter guidance, we expected a slow start of the year. In January and February, we're tracking in line with that guidance.
Then in March, the storm clouds parted both literally and figuratively and the pace of business begin to improve. Whether as a result of pent-up demand from January and February, a seasonably warm March weather or more fundamental improvement in end-market demand in some segments, our sales in March closed the GAAP from the previous two months, and we finished the quarter essentially on budget and on plan. The sales momentum we saw in March was absolutely encouraging, and the fact that it appears to be carrying over into April is even more encouraging.
Not surprisingly, there was considerable disparity in the strength of the March rebound across market segments, distribution channels and geographies. In North America, for example, the most favorable trends were in the Residential and Commercial repaint markets. Although we did see some improvement in new Residential business for the first time in many years, DIY sales to our own stores and most of our external partners turned positive in March after very soft months in January and February. The rebound in our Global Finishes Group business was more broad-based with sales growth across most product lines and in most geographic markets.
But there's a downside of the strengthening industry demand if that will likely keep pressure on the raw material's supply chain. Cost pressure caused by the current tight supply of propylene, azulene, acrylic acid, titanium dioxide and other raw materials is not likely to abate until the second half of the year. If you take a look at the year-over-year raw material cost comparison by quarter, input costs troughed in the second quarter of last year 2009, then rose steadily through the second half. We believe they're likely to peak in the second quarter of this year then ease somewhat in the second half. If this outlook is correct, our most difficult comparisons are likely to be in the second quarter. 
In our year-end 2009 conference call, we predicted that the coatings industry would experience annualized year-over-year raw materials price inflation in the low- to mid-single digits in 2010. Given the recent pricing actions by most of the major raw material suppliers, we now believe a mid- to high-single percent increase is a more realistic expectation. Despite this change, we think we're in good position to continue to improve the profitability of the company. Based on our initial raw material outlook, we took only limited pricing action in January and February on some of our industrial product lines.
In March, we revised our outlook for raw materials and at the same time, announced corporate price increases across most of our architectural lines effective April 1 to help mitigate the amount in cost pressures. Assuming normal implementation of these price increases, combined with our efforts over the past year to reduce manufacturing and distribution costs, and increase our productivity, the impact of raw material inflation over the course of the year should be controlled.
In the first quarter, we continue to invest in our Controlled Distribution Platform. Our Paint Stores Group added several new stores, bringing our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,257 locations compared to 3,339 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for Paint Stores Group to add approximately 40 to 50 new store locations during the year and significantly reduce the rate of redundant store closings.
We made further progress in our management of working capital, reducing our working capital ratio to 12.4% of sales from 12.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally, during the quarter, we used the company's cash to buy back 400,000 shares of our stock, and we increased the dividend rate to $0.36 per share from $.0355 per share last year. Our balance sheet remains fiscally sound and capable of financing our plan business operations and growth well into the foreseeable future.
Effective April 1, we completed the acquisition of 
Sayerlack Industrial Wood Coatings from Arch Chemicals. Headquartered in Pianoro, Italy, Sayerlack is one of the largest manufacturers of industrial wood coatings in Europe, and a technology leader in polyurethane, water and UV coatings for the joinery, furniture and cabinets industry. The company operates several manufacturing sites across Western Europe, along with a comprehensive network of sales, technical and distributor representatives serving clients in Asia and the United States. Net sales for Sayerlack in 2009 were $147 million. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that our consolidated net sales will increase, in percentage terms, in the high single digits compared to last year's second quarter. From the sales of that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share compared to $1.35 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
For the full year 2010, we are increasing our sales guidance range to mid- to high-single digit percentage growth over 2009 compared to our previous range of low- to mid-single digits. With the annual sales of this new level, we've raised our expectations per diluted net income per common share for 2010 to be a range of $4.20 to $4.60 per share including the unfavorable tax impact of healthcare legislation compared to $3.78 per share earned in 2009.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of a valued member of our management team who's participating in his last earnings call today. John Ault, our Vice President and Corporate Controller is retiring after an outstanding 34-year career with the company. John, you really doesn't say much on these calls, but for many years, you've had a strong voice within the company and with our Board of Directors. He plays a supporting role in our external communications but internally, he has always taken the lead to ensure the timeliness and integrity of our financial statements. Oversee the company's compliance and its ever-changing regulatory environment and safeguard our reputation with the financial community. John is humble, good-natured and unassuming. He's also smart, meticulous and unflappable, which in this day and age may seem a pretty good guy for a CEO and CFO to have around. For the past eight months, John has been grooming one of our up and coming financial executives, Al Masticion [ph] (23:38), to assume the responsibilities of Corporate Controller. As anyone who knows John would expect, he's done a commendable job and now is well-prepared for the transition. He has big shoes to fill. I want to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf our company and our shareholders for his many contributions over the past 34 years. John may be leaving us but the influence he's had on this company will benefit our shareholders for years to come. Thanks, John. 
And again at this time, we'd like to thank all of you for joining us. And we're happy to take your questions."

As an over the remainder of the 12 to 18 months to roll this out, we'd probably get up to about 75% implementation. We don't give guidance per line on the P&L through the course of the year. So there's not a gross margin guidance number that we're giving at this point in time. I think it's baked into the overall earnings guidance that we're providing."

So the answer is during this time, we did not put one of those in place. So therefore, no, we haven't got any stock between months end and now. I would tell you that our stock repurchase, when you look at this price, we still think that when you take a look at it, the stock repurchase over the last 10 years and prior to that has all been accretive.

As you know, the year ended at 550 and a few. Normalized year would be 1% to 2% gallon increase. So if we were under the 3% to 4% or even a 5% gallon increase, that would be a nice rebound. That would take us about halfway from 550 to 600. So that number seems a little bit of a stretch to get there. And don't forget that when we're having a normalized year, 1% to 2%, that's with the Commercial and New Construction market behaving normally which it's not. So have some headwind on that, I think the rebound on the repaint cycles will lift it higher than the normal run rate, and 600 seems a little bit of a far out reach at this point."

In order to allow more time for questions, we have provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under investor relations, first quarter press release.
Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2010 versus first quarter 2009, consolidated net sales increased 1% to $1.565 billion due primarily to favorable foreign currency translation rate changes partially offset by declines in domestic paint sale volume.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increase $11.4 million for the quarter to $692 million. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 43.9% in the first quarter last year.
Selling general and administrative expenses for the quarter were essentially flat compared to first quarter 2009 at $612.9 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 39.1% in the first quarter this year from 39.3% last year. Interest expense decreased $600,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $8.6 million or 16.8% to $59.5 million.
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 45.2% compared to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter rate this year reflects the one time increase in income tax expense of $11.4 million related to the Health Care And Education Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in March of this year, which raised our effective rate by 19.2% for the quarter.
For the full year 2010 we expect our effective tax rate would be approximately 35% including the effect of the health care legislation. Last year's rate was 30%. Consolidated net income decreased $4.7 million to $32.6 million from 37.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to the health care tax effect. Net income as a percent of sales was 2.1% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter last year.
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased to $0.30 per share from $0.32 per share in 2009. The tax impact of the health care legislation reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.10 in the quarter. Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our paint stores group in the first quarter 2010 decreased 5.3% to $850.9 million. Comparable store sales or sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months declined 5.4%. The decrease in sales for the segment was due primarily to a decline in paid sales volume and non-paid sales volume.
Regionally in the first quarter, our mid-west division led all divisions followed by eastern division, southeastern division and southwestern division. Segment profit for the group decreased 15.6% to $47.8 million in the first quarter 2010 due primarily to lower volume. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.6% from 6.3% in the first quarter last year due primarily to lower volume and raw material cost increases that were partially offset by reductions in SG&A.
Turning to our consumer group, sales in the first quarter increased 1.4% to $292.1 million. The increase was due primarily to new product introductions partially offset by soft DIY demand at some retail customers. Segment profit for the consumer group increased 24% in the quarter to $37.5 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 12.8% from 10.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued stringent expense control and cost reductions related to facility closings completed during the past year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases and reduced fix cost absorption from lower manufacturing and distribution volume.
For our global finishes group, sales in US dollars increased 16.2% to $421.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paid sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, favorable currency translation rate changes increased net sales for the group by 10.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 333% to $23 million due to higher sales volume and good expense control. Foreign currency rate changes reduced segment profit by $1.1 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 5.5% from 1.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and tight expense control that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency rate changes.
Turning to the balance sheet, our total debt on March 31st 2010 was $1.041 billion including total short term borrowings of $245 million. Total debt on March 31st 2009 was $1.08 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $91.2 million compared to $42.2 million at the end of the first quarter '09. Total borrowings to capitalization were 41% at the end of the quarter versus 40.5% at the end of the first quarter 2009.
Long term debt to capitalization was 34.7% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 16.5% last year due to the issuance of $500 million in 3.125% senior notes in December 2009 used to retire short term debt. In the first quarter 2010, the company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock in the open market. At March 31st 2010 the company had remaining authorization to purchase 10.35 million shares of its common stock. 
Also in the first quarter 2010 we spent $25.4 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $33.1 million and amortization expense was $6.7 million. For the full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year would be approximately 100 to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization would be approximately $26 million.
I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with the brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In California, the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency fee counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufactures of lead pigment. Briefing in this case is completed, oral arguments is now scheduled from May 5th, 2010 with a decision most likely coming in the summer of 2010.
In the Games [ph] case, a single plaintiff personal injury suit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. 
Briefing has now begun with our opening brief due by May 27th. Further briefing by the parties will continue into the fall. No hearing date has been set yet in that case, a decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011. That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2010 so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?

First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year, our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year and our profit was tracking well short of plan.",1247,"Thank you Bob and good morning everybody, thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year, our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year and our profit was tracking well short of plan. Judging by our first quarter guidance we expected a slow start to the year, In January and February, we were tracking in line with that guidance. Then in March, the storm clouds parted both literally and figuratively and the pace of business began to improve. Whether as a result of pent up demand from January and February, seasonably warm March weather, or more fundamental improvement in end market demand in some segments, our sales in March closed the gap from the previous two months and we finished the quarter essentially on budget and on plan. 
The sales momentum we saw in March was absolutely encouraging and the fact it appears to be carrying over into April is even more encouraging. Not surprisingly, there was considerable disparity in the strength of the March rebounds across market segments, distribution channels and geographies. In North America, for example, the most favorable trends were in the residential and commercial repaint markets, although we did see some improvement in new residential businesses for the first time in many years. DIY sales through our own stores and most of our external retail partners turned positive in March, after very soft months in January and February.
The rebound in our global finishes group business was more broad based with sales growth across most product lines and in most geographic markets. If there is a downside to the strengthening industry demand, it is that it will likely keep pressure on the raw material supply chain. Cost pressure caused by the current tight supply of propylene, ethylene, acrylic acid, titanium dioxide and other raw materials is not likely to abate until the second half of the year. 
If you take a look at year over year raw material cost comparison by quarter input cost troughed in the second quarter of last year 2009, then rose steadily through the second half. We believe they are likely to peak in the second quarter of this year and ease somewhat in the second half.
If this outlook is correct, our most difficult comparisons are likely to be in the second quarter. In our year-end 2009 conference call, we predicted that the coatings industry would experience annualized year over year raw material price inflation in the low to mid single digits in 2010. Given the recent pricing actions by most of the major raw materials suppliers, we now believe a mid to high single digit percent increase is a more realistic expectation. Despite this change, we think we're in good position to continue to improve the profitability of the company. Based on our initial raw material outlook, we took only limited pricing actions in January and February on some of our industrial product lines. In March, we revised our outlook for raw materials and at the same time announced appropriate price increase cross most of our architectural lines, effective April 1st, to help mitigate the mounting cost pressures. Assuming normal implementation of these price increases, combined with our efforts over the past years to reduce manufacturing and distribution cost and increase our productivity, the impact of raw material inflation over the course of the year should be controlled. In the first quarter, we continue to invest in our controlled distribution platform, our paint stores group added several new stores bringing our total store count in the US, Canada and the Caribbean to 3,357 locations compared to 3,339 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for paint stores group to add approximately 40 to 50 new store locations during the year and significantly reduce the rate of redundant store closings. We made further process in our management of working capital, reducing our working capital ratio to 12.4% of sales from 12.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally during the quarter, we used the company’s cash to buy back 400,000 shares of our stock and we increased the dividend rate to $0.36 per share from $0.355 per share last year.
Our balance sheet remains physically sound and capable of financing our planned business operations and growth well into the foreseeable future. Effective April 1st we completed the acquisition at Sayerlack Industrial Wood Coatings from Arch Chemicals. Headquartered in Pianoro, Italy, Sayerlack is one of the largest manufacturer of industrial wood coatings in Europe and a technology leader in polyurethane, water and UV coatings for the joinery, furniture and cabinets industry. The company operates several manufacturing site across Western Europe along with a comprehensive network of sales, technical and distributor representatives, serving clients in Asia and the United States. Net sales for Sayerlack in 2009 were $147 million dollars. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that our consolidated net sales will increase in percentage terms in the high single digits compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share compared to $1.35 per share in the second quarter of 2009. For the full year of 2010, we are increasing our sale guidance range to mid to high single percentage growth over 2009 compared to our previous range of up low to mid single digits. With annual sales at this new level, we’ve raised our expectation for diluted net income per common share for 2010 to a range of $4.20 cents to $4.60 cents per share including the unfavorable tax impact of health care legislation compared to $3.78 cents per share earned in 2009. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to a moment to acknowledge the contributions of a valued member of our management team who's participating in his last earnings called today, John Ault, our vice president and corporate controller is retiring after an outstanding 34 year career with the company.
John usually doesn’t say much on these calls, but for many years he has had a strong voice within the company and with our board of directors. He plays a supporting role in our external communications but internally he’s always taken the lead to ensure the timeliness and integrity of our financial statements, oversee the company's compliance in this ever changing regulatory environment and safeguard our reputation with the financial community. John is humble, good natured and unassuming; he's also smart, meticulous and unflappable, which in this day and age makes him to be a pretty good guy for a CEO and CFO to have around. For the past eight months, John has been grooming one of our up and coming financial executives, Almus Fishen [ph] to assume the responsibilities of corporate controller. As anyone who knows John would expect, he has done a commendable job and now is well prepared for the transition, he has big shoes to fill.
I want to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf of our company and its shareholders for his many contributions over the past 34 years, John may be leaving us but the influence he's had in this company will benefit our shareholders for years to come. Thanks, John.
Again at this time, we'd like to thank all of you for joining us and we're happy to take your questions.

I think we have indicated to the investment community that the updated data points from the end of 2009 were the contractors accounted for 55% of all architectural purchases and the DIY market 45%. That trended down a few more points towards the DIY again in ’09 from its’08 levels. And time will tell whether that’s the trough and it starts to move back up or whether there’s more to come.
I think our expectations are that given the significant amount of new construction lack in the market place, that’s a pretty normalized expectation of how that volume would shift and if some of that new construction comes back , we would expect to see this trend back up towards its normal 60/40 ratio in favor of the contractor. You know, early sign, and these are very early signs as we indicated in the month of March and into April, the contractor segment as John just commented on receivable numbers really starting to pick up.

I would tell that our stock repurchase when you look at this price, we still think that when we take a look at it, the stock we’ve purchased over the last ten years and prior to that has all been accretive. We think that we buy the stock on a long term basis and I guess I would just say, last year in the first quarter we bought 500,000 shares, this year we bought 400,000, at the end of the year, we had bought 9 million shares, so as produce cash throughout the year, we are going to be looking for acquisitions just like we did last year, and void of acquisitions, we are going to be buying stock but the one thing I would tell you is there is remote chance that we will have cash on our balance sheet at the end of the year, in a greater amount than we do today last year end.

And you know, as commercial, you know, still a drag this year, but you see it contributing to positive next year, what do you now think of these normalize volumes for the US architectural market and do we get there in 2011 or that’s still more of a 2012 event?

And don't forget that, you know, when we're having a normalized year of 1 to 2%, that's what the commercial new construction market behaving normally which is not, so have some head's win on that, I think the rebound and the repaint cycles will left it, higher than the normal run rate, and the 600 seems a little bit of a far outreach at this point.

These are still some of the acquired stores from the earlier part of the last decade that we are getting to and the reason, the tail on that is that a number of these locations require in their lease language that we are not allowed to close during the term of a lease. So as the leases expire, we are able to get out of these last few stores. And I don’t think there is a lot of upside to the gross store number that we are talking about, it takes a period of time to negotiate real estate locations, then the permitting, and build out et cetera, we’ve got a pretty good visibility into what that number is going to be by year end. I think our expectations are that for the year that’s the right number and we will probably be ramping up slightly into the 11 and 12 period as the market continues to rebound.

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release.
Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2010 versus first quarter 2009, consolidated net sales increased 1% to $1.565 billion due primarily to favorable foreign currency translation rate changes partially offset by a decline in domestic paint sales volume. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $11.4 million for the quarter to $692 million. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 43.9% in the first quarter last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were essentially flat compared to first quarter 2009 at $612.9 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 39.1% in the first quarter this year from 39.3% last year.
Interest expense decreased $600,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $8.6 million or 16.8% to $59.5 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 45.2% compared to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter rate this year reflects the one-time increase in income tax expense of $11.4 million related to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in March of this year, which raised our effective rate by 19.2% for the quarter. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 35%, including the effect of the health care legislation. Last year's rates was 30%.
Consolidated net income decreased $4.7 million to $32.6 million from $37.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to the health care tax effect. Net income as a percent of sales was 2.1% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased to $0.30 per share from $0.32 per share in 2009. The tax impact of the health care legislation reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.10 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2010 decreased 5.3% to $850.9 million. Comparable store sales or sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months declined 5.4%. The decrease in sales for this segment was due primarily to a decline in paint sales volume and non-paint sales volume. 
Regionally in the first quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern division. Segment profit for the group decreased 15.6% to $47.8 million in the first quarter 2010, due primarily to lower volume. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.6% from 6.3% in the first quarter last year due primarily to lower volume and raw material cost increases that were partially offset by reductions in SG&A.
Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter increased 1.4% to $292.1 million. The increase was due primarily to new product introductions, partially offset by soft DIY demand at some retail customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 24% in the quarter to $37.5 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 12.8% from 10.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued stringent expense control and cost reductions related to facility closings completed during the past year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases and reduced fixed cost absorption from lower manufacturing and distribution volumes.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 16.2% to $421.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, favorable currency translation rate changes increased net sales for the group by 10.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 333% to $23 million due to higher sales volume and good expense control. Foreign currency rate changes reduced segment profit by $1.1 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 5.5% from 1.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and tight expense control that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency rate changes.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2010 was $1,041,000,000. Including total short-term borrowings of $245 million. Total debt on March 31, 2009 was $1.08 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $91.2 million compared to $42.2 million at the end of first quarter '09. Total borrowings to capitalization were 41% at the end of the quarter versus 40.5% at the end of first quarter 2009.
Long-term debt to capitalization was 34.7% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 16.5% last year due to the issuance of $500 million in 3 1/8% [ph] (13:29) senior notes in December 2009 used to retire short-term debt. In the first quarter 2010, the company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock in the open market. At March 31, 2010, the company had remaining authorizations to purchase 10.35 million shares of its common stock.
Also, in the first quarter 2010, we spent $25.4 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $33.1 million and amortization expense was $6.7 million. For the full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 million to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization will be approximately $26 million.
I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In California, the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufacturers of lead pigment. Briefing in this case is completed, all arguments is now scheduled for May 5, 2010, with a decision most likely coming in the summer of 2010. In the Gaines' case, a single-plaintiff personal injury suit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. Briefing has now begun with our opening brief due by May 27. Further briefing of the parties will continue into the fall. No hearing date has been set yet in that case. A decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011.
That concludes our review of the results for first quarter of 2010. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?"
303104,99773687,57342,"Sherwin-Williams Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year, and our profit was tracking well as sort of",1226,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year, and our profit was tracking well as sort of planned. Judging by our first quarter guidance, we expected a slow start of the year. In January and February, we're tracking in line with that guidance.
Then in March, the storm clouds parted both literally and figuratively and the pace of business begin to improve. Whether as a result of pent-up demand from January and February, a seasonably warm March weather or more fundamental improvement in end-market demand in some segments, our sales in March closed the GAAP from the previous two months, and we finished the quarter essentially on budget and on plan. The sales momentum we saw in March was absolutely encouraging, and the fact that it appears to be carrying over into April is even more encouraging.
Not surprisingly, there was considerable disparity in the strength of the March rebound across market segments, distribution channels and geographies. In North America, for example, the most favorable trends were in the Residential and Commercial repaint markets. Although we did see some improvement in new Residential business for the first time in many years, DIY sales to our own stores and most of our external partners turned positive in March after very soft months in January and February. The rebound in our Global Finishes Group business was more broad-based with sales growth across most product lines and in most geographic markets.
But there's a downside of the strengthening industry demand if that will likely keep pressure on the raw material's supply chain. Cost pressure caused by the current tight supply of propylene, azulene, acrylic acid, titanium dioxide and other raw materials is not likely to abate until the second half of the year. If you take a look at the year-over-year raw material cost comparison by quarter, input costs troughed in the second quarter of last year 2009, then rose steadily through the second half. We believe they're likely to peak in the second quarter of this year then ease somewhat in the second half. If this outlook is correct, our most difficult comparisons are likely to be in the second quarter. 
In our year-end 2009 conference call, we predicted that the coatings industry would experience annualized year-over-year raw materials price inflation in the low- to mid-single digits in 2010. Given the recent pricing actions by most of the major raw material suppliers, we now believe a mid- to high-single percent increase is a more realistic expectation. Despite this change, we think we're in good position to continue to improve the profitability of the company. Based on our initial raw material outlook, we took only limited pricing action in January and February on some of our industrial product lines.
In March, we revised our outlook for raw materials and at the same time, announced corporate price increases across most of our architectural lines effective April 1 to help mitigate the amount in cost pressures. Assuming normal implementation of these price increases, combined with our efforts over the past year to reduce manufacturing and distribution costs, and increase our productivity, the impact of raw material inflation over the course of the year should be controlled.
In the first quarter, we continue to invest in our Controlled Distribution Platform. Our Paint Stores Group added several new stores, bringing our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,257 locations compared to 3,339 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for Paint Stores Group to add approximately 40 to 50 new store locations during the year and significantly reduce the rate of redundant store closings.
We made further progress in our management of working capital, reducing our working capital ratio to 12.4% of sales from 12.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally, during the quarter, we used the company's cash to buy back 400,000 shares of our stock, and we increased the dividend rate to $0.36 per share from $.0355 per share last year. Our balance sheet remains fiscally sound and capable of financing our plan business operations and growth well into the foreseeable future.
Effective April 1, we completed the acquisition of 
Sayerlack Industrial Wood Coatings from Arch Chemicals. Headquartered in Pianoro, Italy, Sayerlack is one of the largest manufacturers of industrial wood coatings in Europe, and a technology leader in polyurethane, water and UV coatings for the joinery, furniture and cabinets industry. The company operates several manufacturing sites across Western Europe, along with a comprehensive network of sales, technical and distributor representatives serving clients in Asia and the United States. Net sales for Sayerlack in 2009 were $147 million. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that our consolidated net sales will increase, in percentage terms, in the high single digits compared to last year's second quarter. From the sales of that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share compared to $1.35 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
For the full year 2010, we are increasing our sales guidance range to mid- to high-single digit percentage growth over 2009 compared to our previous range of low- to mid-single digits. With the annual sales of this new level, we've raised our expectations per diluted net income per common share for 2010 to be a range of $4.20 to $4.60 per share including the unfavorable tax impact of healthcare legislation compared to $3.78 per share earned in 2009.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of a valued member of our management team who's participating in his last earnings call today. John Ault, our Vice President and Corporate Controller is retiring after an outstanding 34-year career with the company. John, you really doesn't say much on these calls, but for many years, you've had a strong voice within the company and with our Board of Directors. He plays a supporting role in our external communications but internally, he has always taken the lead to ensure the timeliness and integrity of our financial statements. Oversee the company's compliance and its ever-changing regulatory environment and safeguard our reputation with the financial community. John is humble, good-natured and unassuming. He's also smart, meticulous and unflappable, which in this day and age may seem a pretty good guy for a CEO and CFO to have around. For the past eight months, John has been grooming one of our up and coming financial executives, Al Masticion [ph] (23:38), to assume the responsibilities of Corporate Controller. As anyone who knows John would expect, he's done a commendable job and now is well-prepared for the transition. He has big shoes to fill. I want to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf our company and our shareholders for his many contributions over the past 34 years. John may be leaving us but the influence he's had on this company will benefit our shareholders for years to come. Thanks, John.

I think our expectations are that given the significant amount of new construction lack in the marketplace, that's a pretty normalized expectation of how that volume would shift. And if some of that new construction comes back, we'd expect to see this trend back up towards its normal 60:40 ratio in favor of the contractor.

So the answer is during this time, we did not put one of those in place. So therefore, no, we haven't got any stock between months end and now. I would tell you that our stock repurchase, when you look at this price, we still think that when you take a look at it, the stock repurchase over the last 10 years and prior to that has all been accretive. We think that we buy the stock kind of a long-term basis, and I guess I would just say last year in the first quarter, we bought 500,000 shares this it was about 400,000.

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release.
Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2010 versus first quarter 2009, consolidated net sales increased 1% to $1.565 billion due primarily to favorable foreign currency translation rate changes partially offset by a decline in domestic paint sales volume. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $11.4 million for the quarter to $692 million. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 43.9% in the first quarter last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were essentially flat compared to first quarter 2009 at $612.9 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 39.1% in the first quarter this year from 39.3% last year.
Interest expense decreased $600,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $8.6 million or 16.8% to $59.5 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 45.2% compared to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter rate this year reflects the one-time increase in income tax expense of $11.4 million related to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in March of this year, which raised our effective rate by 19.2% for the quarter. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 35%, including the effect of the health care legislation. Last year's rates was 30%.
Consolidated net income decreased $4.7 million to $32.6 million from $37.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to the health care tax effect. Net income as a percent of sales was 2.1% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased to $0.30 per share from $0.32 per share in 2009. The tax impact of the health care legislation reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.10 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2010 decreased 5.3% to $850.9 million. Comparable store sales or sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months declined 5.4%. The decrease in sales for the segment was due primarily to a decline in paint sales volume and non-paint sales volume. 
Regionally in the first quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern division. Segment profit for the group decreased 15.6% to $47.8 million in the first quarter 2010, due primarily to lower volume. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.6% from 6.3% in the first quarter last year due primarily to lower volume and raw material cost increases that were partially offset by reductions in SG&A.
Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter increased 1.4% to $292.1 million. The increase was due primarily to new product introductions, partially offset by soft DIY demand at some retail customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 24% in the quarter to $37.5 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 12.8% from 10.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued stringent expense control and cost reductions related to facility closings completed during the past year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases and reduced fixed cost absorption from lower manufacturing and distribution volume.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 16.2% to $421.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, favorable currency translation rate changes increased net sales for the group by 10.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 333% to $23 million due to higher sales volume and good expense control. Foreign currency rate changes reduced segment profit by $1.1 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 5.5% from 1.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and tight expense control that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency rate changes.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2010 was $1,041,000,000, including total short-term borrowings of $245 million. Total debt on March 31, 2009 was $1.08 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $91.2 million compared to $42.2 million at the end of first quarter '09. Total borrowings to capitalization were 41% at the end of the quarter versus 40.5% at the end of first quarter 2009.
Long-term debt to capitalization was 34.7% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 16.5% last year due to the issuance of $500 million in 3.125% senior notes in December 2009 used to retire short-term debt. In the first quarter 2010, the company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock in the open market. At March 31, 2010, the company had remaining authorizations to purchase 10.35 million shares of its common stock.
Also, in the first quarter 2010, we spent $25.4 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $33.1 million and amortization expense was $6.7 million. For the full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 million to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization will be approximately $26 million.
I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In California, the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufacturers of lead pigment. Briefing in this case is completed, all arguments is now scheduled for May 5, 2010, with a decision most likely coming in the summer of 2010. In the Gaines' case, a single-plaintiff personal injury suit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. Briefing has now begun with our opening brief due by May 27. Further briefing of the parties will continue into the fall. No hearing date has been set yet in that case. A decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011.
That concludes our review of the results for first quarter of 2010. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?"
303104,99773687,58630,"Sherwin-Williams Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year, and our profit was tracking well as sort of",1224,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year, and our profit was tracking well as sort of planned. Judging by our first quarter guidance, we expected a slow start of the year. In January and February, we're tracking in line with that guidance.
Then in March, the storm clouds parted both literally and figuratively and the pace of business begin to improve. Whether as a result of pent-up demand from January and February, a seasonably warm March weather or more fundamental improvement in end-market demand in some segments, our sales in March closed the GAAP from the previous two months, and we finished the quarter essentially on budget and on plan. The sales momentum we saw in March was absolutely encouraging, and the fact that it appears to be carrying over into April is even more encouraging.
Not surprisingly, there was considerable disparity in the strength of the March rebound across market segments, distribution channels and geographies. In North America, for example, the most favorable trends were in the Residential and Commercial repaint markets. Although we did see some improvement in new Residential business for the first time in many years, DIY sales to our own stores and most of our external partners turned positive in March after very soft months in January and February. The rebound in our Global Finishes Group business was more broad-based with sales growth across most product lines and in most geographic markets.
But there's a downside of the strengthening industry demand if that will likely keep pressure on the raw material's supply chain. Cost pressure caused by the current tight supply of propylene, azulene, acrylic acid, titanium dioxide and other raw materials is not likely to abate until the second half of the year. If you take a look at the year-over-year raw material cost comparison by quarter, input costs troughed in the second quarter of last year 2009, then rose steadily through the second half. We believe they're likely to peak in the second quarter of this year then ease somewhat in the second half. If this outlook is correct, our most difficult comparisons are likely to be in the second quarter. 
In our year-end 2009 conference call, we predicted that the coatings industry would experience annualized year-over-year raw materials price inflation in the low- to mid-single digits in 2010. Given the recent pricing actions by most of the major raw material suppliers, we now believe a mid- to high-single percent increase is a more realistic expectation. Despite this change, we think we're in good position to continue to improve the profitability of the company. Based on our initial raw material outlook, we took only limited pricing action in January and February on some of our industrial product lines.
In March, we revised our outlook for raw materials and at the same time, announced corporate price increases across most of our architectural lines effective April 1 to help mitigate the mounting cost pressures. Assuming normal implementation of these price increases, combined with our efforts over the past year to reduce manufacturing and distribution costs and increase our productivity, the impact of raw material inflation over the course of the year should be controlled.
In the first quarter, we continued to invest in our controlled distribution platform. Our Paint Stores Group added several new stores, bringing our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,357 locations compared to 3,339 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for Paint Stores Group to add approximately 40 to 50 new store locations during the year and significantly reduce the rate of redundant store closings.
We made further progress in our management of working capital, reducing our working capital ratio to 12.4% of sales from 12.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally, during the quarter, we used the company's cash to buy back 400,000 shares of our stock, and we increased the dividend rate to $0.36 per share from $.0355 per share last year. Our balance sheet remains fiscally sound and capable of financing our plan business operations and growth well into the foreseeable future.
Effective April 1, we completed the acquisition of Sayerlack Industrial Wood Coatings from Arch Chemicals. Headquartered in Pianoro, Italy, Sayerlack is one of the largest manufacturers of industrial wood coatings in Europe, and a technology leader in polyurethane, water and UV coatings for the joinery, furniture and cabinets industry. The company operates several manufacturing sites across Western Europe, along with a comprehensive network of sales, technical and distributor representatives serving clients in Asia and the United States. Net sales for Sayerlack in 2009 were $147 million. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that our consolidated net sales will increase, in percentage terms, in the high single digits compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share compared to $1.35 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
For the full year 2010, we are increasing our sales guidance range to mid- to high-single digit percentage growth over 2009 compared to our previous range of low- to mid-single digits. With the annual sales of this new level, we've raised our expectations per diluted net income per common share for 2010 to be a range of $4.20 to $4.60 per share including the unfavorable tax impact of healthcare legislation compared to $3.78 per share earned in 2009.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of a valued member of our management team who's participating in his last earnings call today. John Ault, our Vice President and Corporate Controller is retiring after an outstanding 34-year career with the company. John, you really doesn't say much on these calls, but for many years, you've had a strong voice within the company and with our Board of Directors. He plays a supporting role in our external communications but internally, he has always taken the lead to ensure the timeliness and integrity of our financial statements. Oversee the company's compliance and its ever-changing regulatory environment and safeguard our reputation with the financial community. John is humble, good-natured and unassuming. He's also smart, meticulous and unflappable, which in this day and age may seem a pretty good guy for a CEO and CFO to have around. For the past eight months, John has been grooming one of our up and coming financial executives, Al Masticion [ph] (23:38), to assume the responsibilities of Corporate Controller. As anyone who knows John would expect, he's done a commendable job and now is well-prepared for the transition. He has big shoes to fill. I want to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf our company and our shareholders for his many contributions over the past 34 years. John may be leaving us but the influence he's had on this company will benefit our shareholders for years to come. Thanks, John. 
And again at this time, we'd like to thank all of you for joining us. And we're happy to take your questions."

That trended down a few more points towards the DIY again in '09 from its '08 level. And time will tell whether that's the trough and starts to move back up or whether there's more to come. I think our expectations are that given the significant amount of new construction lack in the marketplace, that's a pretty normalized expectation of how that volume would shift. And if some of that new construction comes back, we'd expect to see this trend back up towards its normal 60:40 ratio in favor of the contractor. Early signs, and these are very early signs, as we indicated in the month of March and into April, a contractor segment, as John just commented on the receivable numbers, really starting to pick up.

So the answer is during this time, we did not put one of those in place. So therefore, no, we haven't bought any stock between month-end and now. I would tell you that our stock repurchase, when you look at this price, we still think that when we take a look at it, the stock we've purchased over the last 10 years and prior to that has all been accretive. We think that we buy the stock on a long-term basis, and I guess I would just say last year in the first quarter, we bought 500,000 shares; this year we bought 400,000. At the end of the year, we had bought 9 million share. So as we produce cash throughout the year, we're going to be looking for acquisitions just like we did last year.

Summarizing overall company performance",979,"Thanks, Jackie.  In order to allow more time for questions, we’ve provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations Second Quarter Press Release. 
Summarizing overall company performance for the Second Quarter 2010 verus Second Quarter 2009; consolidated net sales increased $195.2 million, or 10% to $2.14 billion to primarily to improve architectural sales, acquisition, and favorable foreign currency translation rate changes. 
Acquisition increase net sales by 1.9% in the quarter, and favorable currency translation rate increased consolidated net sales 1.3%.  Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $76.5 million for the quarter to $971.9 million. 
Gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 45.4% of sales from 46% in the Second Quarter last year.  Selling, general and administrative expenses to the quarter increased 5.9% to $691.2 million.  
At the percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 32.3% in the Second Quarter this year from 33.5% last year.  Interest expense, increased $16 million compared to the Second Quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $27.1 million or 11.7% to $259.2 million. 
Our expected tax rate in the Second Quarter this year was 29.9% compared to 31.9% in the Second Quarter of 2009.  For the full year of 2010, we expect our effected tax rate to be approximately 33%.  
Consolidated net income, increased $23.7 million to $181.7 million from $158 million in the Second Quarter of 2009.  Net income at the percent sales was 8 1/2 % compared to 8.1% in the Second Quarter last year.  Diluted net income for common share for the quarter increased 21 1/2% to $1.64 per share, from $1.35 per share in 2009. 
Looking at our results by operating segments, sales for our paint store group in the Second Quarter, 2010 increased 6.4% to $1.24 billion.  Comparable store sales, sales by stores open more than 12-calender months, increased 5.9%.  The increase in sales for the segment was due to improved domestic architectural  paint sales, primarily to residential repaint contractors and improving protective and marine product sales. 
Regionally in the Second Quarter, our Eastern Division led all division, followed by Southeastern Division, Midwestern Division, and Southwestern Division. 
Sales by all four paint stores divisions increased in the Second Quarter compared to last year. Segment profit for the group, increased 9 1/2% to $212 million in the Second Quarter 2010. Segment margin, increased to 17% from 16 1/2 % due primarily to higher sales volume and effective SG&A control.  
During the Second Quarter, paint store group opened seven new stored and closed four redundant store locations. 
Turning to our consumer group, sales in the Second Quarter increased 11.9% to $410.2 million. The increase was due primarily to improving demand at some of the segment’s retail, industrial, and institution customers. 
Segment profit for the consumer group increased 22.1% in the quarter to $80.7 million. Segment profit at the percent of external sales, increased in 19.7% from 18% in the same period last year, due primarily to effective cost control and cost savings realized from previous year’s site rationalizations that were practically offset by raw material cost increases. 
For our global finishes group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 18.8% to $486.5 million in the quarter, due primarily to acquisition, favorable currency, translation, rate changes, and higher paint sales volume. 
For the quarter, acquisition increased global finishes group net sales by 9.2%, and favorable currency translation rate changes, added 5% to net sales in U.S. dollars. 
Second Quarter segment profit, increased 28.2% to $40 million, due to higher sales volume, good expense control, and currency translation.  The combined effect of positive foreign currency rate changes, and a negative impact of acquisition’s, including all transaction cost, slightly reduced global finishes group, segment profit in the quarter.  
Turning to the balance sheet, our total debt, on June 30, 2010, was $908.6 million, including total short-term borrowing of $199.5 million. Total debt on June 30, 2009 was $800.7 million. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $48.4 million, compared to $49.3 million at the end of the Second Quarter 2009. 
Total borrowing capitalizations were 37.2% at the end of the quarter verus 31.6% at the end of the Second Quarter last year. Long-term debt capitalization, with 29.1% at the end of the Second Quarter this year, compared to 11.9% last year. 
In the Second Quarter 2010, we spent $22 million on capital expenditures.  Depreciation expense was $33.1 million and amortization expense was $6.5 million.  
For the full year of 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 to $115 million, depreciation will be about $147 million, and amortization will be about $26 million. 
I’ll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation.  
In California, State Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency council to aid them in their suit against former manufactures of lead pigment.  Briefing is completed, oral argument was held on May 5, 2010, and we expect a decision sometime this summer. 
The Gains Case, a single-plaintive, personal injury suit, was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi, beginning in June 2009.  The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintive.  The Company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court and briefing has now begun.  
We recently filed our opening brief.  We expect plaintive to file their brief within the next 60 days, at which time we’ll have an opportunity to file a reply brief.  No hearing date has been set yet, and a decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011. 
That concludes our review of results for the Second Quarter 2010.  So I’ll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for Third Quarter and Full Year. Chris.

It was our strongest quarter in terms of sales growth, in the last four years, dating back to th",1041,"Thanks, Bob.  And good morning everybody.  Thanks for joining us today.  
Second Quarter of 2010 was a solid quarter for Sherwin Williams, in many respects.  It was our strongest quarter in terms of sales growth, in the last four years, dating back to the First Quarter of 2006.  After backing out acquisition’s and positive currency translation, revenues increased nearly 7% verus the Second Quarter of last year.  Our domestic Architectural paint business improved across all end-user segments, led by particularly strong volume gains and residential repaint market. 
Domestic and international sales of automotive finishes, OEM product finishes, and protective and marine coatings also rebounded nicely in the quarter compared to the Second Quarter of last year.  It was a solid quarter in terms of earnings improvement as well.  Although, we did experience some year-over-year gross margin compression resolving from a rapid increase in raw material cost, primarily a acrylic latex and titanium dioxide, and higher operating cost we incurred to compensate for the poor service performance of a major raw material supplier. 
These included the cost of transferring raw materials between manufacturing plants, moving finished goods between distribution centers, and between stores, lower plant productivity due to raw material outages and higher-cost spot by to compensate for poor service levels. 
Although, these raw material supply problems are being resolved as we speak, many of these higher cost will continue to pressure our margin in the near term.  
We have been responding to the mounting raw material cost pressures by appropriately tightening SG&A expense control and raising prices where necessary.  SG&A as a percent of sales for the quarter, decreased 120 basis points, compared to last year, which is noteworthy considering the incremental service expense required to support double-digit sales growth. 
All three of our reportable segments, posted strong, operating margin increases in the quarter.  Combined profits for the three segments, increased by $42 million, more than 14%, and combined segment profit margin increased 60 basis points at 15 ½ %.  
Our interest expense for the quarter increased by $16 million over last year as we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase $85 million in long-term debt.  In this particular case, long term means bonds maturing in 2097.  
The financial metric were favorable and it’s repurchased allows for greater flexibility for our balance sheet going forward.  The decision to take advantage of this opportunity impacted our earnings performance for the quarter by $0.08, it will be reflected in our guidance estimate for our total year earning as well. 
In spite the gross margin pressure I mentioned earlier, and the higher interest expense, our consolidated net income for the quarter rose 15% and diluted earnings per common shares increased 21 1/2 %. 
In the first 6 months of 2010, we generated $211 million in net operating cash.  This was down slightly from the 260 million range in the first half of last year, due primarily to a $78 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales. 
We’ve continue to invest this company’s cash to expand our control distribution platform, complete suitable acquisition as well as purchase shares of stack for treasury. 
During the first six months of the year, our paint stores group opened 13 new store locations, and consolidated seven redundant stores.  We finished the quarter with 3,360 stores in operation, compared to 3,340 this time last year. 
Once again, for the full year, we expect to open between 40 and 50 new stores, and slow the pace of redundant store closings.  Over the past 2 ½ years, our net store count has increased by 35 stores, but it was 35 the hard way.  During this time, we’ve opened 166 store locations in new markets, and closed 131 redundant locations.  Primarily stores we’ve acquired over the past six years that were located in close proximity to existing Sherwin Williams Stores. 
The exposure to new markets we achieve, would be 166 new store openings, it’s giving a significant advantage in receiving new customers as well as servicing existing ones. 
On April 1, we completed the acquisition of Arch Chemical’s Industrial Wood Coatings business, which trades under the Sayerlack brand name.  In late May, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Becker Acroma, one of the largest global manufactures of industrial wood coatings.  
These two European-based companies with combined annual sales of approximately $450 million, serve the joinery, kitchen cabinet, furniture, and wood flooring industries worldwide.  They represent another important step in our efforts to strengthen our growing, global-industrial coatings platform, to better serve our customers around the world with outstanding assets, technology and people. 
During the quarter, we used the companies cash to buy back 1.5 million shares of our common stock on the open market, bringing our year-to-date total of 2.35 million shares.  On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to purchase 8.4 million shares of stock.  We remain cautiously optimistic about the resilience of the architectural repaint market in the America’s, and global demand for most industrial coatings. 
Our outlook for the Third Quarter for 2010 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percentage, compared to last year’s Third Quarter with sales at this level. We expect diluted net income for common share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share, compared to $1.51 per share in 2009. 
For the full year of 2010, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-to-high, single-percentage range, compared to last year. With annual sales of that level, we are updating our diluted net income per common share expectation to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.52 per share, compared to $3.78 per share last year. 
As a reminder, our full year guidance include the $0.08 per share charge for the higher interest expense in the Second Quarter as well as the $0.10 per share charge taken in the First Quarter related to the healthcare legislation. 
Finally, earlier this week, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, up from $0.35 ½ per share last year, keeping us on track to achieve our 32nd consecutive year of increased dividends. 
Again, thanks for joining us this morning and we’d be happy to take your questions.

And we do expect, as Bob just answered in an earlier comment, that when the year is said and done, the new residential construction market will be slightly positive for the year.  So we’re going to start to see a little rebound in those areas.  
And as we’ve also commented on these discussions, that the anecdotal evidence of contractors in our stores with more work, buying equipment, and hiring folks, etcetera would indicate that that’s starting to come back a little bit.  
So we remain bullish on this contractor segment.  We think the 60/40 range that it’s been bounding around in the last couple of years is probably a pretty reliable number to count on going forward, and it should strengthen as new construction comes back, certainly in the coming years on the commercial side as well.  
Regarding our own DIY performance, I think we’ve been pleased.  You see the numbers on our consumer segment this quarter, which have a lot of DIY presence there, so that’s been strong for them as well as the DIY performance at our own stores.  We’re getting our comp stores running at a 5-plus percent performance, all customers moving in the right direction so we’re getting some luck from DIY as well.

That doesn’t mean that there’s no professional painting contractors working on those properties, it’s just that generally the contractor working on those properties also does some floor coverings, some electrical, some plumbing, etcetera.

We don’t think we’re on bottom yet.  We think that’s probably a good number for the balance of the year, is we’re going to finish the year down in the 20%, 20-plus percent range.  
In terms of sales of existing homes, it certainly softens somewhat also after the expiration of a tax credit because that was driving some resales as well.  What is important to us Robert, in looking at those numbers is not just the sheer volume, but the quality of the transaction.  
Foreclosed and distressed properties being acquired out of foreclosure by investors really doesn’t drive our end markets as well as existing home sales by an owner-occupant to a new owner-occupant.  
So to the extend that we can - I mean, if volume is flat from last year, and the quality improves because of the decline in foreclosure transactions, that’s good for us.  We know that there’s certainly more pain to come in the foreclosure market, but it’s been fairly orderly and we’ve seen a steady rise in the quality transactions.  
But a flat number in existing home sales with improving quality would benefit our business.

When we take a look at that we had to close some redundant stores.  
As we continue to get more pentitration in markets we get more productivity in markets.  And so when you take a look at the makeup of our store’s organization two or three years from now versus three years ago, we’ll have higher store counts and we’ll be more productive.  And we can probably hit the peak margins at weaker sales.  That’s what we believe.  
We also believe the same thing in consumer group.  We think that as we continue to get more productivity, what we have said is that we think we can hit our peak margins without hitting our peak sales.  
And then you look at the global group.  It’s the same thing.  As we continue to get more mass in individual countries, we’re going to be able to get that margin up.  
And on the first part of your question ,clearly there is more pain to come in the housing markets and we haven not called the bottom on the housing markets.  We think that foreclosure activity to come is going to keep pressure on home values and that won’t right itself for a while yet.  
We should point out thought that a lot of the vitality we’re seeing in the residential repaint markets are not so much driven by the traditional drivers, which are existing home turnover, but they’re being driven by pent-up demand from postponed maintenance activity by people who are staying in their house.  And we think that that’s what’s driving some of the goodness in the market today.

In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations Second Quarter Press Release.
Summarizing overall company performance for the second quarter 2010 versus second quarter 2009, consolidated net sales increased $195.2 million or 10% to $2.14 billion, due primarily to improved architectural sales, acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation rate changes.
Acquisitions increased net sales by 1.9% in the quarter, and favorable currency translation rate increased consolidated net sales 1.3%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $76.5 million for the quarter to $971.9 million. Gross margins decreased 60 basis points to 45.4% of sales from 46% in the second quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 5.9% to $691.2 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 32.3% in the second quarter this year from 33.5% last year. Interest expense increased $16 million compared to the second quarter last year.
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $27.1 million or 11.7% to $259.2 million. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 29.9% compared to 31.9% in the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 33%.
Consolidated net income increased $23.7 million to $181.7 million from $158 million in the second quarter of 2009. Net income as a percent of sales was 8.5% compared to 8.1% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 21.5% to $1.64 per share from $1.35 per share in 2009. Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter 2010 increased 6.4% to $1.24 billion. Comparable store sales, sales by stores open in more than 12-calendar month, increased 5.9%. The increase in sales for the segment was due to improved domestic Architectural Paint sales, primarily the residential repaint contractors and improving Protective & Marine product sales.
Regionally, in the second quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division and Southwestern division. Sales by all four Paint Stores divisions increased in the second quarter compared to last year. Segment profit for the group increased to 9.5% to $212 million in the second quarter of 2010. Segment margin increased to 17% from 16.5% due primarily to higher sales volume and effective SG&A control.  During the second quarter, Paint Stores Group opened seven new stores and closed four redundant store locations.
Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the second quarter increased 11.9% to $410.2 million. The increase was due primarily to improving demand at some of the segment's retail, industrial and institutional customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 22.1% in the quarter to $80.7 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 19.7% from 18% in the same period last year, due primarily to effective cost control and cost savings realized from previous year's site rationalizations that were partially offset by raw material cost increases.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 18.8% to $486.5 million in the quarter, due primarily to acquisitions, favorable currency rate changes and higher paint sales volume.
For the quarter, acquisitions increased Global Finishes Group net sales by 9.2%, and favorable currency translation rate changes added 5% to net sales in U.S. dollars. Second quarter segment profit increased 28.2% to $40 million, due to higher sales volume, good expense control and currency translation.
The combined effect of positive foreign currency rate changes and the negative impact of acquisitions, including all transaction costs, slightly reduced Global Finishes Group segment profit in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total debt on June 30, 2010, was $908.6 million including total short-term borrowings of $199.5 million. Total debt on June 30, 2009, was $800.7 million. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $48.4 million compared $49.3 million at the end of the second quarter 2009. Total borrowings to capitalization were 37.2% at the end of the quarter versus 31.6% at the end of the second quarter last year.
Long-term debt to capitalization was 29.1% at the end of the second quarter this year compared to 11.9% last year. In the second quarter 2010, we spent $22 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $33.1 million, and amortization expense was $6.5 million. For the full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 million to $115 million, depreciation will be about $147 million, and amortization will be about $26 million.
I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In California, the state's Supreme Court will decide whether it be permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufacturers of lead pigment. Briefing is completed, oral argument was held on May 5, 2010, and we expect a decision some time this summer. 
The Gaines case, a single-plaintiff personal injury suit, was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi, beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court, and briefing has now begun. We recently filed our opening brief. We expect plaintiff to file their brief within the next 60 days at which time, we will have an opportunity to file a reply brief. No hearing date has been set yet, and a decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011.
That concludes our review of results for the second quarter 2010. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the third quarter and full year. Chris?"
303104,108236614,68756,"Sherwin-Williams Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The second quarter of 2010 was a solid quarter for Sherwin-Williams in many respects. It was our strongest quarter in terms of sales growth in the last four years, dating back to the f",1037,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The second quarter of 2010 was a solid quarter for Sherwin-Williams in many respects. It was our strongest quarter in terms of sales growth in the last four years, dating back to the first quarter of 2006. After backing out acquisitions and positive currency translations, revenues increased nearly 7% versus the second quarter of last year. Our Domestic Architectural Paint business improved across all end-user segments, led by particularly strong volume gains in the residential repaint market. Domestic and international sales of Automotive Finishes, OEM Product Finishes and Protective & Marine coatings also rebounded nicely in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year.
It was a solid quarter in terms of earnings improvement as well. Although we did experience some year-over-year gross margin compression resulting from a rapid increase in raw material cost, primarily acrylic latex and titanium dioxide, and higher operating costs we incurred to compensate for the poor service performance of a major raw material supplier. These included the cost of transferring of raw materials between manufacturing plants, moving finished goods between distribution centers and between stores, lower plant productivity due to raw material outages, and higher-cost spot buy to compensate our poor service level. Although these raw material supply problems are being resolved as we speak, many of these higher costs will continue to pressure our margins in the near term. We have them responding to the mounting raw material cost pressures by corporately tightening SG&A expense control and raising prices where necessary. SG&A as a percent of sales for the quarter decreased 120 basis points compared to last year, which is noteworthy considering the incremental service expense required to support double-digit sales growth.
All three of our reportable segments posted strong operating margin increases in the quarter. Combined profit for the three segments increased by $42 million, more than 14%, and combined segment profit margin increased 60 basis points to 15.5%.
Our interest expense for the quarter increased by $16 million over last year, as we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase $85 million in long-term debt. In this particular case, long-term means bonds maturing in 2097. The financial metrics were favorable, and this repurchase allows for greater flexibility for our balance sheet, going forward. The decision to take advantage of this opportunity impacted our earnings performance for the quarter by $0.08 and will be reflected in our guidance estimate for our total year earnings as well.
Despite the gross margins pressure I mentioned earlier and the higher interest expense, our consolidated net income for the quarter rose 15%, and diluted earnings per common share increased 21.5%. In the first six months of 2010, we generated $211 million in net operating cash, as we're down slightly from the $250 million range in the first half of last year, due primarily to $78 million increase in accounts receivable as the result of higher sales. We continue to invest this company's cash to expand our control of distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions as well as purchase shares of our stock for treasury.
Turning to first six months of the year, our Paint Stores Group opened 13 new store locations and consolidated seven redundant stores. We finished the quarter with 3,360 stores in operation compared to 3,340 this time last year. Once again for the full year, we expect to open between 40 and 50 new stores and slow the pace of redundant store closings. Over the past two and a half years, our net store count has increased by 35 stores, but it was 35, the hard way. During this time, we've opened 166 store locations in new markets and closed 131 redundant locations, primarily stores that we acquired over the past six years that were located in close proximity to existing Sherwin-Williams stores. The exposure to new markets we achieve would be the 166 new store openings that's given us the significant advantage in reaching new customers as well as servicing existing ones.
On April 1, we completed the acquisition of Arch Chemicals' industrial wood coatings business which trade under the Sayerlack brand name. In late May, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire  Becker Acroma, one of the largest global manufacturers of industrial wood coatings. These two European-based companies with combined annual sales of approximately $450 million serve the joinery, kitchen cabinet, furniture and wood flooring industries worldwide. They represent another important step in our efforts to strengthen our growing global industrial coatings platform to better serve our customers around the world with outstanding assets, technology and people.
During the quarter, we used the company's cash to buy back 1.95 million shares of our common stock in the open market, preliminary year-to-date total of 2.35 million shares. In June 30, we have remaining board authorization to purchase $8.4 million shares of stock.
We remain cautiously optimistic about the resilience of the architectural repaint market in the Americas and global demand for most industrial coatings. Our outlook for the third quarter of 2010, just for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage compared to last year's third quarter with sales at this level, we expect diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share compared to $1.51 per share in 2009.
For the full year of 2010, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range compared to last year. With the annual sales of that level, we are updating our diluted net income per common share expectation to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.52 per share compared to $3.78 per share last year. As a reminder, our full year guidance includes the $0.08 per share charge for the higher interest expense in the second quarter, as well as the $0.10 per share charge taken in the first quarter related to the healthcare legislation.
Finally, earlier this week, our board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, up from $0.355 last year, keeping us on track to achieve our 32nd consecutive year of increased dividends. Again, thanks for joining us this morning, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

We think that's probably a good number for the balance of the year is we're going to finish the year down in the 20%, 20-plus percent range. In terms of sales of existing homes, it certainly softens somewhat also after the expiration of the tax credit, because that was driving some resales as well. What is important to us, Robert, in looking at those numbers is not just the sheer volume, but the quality of the transaction. Foreclosed and distressed properties being acquired out of foreclosure by investors really doesn't drive our end markets, as well as existing home sales by an owner-occupant to a new owner-occupant. So to the extent that we can -- I mean, if volume is flat from last year, and the quality improves because of the decline in foreclosure transactions, that's good for us. We know that there's certainly more pain to come in the foreclosure market, but it's been fairly orderly and we've seen a steady rise in the quality transactions.

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations Third Quarter press release. 
Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2010 versus third quarter '09, consolidated net sales increased $175.4 million or 8.8% to $2.172 billion due primarily to acquisitions, selling price increases, higher sales volume and favorable foreign currency translation rate changes. Favorable currency translation increased consolidated net sales 0.6% in the quarter, and acquisitions increased net sales by 3.4%. 
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $42.6 million to $971.6 million. Gross margin decreased 180 basis points to 44.7% of sales from 46.5% in the third quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher year-over-year raw material prices, which included certain spot market material purchases tied to supplier plant shutdowns.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 7.6% to $703.7 million due primarily to incremental SG&A from acquisitions, currency translation rate changes, higher service costs resulting from increased sales and higher freight and distribution costs to maintain customer service levels. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 32.4% in the third quarter this year from 32.8% last year. 
Net interest expense increased $2.8 million compared to the third quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $3.3 million or 1.3% to $255.4 million. Profit before tax decreased as a percent of sales to 11.8% from 13% last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 31.4% compared to 32.3% in the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to increase slightly to 32% compared to last year's rate of approximately 30%.
Consolidated net income was essentially flat at $175.3 million compared to $175.2 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net income as a percent of sales declined to 8.1% from 8.8% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased $0.09 or 6% to $1.60 per share from $1.51 per share in 2009. Acquisitions reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.02 per share in the quarter, which was partially offset by favorable currency fluctuation rate changes, which increased diluted net income per common share by $0.01 per share.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter increased 5.4% to $1.286 billion. Improving architectural paint sales to residential repaint contractors and DIY [do-it-yourself] customers and selling price increases more than offset continued weakness in new residential and commercial markets. 
Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.1% in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year. Regionally, in the third quarter 2010, our Southeastern division led the sales performance, followed by Midwest division, Southwest division and Eastern division. Sales by all four Paint Store divisions increased in the third quarter compared to last year.
Segment profit for the group decreased $5.1 million or 2.2% to $225.1 million in the quarter. And higher year-over-year raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses more than offset selling price increases. 
Operating margin decreased to 17.5% from 18.9% in the third quarter last year. 
During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 12 new stores and closed four redundant stores.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Sales in the third quarter increased 3% to $340.4 million, reflecting moderately higher demand in some of the segment's retail, industrial and institutional customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.2 million or 5.7% in the quarter to $59.7 million, due primarily to good expense control and savings from manufacturing site rationalization completed the previous year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.5% from 17.1% in the same period last year.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 22.6% to $544.5 million in the quarter, due primarily to acquisitions, higher paint sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, acquisitions increased Global Finishes Group net sales in U.S. dollars by 15.1%, and favorable currency translation rate changes increased sales in U.S. dollars by 2.5%. 
Third quarter segment profit increased $2.3 million or 7.6% to $31.9 million. Higher paint sales volumes, favorable currency rate changes and good expense control were mostly offset by higher raw material costs and the negative effect of acquisitions. Currency rate changes increased segment profit by $1.4 million, while acquisitions reduced segment profit by $2.8 million. 
Global Finishes Group opened or acquired 20 new branches and closed two branches in the third quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Our total debt on September 30, 2010, was $1.066 billion compared to $711 million in the third quarter 2009. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $64.9 million compared to $32.8 million at the end of third quarter last year. 
Total borrowings to capitalization were 39.4% at the end of the quarter versus 29.5% at the end of the third quarter 2009. Short-term borrowings decreased $57 million to $354.6 million compared to third quarter last year. And long-term debt to capitalization was 26.3% at the end of the third quarter this year compared to 12.4% last year.
In the third quarter this year, we spent $28.7 million on capital expenditures. Depreciation expense was $34.5 million, and amortization was $8.6 million. Full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 million to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $140 million, and amortization will be about $35 million. 
That concludes my review of our results for third quarter 2010. So I will turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?"

From a demand perspective, the third quarter actually started to feel a little bit more normal to us. And we posted solid revenue and volume growth in the quarter, including a 5% comp store sales gain, even though many segments of our end markets continue to struggle. What did not feel normal is the fact that we failed to generate earnings leverage on this revenue growth. 
Our sales in the third quarter came in about as we had expected. When you back out revenue from the Becker Acroma acquisition, which was completed during the quarter but not included in our guidance, our sales increased 7.3% which was in the dead center of our range of mid- to high-single digits. A little more than half of this sales improvement was from increased volume, the balance coming from a combination of price and favorable mix for the company.
Earnings per share for the quarter, also adjusted for the Becker Acroma acquisition, finished in the middle of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.70. We knew going into the quarter that earnings improvement would be challenging, even with the solid sales increase and we guided accordingly. Three key factors contributed to our cautious outlook: continued raw material cost pressure, higher SG&A expense and dilution from acquisitions. And let me comment briefly on each of these three issues a little further. 
First, the persistently higher raw material costs we experienced during the first half did not abate in the third quarter. And some commodities, such as titanium dioxide are still rising. We are also continuing to experience higher operating cost result from material supply shortages. Many of the extraordinary actions we've taken during the year to ensure uninterrupted supply of raw materials to our plants and finished goods to our stores continued to impact our P&L. Despite our efforts to help offset these higher input costs, including multiple price increases announced during the year, the normal lag between raw material cost inflation and higher effective pricing has pressured our gross margin in the second and third quarters and most likely will again in the fourth. Implementation of our price increases is progressing as expected, and we remain confident that we will ultimately close the gap on these input costs.
Second, in addition to the impact of lower gross margin in the quarter, operating income was also impacted by higher SG&A expense. And this higher    spending level is also likely to continue for the balance of the year. SG&A expense was up almost $50 million, completed September 1, were dilutive to earnings in the third quarter and again will be for the balance for the year. Although we knew this when we closed these deals, this dilution was not included in our initial earnings guidance provided in January, nor was the Becker acquisition included in our first quarter or second quarter updates to guidance given in July due to the unknown timing of the closing of these acquisitions.
Moving on to some other areas of focus for the company. We continued to manage working capital efficiently and generated significant net operating cash in the quarter. In the first nine months of 2010, we generated $478 million in net operating cash. Working capital for the nine months increased $140 million as the result of higher accounts receivable and inventory to support our sales increase. Working capital as a percent of sales increased to 13.4% from 12.5% last year. Acquisitions added 130 basis points to working capital as a percent of sales.
Our free cash flow, net operating cash less CapEx and dividend, came in at $284 million. We continue to invest the company's cash to expand our controlled distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions and purchase shares of our stock for treasury. 
Year-to-date, our Paint Stores Group has opened 25 new store locations and consolidated 11 redundant locations. We finished the quarter with 3,368 stores in operation compared to 3,344 this time last year. For the full year, we still expect to open 40 to 50 stores and slow the pace of store closings.
On October 1, we completed the acquisition of Pinturas Cóndor, the leading paint and coatings company in Ecuador. The company develops and manufactures products for the architectural, industrial and automotive vehicle refinish markets and sells them through a combination of company-owned paint stores, as well as exclusive dealers in more than 1,800 independent dealers in the country. Sales in 2009 were approximately USD $51 million. 
During the quarter, we also used the company's cash to buy back 1.13 million shares of our common stock on the open market at an average price of $59.39. This brings our year-to-date total to 3.48 million shares. On September 30, we have remaining board authorization to purchase 7.3 million shares.
While it appears the architectural repaint markets in the Americas and global demand for most investor coatings have stabilized or even rebounded somewhat, raw materials remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Our outlook for the fourth quarter 2010 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the midteens percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter due primarily to acquisitions. We expect fourth quarter diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.69 per share compared to $0.58 per share in 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the high single-digit percentage range compared to last year. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our July 22 of 2010 full year guidance for diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.22 per share compared to $3.78 per share earned in 2009. 
As a reminder, our full year guidance includes an $0.08 per share charge for higher interest expense in the second quarter, a $0.10 per share charge taken in the first quarter related to the healthcare legislation and $0.07 dilution from two acquisitions completed during the year. Finally, last week, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, keeping us on track to achieve our 32nd consecutive year of increased dividends. 
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now the management team would be happy to take your questions."

For the first half of the year, most of the inflation we saw on the material basket was acrylic monomers and acrylic latex. And although the supply situation is getting better in the acrylic chain, we're not seeing much relief on the price side yet in acrylics. At the same time, as Chris mentioned, titanium dioxide is starting to heat up. We're seeing pressure on TiO2. The pressure for this year is embedded in our outlook for the full year for the raw material basket to be up in the high single digits. Year-to-date, it's probably mid to high, with the highest level of inflation being in the fourth quarter. For next year, we're seeing analyst outlooks across a pretty broad range, with the high probably being in the 40% to 50% inflation range. Most analysts put titanium inflation for 2011 in the range of 20% to 30%, and we think that, that feels about right based on the tightness in the supply right now."

We're not going to have any problems with our covenants. We looked at our covenants, and I know other companies are taking a look at this and saying that this trigger a covenant issue for them with the banks. We don't have that. The real question will be how much we're to have, on an ongoing basis, change the fair market value of those leases. And that'll be pretty interesting, because we have 20 years control. With the change of interest rate, we might have that going in and out. And unfortunately, I think it really doesn't change the aspect of our company or so forth. We're going to see more volatility on our balance sheet because of this size of asset being changing on an ongoing basis for fair market value. But what we're going to try to do is keep this out of our operating division so that there's still focus on selling paint, which is how we really make paint money."

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations Third Quarter press release. 
Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2010 versus third quarter '09, consolidated net sales increased $175.4 million or 8.8% to $2.172 billion due primarily to acquisitions, selling price increases, higher sales volume and favorable foreign currency translation rate changes. Favorable currency translation increased consolidated net sales 0.6% in the quarter, and acquisitions increased net sales by 3.4%. 
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $42.6 million to $971.6 million. Gross margin decreased 180 basis points to 44.7% of sales from 46.5% in the third quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher year-over-year raw material prices, which included certain spot market material purchases tied to supplier plant shutdowns.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 7.6% to $703.7 million due primarily to incremental SG&A from acquisitions, currency translation rate changes, higher service costs resulting from increased sales and higher freight and distribution costs to maintain customer service levels. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 32.4% in the third quarter this year from 32.8% last year. 
Net interest expense increased $2.8 million compared to the third quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $3.3 million or 1.3% to $255.4 million. Profit before tax decreased as a percent of sales to 11.8% from 13% last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 31.4% compared to 32.3% in the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to increase slightly to 32% compared to last year's rate of approximately 30%.
Consolidated net income was essentially flat at $175.3 million compared to $175.2 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net income as a percent of sales declined to 8.1% from 8.8% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased $0.09 or 6% to $1.60 per share from $1.51 per share in 2009. Acquisitions reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.02 per share in the quarter, which was partially offset by favorable currency fluctuation rate changes, which increased diluted net income per common share by $0.01 per share.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter increased 5.4% to $1.286 billion. Improving architectural paint sales to residential repaint contractors and DIY [do-it-yourself] customers and selling price increases more than offset continued weakness in new residential and commercial markets. 
Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.1% in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year. Regionally, in the third quarter 2010, our Southeastern division led the sales performance, followed by Midwest division, Southwest division and Eastern division. Sales by all four Paint Store divisions increased in the third quarter compared to last year.
Segment profit for the group decreased $5.1 million or 2.2% to $225.1 million in the quarter. And higher year-over-year raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses more than offset selling price increases. 
Operating margin decreased to 17.5% from 18.9% in the third quarter last year. 
During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 12 new stores and closed four redundant stores.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Sales in the third quarter increased 3% to $340.4 million, reflecting moderately higher demand in some of the segment's retail, industrial and institutional customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.2 million or 5.7% in the quarter to $59.7 million, due primarily to good expense control and savings from manufacturing site rationalization completed the previous year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.5% from 17.1% in the same period last year.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 22.6% to $544.5 million in the quarter, due primarily to acquisitions, higher paint sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, acquisitions increased Global Finishes Group net sales in U.S. dollars by 15.1%, and favorable currency translation rate changes increased sales in U.S. dollars by 2.5%. 
Third quarter segment profit increased $2.3 million or 7.6% to $31.9 million. Higher paint sales volumes, favorable currency rate changes and good expense control were mostly offset by higher raw material costs and the negative effect of acquisitions. Currency rate changes increased segment profit by $1.4 million, while acquisitions reduced segment profit by $2.8 million. 
Global Finishes Group opened or acquired 20 new branches and closed two branches in the third quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Our total debt on September 30, 2010, was $1.066 billion compared to $711 million in the third quarter 2009. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $64.9 million compared to $32.8 million at the end of third quarter last year. 
Total borrowings to capitalization were 39.4% at the end of the quarter versus 29.5% at the end of the third quarter 2009. Short-term borrowings decreased $57 million to $354.6 million compared to third quarter last year. And long-term debt to capitalization was 26.3% at the end of the third quarter this year compared to 12.4% last year.
In the third quarter this year, we spent $28.7 million on capital expenditures. Depreciation expense was $34.5 million and amortization was $8.6 million. For full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $100 million to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $140 million and amortization will be about $35 million. 
That concludes my review of our results for third quarter 2010. So I will turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?"

From a demand perspective, the third quarter actually started to feel a little bit more normal to us. We posted solid revenue and volume growth in the quarter, including a 5% comp store sales gain, even though many segments of our end markets continue to struggle. What did not feel normal is the fact that we failed to generate earnings leverage on this revenue growth. 
Our sales in the third quarter came in about as we had expected. When you back out revenue from the Becker Acroma acquisition, which was completed during the quarter but not included in our guidance, our sales increased 7.3% which was in the dead center of our range of mid- to high-single digits. A little more than half of this sales improvement was from increased volume, the balance coming from a combination of price and favorable mix for the company.
Earnings per share for the quarter, also adjusted for the Becker Acroma acquisition, finished in the middle of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.70. We knew going into the quarter that earnings improvement would be challenging, even with the solid sales increase and we guided accordingly. Three key factors contributed to our cautious outlook: continued raw material cost pressure, higher SG&A expense and dilution from acquisitions. And let me comment briefly on each of these three issues a little further. 
First, the persistently higher raw material costs we experienced during the first half did not abate in the third quarter. And some commodities, such as titanium dioxide are still rising. We are also continuing to experience higher operating cost result from raw material supply shortages. Many of the extraordinary actions we've taken during the year to ensure uninterrupted supply of raw materials to our plants and finished goods to our stores continue to impact our P&L. Despite our efforts to help offset these higher input costs, including multiple price increases announced during the year, the normal lag between raw material cost inflation and higher effective pricing has pressured our gross margin in the second and third quarters and most likely will again in the fourth. Implementation of our price increases is progressing as expected, and we remain confident that we will ultimately close the gap on these input costs.
Second, in addition to the impact of lower gross margin in the quarter, operating income was also impacted by higher SG&A expense, and this higher    spending level is also likely to continue for the balance of the year. SG&A expense was up almost $50 million in the third quarter after rising just over $42 million in the first half.  As a percent of sales, SG&A was down 90 basis points for the first half and down 40 basis points in the third quarter.  Slightly less than half of the SG&A increase in the quarter can be attributed to acquisitions and currency exchange. The balance is from higher service costs and incremental freight and handling to ensure product availability and good customer service.  All of these factors will continue to weigh on SG&A expense in the fourth quarter.  And  finally in the impacts of some of these issues, the acquisition of Sayerlack completed on April 1 and Becker Acroma completed September 1 were diluted to earnings in the third quarter and again will be for the balance for the year. Although we knew this when we closed these deals, this dilution was not included in our initial earnings guidance provided in January, nor was the Becker acquisition included in our first quarter or second quarter updates to guidance given in April and July due to the unknown timing of the closing of these acquisitions.
Moving on to some other areas of focus for the company. We continue to manage working capital efficiently and generated significant net operating cash in the quarter. In the first nine months of 2010, we generated $478 million in net operating cash. Working capital for the nine months increased $140 million as the result of higher accounts receivable and inventory to support our sales increase. Working capital as a percent of sales increased to 13.4% from 12.5% last year. Acquisitions added 130 basis points to working capital as a percent of sales.
Our free cash flow, net operating cash less CapEx and dividend, came in at $284 million. We continue to invest the company's cash to expand our controlled distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions and purchase shares of our stock for treasury. 
Year-to-date, our Paint Stores Group has opened 25 new store locations and consolidated 11 redundant locations. We finished the quarter with 3,368 stores in operation compared to 3,344 this time last year. For the full year, we still expect to open 40 to 50 stores and slow the pace of store closings.
On October 1, we completed the acquisition of Pinturas Cóndor, the leading paint and coatings company in Ecuador. The company develops and manufactures products for the architectural, industrial and automotive vehicle refinish markets and sells them through a combination of company-owned paint stores, as well as exclusive dealers in more than 1,800 independent dealers in the country. Sales in 2009 were approximately USD $51 million. 
During the quarter, we also used the company's cash to buy back 1.13 million shares of our common stock on the open market at an average price of $59.39. This brings our year-to-date total to 3.48 million shares. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to purchase 7.3 million shares.
While it appears the architectural repaint markets in the Americas and global demand for most investor coatings have stabilized or even rebounded somewhat, raw materials remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Our outlook for the fourth quarter 2010 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the midteens percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter due primarily to acquisitions. We expect fourth quarter diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.69 per share compared to $0.58 per share in 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the high single-digit percentage range compared to last year. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our July 22 of 2010 full year guidance for diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.22 per share compared to $3.78 per share earned in 2009. 
As a reminder, our full year guidance includes an $0.08 per share charge for higher interest expense in the second quarter, a $0.10 per share charge taken in the first quarter related to the healthcare legislation and $0.07 dilution from two acquisitions completed during the year. Finally, last week, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, keeping us on track to achieve our 32nd consecutive year of increased dividends.

And then maybe you could also talk about what's going on with some of the other raw materials, whether some of the pressure from the first half of the year is abating, or if you're seeing continued pressure there."

For the first half of the year, most of the inflation we saw on the material basket was acrylic monomers and acrylic latex. And although the supply situation is getting better in the acrylic chain, we're not seeing much relief on the price side yet in acrylics. At the same time, as Chris mentioned, titanium dioxide is starting to heat up. We're seeing pressure on TiO2. The pressure for this year is embedded in our outlook for the full year for the raw material basket to be up in the high single digits. Year-to-date, it's probably mid to high, with the highest level of inflation being in the fourth quarter. For next year, we're seeing analyst outlooks across a pretty broad range, with the high probably being in the 40% to 50% inflation range. Most analysts put titanium inflation for 2011 in the range of 20% to 30%, and we think that, that feels about right based on the tightness in the supply right now."

Most of the lift that we're seeing this year, we've commented, come from the residential repaint market. And the commercial repaint market has actually been one of those areas that we're seeing stress in. Two numbers that you can look at to help support that would be the vacancy rate at both retail and office, big users of residential repaint products and contractors time, and both of these numbers are running at pretty high rates historically. So much like we needed to get this kind of glut of housing through the residential side to start to see some lift there, we need to see occupancy rates for overbuilt retail space rebound as well as in office. To that end, very little, if any, new commercial construction activity happening in the United States this year in those spaces. We think this is the first time in about four years that there hasn't been a major retail complex under construction somewhere in the United States. So we're going to have to wait a while before that glut goes through. And our guidance for this year was that commercial repaint would be a soft segment for the company, and it's certainly proven to be the case."

We're not going to have any problems with our covenants. We looked at our covenants, and I know other companies are taking a look at this and saying does this trigger a covenant issue for them with the banks. We don't have that. The real question will be how much we're going to have, on an ongoing basis, change the fair market value of those leases. And that'll be pretty interesting because we have like 20 years control. With the change of interest rate, we might have that going in and out. And unfortunately, I think it really doesn't change the aspect of our company or so forth. We're going to see more volatility on our balance sheet because of this size asset being changing on an ongoing basis for fair market value.

In order to allow more time for questions we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relation's third quarter press release. Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2010 versus third quarter '09, consolidated net sales increased $175.4 million or 8.8% to $2.172 billion due primarily to acquisitions, selling price increases, higher sales volume and favorable foreign currency translation rate changes. Favorable currency translation increased consolidated net sales 0.6% in the quarter and acquisitions increased net sales by 3.4%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $42.6 million to $971.6 million.
Gross margin decreased 180 basis points to 44.7% of sales from 46.5% in the third quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher year-over-year raw material prices which included certain spot market material purchases tied to supplier plant shut down. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 7.6% to $703.7 million due primarily to incremental SG&A from acquisitions, currency translation rate changes, higher service costs resulting from increased sale and higher freight and distribution costs to maintain customer service levels.
As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 32.4% in the third quarter this year from 32.8% last year. Net interest expense increased $2.8 million compared to the third quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $3.3 million or 1.3% to $255.4 million. Profit before tax decreased as a percent of sales to 11.8% from 13% last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 31.4% compared to 32.3% in the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to increase slightly to 32% compared to last year's rate of approximately 30%.
Consolidated net income was essentially flat at $175.3 million compared to $175.2 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net income as a percent of sales declined to 8.1% from 8.8% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased $0.09 or 6% to $1.60 per share from a $1.51 per share in 2009. Acquisitions reduced diluted net income for common share by $0.02 per share in the quarter which was partially offset by favorable currency fluctuation rate changes which increased diluted net income for common share by $0.01 per share.
Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter increased 5.4% to $1.286 billion. Improving architectural paint sales to residential repaint contractors and DIY customers and selling price increases more than offset continued weakness in new residential and commercial markets. 
Comparable store sales that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 5.1% in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year. Regionally in the third quarter 2010, our south eastern division led the sales performance followed by mid west division, south west division and eastern division. 
Sales by all four paint store divisions increased in the third quarter compared to last year. Segment profits for the group decreased $5.1 million or 2.2% to $225.1 million in the quarter, as higher year-over-year raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses more that offset selling price increases. 
Operating margin decreased to 17.5% from 18.9% in the third quarter last year. During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 12 new stores and closed four redundant stores. 
Turning to the consumer group, sales in the third quarter increased 3% to $340.4 million reflecting moderately higher demand at some of the segments retail, industrial and institutional customers. Segment profit for the consumer group increased $3.2 million or 5.7% in the quarter to $59.7 million due primarily to good expense control and savings from manufacturing site rationalization completed the previous year that was partially offset by raw material cost increases. 
Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.5% from 17.1% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in US dollars increase 22.6% to $544.5 million in the quarter to due primarily to acquisitions, higher paint sales volume in favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, acquisitions increased Global Finishes Group net sales in US dollars by 15.1% and favorable currency translation rate changes increased sales in US dollars by 2.5%. 
Third quarter segment profit increased $2.3 million or 7.6% to $31.9 million. Higher paid sales volumes, favorable currency rate changes and good expense control were mostly offset by higher raw material costs and the negative affect of acquisitions. Currency rate changes increased segment profits by $1.4 million while acquisitions reduced segment profit by $2.8 million. Global Finishes Group opened or acquired 20 new branches and closed two branches in the third quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet, our total debt on September 30, 2010 was $1.066 billion compared to $711 million in the third quarter 2009. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $64.9 million compared to 32.8 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Total borrowings to capitalization were 39.4% at the end of the quarter versus 29.5% at the end of the third quarter 2009.
Short term borrowings decreased to $57 million to $354.6 million compared to third quarter last year. And the long-term debt to capitalization was 26.3% at the end of the third quarter this year compared to 12.4% last year. 
In the third quarter of this year, we spent $28.7 million on the capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $34.5 million and amortization was $8.6 million. For full year of 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately 100 million to $115 million, depreciation will be about a $140 million and amortization will be about $35 million.
That concludes my review of our results for third quarter 2010. So I will turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlights, our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris.

You know from the demand perspective the third quarter actually started to feel a little bit more normal to us. We posted solid revenue and volume growth in the quarter, including a 5% in comp store sales gain, even though many segments of our end markets continue to struggle. We did not feel normal to the fact that we failed to general earnings leverage on this revenue growth.
Our sales in the third quarter came in about as we had expected, when you back out revenue from the Becker Acroma acquisition which was completed during the quarter, but not included in our guidance. Our sales increased 7.3%, which was in the debt center of our range of mid to high single digits. A little more than half of this sales improvement was from increased volume, the balance coming from a combination of price in favorable mix for the company. 
Earnings per share for the quarter also adjusted for the Becker Acroma acquisition finished in the middle of our guidance range of a $1.55 to $1.70. When you are going into the quarter the earnings improvement would be challenging even with the solid sales increase and we guided accordingly. Three key factors contributed to our cautious outlook, continued raw material cost pressure, higher SG&A expense and dilution from acquisitions. So let me kind of brief on each of these three issues a little further. First, the persistently higher raw material cost we experienced during the first-half, did not update in the third quarter and some commodities such as titanium back side are still rising.
We are also continuing to experience higher operating cost results from raw material supply shortages. Many of the extraordinary actions we’ve taken during the year to ensure uninterrupted supply of raw materials to our plans and finished goods to our stores continue to impact our P&L. Despite our efforts to help offset these higher input costs including multiple price increases announced during the year. The normal lag between raw material cost inflation and higher effective pricing has pressured our gross margin in the second and third quarters and most likely will again in the fourth.
Implementation of our price increases is progressing as expected, and we remain confident that we will ultimately close the gap on these input costs. Second, in addition to the impact of lower gross margin in the quarter, operating income was also impacted by higher SG&A expense, and this higher spending level is also likely to continue for the balance of the year.
SG&A expense was up almost $50 million in the third quarter after rising just over $42 million in the first-half. As a percent of sales SG&A was down 90 basis points for the first-half and down 40 basis points in the third quarter, slightly less than half of the SG&A increase in the quarter can be attributed to acquisitions and currency exchange. The balance is from higher service cost and incremental freight and handling to ensure product availability and good customer service. All of these factors will continue to weigh on SG&A expense in the fourth quarter. 
And finally in the impact of some of these issues the acquisition of Sayerlack completed on April 1st and Becker Acroma completed September 1st, were diluted to the earnings in the third quarter and again will be for the balance of the year.
Although we knew this when we closed these deal this delusion was not included in our initial earnings guidance provided in January nor with the Becker acquisition included in our first quarter or second quarter updates to guidance given in April and July due to the unknown timing of the closing of these acquisitions. Moving on to some other areas of focus for the company, we continue to manage working capital officially and generated significant net operating cash in the quarter.
In the first nine months of 2010, we generated $478 million in net operating cash. Working capital for the nine months increased $149 as a result of higher accounts receivable and inventory to support our sales increase. Working capital as a percent of sales increase to 13.4% from 12.5% last year. Acquisitions added a 130 basis points for working capital as a percent of sales. 
Our free cash flow net operating cash less CapEx and dividend came in at 284 million. We continue to invest the company’s cash to expand our control distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions and purchase shares of our stock for treasury. Year-to-date our paid service group has opened 25 new store locations and consolidated 11 re-done in locations. We finished the quarter with 3368 stores in operation compared to 3344 this time last year. 
For the full year, we still expect to open 40 to 50 stores and slow the pace or start closing.
On October 1, we completed the acquisition of Pinturas Condor, the leading paint and coatings company in Ecuador. The company develops and manufactures products to the architectural, industrial and automotive vehicle refinish markets and sell them to a combination of company owned paint stores as well as exclusive dealers in more than 1800 independent dealers in the country.
Sales in 2009 were approximately $61 million US. During the quarter, we also used the company’s cash to buy back 1.13 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $69.39. This brings our year-to-date total of 3.48 million shares. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to purchase 7.3 million shares.
While it appears the architectural repaint market in the Americas and global demand for most investor coatings have stabilized or even rebounded somewhat. Raw materials remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Our outlook for the fourth quarter in 2010 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-teens percentages, compared to the last year’s fourth quarter due primarily to acquisitions. We expect fourth quarter diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.69 per share, compared to $0.58 per share in 2009.
For the full year 2010, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the high single digit percentage range, compared to last year. For the annual sales at that level, we are updating our July 22, 2010 full year guidance for diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.22 per share, compared to $3.78 per share earned in 2009. As a reminder our full year guidance includes an $0.08 per share charge for higher interest expense in the second quarter, a $0.10 per share charge taken in the first quarter related to the healthcare legislation and $0.07 dilution from two acquisitions completed during the year.
Finally, last week our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share keeping us on track to achieve a 32 consecutive year of increase dividends. 
Again I’d like to thank you for joining us this morning and now the management team will be happy to take your questions.

And although those the supply situation is getting better in the acrylic chain, we're not seeing much relief on the price side yet in acrylics. At the same time as Chris mentioned, titanium dioxide is to heat up. We're seeing pressure on TiO2. The pressure for this year is embedded in our outlook for the full year for the raw material basket to be up in the high single digit. Year-to-date its probably mid-to-high with the highest level of inflation being in the fourth quarter. For next year we're seeing analyst outlooks that across the pretty broad range with the high probably being in the 40 to 50% inflation range, most analysts put titanium inflation for 2011 in the range of 20 to 30% and we think that feels about right based on the tightness in the supply right now

And I think we have talked about that it was lower than dollar-for-dollar for sales for that reason. But when we think about next year number one, the first thing its going to cause accretion is not going to get to closing cost and number two we think that some of the steps that we are going to take are managing this businesses will be higher than what they were earning in prior year. So I think you can see they you are in the depending in the third quarter and $0.02 for the first nine months. We expect to have more than that in a run rate maybe not because of just the beginning of the change that we are making but by 2012 we’ll start to see more, but I think we’ll have more than what they have earned in 2009.

What’s going to happen, when a lot of times people will ask us about our leverage, we always talk about our debt to EBITDA being right around one but really 1.7 if you think about net present value of those leases.
So, we’ve always continued to freely point that out. What you are going to see is, our leverage is going to grow to about 1.7, because what we have to do is put that asset on our books and we are going to have to put the debt on the books. We are not going to have any pounds with our covenants. We looked on our covenants and I know other companies are taking a look at this and say that this trigger covenant issue form with the banks, we don’t have that.
The real question will be how much we are going to have to on an ongoing basis change the fair market value of those leases and that will be pretty interesting because we got with 20 years control with the change of interest rate, we might have that going in and out and unfortunately I figured really it doesn’t change the aspect of our company or so forth. We got to see more volatility on our balance sheet, because of this sized asset being changing on an ongoing basis for fair amount of value, but what we are again trying to do is to keep this out of our operating division so that they are so focused on selling paint which is how we really make paint money.
