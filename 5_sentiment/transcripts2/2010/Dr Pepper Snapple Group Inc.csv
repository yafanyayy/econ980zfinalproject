It was great to see a lot of you at CAGNY [Consumer Analyst Group of New York] last week, we certainly covered a lot of material there. So beyond our Q4 results, the majority of our comments will focus on our outlook 2010. I'm sure many of you have questions regarding what impact the acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises North America may or may not have for our business. This potential transaction is yet another great example of the strategic importance and growth potential of the North American beverage market. As I've said before, our guiding principle is to always do what's best for our brands, our customers, our consumers and ultimately you, our stockholders. As I'm sure you'll appreciate discussions with customers or potential customers are something best handled in private. Therefore, it would be premature and certainly inappropriate for us to comment on this transaction for the time being. We'll come back to you with more news when we have something to share.Now turning to our fourth quarter and full year results. Despite a tough economy, I'm proud of our accomplishments in our first full year as a stand-alone company. We executed against our focused strategy and as a result, we've delivered solid results. We've expanded consumption and availability of our products with wins in key Fountain accounts like McDonald's and Jack-in-the-Box. And we exceeded our year one cold drink equipment program goals with placements of almost 36,000 incremental coolers including wins in Dollar General, Hess and Wal-Mart. Leveraging our broad and flexible route to markets, we teamed up with the Pepsi bottlers to significantly expand cross-distribution across the U.S. Flawless execution catapulted this brand to the number two position in fruit-flavored CSD [carbonated soft drink] space. Additionally, we were very happy with the license agreement we reached with PepsiCo pending their acquisition of the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas.We're the only major beverage company in North America to grow CSD and LRB [liquid refreshment beverage] volume and volume share in 2009. Our CSD share grew 1.2 points and our LRB share was up 7/10 of a point. During the year, we invested our infrastructure, our brands and our people to realize the full potential of the business. Our fifth regional center in Victorville, California is on track and on budget. The first phase of our SAP upgrades, covering our DSD business and the roll out of our handhelds are almost complete. We further engaged our employees to call-to-action workshops and by tying their incentive plans to key operational metrics. While we've made great progress and established a solid base, we still have more to do. Moving on to Q4 and full year results, the business delivered another quarter of solid results and we delivered on our full year commitments. North American beverages remained challenging and consumer spending remained weak. Pricing remains rational and we're continuing to see a bias towards promotional activity versus price off. Excluding the loss of Hansen's product distribution in the prior year, volume grew 4% for both the quarter and the full year. For the quarter, CSD volume was up 4% with Crush adding a $12 million incremental cases. Canada Dry and 7up grew high-single digits as we stepped up our marketing investments behind them. Dr Pepper declined less than 1%, driven by our Fountain business with QSR traffic down 3%. Excluding Fountain, Dr Pepper grew 3%. In non-carbs, Mott's grew 23% on strong promotional activity, as well as favorable comparisons to the prior year and the Hawaiian Punch grew 4%. Premium priced beverages were flat for the quarter, stabilizing for the first time this year. And I'm happy to report that Snapple Premium was up 3% and our value tea business more than doubled. This growth was partially offset by continued declines in our Super Premium Tea business. Net sales as adjusted were flat for the quarter and up 2% for the year. Pricing taken early in the year combined with continued strong volume trends were offset by the negative mix from higher sales of CSD concentrates and value juices. Additionally, the loss of certain contract manufacturing, higher marketplace investments and higher than expected concentrate buying ahead of our January price increase further impacted our sales for the quarter. Segment operating profit as adjusted, grew 6% in the quarter and 17% for the year. We continue to benefit from favorability in packaging, ingredients and transportation cost. At the same time, we stepped up the level of marketing and productivity office investments in the quarter to drive long-term brand health and continuous improvement. As a brand owner, we know when tough economic times like these, increasing the relevance and awareness of our brands and investing in the business are critical to fuel our long-term success. Our 2009 marketing investments were up over $50 million, with the majority of this spent in the fourth quarter. In fact, GRP growth almost tripled as we increased our ads for 7UP, Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Snapple. Targeted cost of programming for Dr Pepper drove per capita consumption increases in 80% of the markets and a one liter rack program for Canada Dry drove strong volume performance in the quarter. As I've said before, the productivity, obviously, is all about a lot of small projects. For example, in Q4, we invested in building revenue and margin management capabilities, we consolidated legal entities to enable better tax planning, we outsourced certain IT applications and hardware support and we continue to tweak the organization to improve customer alignment. Our 2010 priorities are simple and clearly aligned with our focused strategy. We'll continue to grow per capita consumption, while expanding distribution and availability through targeted coastal and Hispanic programming and feet-on-the-street initiatives. Our new manufacturing facility in Victorville, California adds much needed juice and mixer capacity to fuel our West Coast expansion. We'll increase our single-serve mix through wins in Fountain, including the rollout of Dr Pepper in all McDonald's. We're in the second year of a five-year cold drink equipment program and we expect to place another 35,000 incremental units. Infrastructure investments will include the completion of our SAP upgrade and handheld rollouts in DSD [direct-to-store delivery], the startup of our new Victorville facility, the second phase of our SAP upgrades in warehouse direct and Mexico businesses, as well as expansion of our Midwest regional center. We'll continue to build our bench strength, instill a set of behaviors that are truly DPS, leveraging an online training program designed to develop leaders as coaches. We'll continue to invest in the marketplace to increase the relevance and awareness of our brands. Our 2010 innovation pipeline is strong and builds on our 2009 successes. Our focus on fun, functionality and flavor will ensure our products meet changing consumer needs. The licensing of certain brands to PepsiCo is expected to be completed by the end of February. As we announced this morning, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock. As we achieve our target capital structure, our focus will shift from debt reduction to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to John to walk you through some of our below the line items and our 2010 guidance."

Before I cover fourth quarter items and 2010 guidance, I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate our entire organization for all their hard work as we achieved full SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley] compliance in our",1274,"Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I cover fourth quarter items and 2010 guidance, I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate our entire organization for all their hard work as we achieved full SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley] compliance in our first full year as a public company. For the quarter, we invested $11 million in productivity office initiatives, bringing the full year to $29 million. We expect these investments will drive over $80 million of cumulative savings over the next five years. We recognized commodity-related mark-to-market gains of $6 million in the quarter, bringing the full year gains to $18 million.In December, we took advantage of very attractive market conditions to refinance a portion of our debt and raise $850 million, consisting of $400 million of 1.7% senior notes due in 2011 and $450 million of 2.35% senior notes due in 2012. Proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down our floating rate term loan and that resulted in us accelerating the recognition of deferred financing cost of $30 million in Q4. As you think about the unusual items in the quarter, the accelerated expensing of deferred financing costs was essentially offset by higher-than-expected concentrate buy-in ahead of the January 2010 price increase, as well as a 30.5% tax rate compared to the 38% we guided to in our third quarter call.Our fourth quarter tax rate primarily reflected favorable deferred tax items. Full year cash provided by operating activities was $865 million. Cash flow growth was driven by net income gains, distribution agreement termination payments and the absence of separation-related items. Net capital spending of $312 million reflects continued strong investment in our supply chain and IT infrastructure, as well as cold drink assets. At the end of the year, our debt obligations totaled $2.955 billion, down $550 million from our beginning of the year balance. As Larry mentioned earlier, we continue to operate in a fairly challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our portfolio of leading brands is well-positioned to capture the continued shift to flavored CSDs and the potential recovery in premium priced beverages towards the end of 2010. In line with our long-term algorithm, we expect net sales to increase 3% to 5% in 2010. There are a number of drivers here, so let me take a moment to elaborate.  We expect continued positive flavored CSD trends, expansion of Fountain, Snapple's turnaround and the recovery in our premium-priced beverages to drive volume growth in both our CSD and non-carb portfolio. This growth will be partially offset by the planned loss of certain contract manufacturing and unfavorable comparisons related to the concentrate buy-in ahead of the January price increase.We also expect that the repatriation of certain brands from Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas following their acquisition by PepsiCo will result in a shift of volume between segments. Let me remind you of the mechanics of this brand repatriation.  Today, our Beverage Concentrates segment sells concentrate to PBG and PAS. As we bring the brands back in-house, we will see selling the associated concentrate and begin manufacturing and distributing finished product in our Packaged Beverages segment. This results in a shift of volume and concentrate profit, as well as the incremental distribution margin made by our DSD system.We continue to see a rational pricing environment. This, combined with low-single digit concentrate price increases taken January 1, as well as the mix benefits from continued single-serve expansion and a late second-half recovery in premium-priced beverages, will result in low-single digit price mix growth. Additionally, net sales will also benefit from the one-time cash payment of $900 million that we expect to receive from PepsiCo. This will be deferred and recorded as net sales in our beverage concentrates segment and will be recognized over 25 years. There is no cost associated with this revenue stream, so it flows right through the P&L. For the year, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the $2.27 to $2.35 range. This reflects healthy top line growth, continued strong management in the middle of the P&L and continued investments in our brands to support the long-term health of the business. To the extent that our portfolio over-delivers, we would expect to make further investments in our brands similar to 2009. Below the line, we're now seeing significant leverage in interest expense. Rapid debt reduction in 2009 and 2010 combined with the highly opportunistic bond deal we did this past December, results in an all-in interest expense of approximately 5%. Additionally, our average debt balance is $500 million lower year-over-year. Our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%, which includes $50 million related to items indemnified formerly by Cadbury and now by Kraft. This is much more in line with our ongoing tax rate and reflects the absence of favorable deferred tax items and foreign tax credits that we recorded in 2009. In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to expect net spending in the 5% of net sales range as we complete Victorville, enter year two of our five-year cold drink expansion strategy, upgrade our warehouse in Mexico businesses to SAP 6.0 and continue to invest in supply chain optimization initiatives. As we announced in this morning's earnings press release, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. While we have no plans to set a specific repurchase level for 2010, we do expect to commence repurchasing shares as soon as we hit our target capital structure. As you know, we had significant packaging and ingredients favorability in 2009. Based on the cover we have taken to date and at today's prices, we expect packaging and ingredients to increase total COGS between 1% and 2% on a constant product mix basis. This is slightly worse than the 1% we had indicated on our third quarter earnings call as we have seen further cost pressure in apples, juice concentrates and other packaging items. As a basket, aluminum favorability is more than offset by PET apples, juice concentrates and other ingredient inflation.As we indicated, we have a number of items that are embedded in our full year guidance that in some cases, also have an impact on our phasing. Consumer trends continued to be weak. However, we believe that we will start to see a recovery in the third trimester of 2010. Our 2009 productivity office initiatives were second half weighted. This should be more balanced in 2010 and we should also see around $15 million of productivity savings over the year. Victorville start up expenses will be first half weighted, while transportation savings will ramp up in the second half. Depreciation on the facility has now started and is expected to grow slightly as new lines come on stream. 2010 is the third and final year of our stock-based compensation cost step up. These costs are expected to increase $12 million, bringing our ongoing annual expense to around $31 million. Based on current spot prices, foreign currency adds about 50 basis points to net sales growth and around $0.03 to EPS. Most of this benefit is expected to occur in the first half of the year. Finally, as a reminder we recorded $18 million of commodity-related mark-to-market gains in 2009, mainly second quarter and fourth quarter. While we continue to add to our hedges, we have the potential to have commodity-related mark-to-market losses in 2010, clearly a number of items that are impacting our growth rates over the year. But I would say, in summary, that we expect to see a much stronger second half compared to the first half. And with that, let me turn the call back to Larry."

We've expanded consumption and availability of our products with wins in key Fountain accounts like McDonald's and Jack-in-the-Box. And we exceeded our year one cold drink equipment program goals with placements of almost 36,000 incremental coolers including wins in Dollar General, Hess and Wal-Mart. Leveraging our broad and flexible route to markets, we teamed up with the Pepsi bottlers to significantly expand cross-distribution across the U.S. Flawless execution catapulted this brand to the number two position in fruit-flavored CSD [carbonated soft drink] space. Additionally, we were very happy with the license agreement we reached with PepsiCo pending their acquisition of the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas.We're the only major beverage company in North America to grow CSD and LRB [liquid refreshment beverage] volume and volume share in 2009. Our CSD share grew 1.2 points and our LRB share was up 7/10 of a point. During the year, we invested our infrastructure, our brands and our people to realize the full potential of the business. Our fifth regional center in Victorville, California is on track and on budget. The first phase of our SAP upgrades, covering our DSD business and the roll out of our handhelds are almost complete. We further engaged our employees through call to action workshops, and by tying their incentive plans to key operational metrics. While we've made great progress and established a solid base, we still have more to do. Moving on to Q4 and full year results, the business delivered another quarter of solid results, and we delivered on our full year commitments. North American beverages remained challenging and consumer spending remained weak. Pricing remains rational, and we're continuing to see a bias towards promotional activity versus price off. Excluding the loss of Hansen's product distribution in the prior year, volume grew 4% for both the quarter and the full year. For the quarter, CSD volume was up 4% with Crush adding a $12 million incremental cases. Canada Dry and 7UP grew high single-digits as we stepped up our marketing investments behind them. Dr Pepper declined less than 1%, driven by our Fountain business with QSR traffic down 3%. Excluding Fountain, Dr Pepper grew 3%. In non-carbs, Mott's grew 23% on strong promotional activity, as well as favorable comparisons to the prior year, and the Hawaiian Punch grew 4%. Premium priced beverages were flat for the quarter, stabilizing for the first time this year. And I'm happy to report that Snapple Premium was up 3%, and our value tea business more than doubled. This growth was partially offset by continued declines in our super premium tea business. Net sales, as adjusted, were flat for the quarter and up 2% for the year. Pricing taken early in the year, combined with continued strong volume trends were offset by the negative mix from higher sales of CSD concentrates and value juices. Additionally, the loss of certain contract manufacturing, higher marketplace investments and higher than expected concentrate buy-in ahead of our January price increase further impacted our sales for the quarter. Segment operating profit, as adjusted, grew 6% in the quarter and 17% for the year. We continue to benefit from favorability in packaging, ingredients and transportation cost. At the same time, we stepped up the level of marketing and productivity office investments in the quarter to drive long term brand health and continuous improvement. As a brand owner, we know in tough economic times like these, increasing the relevance and awareness of our brands and investing in the business are critical to fuel our long-term success. Our 2009 marketing investments were up over $50 million, with the majority of the spend in the fourth quarter. In fact, GRP growth almost tripled as we increased our ads for 7UP, Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Snapple. Targeted coastal programming for Dr Pepper drove per capita consumption increases in 80% of the markets, and a one liter rack program for Canada Dry drove strong volume performance in the quarter. As I've said before, the productivity office is all about a lot of small projects. For example, in Q4, we invested in building revenue and margin management capabilities, we consolidated legal entities to enable better tax planning, we outsourced certain IT applications and hardware support and we continue to tweak the organization to improve customer alignment. Our 2010 priorities are simple and clearly aligned with our focused strategy. We'll continue to grow per capita consumption, while expanding distribution and availability through targeted coastal and Hispanic programming and feet-on-the-street initiatives. Our new manufacturing facility in Victorville, California adds much needed juice and mixer capacity to fuel our West Coast expansion. We'll increase our single-serve mix through wins in Fountain, including the rollout of Dr Pepper in all McDonald's. We're in the second year of a five-year cold drink equipment program, and we expect to place another 35,000 incremental units. Infrastructure investments will include the completion of our SAP upgrade and handheld rollouts in DSD [direct-to-store delivery], the startup of our new Victorville facility, the second phase of our SAP upgrades in the warehouse direct and Mexico businesses, as well as expansion of our Midwest regional center. We'll continue to build our bench strength, and still a set of behaviors that are truly DPS, leveraging an online training program designed to develop leaders as coaches. We'll continue to invest in the marketplace to increase the relevance and awareness of our brands. Our 2010 innovation pipeline is strong and builds on our 2009 successes. Our focus on fun, functionality and flavor will ensure our products meet changing consumer needs. The licensing of certain brands to PepsiCo is expected to be completed by the end of February. As we announced this morning, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock. As we achieve our target capital structure, our focus will shift from debt reduction to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to walk you through some of our below the line items and our 2010 guidance."
9247431,85166665,55508,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2010",2010-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I cover fourth quarter items and 2010 guidance, I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate our entire organization for all their hard work as we achieved full SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley] compliance in our",1275,"Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I cover fourth quarter items and 2010 guidance, I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate our entire organization for all their hard work as we achieved full SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley] compliance in our first full year as a public company. For the quarter, we invested $11 million in productivity office initiatives, bringing the full year to $29 million. We expect these investments will drive over $80 million of cumulative savings over the next five years. We recognized commodity-related mark-to-market gains of $6 million in the quarter, bringing the full year gains to $18 million.In December, we took advantage of very attractive market conditions to refinance a portion of our debt and raised $850 million, consisting of $400 million of 1.7% senior notes due in 2011, and $450 million of 2.35% senior notes due in 2012. Proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down our floating rate term loan, and that resulted in us accelerating the recognition of deferred financing cost of $30 million in Q4. As you think about the unusual items in the quarter, the accelerated expensing of deferred financing costs was essentially offset by higher-than-expected concentrate buy-in ahead of the January 2010 price increase, as well as a 30.5% tax rate compared to the 38% we guided to in our third quarter call.Our fourth quarter tax rate primarily reflected favorable deferred tax items. Full year cash provided by operating activities was $865 million. Cash flow growth was driven by net income gains, distribution agreement termination payments and the absence of separation-related items. Net capital spending of $312 million reflects continued strong investment in our supply chain and IT infrastructure, as well as cold drink assets. At the end of the year, our debt obligations totaled $2.955 billion, down $550 million from our beginning of the year balance. As Larry mentioned earlier, we continue to operate in a fairly challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our portfolio of leading brands is well positioned to capture the continued shift to flavored CSDs and the potential recovery in premium-priced beverages towards the end of 2010. In line with our long-term algorithm, we expect net sales to increase 3% to 5% in 2010. There are a number of drivers here so let me take a moment to elaborate. We expect continued positive flavored CSD trends, expansion of Fountain, Snapple's turnaround and the recovery in our premium-priced beverages to drive volume growth in both our CSD and non-carb portfolio. This growth will be partially offset by the planned loss of certain contract manufacturing and unfavorable comparisons related to the concentrate buy-in ahead of the January price increase.We also expect that the repatriation of certain brands from Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas, following their acquisition by PepsiCo, will result in a shift of volume between segments. Let me remind you of the mechanics of this brand repatriation.  Today, our Beverage Concentrates segment sells concentrate to PBG and PAS. As we bring the brands back in house, we will see selling the associated concentrate and begin manufacturing and distributing finished product in our Packaged Beverages segment. This results in a shift of volume and concentrate profit, as well as the incremental distribution margin made by our DSD system.We continue to see a rational pricing environment. This, combined with low-single digit concentrate price increases taken January 1, as well as the mix benefits from continued single-serve expansion and a late second-half recovery in premium-priced beverages, will result in low-single digit price mix growth. Additionally, net sales will also benefit from the one-time cash payment of $900 million that we expect to receive from PepsiCo. This will be deferred and recorded as net sales in our beverage concentrates segment and will be recognized over 25 years. There is no cost associated with this revenue stream, so it flows right through the P&L. For the year, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the $2.27 to $2.35 range. This reflects healthy top line growth, continued strong management in the middle of the P&L and continued investments in our brands to support the long-term health of the business. To the extent that our portfolio over-delivers, we would expect to make further investments in our brands similar to 2009. Below the line, we're now seeing significant leverage in interest expense. Rapid debt reduction in 2009 and 2010 combined with the highly opportunistic bond deal we did this past December, results in an all-in interest expense of approximately 5%. Additionally, our average debt balance is $500 million lower year-over-year. Our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%, which includes $50 million related to items indemnified formerly by Cadbury and now by Kraft. This is much more in line with our ongoing tax rate and reflects the absence of favorable deferred tax items and foreign tax credits that we recorded in 2009. In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to expect net spending in the 5% of net sales range as we complete Victorville, enter year two of our five-year cold drink expansion strategy, upgrade our warehouse in Mexico businesses to SAP 6.0 and continue to invest in supply chain optimization initiatives. As we announced in this morning's earnings press release, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. While we have no plans to set a specific repurchase level for 2010, we do expect to commence repurchasing shares as soon as we hit our target capital structure. As you know, we had significant packaging and ingredients favorability in 2009. Based on the cover we have taken to date and at today's prices, we expect packaging and ingredients to increase total COGS between 1% and 2% on a constant product mix basis. This is slightly worse than the 1% we had indicated on our third quarter earnings call as we have seen further cost pressure in apples, juice concentrates and other packaging items. As a basket, aluminum favorability is more than offset by PET apples, juice concentrates and other ingredient inflation.As we indicated, we have a number of items that are embedded in our full year guidance that in some cases, also have an impact on our phasing. Consumer trends continued to be weak. However, we believe that we will start to see a recovery in the third trimester of 2010. Our 2009 productivity office initiatives were second half weighted. This should be more balanced in 2010 and we should also see around $15 million of productivity savings over the year. Victorville start up expenses will be first half weighted, while transportation savings will ramp up in the second half. Depreciation on the facility has now started and is expected to grow slightly as new lines come on stream. 2010 is the third and final year of our stock-based compensation cost step up. These costs are expected to increase $12 million, bringing our ongoing annual expense to around $31 million. Based on current spot prices, foreign currency adds about 50 basis points to net sales growth and around $0.03 to EPS. Most of this benefit is expected to occur in the first half of the year. Finally, as a reminder we recorded $18 million of commodity-related mark-to-market gains in 2009, mainly second quarter and fourth quarter. While we continue to add to our hedges, we have the potential to have commodity-related mark-to-market losses in 2010, clearly a number of items that are impacting our growth rates over the year. But I would say, in summary, that we expect to see a much stronger second half compared to the first half. And with that, let me turn the call back to Larry."

Let me start with a quick update on where we are with both the completed PepsiCo bottler transaction and the pending Coca-Cola deal. We completed the license agreement with PepsiCo on February 26, 2010. Extensive p",1424,"Thanks, Aly, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick update on where we are with both the completed PepsiCo bottler transaction and the pending Coca-Cola deal. We completed the license agreement with PepsiCo on February 26, 2010. Extensive planning on both sides resulted in a seamless transfer of DPS brands across the system, and I am thrilled to report that the brands continue to post industry-leading growth. Investments and decisions we have made had resulted in a flexible, balanced and cost-effective manufacturing and distribution footprint that gives us a solid foundation for growth. Our brands continue to gain relevance and are growing. 
With regards to the Coca-Cola transaction, when in the very early stages of the process, our guiding principles here is unchanged. Do what's best for our brands, our customers, our consumers and ultimately you, our stockholders. As I've said before, discussions of this nature are best handled in private. We'll come back to you with more news when we have something to share. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. Despite unseasonably cold weather in January and February, our business delivered another quarter of solid results with BCS [bottler case sales] volume growing 3% and dollar share up almost a full point. CSDs [carbonated soft drinks] were up 2%, led by 3% growth in Dr Pepper on the continued success of Dr Pepper Cherry and Dr Pepper Heritage in the Pepsi system. Crush was up 22%. And we continue to expand distribution and bring in new users with innovation like Cherry Crush in the U.S. and the 2.3 liter value line in Mexico. 
Canada Dry grew 10%, supported by TV advertising and targeted marketing programs. Our Fountain volume was up 2% with trends improving sequentially through the quarter. During the quarter, we installed over 5,000 incremental valves and our McDonald's rollout is on track. 
In Non-carbs, Snapple grew 17% as we continue to gain distribution in 16-ounce premium glass, 16.9 value PET and $0.79 value cans. We're seeing these gains in both measured and in particular, non-measured channels. 
Mott's grew 14% on expanded distribution and strong brand support, while Hawaiian Punch was up 7%. These results demonstrate our ability to grow shares through innovation and pull marketing campaigns, and we will continue to drive these investments. 
As we highlighted during our fourth quarter call, Q1 was our toughest quarter from a comp perspective. Sales volume lagged BCS by 600 basis points, of that amount, bottlers working to a concentrate inventory build into the first quarter of 2010 were about 200 basis points. A decline in contract manufacturing, as we continue to deemphasize the slow margin business accounted for another 200 basis points. And the unfavorable comparison related to the successful Crush launch was another 100 basis points. As a result of these factors, net sales on a currency-neutral basis were down 2% for the quarter. Our U.S. and Canada business posted solid price and mix growth, while product and channel mix in Mexico resulted in negative price and mix there. 
Segment operating profit on a currency-neutral basis declined 1% in the quarter. The business benefited from lower packaging ingredient cost, as well as a relentless focus on cost controls and productivity initiatives. Our supply chain team once again raised the bar, driving almost three points of improvement in overall equipment effectiveness. We continue to invest in our brands and in the startup of our Victorville facility. 
Our critical cold drink expansion program continues to gain momentum. And despite a challenging economic environment, we placed almost 4,500 incremental coolers and vendors. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the trends we saw in late March and through April, especially in the critical immediate consumption and fountain foodservice channels. We're also very pleased with the overall pricing environment. It remains rational and we believe this will continue. 
I am thrilled to share with you that our fifth regional center located in Victorville, California is officially open for business, on time and on budget. Victorville will also be the first of our facilities to be LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] certified. Four of our five lines are now up and running with the fifth line coming onstream within the next few weeks. The old Memphis [ph] facility marks another key milestone in the DPS journey as it enables our win the west [ph]  Strategy. Our plan to make Mott's and Hawaiian Punch the share leader in their respective categories while extending share leadership held by Mr & Mrs Ts. 
Providing cost advantage products is only part of the equation.  We're also stepping up our marketplace investments in-store, print and on air. We're targeting the Mott's moms and Hispanic moms with strong local media programs tied to retail execution as well as co-branded activities including the 7UP sponsorship of the Latin Grammy Awards. Mott's recent WIC [Women, Infants & Children] certification in California also expands the brand to more than 1.4 million new users. 
As brand owners, we know that increasing the relevance and awareness of our brands and investing incrementally are key to our long-term success. 
Our first quarter media investment was up 25% over the prior year period and contributed to strong sales growth for Snapple, Dr Pepper and Canada Dry. To continue this momentum and to support new products and retailer tie-ins, we'll spend an additional $25 million in marketing in the second quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 
With the great taste of Mott's juice, our new Mott's Medleys will help mom provide more convenient nutrition to her family with two fruit and vegetable servings in each eight-ounce portion. We're supporting this launch with new TV, print and online advertising featuring Marcia Cross. We're bringing powerful energy at the price of a CSD to Sunkist soda with the launch of Sunkist Solar Fusion, combining a delicious mandarin flavor with caffeine and B vitamins. We'll engage our target consumer with new advertising, airing June through August on shows like The Hills, Laguna Beach and MTV.  
The Mr & Mrs T's refresh is going extremely well, with volume up 10% in Q1. And in Mexico, we've launched a lightly-carbonated Snapple natural tea, targeting the health-conscious female consumer. Snapple was up almost 30% in Mexico for the quarter. 
Dr Pepper sponsorship of ACMAs on April 18 combined TV advertising with online social media, generating over $200 million impressions. And national TV advertising has already started for Dr Pepper's partnership with the biggest movie release of 2010, Iron Man 2, which premieres in the U.S. tomorrow. This integrated marketing campaign offers fans a chance to win an unrivaled collection of multimedia equipment. And building on the success of its relaunch, Snapple has embarked on its biggest ever merchandising event, joining forces with Donald Trump on one of NBC's most highly-rated shows, The Celebrity Apprentice. This fully integrated event features media, product integration, merchandising, consumer promotions and two Celebrity Apprentice-inspired products. And these are just a sample of the exciting things we're doing to engage the consumer and drive traffic for our retail customers. 
Healthcare reform and beverage tax legislation continue to be significant concerns at the national and state level. As an industry, we're coming together to help consumers understand the role of our products in their lives. While we're assessing the impact the proposed healthcare legislation may have on our business, let me take a moment to tell you how DPS is taking action to encourage an active and balanced lifestyle. 
In February, we joined with other leading beverage companies to support First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign by adopting U.S. product labeling that will list calories more prominently on containers, vending machines and fountain equipment. We've extended our partnership with the non-profit KaBOOM!. We'll turn 10 vacant lots into playgrounds in underserved communities this year. Mott's will be the lead sponsor of the Play Day program, an initiative to design and to inspire communities across the U.S. to lead local events that promote and celebrate the importance of playing. Consumers want choices, and our portfolio of diets, juices and waters drive 26% of our sales. And we continue to roll out new products like Mott's Medleys that meet consumer needs. 
And internally, we're leading by example, encouraging our employees to take action for their health through annual check-ups and other health and wellness programs. 
Now let me introduce our new CFO, Marty Ellen, to walk you through some of the below-the-line items in our 2010 guidance. Marty, I am thrilled to have you on the team."
9247431,100551164,60159,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. It's great to be on this team and back in the industry. I know many of you on this call and look forward to meeting all of you in person soon. Before I cover first quarter items as well as our 2010 guidance, I want to take a moment to share",1081,"Thanks, Larry. It's great to be on this team and back in the industry. I know many of you on this call and look forward to meeting all of you in person soon. Before I cover first quarter items as well as our 2010 guidance, I want to take a moment to share with you some of my observations during my first month here. 
First, and without a doubt, we have a terrific portfolio of powerful, well-loved brands. The teams have put together a roadmap that is robust and ensures that we exploit the full potential of this business. I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe this potential was achievable. 
Second, Larry has assembled one of the finest collections of leaders I have seen in my many years, both in the beverage industry and in other successful businesses. And what differentiates them is a true sense of entrepreneurship together with demonstrated execution. The industry is further consolidating and integrating, but we've already done much of the heavy lifting. Now that we are a stand-alone company, we have undistracted focus on our objectives. 
Third, I have a great team of finance and IT professionals with enormous capability to drive improvements throughout the business. As we speak, we are embarking on a number of continuous improvement initiatives to do so. I know firsthand the power of a lean, continuous improvement culture, and we're building it here. All of this capability, coupled with rigor around the financial management of shareholder capital, leads me to the unequivocal conclusion that we have enormous potential to grow the value of this enterprise. 
Now, turning to our results for the quarter. We had a number of items that impacted us below the segment operating profit line. First, stock-based compensation costs were $3 million higher year-over-year. As a reminder, 2010 is the third and final year of our step-up in stock-based compensation costs. For the full year, these costs will be $12 million higher. Second, we have spent $8 million in the quarter for cost related to the PepsiCo licensing agreement. Third, we invested $9 million in productivity office initiatives, impacting both our segment operating profit and corporate expenses. You should recall almost all of our 2009 productivity office investments were incurred in the second half of last year. Fourth, we recorded unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market losses of $1 million in the quarter, compared to a $1 million gain a year ago. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 43.3%. It was increased by a $13 million revaluation of certain deferred tax assets established in Canada at the time of our separation. Continued great execution by our tax team resulted in better-than-expected tax benefits in other areas, which will benefit the full year. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $987 million. This includes the one-time payment from PepsiCo of $900 million. 
Our cash flow was also impacted by the timing of our annual incentive payments. We paid these in the first quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter last year. Net capital spending of $55 million is tracking in line with full year guidance of approximately 5% of net sales. 
And finally in the quarter, we repaid $405 million of debt, achieving our target capital structure. We returned $240 million to shareholders, comprising $38 million in dividends and $202 million in the form of share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we're still dealing with a fairly fragile consumer and macroeconomic backdrop. At the same time, we're encouraged by the sequential improvements we're seeing, particularly toward the end of March and through April. And we've now lapped those items already mentioned, which adversely affected first quarter sales comparisons. As a result, we expect to achieve 3% to 5% net sales growth in 2010, driven by continued investments and strong trends in flavored CSDs, Snapple, Hawaiian Punch and Mott's. Also, as immediate consumption and premium-priced beverages rebound, we expect to benefit from the improvement associated with this positive price mix. As a reminder, the repatriation of certain brands from the Pepsi system, as well as the amortization of the $900 million of deferred revenue will add about a point of reported net sales growth for the year. 
On the contract manufacturing side, we continue to deemphasize this non-core business, consciously trading off those sales for higher margins. And finally, the weaker dollar is giving us some benefit in reported sales comparisons. 
As you saw in this morning's press release, our reported full year tax rate is still expected to be approximately 38%. Essentially, certain favorable tax opportunities of around $0.02 to $0.03 per share are partially offsetting the foreign tax item we recorded in the first quarter, and the result is a reported tax rate that is still about 38%. 
In terms of our input cost outlook, we are experiencing slightly better trends compared to our beginning-of-the-year expectations. At current prices, packaging and ingredients will increase total COGS by less than 1% for the full year on a constant product mix basis. We continue to aggressively manage our total cost basket and look for ways to drive additional supply-chain efficiencies. 
Our current expectations include certain planned investments in our brands. We would also expect to invest any additional upsides from top line performance and cost improvements in our brands, just as we did in 2009. For the year, we now expect diluted earnings per share, excluding the separation-related foreign deferred tax charge, to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.42. This represents a $0.07 increase from our beginning-of-the-year guidance, driven by greater below-the-line leverage from higher share repurchases and the favorable tax opportunities I mentioned earlier. 
As we said on our previous earnings call, we expect to see a much stronger second half compared to the first half. In particular, as it relates to modeling SG&A, I would highlight that marketplace investments in the second quarter will be $25 million higher compared to the same period a year ago to support an extremely strong innovation and marketing calendar. 
Moving on to cash flow, we continue to expect net capital spending to be approximately 5% of net sales. With our target debt capital structure achieved and with a strong cash position, we continue to execute our previously announced plan to purchase $1 billion of our common stock in 2010. However, as referenced in our March 16 8-K filing, our purchases are subject to market conditions and certain other repurchase parameters. 
With that said, let me turn the call back to Larry."

Before we open the lines for questions, let me leave you with a few thoughts. Our results for the quarter and our outlook for the year demonstrate the progress we're making against the priorities I outlined for you at the beginning of the year, with our plans squarely focused on organic growth only. We're growing per capita consumption, while expanding distribution and availability. 
We're increasing our single-serve mix through continued incremental cold drink asset placements and fountain installs. We're meeting consumer needs with innovation that is both relevant and delivers value. We're strengthening our infrastructure with Victorville and key IT investments. We're investing in the marketplace and driving relevance and awareness. At the same time, we're relentlessly and optimizing our processes to enhance customer value, eliminate waste and reduce cost. And finally, having achieved our targeted capital structure, we expect to return excess cash to our shareholders. It is these things that give me confidence in our guidance for the year and the growth in the years ahead.

Let me start with a quick update on where we are with both the completed PepsiCo bottler transaction and the pending Coca-Cola deal.

Let me start with a quick update on where we are with both the completed PepsiCo bottler transaction and the pending Coca-Cola deal. We completed the license agreement with PepsiCo on February 26, 2010. Extensive planning on both sides resulted in a seamless transfer of DPS brands across the system, and I am thrilled to report that the brands continue to post industry-leading growth. Investments and decisions we have made had resulted in a flexible, balanced and cost-effective manufacturing and distribution footprint that gives us a solid foundation for growth. Our brands continue to gain relevance and are growing. 
With regards to the Coca-Cola transaction, when in the very early stages of the process, our guiding principles here is unchanged. Do what's best for our brands, our customers, our consumers and ultimately you, our stockholders. As I've said before, discussions of this nature are best handled in private. We'll come back to you with more news when we have something to share. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. Despite unseasonably cold weather in January and February, our business delivered another quarter of solid results with BCS [bottler case sales] volume growing 3% and dollar share up almost a full point. CSDs [carbonated soft drinks] were up 2%, led by 3% growth in Dr Pepper on the continued success of Dr Pepper Cherry and Dr Pepper Heritage in the Pepsi system. Crush was up 22%. And we continue to expand distribution and bring in new users with innovation like Cherry Crush in the U.S. and the 2.3 liter value line in Mexico. 
Canada Dry grew 10%, supported by TV advertising and targeted marketing programs. Our Fountain volume was up 2% with trends improving sequentially through the quarter. During the quarter, we installed over 5,000 incremental valves and our McDonald's rollout is on track. 
In Non-carbs, Snapple grew 17% as we continue to gain distribution in 16-ounce premium glass, 16.9 value PET and $0.79 value cans. We're seeing these gains in both measured and in particular, non-measured channels. 
Mott's grew 14% on expanded distribution and strong brand support, while Hawaiian Punch was up 7%. These results demonstrate our ability to grow shares through innovation and pull marketing campaigns, and we will continue to drive these investments. 
As we highlighted during our fourth quarter call, Q1 was our toughest quarter from a comp perspective. Sales volume lagged BCS by 600 basis points, of that amount, bottlers working to a concentrate inventory build into the first quarter of 2010 were about 200 basis points. A decline in contract manufacturing, as we continue to deemphasize the slow margin business accounted for another 200 basis points. And the unfavorable comparison related to the successful Crush launch was another 100 basis points. As a result of these factors, net sales on a currency-neutral basis were down 2% for the quarter. Our U.S. and Canada business posted solid price and mix growth, while product and channel mix in Mexico resulted in negative price and mix there. 
Segment operating profit on a currency-neutral basis declined 1% in the quarter. The business benefited from lower packaging ingredient cost, as well as a relentless focus on cost controls and productivity initiatives. Our supply chain team once again raised the bar, driving almost three points of improvement in overall equipment effectiveness. We continue to invest in our brands and in the startup of our Victorville facility. 
Our critical cold drink expansion program continues to gain momentum. And despite a challenging economic environment, we placed almost 4,500 incremental coolers and vendors. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the trends we saw in late March and through April, especially in the critical immediate consumption and fountain foodservice channels. We're also very pleased with the overall pricing environment. It remains rational and we believe this will continue. 
I am thrilled to share with you that our fifth regional center located in Victorville, California is officially open for business, on time and on budget. Victorville will also be the first of our facilities to be LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] certified. Four of our five lines are now up and running with the fifth line coming onstream within the next few weeks. The old Memphis [ph] facility marks another key milestone in the DPS journey as it enables our win the west [ph]  Strategy. Our plan to make Mott's and Hawaiian Punch the share leader in their respective categories while extending share leadership held by Mr & Mrs Ts. 
Providing cost advantage products is only part of the equation.  We're also stepping up our marketplace investments in-store, print and on air. We're targeting the Mott's moms and Hispanic moms with strong local media programs tied to retail execution as well as co-branded activities including the 7UP sponsorship of the Latin Grammy Awards. Mott's recent WIC [Women, Infants & Children] certification in California also expands the brand to more than 1.4 million new users. 
As brand owners, we know that increasing the relevance and awareness of our brands and investing incrementally are key to our long-term success. 
Our first quarter media investment was up 25% over the prior year period and contributed to strong sales growth for Snapple, Dr Pepper and Canada Dry. To continue this momentum and to support new products and retailer tie-ins, we'll spend an additional $25 million in marketing in the second quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 
With the great taste of Mott's juice, our new Mott's Medleys will help mom provide more convenient nutrition to her family with two fruit and vegetable servings in each eight-ounce portion. We're supporting this launch with new TV, print and online advertising featuring Marcia Cross. We're bringing powerful energy at the price of a CSD to Sunkist soda with the launch of Sunkist Solar Fusion, combining a delicious mandarin flavor with caffeine and B vitamins. We'll engage our target consumer with new advertising, airing June through August on shows like The Hills, Laguna Beach and MTV.  
The Mr & Mrs T's refresh is going extremely well, with volume up 10% in Q1. And in Mexico, we've launched a lightly-carbonated Snapple natural tea, targeting the health-conscious female consumer. Snapple was up almost 30% in Mexico for the quarter. 
Dr Pepper sponsorship of ACMAs on April 18 combined TV advertising with online social media, generating over $200 million impressions. And national TV advertising has already started for Dr Pepper's partnership with the biggest movie release of 2010, Iron Man 2, which premieres in the U.S. tomorrow. This integrated marketing campaign offers fans a chance to win an unrivaled collection of multimedia equipment. And building on the success of its relaunch, Snapple has embarked on its biggest ever merchandising event, joining forces with Donald Trump on one of NBC's most highly-rated shows, The Celebrity Apprentice. This fully integrated event features media, product integration, merchandising, consumer promotions and two Celebrity Apprentice-inspired products. And these are just a sample of the exciting things we're doing to engage the consumer and drive traffic for our retail customers. 
Healthcare reform and beverage tax legislation continue to be significant concerns at the national and state level. As an industry, we're coming together to help consumers understand the role of our products in their lives. While we're assessing the impact the proposed healthcare legislation may have on our business, let me take a moment to tell you how DPS is taking action to encourage an active and balanced lifestyle. 
In February, we joined with other leading beverage companies to support First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign by adopting U.S. product labeling that will list calories more prominently on containers, vending machines and fountain equipment. We've extended our partnership with the non-profit KaBOOM!. We'll turn 10 vacant lots into playgrounds in underserved communities this year. Mott's will be the lead sponsor of the Play Day program, an initiative to design and to inspire communities across the U.S. to lead local events that promote and celebrate the importance of playing. Consumers want choices, and our portfolio of diets, juices and waters drive 26% of our sales. And we continue to roll out new products like Mott's Medleys that meet consumer needs. 
And internally, we're leading by example, encouraging our employees to take action for their health through annual check-ups and other health and wellness programs. 
Now let me introduce our new CFO, Marty Ellen, to walk you through some of the below-the-line items in our 2010 guidance. Marty, I am thrilled to have you on the team.

It's great to be on this team and back in the industry. I know many of you on this call and look forward to meeting all of you in person soon. Before I cover first quarter items as well as our 2010 guidance, I want to take a moment to share",1081,"Thanks, Larry. It's great to be on this team and back in the industry. I know many of you on this call and look forward to meeting all of you in person soon. Before I cover first quarter items as well as our 2010 guidance, I want to take a moment to share with you some of my observations during my first month here. 
First, and without a doubt, we have a terrific portfolio of powerful, well-loved brands. The teams have put together a roadmap that is robust and ensures that we exploit the full potential of this business. I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe this potential was achievable. 
Second, Larry has assembled one of the finest collections of leaders I have seen in my many years, both in the beverage industry and in other successful businesses. And what differentiates them is a true sense of entrepreneurship together with demonstrated execution. The industry is further consolidating and integrating, but we've already done much of the heavy lifting. Now that we are a stand-alone company, we have undistracted focus on our objectives. 
Third, I have a great team of finance and IT professionals with enormous capability to drive improvements throughout the business. As we speak, we are embarking on a number of continuous improvement initiatives to do so. I know firsthand the power of a lean, continuous improvement culture, and we're building it here. All of this capability, coupled with rigor around the financial management of shareholder capital, leads me to the unequivocal conclusion that we have enormous potential to grow the value of this enterprise. 
Now, turning to our results for the quarter. We had a number of items that impacted us below the segment operating profit line. First, stock-based compensation costs were $3 million higher year-over-year. As a reminder, 2010 is the third and final year of our step-up in stock-based compensation costs. For the full year, these costs will be $12 million higher. Second, we have spent $8 million in the quarter for cost related to the PepsiCo licensing agreement. Third, we invested $9 million in productivity office initiatives, impacting both our segment operating profit and corporate expenses. You should recall almost all of our 2009 productivity office investments were incurred in the second half of last year. Fourth, we recorded unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market losses of $1 million in the quarter, compared to a $1 million gain a year ago. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 43.3%. It was increased by a $13 million revaluation of certain deferred tax assets established in Canada at the time of our separation. Continued great execution by our tax team resulted in better-than-expected tax benefits in other areas, which will benefit the full year. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $987 million. This includes the one-time payment from PepsiCo of $900 million. 
Our cash flow was also impacted by the timing of our annual incentive payments. We paid these in the first quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter last year. Net capital spending of $55 million is tracking in line with full year guidance of approximately 5% of net sales. 
And finally in the quarter, we repaid $405 million of debt, achieving our target capital structure. We returned $240 million to shareholders, comprising $38 million in dividends and $202 million in the form of share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we're still dealing with a fairly fragile consumer and macroeconomic backdrop. At the same time, we're encouraged by the sequential improvements we're seeing, particularly toward the end of March and through April. And we've now lapped those items already mentioned, which adversely affected first quarter sales comparisons. As a result, we expect to achieve 3% to 5% net sales growth in 2010, driven by continued investments and strong trends in flavored CSDs, Snapple, Hawaiian Punch and Mott's. Also, as immediate consumption and premium-priced beverages rebound, we expect to benefit from the improvement associated with this positive price mix. As a reminder, the repatriation of certain brands from the Pepsi system, as well as the amortization of the $900 million of deferred revenue will add about a point of reported net sales growth for the year. 
On the contract manufacturing side, we continue to deemphasize this non-core business, consciously trading off those sales for higher margins. And finally, the weaker dollar is giving us some benefit in reported sales comparisons. 
As you saw in this morning's press release, our reported full year tax rate is still expected to be approximately 38%. Essentially, certain favorable tax opportunities of around $0.02 to $0.03 per share are partially offsetting the foreign tax item we recorded in the first quarter, and the result is a reported tax rate that is still about 38%. 
In terms of our input cost outlook, we are experiencing slightly better trends compared to our beginning-of-the-year expectations. At current prices, packaging and ingredients will increase total COGS by less than 1% for the full year on a constant product mix basis. We continue to aggressively manage our total cost basket and look for ways to drive additional supply-chain efficiencies. 
Our current expectations include certain planned investments in our brands. We would also expect to invest any additional upsides from top line performance and cost improvements in our brands, just as we did in 2009. For the year, we now expect diluted earnings per share, excluding the separation-related foreign deferred tax charge, to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.42. This represents a $0.07 increase from our beginning-of-the-year guidance, driven by greater below-the-line leverage from higher share repurchases and the favorable tax opportunities I mentioned earlier. 
As we said on our previous earnings call, we expect to see a much stronger second half compared to the first half. In particular, as it relates to modeling SG&A, I would highlight that marketplace investments in the second quarter will be $25 million higher compared to the same period a year ago to support an extremely strong innovation and marketing calendar. 
Moving on to cash flow, we continue to expect net capital spending to be approximately 5% of net sales. With our target debt capital structure achieved and with a strong cash position, we continue to execute our previously announced plan to purchase $1 billion of our common stock in 2010. However, as referenced in our March 16 8-K filing, our purchases are subject to market conditions and certain other repurchase parameters. 
With that said, let me turn the call back to Larry.

Before we open the lines for questions, let me leave you with a few thoughts. Our results for the quarter and our outlook for the year demonstrate the progress we're making against the priorities I outlined for you at the beginning of the year, with our plans squarely focused on organic growth only. We're growing per capita consumption, while expanding distribution and availability. 
We're increasing our single-serve mix through continued incremental cold drink asset placements and fountain installs. We're meeting consumer needs with innovation that is both relevant and delivers value. We're strengthening our infrastructure with Victorville and key IT investments. We're investing in the marketplace and driving relevance and awareness. At the same time, we're relentlessly and optimizing our processes to enhance customer value, eliminate waste and reduce cost. And finally, having achieved our targeted capital structure, we expect to return excess cash to our shareholders. It is these things that give me confidence in our guidance for the year and the growth in the years ahead. 
Operator, we're ready for our first question.

Before Marty and I cover our third quarter results and full year guidance, I would like to take a moment to update you on our recently completed licensee agreements with The Coca-Cola Company.We are thrilled to ha",1272,"Thanks Aly, and good morning, everyone. Before Marty and I cover our third quarter results and full year guidance, I would like to take a moment to update you on our recently completed licensee agreements with The Coca-Cola Company.
We are thrilled to have the distribution of a portion of our Dr. Pepper business secured in the Coke system. We believe this further secures and strengthens a long-term growth through this trademark. As I think about the new agreements with Coke, I see several benefits.
First, with initial term of 20 years, with 20-year renewal periods and more robust performance conditions, both sides are committed to invest and grow the business.
Second, we benefit from Coke’s strengthened Fountain. To build awareness for Dr. Pepper, we’re all creating millions of sampling occasions to access to local fountain accounts previously serviced by CCE and on Coke’s revolutionary Freestyle machine.
Third, staring early January, brands such as Squirt, Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler will be sold through our company-owned DSD business.
Let’s face it. These brands were low priority in the former CCE system, but 15 million cases in our system gives us significant operating scale and we believe allows us to find another crush.
As you may have seen in earlier press release, we’ve received the one-time payment from Coke totaling $715 million. In fourth quarter 2010 and similar to the accounting from Pepsi payment, we’ll begin recognizing deferred revenue on this amount over 25 years. We’ll also record approximately $3 million in fees and expenses related to this transaction.
Now turning to our results. I am very pleased with how well our brands performed in the quarter. BCS volume was up 2% cycling at 4% growth last year. We once again posted industry-leading growth against the backdrop of weak macros of fragile consumer and of changing LRB landscape.
In the quarter, Dr. Pepper grew 2%. Our Core four brands plus Crush grew 3%, Hawaiian Punch was up 7%, Snapple was up 10% and Mott’s grew 3%. These brands drive 75% of our volume and with improving LRB trends I believe we still have plenty of room to grow.
Contract manufacturing declined over 30% in the quarter as we continue to rationalize this part of our business in pursuit of more profitable growth.
To put this into context, contract manufacturing declines reduced overall volumes by two percentage point, net sales by one percentage point, but had no impact to segment operating profit. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle contract manufacturing declines in December.
On a year-to-date basis, BCS volume and branded shipments are much more in line as you’d expect.
Moving onto net sales, in the quarter there were three items I believe impacted our comparison to last year. First, our continued de-emphasis of our contract manufacturing business reduced net sales growth by one percentage point.
Second, as consumers continue to seek value, we continue to see more sales of non-cola CSDs and value juices and this is driving negative revenue mix. What’s important to know here is the bias towards value is lasting much longer than I think any of us expected. It’s certainly not getting worse, in fact, in some market it appears to be getting better.
Third, we continue to invest in promotional activity both with our bottlers and our company-owned systems to help stimulate traffic for our retailers. Examples in the quarter include two-liter CSD events and grocery and mass merch, Hawaiian Punch, one-gallon programs in grocery and dollar, Snapple Premium six-pack sampling promotions, more try me coupons and increased retailer support behind new 7Up.
These three items combined reduce net sales growth by three percentage points and were partially offset by revenue recognized under the Pepsi license agreement, which added less than one point of growth.
It’s also important to highlight three factors that contributed to segment operating profit declines in the quarter. First, packaging, ingredient and transportation cost increased approximately $28 million, which we were trying to offset in part with incremental productivity. Second, we incurred strike-related cost of $15 million.
Let me pause for a moment and talk about this item. Our primary goal throughout the negotiations was to provide our customers and consumers with uninterrupted product supply.
At the same time, we sought an agreement that would support our long-term supply chain optimization strategy by bringing labor practices and costs at our Williamson plant in line with industry standards and to improve our overall competitive position. I am happy to say that we achieved both objectives and the facility is back up and running.
The third item impacting segment operating profit was increased marketplace investments in line with our previous comments. In the quarter, we made focused investments in network TV and local radio supporting Dr Pepper, Sunkist, Canada Dry and Mott’s driving GRPs up over 90% and with media spend up 30%. We also achieved a better return on our invested dollars, a practice we believe will allow us to drive even more effectiveness out of our marketing strength.
Despite negative mix, higher input and transportation cost and a strike, which alone reduced operating margins by 100 basis points in the quarter, we were still able to achieve operating margins of almost 18% compared to 19% last year and do so with continued increases in marketplace investment.
EPS for the quarter was $0.60, including $0.04 of strike-related costs. This was in line with our expectations and up 11% from the prior year period on a comparable basis.
Looking ahead, let me highlight some of our fourth quarter 2010 and trimester 1 2011 innovation and activation plans that will continue to increase awareness and relevance of our brands.
In the fourth quarter, we’ll keep strong bottler and retail momentum going behind the 7Up re-launch with holiday display contest, national TV and we’ll bring back 7Up Pomegranate with antioxidants again for a limited time. Early reads on the 7Up re-launch are very encouraging.
In the month of September, BCS volume was up 3% compared to a year-to-date trend of down 6%. It’s early days yet, but we believe we’re on the right track.
We will continue to win the West in Mott’s and Hawaiian Punch with strong fourth quarter retailer activity and accounts including Wal-Mart, Kroger, Target and Safeway. In the first trimester of 2011, we’ll expand this critical initiative by increasing regional media support and step-up investments aimed at increasing usage with our Hispanic consumer.
In January, Punchy will get a full makeover. This will be the first new graphics and merchandizing update for a Hawaiian Punch in 10 years and kids will get to enjoy their favorite treat on the go with the launch of a new multi-packed single serve 10-ounce PT offering available in four flavors.
We’ll keep the excitement going on Snapple with the national launch of a 64-ounce multi-serve offering. This package has performed extremely well in its test markets.
Finally, we believe 2011 will be a huge year for Mott’s as we support three key initiative innovation points with strong national TV advertising.
We are re-launching Mott’s for Tots with the introduction of four new SKUs with nutritional benefits and new single-serve packaging. We’ll continue to support Mott’s Medleys at national media coupons and sampling. Mott’s will enter the vegetable juice category in the U.S. with the introduction of Mott’s Garden brand made with the 100% vegetable juice. This product has been a huge hit in Canada driving strong growth there.
Now, let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through some of our below the line items for the quarter and our guidance update.

In the third quarter, we continued to make productivity office investments to streamline processes and drive efficiencies. In the quarter, we invested approximately $7 million, with $4 million recorded in corporate expense and the balance in these segments.
Year-to-date, these investments stand at $23 million compared to $18 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, we also gained momentum behind our rapid continuous improvement initiative or RCI for short. A great example of this is the project we just completed at our St. Louis facility.
This is, in fact, a breakthrough for us. So, let me share some highlights. In an effort to reduce the need for our local warehouse in St. Louis, we embarked on our RCI initiative to reduce inventories and a certain product line by 70%. Well, after only a two-week effort, we achieved a 60% reduction, not bad in our view.
Line change overtime was reduced by 60%. Warehouse transfers were reduce by 40% as we now ship to a number of customers direct from the end of the production line and we reduce costs associated with this operation by 60%.
So it’s not to overstate the financial success of this achievement, the combined inventory reduction and annual cost savings is a little less than $1 million. Small by your measures, but this is an enormous breakthrough in thinking in the traditional business model and is creating enormous energy inside our organization to deploy these learnings across our entire system.
I have been asked by many of you to provide measurable financial targets for our improvement goals. Typically, these are seen as productivity improvements in working capital, capital spending and operating costs. It’s still early, but it’s not unreasonable for us to achieve productivity improvement of $150 million, maybe more, over the next few years.
Now, turning back to the slide. As you think about the corporate line for the quarter, let me remind you that this is where we record our unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our commodity hedges. Year-to-date, we recorded $2 million in losses versus $11 million in gains last year, a swing of $13 million. By year end, we expect this swing to be about $23 million.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.7%, bringing our year-to-date rate to 38.2%, in line with our full year guidance.
Moving on to cash flow, we spent $154 million net on capital so far this year. This is tracking in line with our full year target of approximately 5% of net sales. We have returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With our original $1 billion program almost complete and with the receipt of the Coke licensing payment, we expect to repurchase additional shares in 2010 under our second $1 billion authorization.
Now, let me move on to guidance. As Larry mentioned, our quarter and year-to-date net sales are being negatively impacted by a couple of things, the de-emphasis of contract manufacturing and negative product mix. Partially offsetting these declines is revenue recognized under new licensing agreement.
With the completion of the Coke deal, we will record an additional $7 million of licensing revenue in the fourth quarter with $3 million of transaction expenses recorded in the corporate line. Given these factors, we now expect 2010 reported net sales to grow in the 1% to 2% range.
Moving on to EPS, we expect diluted earnings per share, excluding the first quarter tax item to be in the $2.35 to $2.43 range, consistent with our past guidance but up $0.01 for the Coke transaction.
Unchanged from our prior guidance, we continue to expect packaging and ingredient to increase cost of goods sold by less than 1% for the full year 2010 on a constant product mix basis and expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 38%.
With that let me turn the call back to Larry.

The macroeconomic environment remains challenging and its impact on consumer behavior continues to create a degree of uncertainty. Our portfolio of leading and preferred non-cola CSDs, teas and juices are healthy, gaining share and growing brand equity.
We remained focused on executing the strategy we laid out at the time of our spin and we’ll continue to invest in the business and our brands for the long-term.
As Marty outlined, we’re seeing the early wins with RCI. By the end 2013, we believe RCI will deliver $150 million annually of incremental productivity, providing both incremental return to shareholders and further resources to invest in growth.
With our foundational investment almost complete, we can turn our full attention to expanding our distribution and availability opportunities and unlock the full potential of this business.

And I think it’s still going to be a little tough, probably still kind of run along the same trends with some improvement for the first trimester.

We’ve added a number of resources to drive this program through the organization and I can tell you that it’s clear, the organization is starting to pick up speed. It’s also a learning process here that comes with being good at lean.
So it would be reasonable to assume that the phasing sort of accelerates over time. I don’t want to put too many definitive timeframes on it, but I think in the next two years to three years we can get to that level of annual savings. That should not unreasonable based on sort of the early returns and opportunities we are starting to see there, that St. Louis improvement I referred to, small in dollar terms, but enormous in its change to the way the business has traditionally been operated in sort of that segment of the business and that learning is deployable elsewhere in the business.
One of the things we are really expecting out of the savings is, in fact, to allow us to create resource to invest in growth, not all of it, we shouldn’t need all of it. There is no reason to believe we need it all, so some should go to improve returns for shareholders. But it’s real clear, this is an opportune way for us to create resources, to beat that cost inflation in other areas of the company and provide resources to invest in growth clearly.

Our sales volume was up 1% but our BCS down about in 3%. So we’ve got some priorities down there that we’re looking at constantly.
We want to optimize our routes that we installed in 2009 and 2010.

Like I said in my call on September, our volume was up 3% on 7UP, which was very encouraging. We had markets like Michigan that were up 35%. I went out and hit nine markets in three and a half days across the United States and just saw some unbelievable execution out there and our guys are great at execution, but I think what encourages me the most is feedback I get from store managers and people working in the stores and the consumer that this really loves the new crisp, clean, ridiculously bubbly taste of 7UP.

Clearly, if we look at current spot prices and taken into consideration our hedge position, we’re going to be up greater than that. Now we’re about half way through our planning process. As we did this year and we’d expect next year, our supply chain has done a great job of finding other offsets to this cost inflation in the commodity basket, which I think you all know the commodity baskets that we tend to talk about here is 20% low, 20%, 21%,22% of our total cost of goods, so will be higher. That said, about half way through I suggest our planning process for 2011, right now looking at low single digit pricing, it looks like that will cover in dollar term, not in percent terms, in dollar term all of the COGS inflation.

If we look at the top line, I think it’s pretty much in line with our comments from Q2 and plus in September. A lot of it is from where we were planning, John, we thought the consumer would be up a little more than where it is right now. We’re starting to see it a little later than we anticipated.
So then as far as the contract pack piece, I mean it’s quite a bit of the mess and we bring in the Coke piece in, where we’re going to be putting more of own products through those lines which make so much more sense for us. I think the other piece is I am looking at what we have as another Crush.
As we bring these brands in like I had mentioned I mean $15 million coming from Coke that was very small to CC but could be big to us and in our company-owned DSD. However, the biggest piece is what now our marketing team can do to where we have more control of a brand, whether it’s in our system or whether it’s in Coke or Pepsi’s, we no longer have a brand in three systems. We were able to make it much more uniform.
So we can look at those, put a lot more spin behind them. Get national programs that can be executed flawlessly and start seeing growth off of those. Plus I mean the other Crush we’re looking for that. We think we’ve got some great ideas. We never limited to where they would be in a third party bottler or in own company-owned DSD. So those are the things we’re looking at we’ll have pretty soon.
I think the other one, John, is just our distribution availability. I mean now that we’ve got most of our work done, the foundation laid, it gives us much more time to really focus on that and it’s one of the key operating measures we’re using for the team. We’re gaining in CSDs, Mott’s and Snapple and we’re up right now almost 200 basis points. So we’re encouraged by that. And then as you probably tell, I’m feeling a lot better about the consumer. I love seeing the team come together, the investments we’ve made, they’re going to start kind of paying off for sure.

Like you saw on the second quarter when we have the pricing with Wal-Mart, we were able to move pretty quickly and moved some of that spend. The way the brands have been underinvested through the years, I don’t really know where right levels at but we watch it very closely. Our return on margin investment is helping us to look at that.

In my earlier comments I talked about COGS. We understand where transportation costs are. Of course, you know in a RCI world what you attempt to do now is reduce transportation cost as I said in St. Louis we’re no longer driving product from a plant to a warehouse. I mean this is the exactly the kind of stuff you go do, particularly when faced with this stuff to reduce cost. So it’s going to be up as I said, COGS inflation was 1% this year, commodities is a big part of that. We will get with supply chain savings and we will open up pricing.

We think that trend is going to continue. Value, as we’ve always said on the value side, we do that very strategic and also very defensively where we need to go against the highly discounted tea prices.
Still our number one focus will always be premium, the 16-ounce glass that’s where we’re number one. We’re very happy with the performance and we know it will continue. With Q3 being up 13%, I mean that’s something we’ve been looking for, for quite a few years and our distributors and our customers have us convinced that that will continue.
You look at the ACV on our 6-pack and grocery, the latest four weeks were 86% and everybody thought that the 6-pack wouldn’t work when it was a 12-pack package that was given away for years. So very, very encouraged. We’ve got our shares up four points. We’re just looking at it and thinking that Snapple is here for the long run and we’re pleased with it. The premium, you want to always remember the premium with 16-ounce glass that’s 85% of our total Snapple business, so that’s the big one.
