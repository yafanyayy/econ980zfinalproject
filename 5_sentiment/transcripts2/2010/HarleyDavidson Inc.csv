We've got a lot of ground to cover this morning so we'll get right to it. And as you saw in the press release today, Harley-Davidson reported its first quarterly loss in many years with full year revenues and profits decreased from last year. These results were not surprising, in fact, they were as we had expected because they were the direct result of the economic climate and the decisive actions we took throughout the year. Actions to deal not just with the recession but to position of our company for the future through the go-forward strategy that we unveiled in October. We firmly believe the short-term pain of Harley-Davidson is going through is the result of our actions is worth the longer-term gain that we expect to see as a result. And we have confidence that we're doing the right things to manage our business prudently and effectively in this economy and to restore Harley-Davidson to greater profitability going forward. So let's take a look at 2009 and our actions and then I want to turn my attention to what lies ahead. When I joined Harley-Davidson in May, we set out two key priorities for our team. First, was to continue to take the actions necessary and execute effectively on our strategy to manage the business in the current economic environment. And at the same, it was even more essential that we develop a clear comprehensive and powerful strategy to maximize our opportunities for growth and profitability going forward. And so looking at our actions to execute effectively in the current environment, we reduced shipment volumes significantly to align our inventories. We embarked on major restructuring of our production operations. We obtained funding for the lending activities of HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services] and positioned HDFS for solid footing in 2010 and launched our go-forward business strategy to deliver results by focusing on the four key pillars of our strategy, which are growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability.Under our strategy, we are focusing our investment behind the uniquely strong Harley-Davidson brand as the most attractive path to sustained long-term growth. Through products and experiences, global expansion, outreach to new customers and our commitment to core customers. And as we look at the year in front of us, we expect 2010 to continue to be challenging. Our strategy and the performance goals that we have laid out through 2014 are based on an appropriately prudent approach. And our growth targets will take hard work and intense focus to reach, but we believe they are imminently achievable and appropriately conservative.But even in an environment where consumers are more practical and cautious, we believe that people still dream about the Harley-Davidson experience. And everything we see indicates that the brand is in stronger, stronger than ever both in the U.S. and globally. So we will continue to solidify our position and execute on our go-forward strategy, including bringing exciting products to market like the Forty-Eight that we are introducing today and which like the other dark custom bikes is intended to reach new, young, adult customers. In addition to our focus on growing core and outreach markets in North America, we will also continue to focus on expanding the brand in international markets. Harley-Davidson's brand appeal around the world is as strong or stronger than ever. And so in summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results are a direct reflection of the economy and the actions that we took to manage the business prudently and effectively in the current environment and more importantly for the future.While we expect 2010 to be another challenging year for the industry and for Harley-Davidson, the Harley-Davidson brand has exceptional strength and we're highly focused on continuing to grow the reach of our brand around the world. And we have a great conviction that our go-forward strategy is focusing our company in the right direction and that we are executing our strategy with appropriate urgency. So with that, I'd like to say thanks and let me turn it over to John Olin for the numbers and then more of the details."

During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing oper",1417,"Thanks, Keith. This morning I'll discuss some of the details around our financial results, provide an update on our restructuring activities and discuss an expectations for 2010. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing operations was down 40.2% and we recognized a loss for the first time in recent history. This loss was expected as a result of ongoing restructuring activity, costs associated with exiting the Buell product line and the impact of shipping 53% fewer bikes than the fourth quarter of last year.While the shipment reduction negatively impacted the quarter's results, the positive news is that our U.S. dealer network had a year-end inventory level that was significantly lower than last year and we believe appropriate for the current environment which I'll talk more about shortly.Moving on to Slide 11, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down worldwide during the fourth quarter and the full year 2009 compared to last year. A few points to note about retail sales. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide retail sales rate was flat compared to last quarter. In international markets we saw another sequential improvement in retail sales rate and after being down for three consecutive quarters, Europe was up slightly in the fourth quarter. Regarding market share, our U.S. market share decreased by 4.8 percentage points in the quarter as we lacked a strong fourth quarter 2008 share increase of 4.4 percentage points. Also, driving the decrease in fourth quarter 2009 market share were strong sales in the performance segment due to significant price discounting during the quarter. For the full year, our market share was up 7.9 percentage points versus 2008.On Slide 12, our U.S. dealer networks year-end retail inventory was down 18,000 units compared to last year. It was the third consecutive year we significantly reduced dealer inventory and we remain committed to the task of balancing supply in line with demand. As retail conditions remain challenging, we continue to execute our plan to help protect the integrity of our dealer network. In October, we estimated that 15 to 30 additional dealer points could close over the next six months. During the fourth quarter, 14 dealer points closed. So during 2009, a total of 28 dealer points closed. We continue to expect approximately 15 additional dealer points will close in the next three months.On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the full year were down 26.5% to 223,000 units. Of that total, Sportster represented 21.2% of shipments just slightly more than 2008 full year total. Mix shifted between the Custom and Touring families compared to 2008, primarily driven by the new Tri Glide models and shipments to international markets increased to 35% of the total.On the next slide, you'll see revenue in all categories of the Motorcycle and Related Products segment was down in the fourth quarter and the full year. The 45.6% decrease in Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue during the fourth quarter was primarily a result of lower shipments, partially offset by favorable shipment mix and favorable foreign currency exchange. P&A [Parts and Accessories] and General Merchandise revenue were down less than motorcycle revenue. Both were an important part of our growth strategy and we're excited about the prospects of these high margin businesses in the future.For example, the Fit Shop is a new P&A concept. It enables sales people to show customers how handle bars, seats, controls and suspension affect riding position comfort and confidence. General Merchandise just launched the new Pink Label Collection, a portion of the proceeds will support the Breast Cancer Network of Strength. Both support our strategy to reach a more diverse rider base. As retail sales, shipments and revenue have been down due to the recession, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and structuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. Throughout 2009, we announced significant restructuring efforts that will result in reduced administrative costs, reduced excess capacity and increased focus on our core operations. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to consolidate a three vehicle test facility into one location further streamlining operations. The estimated total costs and savings associated with our 2009 restructuring activities are summarized on Slide 15.During the fourth quarter, we shut down Buell production. The financial results related to Buell will continue to be reported as a component of income from operations. Related exit costs will be recorded as restructuring expenses and gross profit will continue to include earnings on the sale of our remaining Buell inventory. In 2009, we recorded approximately $116 million of the estimated $125 million in costs related to exiting Buell.On Slide 17, you'll see our total 2009 restructuring costs were $221 million, which exceeded our estimated range of $190 million to $210 million mainly driven by higher Buell restructuring costs. However, total Buell exit costs are still expected to be $125 million as there was favorability in the gross margin impact associated with the Buell product line exit.Restructuring savings were $91 million, slightly above the high end of our expected range. We now expect total restructuring and impairment costs will be between $430 million and $460 million through 2012 and we continue to expect total cumulative annual savings associated with our restructuring to be between $240 million and $260 million. Expected costs and savings by year are provided on the slide.On Slide 18, you will see gross margin in the quarter decreased to 20.3% of revenue compared to last year. As expected, gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by lower shipments and Buell exit costs. But also by unfavorable manufacturing costs due to loss absorption. Overall, material costs favorable mix and higher-than-expected productivity provided some favorable offset. Full year gross margin was 32.3% of revenue and we continue to be very pleased with the gross margin strength of our core business despite volume declines of over 26% from 2008.On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was a negative 29%, which was impacted by lower gross margin of $254 million, restructuring and asset impairments of $120 million and higher SG&A expenses. Full year operating margin decreased to 7.3% as a result of lower gross margin and restructuring and asset impairment charges. SG&A finished the year down by $91 million driven by an estimated $83 million in restructuring savings.Now moving on to our Financial Services segment. During the quarter HDFS recorded an operating loss of $7.1 million, an improvement of $17.8 million compared to last year. The main drivers of this improvement were income from past off-balance sheet securitization increased by $18.1 million during the quarter. Impairments to retain securitization interest for the fourth quarter 2009 were $9.8 million compared to $25.3 million impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Provision for retail loan losses increased by $19.9 million during the quarter, primarily due to a higher balance of held for invested receivables versus the prior year. And the provision for wholesale loan losses decreased by $7 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease resulted primarily from lower outstanding receivables due to reduced motorcycle inventory in the dealer network from a year ago.It is encouraging that our credit risk assumptions in both the retail and wholesale portfolio did not change significantly from the third quarter of 2009. The remaining $11.1 million of improvement is primarily the result of a fourth quarter 2008 provision for lower of cost or market adjustments on held-for-sale receivables. There is no comparable item in the fourth quarter of 2009 as these receivables were reclassified to held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2009.On a full year basis, HDFS incurred $118 million loss largely due to $101 million of one-time items recorded during the year. In October, we said we expected HDFS to incur loss into the next couple of quarters due to seasonality, lower recovery values and higher cost of debt. Since then, HDFS continued to access the debt capital markets at relatively attractive cost of funds and repay the $600 million, 15% intercompany loan to Harley-Davidson Inc., HD Inc. will hold the debt and will incur rebated [ph] interest expense.Repayment of this debt to HD Inc. positively impacted HDFS' fourth quarter results and going forward, we believe HDFS' cost of funds will be more reflective of current market interest rates. We expect the new interest rate structure will assist us in moving to profitability in 2010. Now Larry will review HDFS' operations and portfolio performance."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 29% compared to 2008. HDFS retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was down nearly five percentage points to 48.8% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to an increase in cash buyers and also due to competition particularly in the prime-rated [ph] customer segment.At the end of the fourth quarter of the approximately $4.8 billion of receivables that were classified as held for investment, $4 billion were retail and $863 million were wholesale. We are pleased with the progress resulting from the significant underwriting adjustments we made in 2009. We continue to see improved performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated in 2009 compared to the prior year.At the end of 2009, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were primed compared to approximately 75% in previous years. We continue to monitor the performance of these new originations very closely and we will make changes to our underwriting standards that we deem appropriate. The impact of the recession and high unemployment continue to drive delinquencies and credit losses. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2009, was 6.51%, up slightly over 2008. Our increased collections staffing levels and modified collection strategies have enabled us to manage delinquency levels close to last year despite increase in unemployment in the U.S. Annualized retail credit losses increased to 2.86% for the full year in 2008 and were driven by a higher frequency of loss and a decline in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.So in conclusion as John mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in improving our liquidity position and reducing our cost of funds. As we work through the winter months and given continued high unemployment rates in the U.S., we expect to continue to see higher levels of delinquent loans and retail credit losses in the near term. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate and we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Now let me turn it back to John."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS obtained $1.8 billion of funding. Last quarter, we said we were engaged in reviewing our strategic options to find more diversified and cost effective funding in order to meet HDFS' goal of providing credit while delivering appropriate returns in profitability. The process is progressing as we continue our discussion with several institutions. Realistically, we recognized that this is a challenge. However, we remain cautiously optimistic that we can find additional opportunities to improve HDFS' funding profile. In the meantime, we are pleased with HDFS' fourth quarter results and are seeing some positive signs as we move into 2010.On Slide 24, you'll see our overall cash position and liquidity strategy. We ended this quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. This is a significant and welcome improvement in liquidity from just one year ago and we believe is an appropriate level given the uncertain economy. Of the total $1.7 billion, HDFS ended the year with $489 million in cash after repaying HD Inc. the $600 million it borrowed in February of 2009. Additionally, HDFS has access to approximately $2 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities. As of the end of 2009, we believe we have met HDFS' anticipated 2010 funding needs throughout 2009 actions. During the year, we expect to pre-fund our 2011 needs through the capital markets and by renewing a portion of the bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities.Going forward, our strategy will be to maintain a minimum of 12 months of liquidity in cash and/or credit facilities. We will carry higher cash balances until we see stabilization and improvement in the economy, capital and credit markets and our company's credit ratings. We will continue to try to diversify our funding profile through a combination of short-term and long-term funding vehicles, reduce our reliance on the term asset-backed securitization market and continue to pursue all avenues to obtain cost-effective funding. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 25.On a continuing basis, Harley-Davidson Inc. 2009 revenue, net income and earnings per share were down compared to last year mainly due to significant one-time items related to restructuring and asset impairment charges and the reclassification of HDFS receivables during the year. On Slide 26, I would like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash, despite the large drop in motorcycle shipments and the restructuring spending that we incurred, we were able to generate operating cash of over $600 million, which included a fourth quarter contribution of $215 million to our pension plans.And second, our tax rate increased significantly in 2009 relative to 2008, primarily due to the one-time charge for the Wisconsin tax law change and the non-deductible HDFS goodwill write-off as well as the impact of reduced earnings. In 2010, we expect the full year effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% from continuing operations.We are proceeding with our plan to sell MV Agusta. As a result, MV Agusta's assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale and its financial results have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the fourth quarter, we will bound [ph] the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets resulting in non-cash of $53 million net of related tax benefits. For the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize a loss from discontinued operations. The details are on Slide 27.Now I'd like to talk about two important changes in our financial reporting. First, in the first quarter of 2010, FAS 166 and 167 will be adopted and approximately $1.9 billion of receivables and related debt will be brought back onto our balance sheet. Adoption will also result in a small adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we expect to remain in compliance with all our debt covenants. We will provide more details in the 2009 10-K.The second important change to our financials also involves HDFS. With the complexity and changing dynamics of the Financial Services business, we feel that it is important for our stakeholders to see more detail around our motorcycle and Financial Services segment. Therefore, in the 10-K, we will begin providing consolidating financial information that will breakdown the income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows for each segment.So all in all, 2009 was a challenging year but we are confident that we have taken the appropriate actions to reserve [ph] greater profitability and drive long-term growth. We expect 2010 to be another challenging year. As a result, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments in 2010 to be between 201,000 and 212,000 motorcycles, down 5% to 10% from 2009 as a result of two key factors. First, we expect the global economy to remain challenging with continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence in United States. Second, we expect continued price competition from other manufacturers as they reduce excess inventories. We also anticipate price competition at the local level as retailers discount excess inventory driven by contraction of the dealer network.In 2010, we will take a conservative approach to shipment volumes as we continue to work with our dealers to aggressively balance supply in line with demand. And when demand improves, we will be ready to increase production. We expect gross margins to be between 32% and 33.5% for the full year. And capital expenditures are expected to be between $235 million and $255 million which includes approximately $95 million to $110 million in restructuring capital.As we put 2009 behind us, it is important to note that despite significantly lower volumes and restructuring spending, Harley-Davidson remains a very strong company with an incredibly powerful brand. Our strength is evidenced by our solid gross margins and our ability to generate positive cash from the Motorcycle segment in a challenging business environment. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the economic downturn and execute our long-term strategy. And now let's open the call up to your questions."

We think it's very important for everyone to see the separate businesses. And certainly, the high margin Motorcycle business that we've got that has very little debt and very high margins and the reinvestment returns or the returns on equity that we've gotten off of our Financial Service business. So we want to start to show the different dynamics of the business. So that doesn't have anything to do with looking forward at HDFS from a strategic standpoint. But what we have said a couple of quarters ago that we were evaluating our options, our strategic options as it relates to obtaining a more diversified low-cost funds for HDFS. Our goal at HDFS has been to provide credit while balancing appropriate returns and profitability. And to that end, we've engaged an advisor and are discussing potential opportunities with several institutions. At this point, we're still in the process but we're realistic that this is just a challenge. There is no cookie-cutter model out there that says, here's how the best way to transfer red score to reduced lower cost of funds. But we're working on as diligent as we can, we remain cautiously optimistic that we had find some additional opportunities out there to improve the funding profile. But Tim, let's be clear we believe that HDFS provides a strategic advantage at Harley-Davidson. We also believe that the company benefited from having HDFS this year. It benefited both the company and our dealers and any arrangement must be with their company's long-term interest at heart and that includes underwriting, long-term commitment and certainly, recognition of any of the value that HDFS brings to the organization."

But again, internationally, we typically got what we call pipeline, the inventory is sent to a warehouse and the dealers draw from it. Because typically, the dealer shops are smaller and they keep 20-ish bikes on the floor and then when they sell them, they draw from the warehouse. So there is not a lot to put in the dealerships."

And again, we feel extremely pleased that our ability to hold up gross margins despite a 26% decline in shipments. Specifically to answer your question is that yes, we've been under -- our guidance has been below where we come in actuals and I think it's largely driven by the incredible productivity that the operations organization is generated. I couldn't be happier with the organization and unbuckling down and pulling forward productivity projects and we'll be focusing on continuous improvement everyday. And that's really what's been the -- delivering more than what we expected. In the fourth quarter specifically, a little bit of it was the Buell piece.

And as you saw in the press release today, Harley-Davidson reported its first quarterly loss in many years, with full year revenues and profits decreased from last year. These results were not surprising. In fact, they were as we had expected, because they were the direct result of the economic climate and the decisive actions we took throughout the year, actions to deal not just with the recession, but to position our company for the future through the go-forward strategy that we unveiled in October. We firmly believe the short-term pain that Harley-Davidson is going through is a result of our actions, is worth the longer-term gain that we expect to see as a result. And we have confidence that we're doing the right things to manage our business prudently and effectively in this economy, and to restore Harley-Davidson to greater profitability going forward. So let's take a look at 2009 and our actions. And then I want to turn my attention to what lies ahead. When I joined Harley-Davidson in May, we set out two key priorities for our team. Firs was to continue to take the actions necessary, and execute effectively on our strategy to manage the business in the current economic environment. And at the same, it was even more essential that we develop a clear, comprehensive and powerful strategy to maximize our opportunities for growth and profitability going forward. And so looking at our actions to execute effectively in the current environment, we reduced shipment volumes significantly to align our inventories. We embarked on major restructuring of our production operations. We obtained funding for the lending activities of HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services] and positioned HDFS for solid footing in 2010, and launched our go-forward business strategy to deliver results by focusing on the four key pillars of our strategy, which are growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability.Under our strategy, we are focusing our investment behind the uniquely strong Harley-Davidson brand as the most attractive path to sustained long-term growth through products and experiences, global expansion, outreach to new customers and our commitment to core customers. And as we look at the year in front of us, we expect 2010 to continue to be challenging. Our strategy and the performance goals that we have laid out through 2014 are based on an appropriately prudent approach. And our growth targets will take hard work and intense focus to reach, but we believe they are imminently achievable and appropriately conservative.But even in an environment where consumers are more practical and cautious, we believe that people still dream about the Harley-Davidson experience. And everything we see indicates that the brand is in stronger, stronger than ever both in the U.S. and globally. So we will continue to solidify our position and execute on our go-forward strategy, including bringing exciting products to market like the Forty-Eight that we are introducing today and which, like the other Dark Custom bikes, is intended to reach new young adult customers. In addition to our focus on growing core and outreach markets in North America, we will also continue to focus on expanding the brand in international markets. Harley-Davidson's brand appeal around the world is as strong or stronger than ever. And so in summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results are a direct reflection of the economy and the actions that we took to manage the business prudently and effectively in the current environment and more importantly for the future.While we expect 2010 to be another challenging year for the industry and for Harley-Davidson, the Harley-Davidson brand has exceptional strength and we're highly focused on continuing to grow the reach of our brand around the world. And we have a great conviction that our go-forward strategy is focusing our company in the right direction and that we are executing our strategy with appropriate urgency. So with that, I'd like to say thanks and let me turn it over to John Olin for the numbers and then more of the details."

This morning I'll discuss some of the details around our financial results, provide an update on our restructuring activities and discuss an expectations for 2010. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing oper",1416,"Thanks, Keith. This morning I'll discuss some of the details around our financial results, provide an update on our restructuring activities and discuss an expectations for 2010. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing operations was down 40.2% and we recognized a loss for the first time in recent history. This loss was expected as a result of ongoing restructuring activity, costs associated with exiting the Buell product line and the impact of shipping 53% fewer bikes than the fourth quarter of last year.While the shipment reduction negatively impacted the quarter's results, the positive news is that our U.S. dealer network had a year-end inventory level that was significantly lower than last year and we believe appropriate for the current environment which I'll talk more about shortly.Moving on to Slide 11, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down worldwide during the fourth quarter and the full year 2009 compared to last year. A few points to note about retail sales. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide retail sales rate was flat compared to last quarter. In international markets we saw another sequential improvement in retail sales rate and after being down for three consecutive quarters, Europe was up slightly in the fourth quarter. Regarding market share, our U.S. market share decreased by 4.8 percentage points in the quarter as we lacked a strong fourth quarter 2008 share increase of 4.4 percentage points. Also, driving the decrease in fourth quarter 2009 market share were strong sales in the performance segment due to significant price discounting during the quarter. For the full year, our market share was up 7.9 percentage points versus 2008.On Slide 12, our U.S. dealer networks year-end retail inventory was down 18,000 units compared to last year. It was the third consecutive year we significantly reduced dealer inventory and we remain committed to the task of balancing supply in line with demand. As retail conditions remain challenging, we continue to execute our plan to help protect the integrity of our dealer network. In October, we estimated that 15 to 30 additional dealer points could close over the next six months. During the fourth quarter, 14 dealer points closed. So during 2009, a total of 28 dealer points closed. We continue to expect approximately 15 additional dealer points will close in the next three months.On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the full year were down 26.5% to 223,000 units. Of that total, Sportster represented 21.2% of shipments just slightly more than 2008 full year total. Mix shifted between the Custom and Touring families compared to 2008, primarily driven by the new Tri Glide models and shipments to international markets increased to 35% of the total.On the next slide, you'll see revenue in all categories of the Motorcycle and Related Products segment was down in the fourth quarter and the full year. The 45.6% decrease in Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue during the fourth quarter was primarily a result of lower shipments, partially offset by favorable shipment mix and favorable foreign currency exchange. P&A [Parts and Accessories] and General Merchandise revenue were down less than motorcycle revenue. Both were an important part of our growth strategy and we're excited about the prospects of these high margin businesses in the future.For example, the Fit Shop is a new P&A concept. It enables sales people to show customers how handle bars, seats, controls and suspension affect riding position comfort and confidence. General Merchandise just launched the new Pink Label Collection, a portion of the proceeds will support the Breast Cancer Network of Strength. Both support our strategy to reach a more diverse rider base. As retail sales, shipments and revenue have been down due to the recession, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and structuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. Throughout 2009, we announced significant restructuring efforts that will result in reduced administrative costs, reduced excess capacity and increased focus on our core operations. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to consolidate a three vehicle test facility into one location further streamlining operations. The estimated total costs and savings associated with our 2009 restructuring activities are summarized on Slide 15.During the fourth quarter, we shut down Buell production. The financial results related to Buell will continue to be reported as a component of income from operations. Related exit costs will be recorded as restructuring expenses and gross profit will continue to include earnings on the sale of our remaining Buell inventory. In 2009, we recorded approximately $116 million of the estimated $125 million in costs related to exiting Buell.On Slide 17, you'll see our total 2009 restructuring costs were $221 million, which exceeded our estimated range of $190 million to $210 million mainly driven by higher Buell restructuring costs. However, total Buell exit costs are still expected to be $125 million as there was favorability in the gross margin impact associated with the Buell product line exit.Restructuring savings were $91 million, slightly above the high end of our expected range. We now expect total restructuring and impairment costs will be between $430 million and $460 million through 2012 and we continue to expect total cumulative annual savings associated with our restructuring to be between $240 million and $260 million. Expected costs and savings by year are provided on the slide.On Slide 18, you will see gross margin in the quarter decreased to 20.3% of revenue compared to last year. As expected, gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by lower shipments and Buell exit costs. But also by unfavorable manufacturing costs due to loss absorption. Overall, material costs favorable mix and higher-than-expected productivity provided some favorable offset. Full year gross margin was 32.3% of revenue and we continue to be very pleased with the gross margin strength of our core business despite volume declines of over 26% from 2008.On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was a negative 29%, which was impacted by lower gross margin of $254 million, restructuring and asset impairments of $120 million and higher SG&A expenses. Full year operating margin decreased to 7.3% as a result of lower gross margin and restructuring and asset impairment charges. SG&A finished the year down by $91 million driven by an estimated $83 million in restructuring savings.Now moving on to our Financial Services segment. During the quarter HDFS recorded an operating loss of $7.1 million, an improvement of $17.8 million compared to last year. The main drivers of this improvement were income from past off-balance sheet securitization increased by $18.1 million during the quarter. Impairments to retain securitization interest for the fourth quarter 2009 were $9.8 million compared to $25.3 million impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Provision for retail loan losses increased by $19.9 million during the quarter, primarily due to a higher balance of held for invested receivables versus the prior year. And the provision for wholesale loan losses decreased by $7 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease resulted primarily from lower outstanding receivables due to reduced motorcycle inventory in the dealer network from a year ago.It is encouraging that our credit risk assumptions in both the retail and wholesale portfolio did not change significantly from the third quarter of 2009. The remaining $11.1 million of improvement is primarily the result of a fourth quarter 2008 provision for lower of cost or market adjustments on held-for-sale receivables. There is no comparable item in the fourth quarter of 2009 as these receivables were reclassified to held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2009.On a full year basis, HDFS incurred $118 million loss largely due to $101 million of one-time items recorded during the year. In October, we said we expected HDFS to incur loss into the next couple of quarters due to seasonality, lower recovery values and higher cost of debt. Since then, HDFS continued to access the debt capital markets at relatively attractive cost of funds and repay the $600 million, 15% intercompany loan to Harley-Davidson, Inc. H-D, Inc. will hold the debt and will incur rebated interest expense.Repayment of this debt to H-D, Inc. positively impacted HDFS' fourth quarter results and going forward, we believe HDFS' cost of funds will be more reflective of current market interest rates. We expect the new interest rate structure will assist us in moving to profitability in 2010. Now Larry will review HDFS' operations and portfolio performance."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion",380,"Thanks, John. During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 29% compared to 2008. HDFS retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was down nearly five percentage points to 48.8% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to an increase in cash buyers and also due to competition, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment.At the end of the fourth quarter, of the approximately $4.8 billion of receivables that were classified as held for investment, $4 billion were retail and $863 million were wholesale. We are pleased with the progress resulting from the significant underwriting adjustments we made in 2009. We continue to see improved performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated in 2009 compared to the prior year.At the end of 2009, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were primed compared to approximately 75% in previous years. We continue to monitor the performance of these new originations very closely, and we will make changes to our underwriting standards that we deem appropriate. The impact of the recession and high unemployment continue to drive delinquencies and credit losses. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2009, was 6.51%, up slightly over 2008. Our increased collections' staffing levels and modified collection strategies have enabled us to manage delinquency levels close to last year, despite increase in unemployment in the U.S. Annualized retail credit losses increased to 2.86% for the full year in 2008, and were driven by a higher frequency of loss and a decline in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in improving our liquidity position and reducing our cost of funds. As we work through the winter months and given continued high unemployment rates in the U.S., we expect to continue to see higher levels of delinquent loans and retail credit losses in the near term. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate, and we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Now let me turn it back to John."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS obtained $1.8 billion of funding. Last quarter, we said we were engaged in reviewing our strategic options to find more diversified and cost-effective funding in order to meet HDFS' goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns in profitability. The process is progressing as we continue our discussion with several institutions. Realistically, we recognized that this is a challenge. However, we remain cautiously optimistic that we can find additional opportunities to improve HDFS' funding profile. In the meantime, we are pleased with HDFS' fourth quarter results, and are seeing some positive signs as we move into 2010.On Slide 24, you'll see our overall cash position and liquidity strategy. We ended this quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. This is a significant and welcomed improvement in liquidity from just one year ago, and we believe is an appropriate level given the uncertain economy. Of the total $1.7 billion, HDFS ended the year with $489 million in cash after repaying H-D, Inc. the $600 million it borrowed in February of 2009. Additionally, HDFS has access to approximately $2 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities. As of the end of 2009, we believe we have met HDFS' anticipated 2010 funding needs throughout 2009 actions. During the year, we expect to pre-fund our 2011 needs through the capital markets, and by renewing a portion of the bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities.Going forward, our strategy will be to maintain a minimum of 12 months of liquidity in cash and/or credit facilities. We will carry higher cash balances until we see stabilization and improvement in the economy, capital and credit markets and our company's credit ratings. We will continue to try to diversify our funding profile through a combination of short-term and long-term funding vehicles, reduce our reliance on the term asset-backed securitization market and continue to pursue all avenues to obtain cost-effective funding. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 25.On a continuing basis, Harley-Davidson Inc. 2009 revenue, net income and earnings per share were down compared to last year mainly due to significant one-time items related to restructuring and asset impairment charges and the reclassification of HDFS receivables during the year. On Slide 26, I would like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash, despite the large drop in motorcycle shipments and the restructuring spending that we incurred, we were able to generate operating cash of over $600 million, which included a fourth quarter contribution of $215 million to our pension plans.And second, our tax rate increased significantly in 2009 relative to 2008, primarily due to the one-time charge for the Wisconsin tax law change and the non-deductible HDFS goodwill write-off as well as the impact of reduced earnings. In 2010, we expect the full year effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% from continuing operations.We are proceeding with our plan to sell MV Agusta. As a result, MV Agusta's assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale and its financial results have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets resulting in non-cash of $53 million net of related tax benefits. For the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize a loss from discontinued operations. The details are on Slide 27.Now I'd like to talk about two important changes in our financial reporting. First, in the first quarter of 2010, FAS 166 and 167 will be adopted and approximately $1.9 billion of receivables and related debt will be brought back onto our balance sheet. Adoption will also result in a small adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we expect to remain in compliance with all our debt covenants. We will provide more details in the 2009 10-K.The second important change to our financials also involves HDFS. With the complexity and changing dynamics of the Financial Services business, we feel that it is important for our stakeholders to see more detail around our motorcycle and Financial Services segment. Therefore, in the 10-K, we will begin providing consolidating financial information that will breakdown the income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows for each segment.So all in all, 2009 was a challenging year. But we are confident that we have taken the appropriate actions to reserve greater profitability and drive long-term growth. We expect 2010 to be another challenging year. As a result, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments in 2010 to be between 201,000 and 212,000 motorcycles, down 5% to 10% from 2009 as a result of two key factors. First, we expect the global economy to remain challenging with continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence in United States. Second, we expect continued price competition from other manufacturers as they reduce excess inventories. We also anticipate price competition at the local level as retailers discount excess inventory driven by contraction of the dealer network.In 2010, we will take a conservative approach to shipment volumes as we continue to work with our dealers to aggressively balance supply in line with demand. And when demand improves, we will be ready to increase production. We expect gross margins to be between 32% and 33.5% for the full year. And capital expenditures are expected to be between $235 million and $255 million which includes approximately $95 million to $110 million in restructuring capital.As we put 2009 behind us, it is important to note that despite significantly lower volumes and restructuring spending, Harley-Davidson remains a very strong company with an incredibly powerful brand. Our strength is evidenced by our solid gross margins and our ability to generate positive cash from the Motorcycle segment in a challenging business environment. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the economic downturn and execute our long-term strategy. And now let's open the call up to your questions."

Our goal at HDFS has been to provide credit while balancing appropriate returns and profitability. And to that end, we've engaged an advisor and are discussing potential opportunities with several institutions. At this point, we're still in the process but we're realistic that this is just a challenge. There is no cookie-cutter model out there that says, here's how the best way to transfer red score to reduced lower cost of funds. But we're working on as diligent as we can, we remain cautiously optimistic that we had find some additional opportunities out there to improve the funding profile. But Tim, let's be clear we believe that HDFS provides a strategic advantage at Harley-Davidson. We also believe that the company benefited from having HDFS this year.

And again, we feel extremely pleased that our ability to hold up gross margins despite a 26% decline in shipments. Specifically to answer your question is that yes, we've been under -- our guidance has been below where we come in actuals and I think it's largely driven by the incredible productivity that the operations organization is generated. I couldn't be happier with the organization and unbuckling down and pulling forward productivity projects and we'll be focusing on continuous improvement everyday. And that's really what's been the -- delivering more than what we expected. In the fourth quarter specifically, a little bit of it was the Buell piece. So we expected a larger cost in gross margin in the fourth quarter. And again, as I had mentioned we got a higher cost in restructuring but a lower cost in gross margins..."

We've got a lot of ground to cover this morning, so we'll get right to it. And as you saw in the press release today, Harley-Davidson reported its first quarterly loss in many years, with full year revenues and profits decreased from last year. These results were not surprising. In fact, they were as we had expected, because they were the direct result of the economic climate and the decisive actions we took throughout the year, actions to deal not just with the recession, but to position our company for the future through the go-forward strategy that we unveiled in October. We firmly believe the short-term pain that Harley-Davidson is going through is a result of our actions, is worth the longer-term gain that we expect to see as a result. And we have confidence that we're doing the right things to manage our business prudently and effectively in this economy, and to restore Harley-Davidson to greater profitability going forward. So let's take a look at 2009 and our actions. And then I want to turn my attention to what lies ahead. When I joined Harley-Davidson in May, we set out two key priorities for our team. Firs was to continue to take the actions necessary, and execute effectively on our strategy to manage the business in the current economic environment. And at the same, it was even more essential that we develop a clear, comprehensive and powerful strategy to maximize our opportunities for growth and profitability going forward. And so looking at our actions to execute effectively in the current environment, we reduced shipment volumes significantly to align our inventories. We embarked on major restructuring of our production operations. We obtained funding for the lending activities of HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services] and positioned HDFS for solid footing in 2010, and launched our go-forward business strategy to deliver results by focusing on the four key pillars of our strategy, which are growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability.Under our strategy, we are focusing our investment behind the uniquely strong Harley-Davidson brand as the most attractive path to sustained long-term growth through products and experiences, global expansion, outreach to new customers and our commitment to core customers. And as we look at the year in front of us, we expect 2010 to continue to be challenging. Our strategy and the performance goals that we have laid out through 2014 are based on an appropriately prudent approach. And our growth targets will take hard work and intense focus to reach, but we believe they are imminently achievable and appropriately conservative.But even in an environment where consumers are more practical and cautious, we believe that people still dream about the Harley-Davidson experience. And everything we see indicates that the brand is in stronger, stronger than ever both in the U.S. and globally. So we will continue to solidify our position and execute on our go-forward strategy, including bringing exciting products to market like the Forty-Eight that we are introducing today and which, like the other Dark Custom bikes, is intended to reach new young adult customers. In addition to our focus on growing core and outreach markets in North America, we will also continue to focus on expanding the brand in international markets. Harley-Davidson's brand appeal around the world is as strong or stronger than ever. And so in summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results are a direct reflection of the economy and the actions that we took to manage the business prudently and effectively in the current environment and more importantly for the future.While we expect 2010 to be another challenging year for the industry and for Harley-Davidson, the Harley-Davidson brand has exceptional strength and we're highly focused on continuing to grow the reach of our brand around the world. And we have a great conviction that our go-forward strategy is focusing our company in the right direction and that we are executing our strategy with appropriate urgency. So with that, I'd like to say thanks and let me turn it over to John Olin for the numbers and then more of the details."

This morning I'll discuss some of the details around our financial results, provide an update on our restructuring activities and discuss an expectations for 2010. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing oper",1416,"Thanks, Keith. This morning I'll discuss some of the details around our financial results, provide an update on our restructuring activities and discuss an expectations for 2010. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing operations was down 40.2% and we recognized a loss for the first time in recent history. This loss was expected as a result of ongoing restructuring activity, costs associated with exiting the Buell product line and the impact of shipping 53% fewer bikes than the fourth quarter of last year.While the shipment reduction negatively impacted the quarter's results, the positive news is that our U.S. dealer network had a year-end inventory level that was significantly lower than last year and we believe appropriate for the current environment which I'll talk more about shortly.Moving on to Slide 11, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down worldwide during the fourth quarter and the full year 2009 compared to last year. A few points to note about retail sales. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide retail sales rate was flat compared to last quarter. In international markets we saw another sequential improvement in retail sales rate and after being down for three consecutive quarters, Europe was up slightly in the fourth quarter. Regarding market share, our U.S. market share decreased by 4.8 percentage points in the quarter as we lacked a strong fourth quarter 2008 share increase of 4.4 percentage points. Also, driving the decrease in fourth quarter 2009 market share were strong sales in the performance segment due to significant price discounting during the quarter. For the full year, our market share was up 7.9 percentage points versus 2008.On Slide 12, our U.S. dealer networks year-end retail inventory was down 18,000 units compared to last year. It was the third consecutive year we significantly reduced dealer inventory and we remain committed to the task of balancing supply in line with demand. As retail conditions remain challenging, we continue to execute our plan to help protect the integrity of our dealer network. In October, we estimated that 15 to 30 additional dealer points could close over the next six months. During the fourth quarter, 14 dealer points closed. So during 2009, a total of 28 dealer points closed. We continue to expect approximately 15 additional dealer points will close in the next three months.On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the full year were down 26.5% to 223,000 units. Of that total, Sportster represented 21.2% of shipments just slightly more than 2008 full year total. Mix shifted between the Custom and Touring families compared to 2008, primarily driven by the new Tri Glide models and shipments to international markets increased to 35% of the total.On the next slide, you'll see revenue in all categories of the Motorcycle and Related Products segment was down in the fourth quarter and the full year. The 45.6% decrease in Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue during the fourth quarter was primarily a result of lower shipments, partially offset by favorable shipment mix and favorable foreign currency exchange. P&A [Parts and Accessories] and General Merchandise revenue were down less than motorcycle revenue. Both were an important part of our growth strategy and we're excited about the prospects of these high margin businesses in the future.For example, the Fit Shop is a new P&A concept. It enables sales people to show customers how handle bars, seats, controls and suspension affect riding position comfort and confidence. General Merchandise just launched the new Pink Label Collection, a portion of the proceeds will support the Breast Cancer Network of Strength. Both support our strategy to reach a more diverse rider base. As retail sales, shipments and revenue have been down due to the recession, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and structuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. Throughout 2009, we announced significant restructuring efforts that will result in reduced administrative costs, reduced excess capacity and increased focus on our core operations. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to consolidate a three vehicle test facility into one location further streamlining operations. The estimated total costs and savings associated with our 2009 restructuring activities are summarized on Slide 15.During the fourth quarter, we shut down Buell production. The financial results related to Buell will continue to be reported as a component of income from operations. Related exit costs will be recorded as restructuring expenses and gross profit will continue to include earnings on the sale of our remaining Buell inventory. In 2009, we recorded approximately $116 million of the estimated $125 million in costs related to exiting Buell.On Slide 17, you'll see our total 2009 restructuring costs were $221 million, which exceeded our estimated range of $190 million to $210 million mainly driven by higher Buell restructuring costs. However, total Buell exit costs are still expected to be $125 million as there was favorability in the gross margin impact associated with the Buell product line exit.Restructuring savings were $91 million, slightly above the high end of our expected range. We now expect total restructuring and impairment costs will be between $430 million and $460 million through 2012 and we continue to expect total cumulative annual savings associated with our restructuring to be between $240 million and $260 million. Expected costs and savings by year are provided on the slide.On Slide 18, you will see gross margin in the quarter decreased to 20.3% of revenue compared to last year. As expected, gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by lower shipments and Buell exit costs. But also by unfavorable manufacturing costs due to loss absorption. Overall, material costs favorable mix and higher-than-expected productivity provided some favorable offset. Full year gross margin was 32.3% of revenue and we continue to be very pleased with the gross margin strength of our core business despite volume declines of over 26% from 2008.On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was a negative 29%, which was impacted by lower gross margin of $254 million, restructuring and asset impairments of $120 million and higher SG&A expenses. Full year operating margin decreased to 7.3% as a result of lower gross margin and restructuring and asset impairment charges. SG&A finished the year down by $91 million driven by an estimated $83 million in restructuring savings.Now moving on to our Financial Services segment. During the quarter HDFS recorded an operating loss of $7.1 million, an improvement of $17.8 million compared to last year. The main drivers of this improvement were income from past off-balance sheet securitization increased by $18.1 million during the quarter. Impairments to retain securitization interest for the fourth quarter 2009 were $9.8 million compared to $25.3 million impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Provision for retail loan losses increased by $19.9 million during the quarter, primarily due to a higher balance of held for invested receivables versus the prior year. And the provision for wholesale loan losses decreased by $7 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease resulted primarily from lower outstanding receivables due to reduced motorcycle inventory in the dealer network from a year ago.It is encouraging that our credit risk assumptions in both the retail and wholesale portfolio did not change significantly from the third quarter of 2009. The remaining $11.1 million of improvement is primarily the result of a fourth quarter 2008 provision for lower of cost or market adjustments on held-for-sale receivables. There is no comparable item in the fourth quarter of 2009 as these receivables were reclassified to held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2009.On a full year basis, HDFS incurred $118 million loss largely due to $101 million of one-time items recorded during the year. In October, we said we expected HDFS to incur loss into the next couple of quarters due to seasonality, lower recovery values and higher cost of debt. Since then, HDFS continued to access the debt capital markets at relatively attractive cost of funds and repay the $600 million, 15% intercompany loan to Harley-Davidson, Inc. H-D, Inc. will hold the debt and will incur rebated interest expense.Repayment of this debt to H-D, Inc. positively impacted HDFS' fourth quarter results and going forward, we believe HDFS' cost of funds will be more reflective of current market interest rates. We expect the new interest rate structure will assist us in moving to profitability in 2010. Now Larry will review HDFS' operations and portfolio performance."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion",380,"Thanks, John. During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 29% compared to 2008. HDFS retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was down nearly five percentage points to 48.8% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to an increase in cash buyers and also due to competition, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment.At the end of the fourth quarter, of the approximately $4.8 billion of receivables that were classified as held for investment, $4 billion were retail and $863 million were wholesale. We are pleased with the progress resulting from the significant underwriting adjustments we made in 2009. We continue to see improved performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated in 2009 compared to the prior year.At the end of 2009, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were primed compared to approximately 75% in previous years. We continue to monitor the performance of these new originations very closely, and we will make changes to our underwriting standards that we deem appropriate. The impact of the recession and high unemployment continue to drive delinquencies and credit losses. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2009, was 6.51%, up slightly over 2008. Our increased collections' staffing levels and modified collection strategies have enabled us to manage delinquency levels close to last year, despite increase in unemployment in the U.S. Annualized retail credit losses increased to 2.86% for the full year in 2008, and were driven by a higher frequency of loss and a decline in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in improving our liquidity position and reducing our cost of funds. As we work through the winter months and given continued high unemployment rates in the U.S., we expect to continue to see higher levels of delinquent loans and retail credit losses in the near term. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate, and we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Now let me turn it back to John."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS obtained $1.8 billion of funding. Last quarter, we said we were engaged in reviewing our strategic options to find more diversified and cost-effective funding in order to meet HDFS' goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns in profitability. The process is progressing as we continue our discussion with several institutions. Realistically, we recognized that this is a challenge. However, we remain cautiously optimistic that we can find additional opportunities to improve HDFS' funding profile. In the meantime, we are pleased with HDFS' fourth quarter results, and are seeing some positive signs as we move into 2010.On Slide 24, you'll see our overall cash position and liquidity strategy. We ended this quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. This is a significant and welcomed improvement in liquidity from just one year ago, and we believe is an appropriate level given the uncertain economy. Of the total $1.7 billion, HDFS ended the year with $489 million in cash after repaying H-D, Inc. the $600 million it borrowed in February of 2009. Additionally, HDFS has access to approximately $2 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities. As of the end of 2009, we believe we have met HDFS' anticipated 2010 funding needs throughout 2009 actions. During the year, we expect to pre-fund our 2011 needs through the capital markets, and by renewing a portion of the bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities.Going forward, our strategy will be to maintain a minimum of 12 months of liquidity in cash and/or credit facilities. We will carry higher cash balances until we see stabilization and improvement in the economy, capital and credit markets and our company's credit ratings. We will continue to try to diversify our funding profile through a combination of short-term and long-term funding vehicles, reduce our reliance on the term asset-backed securitization market and continue to pursue all avenues to obtain cost-effective funding. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 25.On a continuing basis, Harley-Davidson Inc. 2009 revenue, net income and earnings per share were down compared to last year mainly due to significant one-time items related to restructuring and asset impairment charges and the reclassification of HDFS receivables during the year. On Slide 26, I would like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash, despite the large drop in motorcycle shipments and the restructuring spending that we incurred, we were able to generate operating cash of over $600 million, which included a fourth quarter contribution of $215 million to our pension plans.And second, our tax rate increased significantly in 2009 relative to 2008, primarily due to the one-time charge for the Wisconsin tax law change and the non-deductible HDFS goodwill write-off as well as the impact of reduced earnings. In 2010, we expect the full year effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% from continuing operations.We are proceeding with our plan to sell MV Agusta. As a result, MV Agusta's assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale and its financial results have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets resulting in non-cash of $53 million net of related tax benefits. For the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize a loss from discontinued operations. The details are on Slide 27.Now I'd like to talk about two important changes in our financial reporting. First, in the first quarter of 2010, FAS 166 and 167 will be adopted and approximately $1.9 billion of receivables and related debt will be brought back onto our balance sheet. Adoption will also result in a small adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we expect to remain in compliance with all our debt covenants. We will provide more details in the 2009 10-K.The second important change to our financials also involves HDFS. With the complexity and changing dynamics of the Financial Services business, we feel that it is important for our stakeholders to see more detail around our motorcycle and Financial Services segment. Therefore, in the 10-K, we will begin providing consolidating financial information that will breakdown the income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows for each segment.So all in all, 2009 was a challenging year. But we are confident that we have taken the appropriate actions to reserve greater profitability and drive long-term growth. We expect 2010 to be another challenging year. As a result, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments in 2010 to be between 201,000 and 212,000 motorcycles, down 5% to 10% from 2009 as a result of two key factors. First, we expect the global economy to remain challenging with continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence in United States. Second, we expect continued price competition from other manufacturers as they reduce excess inventories. We also anticipate price competition at the local level as retailers discount excess inventory driven by contraction of the dealer network.In 2010, we will take a conservative approach to shipment volumes as we continue to work with our dealers to aggressively balance supply in line with demand. And when demand improves, we will be ready to increase production. We expect gross margins to be between 32% and 33.5% for the full year. And capital expenditures are expected to be between $235 million and $255 million which includes approximately $95 million to $110 million in restructuring capital.As we put 2009 behind us, it is important to note that despite significantly lower volumes and restructuring spending, Harley-Davidson remains a very strong company with an incredibly powerful brand. Our strength is evidenced by our solid gross margins and our ability to generate positive cash from the Motorcycle segment in a challenging business environment. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the economic downturn and execute our long-term strategy. And now let's open the call up to your questions."

Our goal at HDFS has been to provide credit while balancing appropriate returns and profitability. And to that end, we've engaged an advisor and are discussing potential opportunities with several institutions. At this point, we're still in the process but we're realistic that this is just a challenge.

I couldn't be happier with the organization and unbuckling down and pulling forward productivity projects and we'll be focusing on continuous improvement everyday. And that's really what's been the -- delivering more than what we expected. In the fourth quarter specifically, a little bit of it was the Buell piece. So we expected a larger cost in gross margin in the fourth quarter. And again, as I had mentioned we got a higher cost in restructuring but a lower cost in gross margins..."

It was done with the understanding that they would pay the funds back when the liquidity improved. It was basically a bridge in an illiquid market. So in the end, the repayment of the EGI [ph] debt does not impact the consolidated earnings at all but it will more accurately reflect the economics of HDFS going forward.

We've got a lot of ground to cover this morning, so we'll get right to it. And as you saw in the press release today, Harley-Davidson reported its first quarterly loss in many years, with full year revenues and profits decreased from last year. These results were not surprising. In fact, they were as we had expected, because they were the direct result of the economic climate and the decisive actions we took throughout the year, actions to deal not just with the recession, but to position our company for the future through the go-forward strategy that we unveiled in October. We firmly believe the short-term pain that Harley-Davidson is going through is a result of our actions, is worth the longer-term gain that we expect to see as a result. And we have confidence that we're doing the right things to manage our business prudently and effectively in this economy, and to restore Harley-Davidson to greater profitability going forward. So let's take a look at 2009 and our actions. And then I want to turn my attention to what lies ahead. When I joined Harley-Davidson in May, we set out two key priorities for our team. Firs was to continue to take the actions necessary, and execute effectively on our strategy to manage the business in the current economic environment. And at the same, it was even more essential that we develop a clear, comprehensive and powerful strategy to maximize our opportunities for growth and profitability going forward. And so looking at our actions to execute effectively in the current environment, we reduced shipment volumes significantly to align our inventories. We embarked on major restructuring of our production operations. We obtained funding for the lending activities of HDFS [Harley-Davidson Financial Services] and positioned HDFS for solid footing in 2010, and launched our go-forward business strategy to deliver results by focusing on the four key pillars of our strategy, which are growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability.Under our strategy, we are focusing our investment behind the uniquely strong Harley-Davidson brand as the most attractive path to sustained long-term growth through products and experiences, global expansion, outreach to new customers and our commitment to core customers. And as we look at the year in front of us, we expect 2010 to continue to be challenging. Our strategy and the performance goals that we have laid out through 2014 are based on an appropriately prudent approach. And our growth targets will take hard work and intense focus to reach, but we believe they are imminently achievable and appropriately conservative.But even in an environment where consumers are more practical and cautious, we believe that people still dream about the Harley-Davidson experience. And everything we see indicates that the brand is in stronger, stronger than ever both in the U.S. and globally. So we will continue to solidify our position and execute on our go-forward strategy, including bringing exciting products to market like the Forty-Eight that we are introducing today and which, like the other Dark Custom bikes, is intended to reach new young adult customers. In addition to our focus on growing core and outreach markets in North America, we will also continue to focus on expanding the brand in international markets. Harley-Davidson's brand appeal around the world is as strong or stronger than ever. And so in summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results are a direct reflection of the economy and the actions that we took to manage the business prudently and effectively in the current environment and more importantly for the future.While we expect 2010 to be another challenging year for the industry and for Harley-Davidson, the Harley-Davidson brand has exceptional strength and we're highly focused on continuing to grow the reach of our brand around the world. And we have a great conviction that our go-forward strategy is focusing our company in the right direction and that we are executing our strategy with appropriate urgency. So with that, I'd like to say thanks and let me turn it over to John Olin for the numbers and then more of the details."

This morning I'll discuss some of the details around our financial results, provide an update on our restructuring activities and discuss an expectations for 2010. During the fourth quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. revenue from continuing operations was down 40.2% and we recognized a loss for the first time in recent history. This loss was expected as a result of ongoing restructuring activity, costs associated with exiting the Buell product line and the impact of shipping 53% fewer bikes than the fourth quarter of last year.While the shipment reduction negatively impacted the quarter's results, the positive news is that our U.S. dealer network had a year-end inventory level that was significantly lower than last year and we believe appropriate for the current environment which I'll talk more about shortly.Moving on to Slide 11, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down worldwide during the fourth quarter and the full year 2009 compared to last year. A few points to note about retail sales. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide retail sales rate was flat compared to last quarter. In international markets we saw another sequential improvement in retail sales rate and after being down for three consecutive quarters, Europe was up slightly in the fourth quarter. Regarding market share, our U.S. market share decreased by 4.8 percentage points in the quarter as we lacked a strong fourth quarter 2008 share increase of 4.4 percentage points. Also, driving the decrease in fourth quarter 2009 market share were strong sales in the performance segment due to significant price discounting during the quarter. For the full year, our market share was up 7.9 percentage points versus 2008.On Slide 12, our U.S. dealer networks year-end retail inventory was down 18,000 units compared to last year. It was the third consecutive year we significantly reduced dealer inventory and we remain committed to the task of balancing supply in line with demand. As retail conditions remain challenging, we continue to execute our plan to help protect the integrity of our dealer network. In October, we estimated that 15 to 30 additional dealer points could close over the next six months. During the fourth quarter, 14 dealer points closed. So during 2009, a total of 28 dealer points closed. We continue to expect approximately 15 additional dealer points will close in the next three months.On Slide 13, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the full year were down 26.5% to 223,000 units. Of that total, Sportster represented 21.2% of shipments just slightly more than 2008 full year total. Mix shifted between the Custom and Touring families compared to 2008, primarily driven by the new Tri Glide models and shipments to international markets increased to 35% of the total.On the next slide, you'll see revenue in all categories of the Motorcycle and Related Products segment was down in the fourth quarter and the full year. The 45.6% decrease in Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue during the fourth quarter was primarily a result of lower shipments, partially offset by favorable shipment mix and favorable foreign currency exchange. P&A [Parts and Accessories] and General Merchandise revenue were down less than motorcycle revenue. Both were an important part of our growth strategy and we're excited about the prospects of these high margin businesses in the future.For example, the Fit Shop is a new P&A concept. It enables sales people to show customers how handle bars, seats, controls and suspension affect riding position comfort and confidence. General Merchandise just launched the new Pink Label Collection, a portion of the proceeds will support the Breast Cancer Network of Strength. Both support our strategy to reach a more diverse rider base. As retail sales, shipments and revenue have been down due to the recession, we have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and structuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. Throughout 2009, we announced significant restructuring efforts that will result in reduced administrative costs, reduced excess capacity and increased focus on our core operations. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to consolidate a three vehicle test facility into one location further streamlining operations. The estimated total costs and savings associated with our 2009 restructuring activities are summarized on Slide 15.During the fourth quarter, we shut down Buell production. The financial results related to Buell will continue to be reported as a component of income from operations. Related exit costs will be recorded as restructuring expenses and gross profit will continue to include earnings on the sale of our remaining Buell inventory. In 2009, we recorded approximately $116 million of the estimated $125 million in costs related to exiting Buell.On Slide 17, you'll see our total 2009 restructuring costs were $221 million, which exceeded our estimated range of $190 million to $210 million mainly driven by higher Buell restructuring costs. However, total Buell exit costs are still expected to be $125 million as there was favorability in the gross margin impact associated with the Buell product line exit.Restructuring savings were $91 million, slightly above the high end of our expected range. We now expect total restructuring and impairment costs will be between $430 million and $460 million through 2012 and we continue to expect total cumulative annual savings associated with our restructuring to be between $240 million and $260 million. Expected costs and savings by year are provided on the slide.On Slide 18, you will see gross margin in the quarter decreased to 20.3% of revenue compared to last year. As expected, gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by lower shipments and Buell exit costs. But also by unfavorable manufacturing costs due to loss absorption. Overall, material costs favorable mix and higher-than-expected productivity provided some favorable offset. Full year gross margin was 32.3% of revenue and we continue to be very pleased with the gross margin strength of our core business despite volume declines of over 26% from 2008.On Slide 19, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was a negative 29%, which was impacted by lower gross margin of $254 million, restructuring and asset impairments of $120 million and higher SG&A expenses. Full year operating margin decreased to 7.3% as a result of lower gross margin and restructuring and asset impairment charges. SG&A finished the year down by $91 million driven by an estimated $83 million in restructuring savings.Now moving on to our Financial Services segment. During the quarter HDFS recorded an operating loss of $7.1 million, an improvement of $17.8 million compared to last year. The main drivers of this improvement were income from past off-balance sheet securitization increased by $18.1 million during the quarter. Impairments to retain securitization interest for the fourth quarter 2009 were $9.8 million compared to $25.3 million impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Provision for retail loan losses increased by $19.9 million during the quarter, primarily due to a higher balance of held for invested receivables versus the prior year. And the provision for wholesale loan losses decreased by $7 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease resulted primarily from lower outstanding receivables due to reduced motorcycle inventory in the dealer network from a year ago.It is encouraging that our credit risk assumptions in both the retail and wholesale portfolio did not change significantly from the third quarter of 2009. The remaining $11.1 million of improvement is primarily the result of a fourth quarter 2008 provision for lower of cost or market adjustments on held-for-sale receivables. There is no comparable item in the fourth quarter of 2009 as these receivables were reclassified to held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2009.On a full year basis, HDFS incurred $118 million loss largely due to $101 million of one-time items recorded during the year. In October, we said we expected HDFS to incur loss into the next couple of quarters due to seasonality, lower recovery values and higher cost of debt. Since then, HDFS continued to access the debt capital markets at relatively attractive cost of funds and repay the $600 million, 15% intercompany loan to Harley-Davidson, Inc. H-D, Inc. will hold the debt and will incur rebated interest expense.Repayment of this debt to H-D, Inc. positively impacted HDFS' fourth quarter results and going forward, we believe HDFS' cost of funds will be more reflective of current market interest rates. We expect the new interest rate structure will assist us in moving to profitability in 2010. Now Larry will review HDFS' operations and portfolio performance."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion",380,"Thanks, John. During the fourth quarter, HDFS originated $284 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 25% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. For the full year, HDFS originated $2 billion in retail motorcycle loans, down 29% compared to 2008. HDFS retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was down nearly five percentage points to 48.8% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to an increase in cash buyers and also due to competition, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment.At the end of the fourth quarter, of the approximately $4.8 billion of receivables that were classified as held for investment, $4 billion were retail and $863 million were wholesale. We are pleased with the progress resulting from the significant underwriting adjustments we made in 2009. We continue to see improved performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated in 2009 compared to the prior year.At the end of 2009, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were primed compared to approximately 75% in previous years. We continue to monitor the performance of these new originations very closely, and we will make changes to our underwriting standards that we deem appropriate. The impact of the recession and high unemployment continue to drive delinquencies and credit losses. The 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2009, was 6.51%, up slightly over 2008. Our increased collections' staffing levels and modified collection strategies have enabled us to manage delinquency levels close to last year, despite increase in unemployment in the U.S. Annualized retail credit losses increased to 2.86% for the full year in 2008, and were driven by a higher frequency of loss and a decline in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in improving our liquidity position and reducing our cost of funds. As we work through the winter months and given continued high unemployment rates in the U.S., we expect to continue to see higher levels of delinquent loans and retail credit losses in the near term. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate, and we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Now let me turn it back to John."

During the fourth quarter, HDFS obtained $1.8 billion of funding. Last quarter, we said we were engaged in reviewing our strategic options to find more diversified and cost-effective funding in order to meet HDFS' goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns in profitability. The process is progressing as we continue our discussion with several institutions. Realistically, we recognized that this is a challenge. However, we remain cautiously optimistic that we can find additional opportunities to improve HDFS' funding profile. In the meantime, we are pleased with HDFS' fourth quarter results, and are seeing some positive signs as we move into 2010.On Slide 24, you'll see our overall cash position and liquidity strategy. We ended this quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. This is a significant and welcomed improvement in liquidity from just one year ago, and we believe is an appropriate level given the uncertain economy. Of the total $1.7 billion, HDFS ended the year with $489 million in cash after repaying H-D, Inc. the $600 million it borrowed in February of 2009. Additionally, HDFS has access to approximately $2 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities. As of the end of 2009, we believe we have met HDFS' anticipated 2010 funding needs throughout 2009 actions. During the year, we expect to pre-fund our 2011 needs through the capital markets, and by renewing a portion of the bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities.Going forward, our strategy will be to maintain a minimum of 12 months of liquidity in cash and/or credit facilities. We will carry higher cash balances until we see stabilization and improvement in the economy, capital and credit markets and our company's credit ratings. We will continue to try to diversify our funding profile through a combination of short-term and long-term funding vehicles, reduce our reliance on the term asset-backed securitization market and continue to pursue all avenues to obtain cost-effective funding. Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 25.On a continuing basis, Harley-Davidson Inc. 2009 revenue, net income and earnings per share were down compared to last year mainly due to significant one-time items related to restructuring and asset impairment charges and the reclassification of HDFS receivables during the year. On Slide 26, I would like to highlight two items. First, with regards to operating cash, despite the large drop in motorcycle shipments and the restructuring spending that we incurred, we were able to generate operating cash of over $600 million, which included a fourth quarter contribution of $215 million to our pension plans.And second, our tax rate increased significantly in 2009 relative to 2008, primarily due to the one-time charge for the Wisconsin tax law change and the non-deductible HDFS goodwill write-off as well as the impact of reduced earnings. In 2010, we expect the full year effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% from continuing operations.We are proceeding with our plan to sell MV Agusta. As a result, MV Agusta's assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale and its financial results have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets resulting in non-cash of $53 million net of related tax benefits. For the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize a loss from discontinued operations. The details are on Slide 27.Now I'd like to talk about two important changes in our financial reporting. First, in the first quarter of 2010, FAS 166 and 167 will be adopted and approximately $1.9 billion of receivables and related debt will be brought back onto our balance sheet. Adoption will also result in a small adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we expect to remain in compliance with all our debt covenants. We will provide more details in the 2009 10-K.The second important change to our financials also involves HDFS. With the complexity and changing dynamics of the Financial Services business, we feel that it is important for our stakeholders to see more detail around our motorcycle and Financial Services segment. Therefore, in the 10-K, we will begin providing consolidating financial information that will breakdown the income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows for each segment.So all in all, 2009 was a challenging year. But we are confident that we have taken the appropriate actions to reserve greater profitability and drive long-term growth. We expect 2010 to be another challenging year. As a result, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments in 2010 to be between 201,000 and 212,000 motorcycles, down 5% to 10% from 2009 as a result of two key factors. First, we expect the global economy to remain challenging with continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence in United States. Second, we expect continued price competition from other manufacturers as they reduce excess inventories. We also anticipate price competition at the local level as retailers discount excess inventory driven by contraction of the dealer network.In 2010, we will take a conservative approach to shipment volumes as we continue to work with our dealers to aggressively balance supply in line with demand. And when demand improves, we will be ready to increase production. We expect gross margins to be between 32% and 33.5% for the full year. And capital expenditures are expected to be between $235 million and $255 million which includes approximately $95 million to $110 million in restructuring capital.As we put 2009 behind us, it is important to note that despite significantly lower volumes and restructuring spending, Harley-Davidson remains a very strong company with an incredibly powerful brand. Our strength is evidenced by our solid gross margins and our ability to generate positive cash from the Motorcycle segment in a challenging business environment. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the economic downturn and execute our long-term strategy. And now let's open the call up to your questions."

Our goal at HDFS has been to provide credit while balancing appropriate returns and profitability. And to that end, we've engaged an advisor and are discussing potential opportunities with several institutions. At this point, we're still in the process but we're realistic that this is just a challenge.

It benefited both the company and our dealers and any arrangement must be with their company's long-term interest at heart and that includes underwriting, long-term commitment and certainly, recognition of any of the value that HDFS brings to the organization."

What we said on last quarter when we announced that we were exiting the Buell product line is we expected $125 million of exit costs. That hasn't changed. Those costs were broken up into -- we'd hit in two lines of our P&L, one in the restructuring costs and the other in gross margin. As I mentioned before, the gross margin piece is to discount some of those bikes to clear the market. During the quarter, $71 million hit in restructuring. So for the motorcycle segment, we had $221 million on a full-year basis, $71 million of that was for restructuring at Buell. And that was about $10 million higher than we originally anticipated. However, the gross margin piece that hit in the fourth quarter was $45 million, and that was favorable in the same neighborhood as the unfavorability. So overall the $125 million is on track. However, restructuring piece is higher."

Still trying to get a sense of whether we'd see similar mix as we've seen in the last 10 years. Just with a general comment like that even if you don't put a number on it."

Obviously, we just announced today that we're launching a new model called the 48, which is another extension, if you will, of that line, sort of in the dark-custom family that's intended to reach out to younger riders. We've had tremendous success with the dark-custom line up in terms of attracting young buyers to the Harley-Davidson brand. Unfortunately, because of the economy the way it is and maybe some of the younger folks having more difficulty having access to capital or borrowing, I'm sure it's impacted it somewhat. But overall, we feel pretty encouraged, and we continue to see that as just a very important part of our line up going forward."

As we noted in our earnings release, we are making good progress on a number of fronts with some encouraging directional improvements.
We recorded earnings of $0.29 a share from continuing operations, which are the best earnings we have posted since last year's first quarter. Worldwide dealer retail sales of our motorcycles declined 18.2% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. And this was the smallest quarterly year-over-year decline since the last year's first quarter and the rate of decline lessened throughout the first quarter. 
We returned Harley-Davidson Financial Services to profitability, with operating income of $26.7 million.  Given all the difficulties of the past year, this is especially welcome news that reflects extremely well on the team at HDFS. 
We are on track with our restructuring activities, including the transformation underway at our York, Pennsylvania factory.
We believe dealer inventory is at an appropriate level in aggregate for our current market and our expectations for the year. Managing supply in line with demand will continue to be a priority for our company. And we are moving full speed ahead with our go-forward business strategy. So let me say thanks at the outset to all of our employees, dealers and suppliers for all the hard work and efforts [ph] to deliver the results that we are seeing. 
There's no doubt that we still have a long way to go, and it will continue to be a bumpy road on a number of fronts, given the uncertainty that remains in the economy and ongoing consumer caution. Still, it's good to see the progress that's occurring as a result of the actions that we've put into motion last year to strengthen Harley-Davidson and to grow the reach of the brand.
Our entire team is moving with great purpose and speed as we implement our go-forward business strategy with a focus on global growth and continuous improvement. So let me just take a couple of minutes to highlight a few of the things that are unfolding through our strategy in contributing to our momentum.
Like last year's Iron 883 motorcycle, the new 48 that we introduced this January is getting great traction. The 48 is the latest in our Dark Custom series of motorcycles designed to appeal to young adults. And in particular, we're having a hard time keeping it in our dealerships. We are seeing good results from two marketing programs that are currently underway. Our competitive bike exchange has generated a marked increase in trade-ins from competitive bike owners, with many of them moving over to one of our Touring bikes.
Once more, this program is succeeding on one of its main objectives, which is to let people know that our dealers are taking in competitive trade-ins. And the Ride Easy Guarantee is exceeding its target goals for selling the remaining non-current model year new motorcycles.
In March, Women's Garage Party month attracted more than 25,000 women to dealerships to learn about and get more comfortable on our bikes. Dealers enthusiastically embraced this program, holding some 450 garage parties. And many of the women attending are enrolling in our Rider's Edge New Rider Course. And anecdotally, dealers are reporting a positive sales impact.
We are reinvigorating our customer experience and events in a number of ways. At Daytona Bike Week last month, we moved our primary show venue from the convention center to a street event in the heart of the action across the street with dealership. We repositioned our Demo Ride Program at Daytona to reach him a more competitively-focused audience. And we conducted more than 8,300 demo rides during that bike week.  And for the first time, even non-riders could experience the feel of a Harley for themselves on stationary dynamometers. 
On the international front, we continue to expand our footprint. Last month, we announced the appointment of five dealerships in India. And I'm pleased to announce that at 7:45 a.m. this morning, India Standard Time, our new dealer in Mumbai took the first official booking of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle order in India, a 2010 XL 1200N Nightster. The international dealer network is expanding elsewhere as well. We're opening a dealership in Ecuador this month. And in May, the first of four newly-appointed dealers will open in Mexico.
Every year, we conduct Harley Owners Group officer training in various sites across the country. Two weeks ago, about 1,200 of these loyal enthusiasts were in Milwaukee for training. And more than a third of them were from international markets that represented over 25 countries. H.O.G. has more than 1 million members worldwide. And I can tell you from the time I spent with these members of this local chapter officers training, they are unbelievable ambassadors for our brand. So as you can see, there's an incredible amount of activity underway to support our growth strategy, and I've just barely scratched the surface.
Turning for a moment to continuous improvement, the restructuring of our York operations is well underway and the project is on target and on schedule and is exceeding our expectations. The physical restructuring and cultural change processes are on schedule, as is the outsourcing of non-core operations.
We have implemented the work rule changes in the new contract and our employees are involved and engaged. And in March, the plant had two days of weather-related closings, yet we still met the full-month production schedule, as a result of the improved productivity and efficiencies that exceeded our target. In short, we have seen a significant accomplishment from this facility, which is a testament to the commitment and focused effort by the entire team at York and our union leadership.
In Milwaukee, we're also on target with our restructuring activities. We expect to largely complete the consolidation of Powertrain Operations by the end of the second quarter. And moving forward, we will remain intently focused on identifying the competitive gaps and closing those gaps wherever they exist in our operations. We believe there are still many opportunities to improve efficiency, flexibility and cost competitiveness and align production across our operations.
So in summary, we're making good progress and we're seeing some encouraging signs, even as we continue to deal with the level of uncertainty in the global economy. The Harley-Davidson brand remains powerful and strong, with great appeal to both current and new customers in the U.S. and globally. We have a great conviction on our-go forward strategy is focusing our company in the right direction and that we are executing our strategy with the appropriate urgency.  Now let me turn it over to John Olin for a more detailed look at the financial results."

During the first quarter, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 18.9%. This was expected as we shipped 28.1% fewer motorcycles than the first quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations and earnings per share were both down, as a result of lower revenue and the impact of ongoing restructuring activities.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 10. During the first quarter, our dealers' retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 18.2% on a worldwide basis as compared to last year. While an 18% reduction is disappointing, it was not unexpected given the overall economic conditions. Despite lower overall retail sales, we have made some encouraging progress on the retail front. On a sequential basis, comparing the last quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010, we saw an improvement in the rate of retail sales decline in the U.S. and international markets. In addition, the Europe region posted sales increases for the second consecutive quarter. 
Regarding market share, our U.S. market share decreased by 2.3 percentage points in the first quarter, as we lapped a strong first quarter 2009 share increase of 8.2 percentage points and as we continue to face significant price competition from many of our competitors. 
Now let's talk about the health of the U.S. dealer network on Slide 11. First, and I know you've heard me say this numerous times, but it's important to reiterate that we remain committed to aggressively managing the supply of motorcycles in line with demand. We believe this will help protect our premium brand, which ultimately helps keep the dealer network strong. 
As we exited the first quarter, U.S. dealers' retail inventory was down over 23,000 units for the first quarter of 2009 and considerably from the peak in 2006. As Keith mentioned, we feel that the U.S. dealer inventory level is appropriate as we begin the 2010 selling season. However, our dealers are carrying a higher level of previous model year motorcycles than they normally do at this time of year, primarily due to the steep decline in retail sales experienced in the second quarter of 2009.
We are supporting our dealers' efforts to sell through these motorcycles. Keith talked about our efforts during the quarter, including the Ride Easy Guarantee, which offers value added incentives on the purchase of certain previous model year custom motorcycles and special financing for certain qualified purchasers of previous model year Sportsters. Also during the quarter, we offered a program which encouraged competitive owners to trade in their bike for a new Harley-Davidson. This program successfully drove targeted consumers into the dealerships and encouraged sales during the early spring.
The U.S. dealer network remains profitable. Through the first three months of the year, we lost only six dealer points versus a forecast of up to 15 dealer point closures. The start of the selling season was a welcome improvement to all our dealers who persevered through a very long winter. We do expect more dealers to close due to financial issues. And as we've said before, we believe that some contraction of the dealer network is healthy at this time.
As we move forward, we have several levels of insight into our dealer financials through our Motorcycle business, as well as through HDFS. We have realistic expectations and are taking a proactive approach to maintain a healthy dealer network. Our international dealer network remains healthy as well. And we believe there is potential to add 100 to 150 international dealer points through 2014, as we have stated in our strategic plan.
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the first quarter were down 28% compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were in line with our expectations and resulted in significantly lower dealer inventory than one year ago. Sportster represented 15.3% of shipments, down 7.2 percentage points from last year. Conversely, Touring mix increased 7.9 percentage points, aided by strong Tri Glide sales and continued strength of our high-end offerings. This adjustment in mix continues to balance deals inventory that has been disrupted by the economic crisis. 
As you may recall, we increased Sportster production in the first half of 2009 in anticipation of a more price-conscious consumer, preference skewed toward the higher-end models. So we significantly reduced productions of 2010 Sportsters in the fourth quarter of last year.  Still, retail inventories of 2009 model year Sportsters remained high as we entered into the first quarter. Also, keep in mind that last year, shipments of the new Iron 883 started in the beginning of the first quarter. And this year's new Sportster, 48 did not start shipping until later in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect to ship between 55,000 and 60,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles to our worldwide dealers, which is in line with last year's second quarter shipments of 58,000 units.
On Slide 13, you'll see revenue in all categories of the motorcycle and related product segments were down in the first quarter. The 20.0% decrease in Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue during the first quarter was primarily the result of lower shipments, partially offset by favorable shipment mix and foreign currency exchange rates. As retail sales, shipments and revenue have been down due to the recession. We have been intensely focused on improving our cost structure and structuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. 
Throughout 2009, we announced significant restructuring efforts that will reduce administrative costs, eliminate excess capacity and increase focus on core operations. During the quarter, we incurred $48.2 million in restructuring expenses. We remained on track to deliver the expected full year total cost and savings associated with our restructuring activities, which are summarized on Slide 14. 
On Slide 15, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 36.6%, a half percentage point below the same quarter last year. As expected, gross margin was positively impacted by significantly more favorable mix, as I explained earlier. Mix favorability was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, due mainly to loss absorption.
Productivity in our operations continues to be strong, especially considering the consolidation taking place in our Powertrain Operation and the transformation underway at our York facility. First quarter gross margin exceeded our full year guidance, largely due to strong mix shift between Touring and Sportster. As the year progresses, we anticipate Sportster mix will end up in line with the historical range, and we continue to expect full year gross margin will be between 32% and 33.5%.
On Slide 16, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 12.2%, which was impacted by $94.5 million of lower gross margin and higher restructuring costs of $13.3 million, partially offset by lower operating expenses. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment. On January 1, we adopted FAS 166 and 167. On Slide 17, you will see a summary of the adjustments to implement those accounting changes. As a result of the adjustments, HDFS recorded assets and liabilities associated with the securitization transactions previously recorded as off balance sheet. The largest impacts were due to recording of approximately $1.9 billion in finance receivables and related debt, as well as a $41.0 million one-time charge to retained earnings.
HDFS' quarterly results, one of our big headlines today, are on Slide 18. In the first quarter, HDFS posted a $26.7 million profit, an improvement of over $15 million compared to last year. We believe that with the adoption of FAS 166 and 167, our financials for HDFS will provide a more transparent, easier to understand view of the business. Having said that, over the next several quarters, the year-over-year reconciliation as is presented on this slide will be impacted by comparability issues due to the extensive accounting changes from last year.
The key drivers for the quarter improvement were: Net interest income was favorable $36.4 million compared to last year, as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables and an improvement in the net interest spread, as the cost of funds of HDFS has decreased. The provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with on-balance sheet held for investment retail receivables, was $28.5 million higher compared to the first quarter last year, as all receivables are now on balance sheet. Importantly, our credit risk assumptions in the retail portfolio did not change significantly from the prior quarter.
The impact of the provision for wholesale receivables is favorable compared to last year on a 29% smaller wholesale receivable balance from the prior year. And operating expenses were lower during the first quarter, as a result of restructuring savings in the business. The $2 million all other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer have gain on sale accounting. And the items that existed last year were income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees, low comp adjustments and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest.
After three quarters of losses, we are pleased to see HDFS return to profitability. Lower cost of funds, improving credit loss trends and improving values of repossessed motorcycles have all contributed to a strong quarter at HDFS, which Larry will tell you more about now."

During the first quarter, HDFS originated $374 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 21% compared to last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U. S. HDFS' retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sold in the U.S. was down nearly five percentage points to 42.1% in the first quarter compared to last year, as dealers are reporting more cash buyers in the market.
Also, we are seeing increased activity from competitors, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment. At the end of the first quarter, of the approximately $6.6 billion of net finance receivables, $5.6 billion were retail and $1 billion were wholesale. We continue to see good credit performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January 2009. In the first quarter, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes. 
Now moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 20, where you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.57%, which is better than both the comparable quarter-end results in 2008 and 2009.
Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively manage delinquency levels and bring them down compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U. S. 
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 58 basis points to 2.83% for the first quarter of 2009, driven by lower frequency of loss and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
So in conclusion, HDFS remains the primary source of funding for Harley-Davidson wholesale and retail motorcycle lending, and our profit this quarter is encouraging. We continue to make progress as our cost of funds has decreased and the performance of our portfolio has improved compared to last year. With unemployment near 10% and ongoing economic challenges, we'll continue to watch losses and delinquencies closely. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate, and we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis.  Now I'll turn it back to John."

The",587,"Thanks, Larry. As most of you know, we are currently engaged in reviewing our strategic options to find more diversified and cost-effective funding in order to meet HDFS' goal of providing credit while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. The process is progressing and we are considering several potential scenarios. HDFS' return to profitability reinforces that we do have options and we will make the right decisions for the long term.
On Slide 21, you'll see our overall cash position at the end of the quarter. On March 28, we had $1.48 billion of cash and marketable securities. This is a significant welcome improvement and liquidity from just one year ago. And we believe it is in an appropriate level, given the uncertain economy. At end of the quarter, HDFS had approximately $900 million of available liquidity through bank credit and asset-backed conduit facilities. HDFS is currently in the process of negotiating the bank credit facility and asset-backed conduit facility. We expect negotiations will be complete by the end of April.
Our cash strategy continues to require a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity in cash and/or other credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson financials on Slide 22. I'd like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash, despite the large reduction in motorcycle shipments and the restructuring spending that we incurred, we were able to generate operating cash of over $200 million during the first quarter, with the motor company generating $61.6 million in operating cash. 
Regarding our tax rate, if you recall, last year, we incurred a tax charge due to a change in the Wisconsin tax law, which did not reoccur this year but drove the first quarter tax rate up to 45.4% last year. This year, our first quarter effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 47.2%. The increase was generally due to a $13.3 million tax charge associated with the taxability of Medicare Part D reimbursements under the recently-passed healthcare bill and the expiration of the research and development tax credit. As a result, we now expect our 2010 full year effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be approximately 40.5%.
On Slide 23, you'll find the summary of the MV Agusta business, which is presented as discontinued operations. During the first quarter, we posted an operating loss of $6.8 million and we wrote down the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets, resulting in a non-cash charge of $28.6 million net of related tax benefits. As we noted in the release this morning, we are currently in discussions with potential buyers for MV Agusta.
Looking forward to the remaining quarters of 2010, we continue to expect that the global economies will remain challenging. As we have said, we'll take a conservative approach to shipment volumes, as we continue to aggressively balance supply in line with demand. On a full year basis, our shipment, gross margin and capital expenditure guidance for 2010 remains unchanged, and they are noted on Slide 24.
As we look back on the first quarter of 2010, we were pleased to see some improvement in the retail sales rate from previous quarters, and profitability returned to HDFS. We look forward to coming quarters, as our sales season progresses and we prepare to launch our 2011 model year motorcycles in July. We'll continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the economic challenges and execute our long-term strategy. And now let's open the call up to your questions."

And we're seeing deals on motorcycles anywhere from $500 a bike to $5000, so nothing has really changed quarter-over-quarter in that front. As far as the FX on gross margins, that was unfavorable by $4 million and FX on operating expenses was unfavorable by $3 million during the quarter."

And yes, it's above our guidance of 32% to 33.5%, but certainly, we expected that, given the mixed shift between Touring and Sportsters. So during the quarter, we shift in 7.9 percentage points, more of Touring. And that's because as we've seen all last year certainly into this year, the strong sales of those bikes certainly led by the Trike, as well as the new Ultra Limited and our Road Glide that we introduced last July. Conversely, our Sportster mix was down 7.2 percentage points. And again as we entered into the first quarter, we still had a fair amount of model year 2009 Sportsters. And so we moderated production, and therefore, shipments in the quarter due to that. And then as I mentioned on the call as well, as when we look at the year-over-year shipments between Iron 883 and the Forty-Eight, we shipped in much fewer Forty-Eights. And that was because a year ago, when the plant was still up and operating at the end of 2008, we were building forward for the introduction at our Winter Dealer Meeting. Because the plant was shut down this year in the fourth quarter, we didn't have that opportunity and again, got into production a little bit later in the first quarter. So that's a pretty significant mixed shift. And that drove $54 million of margin favorability, which pushed up the gross margin up about five percentage points. As we progress through the year, we expect our Sportster mix to normalize. And a lot of that mix favorability to reverse out. Rod, I think your second question was on price competitiveness.

Harley-Davidson continues to make good progress at executing our strategy through ""Delivering Results Through Focus,"" and we are seeing the benefits of that progress in our earnings performance.
Harley-Davidson's first half earnings from continued operations were $0.89 a share. We saw continued improvement at HDFS, and there was a further moderation in the retail sales decline for new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales in the second quarter.
Over the past year and a half, we've taken many actions from an operations standpoint, in marketing and product development, at HDFS and in every aspect of our business to deal with the economy and focus our resources on long-term goals and priorities. So we thank our employees for the outstanding work they do each and every day. I continue to be impressed by the dedication they show to the company and to executing our strategy.
And I'd also like to recognize our dealers for their commitment to Harley-Davidson customers and delivering a premium Harley-Davidson experience in local markets around the world. It has been a challenging time for them, and they are doing a lot of great work.
So while we still have a lot of hard work ahead, when it comes to driving competitiveness and effective execution at every level in the organization, we believe that we're on the right path. And we are very purposefully transforming our entire company to be more flexible and customer responsive. In operations, the transformation at York is continuing on pace, and we are seeing remarkable changes in how people come to work every day, engaged and ready to do a great job for our customers. Last month, we started up the production of Trikes at York, the first product line to fully utilize the new operating system there.
Later this week, we will formally sit down with our Wisconsin unions to begin negotiations on agreements for a similar transformation of our Milwaukee area and Tomahawk production operations. Our goal and our preference is to find a way to close the large cost gaps and create a flexible operation in Wisconsin that enables us to produce closer to demand. At the same time, we have indicated that we will take whatever actions necessary to ensure a cost-effective and flexible operation.
We are also making great progress with changes to our product development approach and processes, which we expect to result in shorter lead times, greater cost effectiveness, and most importantly, even more product vowel [ph] (0:20:41) for our customers. After all, that's what it's all about, is bringing great products and experiences to our current customers and new customers alike.
We continue to expand our reach to new customers all around the globe. Retail new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales grew for the third straight quarter in Europe, which is our largest market region outside the U.S.
Over the past two weeks, three Harley-Davidson dealerships opened in India, in Hyderabad, Chandigarh and New Delhi. And we have established a subsidiary operation in China to improve sales and marketing capabilities, dealer support and distribution effectiveness, providing an enhanced customer experience. We expect four new dealerships to open in China this year, for a total of eight.
And in the U.S., no one is reaching new customers better than Harley-Davidson. Based on recently provided Polk data, we have been the heavyweight motorcycle category market leader in new motorcycle sales to young-adult men and women, ages 18 to 34, since at least 2006.
We have also been the heavyweight market leader since at least 2006 in new motorcycle sales to women riders, Hispanic riders and African-American riders ages 35 and older. And of course, we're also the market leader among Caucasian men ages 35 and older. And when it comes to new motorcycle sales to young adults in all sizes of on-road motorcycles, Harley-Davidson has been the U.S. market-share leader since 2008.
Clearly, we believe the Harley-Davidson brand, our products and experiences remain powerful and strong, with great appeal to both current and new customers in the U.S. as well as globally. And John will elaborate on this in his comments.
Next week at our Summer Dealer Meeting in Las Vegas, we will be sharing new products and programs with our global dealer network that we believe will extend the reach of the brand even farther.
And while there are still many challenges ahead, we continue to feel good about the progress we are making on many fronts. Our strategy of results through focus is clearly on track. Now let me turn it over to John."

Our solid financial performanc",1212,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 10. During the second quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Related Products revenue from continuing operations was down 0.1%. Our solid financial performance in the quarter included slightly higher year-over-year shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, strong gross margins from the Motorcycle segment, and another good quarter from Harley-Davidson Financial Services. Income from continuing operations and earnings per share were both up over threefold.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 11. During the second quarter, our dealers’ retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 5.5% on a worldwide basis compared to last year. While economic conditions continue to be choppy, we are encouraged by the sequential moderation in the rate of retail sales decline over the last four quarters in both the United States and our international markets. In addition, the Europe region posted its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales increase, bringing our total international sales to year-ago levels for the second quarter.
Regarding market share, our U.S. market share increased by one percentage point in the second quarter to 52.5%, and the June year-to-date market share was 53.6%, down 0.5 percentage points from last year. Our market share in the U.S. is holding up despite ongoing price competition from many of our competitors.
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the second quarter were up slightly compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were in line with our expectations and resulted in nearly 21,000 fewer units in U.S. dealer retail inventory than one year ago.
At 24.4% of the total, Sportster shipments were higher than the historical range of 18% to 22%, as initial dealer shipments of the new 48 motorcycle continue into the second quarter. We continue to expect that Sportster as a percent of total shipments will be within the historical range for the full year.
For the third quarter, we expect to ship between 53,000 and 58,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide, which is in line with last year's third quarter shipments of just over 54,000 units.
On Slide 13, you will see that the motorcycle inventory level in our U.S. dealer network is down compared to a year ago. While most of the inventory is current-model year, previous model-year motorcycle inventory is higher than normal at this time of year, and we will continue to support our dealers’ efforts to sell these motorcycles, while carefully managing supply in line with demand.
Despite significantly reduced retail sales, the Harley-Davidson dealer network remains profitable as a whole and unrivaled in the motorcycle industry. In the second quarter, U.S. Harley-Davidson dealer retail sales were over 85% current model-year bikes, while competitive brand dealers sold just over 30% current-year motorcycles.
We believe U.S. Harley-Davidson dealers continue to sell at or near MSRP for new bikes, and they are selling an increasing number of used bikes at their stores. We are focused on the health of the dealer network and are proceeding with our plan to encourage consolidation in select U.S. markets to help protect the integrity of our world-class dealer network. We believe that some contraction of the dealer network is healthy at this time.
On Slide 14, you will see revenue from the Motorcycle and Related Products segment for the second quarter was largely flat compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $184 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
We continue to be intensely focused on improving our cost structure and restructuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the quarter, we incurred $30.1 million in restructuring expenses. We are on track to deliver the full year expected total cost and savings associated with our restructuring activities, which are summarized on Slide 15. The potential costs and savings associated with our Wisconsin operation’s union negotiations, which Keith mentioned earlier, are not included on this chart. We will provide more information when we finalize and disclose a decision later this year.
On Slide 16, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 35%, 0.9 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was driven by a richer mix of products within the families and favorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and rising raw material costs.
Gross margin for the first six months was 35.7%, which was flat compared to prior year and exceeds our full year guidance range of 32% to 33.5%. We are very pleased with our first half margin performance and now expect gross margin will be between 32.5% and 34% for the full year. We do not expect that the second half will benefit from mix to the same extent as the first half, and we expect unfavorable headwinds from foreign currency exchange and raw material costs.
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 13.9% versus 15.3% in 2009. Operating margin was adversely impacted by an increase in restructuring costs and higher operating expenses.
Now moving on to our quarterly results for our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the second quarter, HDFS posted a $60.8 million profit, an improvement of $151.3 million compared to last year. Keep in mind that the year-over-year reconciliation as it is presented on this slide reflects $101.1 million of charges incurred in the second quarter of 2009 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2010. The key drivers of the second quarter 2010 improvement were: Net interest income was favorable by $63.9 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables; and an improvement in the net interest spread of the cost of funds that HDFS has decreased.
Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with on-balance sheet held-for-investment retail receivables, decreased by $61 million compared to the second quarter last year. The decrease was driven by $72.7 million provision established in the second quarter of 2009 that resulted from the reclassification of $3.14 billion in finance receivables held for sale to held for investment. Additionally, the remaining variance of $11.7 million was mostly due to the increase of on-balance sheet receivables in Q2 2010 versus last year, partially offset by a slight improvement in credit risk consumptions based on favorable credit performance.
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables was favorable by $4.5 million compared to last year, primarily due to a 28% reduction in wholesale receivables from prior year.
Also, in the second quarter 2009, HDFS recorded a charge of $28.4 million to write off all HDFS goodwill, which resulted in a commensurate year-over-year improvement this year.
And last, the $3.5 million all-other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer have securitization accounting. The items that existed last year were: Income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees, low comp adjustments and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest.
We are pleased to see HDFS is improving profitability. Lower cost for funds and improving credit performance have contributed to another positive quarter at HDFS. Larry will provide more detail on HDFS’s operations. Larry?"

During the second quarter, HDFS originated $653 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 5.4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. HDFS’s retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 47.1% in the first six months of 2010, down one percentage point compared to the same period last year.
Regarding competition, we continued to see increased activity, particularly in the Prime-Rated Customer segment.
At the end of second quarter, of the approximately $6.4 billion of net finance receivables, $5.6 billion were retail and $800 million were wholesale. We continue to see good credit performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January 2009. For the first six months of 2010, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes.
Now moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 20, where you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.5%, which is better than the comparable quarter-end results in 2008 and 2009. Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively reduce delinquency levels compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U.S.
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 65 basis points to 2.04% for the first half of 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and some improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
So in conclusion, HDFS remains the primary source of funding for Harley-Davidson wholesale and retail motorcycle lending, and our profit this quarter is encouraging. We continue to make progress as our cost of funds has decreased and the performance of our portfolio has improved compared to last year. 
Keep in mind, historically, delinquencies and losses have increased during the second half of the year as we move out of riding season. Additionally, with unemployment still near 10% and ongoing economic challenges, we'll continue to watch losses and delinquencies closely. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate at the present time, but we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Now I'll turn it back to John."

As most of you know, several quarters ago, we began a comprehensive study of our strategic options related to HDFS's Retail Lending business. We reviewed numerous scenarios, which included selling the business, partnering and various other financing arrangements. 
Our criteria included a business structure or relationship that would provide a consistent and reliable source of financing to our dealers and customers, adequate control or influence over underwriting and pricing, a long-term relationship that would enhance the brand and an earnings stream back to the company reflective of the value of the business. We have concluded a thorough exploration of business models and relationships that might meet our criteria. And at this time, we believe that it is in the company's best interest to maintain our current captive finance model.
It comes down to this: At this time, we're not willing to give the keys away to a strategic asset that has served the company, our dealer network, our customers and our shareholders so well in the past and through the recent economic downturn. We are very pleased with the management of the business, especially through the recession, and are excited to move forward with our current business model. 
We believe there is much opportunity to improve our retail financing operations through continuous improvement of our underwriting, collections and service aspects of the business. HDFS's goal continues to be to provide credit, while delivering appropriate returns and profitability.
As we have done throughout the recession and as part of our regular management of the business, we will continue to evaluate financing options and alternatives to diversify HDFS's funding and manage its risk.
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.16 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
During the quarter, HDFS addressed a couple of debt maturities. The previous 364-day $625 million and three-year $950 million credit facilities were replaced with a 364-day $675 million and a three-year $675 million credit facility. HDFS also downsized the conduit to $600 million and extended it. Our cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity and cash in committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 22. I would like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash from continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of over $726 million during the first half of 2010. The Motorcycle business continues to generate strong cash. Of the total, the Motorcycle business generated $297 million of operating cash.
Our second quarter effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 29.2% compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The rate decrease was generally due to the nonrecurrence of a $28.4 million nondeductible goodwill impairment charge incurred in the second quarter of 2009; the favorable conclusion of an IRS audit; and in connection with the settlement, an adjustment to income taxes payable. We now expect 2010 full year effective income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 36.0%.
On Slide 23, you'll find a summary of MV Agusta's business, which is presented as discontinued operations. During the second quarter, we posted an operating loss of $6.6 million, net of tax, and we wrote down the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets, resulting in a non-cash charge of $61.5 million, net of related-tax benefits. We continue to be in discussions with potential buyers for MV Agusta.
Looking forward to the remaining quarters of 2010, we continue to expect that the global economies will remain challenging, and we'll take a conservative approach to shipment volumes as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. On Slide 24, you will see that on a full year basis, our shipment and capital expenditure guidance for 2010 remained unchanged. And as I noted earlier, we have increased our expected gross margin range.
As we look back in the second quarter of 2010, we are pleased to see continued moderation in the rate of retail sales decline relative to previous quarters and continued profitability at HDFS, and we look forward to the launch of our 2011 model-year motorcycles next week.
Before we open the phone lines, I want to address a question that has been coming up in investor meetings. Many of you are asking what we believe the total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles will be in the future. More specifically, if we believe we will return to our 2006 peak retail sales of 349,000 motorcycles. As you know, we do not provide long-term sales forecasts, and I cannot give you a specific number. But I can tell you two things with absolute confidence: First, we are prudently managing the company in response to significantly lower volumes; and second, the brand remains strong and is a significant competitive advantage.
With regard to the first point, the world and the motorcycle market have changed, and we are taking appropriate action. By the end of 2010, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments in the year to be down approximately 40% from their 2006 peak. In response to lower volumes, we have been working hard to rightsize our manufacturing footprint, address labor contracts to gain manufacturing flexibility and competitiveness, reduce administrative costs and exit non-core businesses in order to focus on core operations. The result is a new business model with a lower breakeven point. We are executing a solid plan designed to regain the lion’s share of lost operating margin at significantly lower volumes. Restructuring has already delivered significant results, but we have not compromised the capacity for future growth. In fact, our plan will be able to more efficiently flex according to future demand. 
In addition, throughout the economic downturn, we have continued to invest in our future and have developed new products and features such as the Iron 883 and the new 48, invested in our Outreach Demographic segments in the United States and developed new international customers and markets.
In short, as the recovery continues and when volumes do increase, we will be in a strong position to capitalize on future opportunities, while positioning the company to better contend with future economic cycles and turbulence.
And my second point, when you are contemplating future demand, consider that the Harley-Davidson brand has continued to strengthen even through the severity of the recession. In the United States, when you look at Harley-Davidson's competitive position in terms of market share, we have gained a significant amount of market share since the end of 2007 and maintained a strong leadership position in the United States.
Internationally, the story is similar. Harley-Davidson has gained share in many international markets as well. In Europe, the single-largest heavyweight motorcycle market in the world, we have seen strong share gains during the last several years and retail sales growth in the past three quarters.
However, the power of the brand is even more clearly evident when you look at total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States on Slide 25. Despite the severity of the recession, when combining retail sales of both new and used motorcycles, Harley-Davidson's total retail sales in the United States were down 2% in 2008, 12.8% in 2009 and up 1.3% through May in 2010.
Despite our continued strong measures of brand strength, as the recession deepened in late 2008, many of our customers were forced to sell their motorcycles. This increased the supply of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States and changed the ratio of used-to-new sales from about 1:1 in 2007 to about 2:1 in 2009. Consequently, the values of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles declined significantly from 2006 and 2007 levels.
In an effort to improve used-bike pricing and return to a more normal ratio of used-to-new-bike sales, we continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand. We believe we have made progress toward our goal of restoring used-bike prices and further strengthening the brand. 
Our strategy is focused on extending our powerful brand and exploring opportunities that exist. As Keith mentioned, we are extending the Harley-Davidson experience to a much greater base of potential customers than ever before. For example, we expect to add 100 to 150 new international dealerships through 2014, including dealerships in 19 countries this year. We look to design products and features that are desired by international customers. 
In the United States, we expect to strengthen our leadership position in the young adult, women, Hispanic and African-American markets by delivering relevant products and experiences. And of course, we will continue to serve our core customers with products and experiences to fulfill their dreams.
So while I can't tell you definitely what the future demand looks like, I can assure you that we are managing the business prudently, given today's difficult environment, and continue to invest in our future.
We are ready to expand our sales when the world economies improve, and we'll remain disciplined as we manage the company. And now, let's open the call up to your questions."

So those act as a natural hedge versus currency exposures. And then in addition to that, we buy forwards on typically over a 12-month period of time. And in the first quarter, we saw revenue certainly benefit from the exchange rates, and we had some unfavorable -- about $7 million of unfavorability. And in the second quarter, we saw a reversal of rates. The average euro for the second quarter was about $1.28 versus $1.36, and that hit revenue by about $9 million, and overall cost, we’re talking about $10 million -- I’m sorry, the impact of $10 million. So as we look forward to the third and fourth quarter, the average euro exchange rate was $1.43 in third quarter and $1.48 in the fourth quarter. And currently, I think as of yesterday, we’re sitting at $1.29. So again, we've got some natural hedges to protect us in the back half as well as some financial forwards.

The largest driver of motorcycle mix during the quarter was actually the mix of products within families, not the mix between families. Typically, the mix between families is the largest driver of motorcycle-mix variation. So when we look at the overall $24 million, Ed, the biggest drivers of mix within family come from within the Touring segment. So a year ago, we introduced the Ultra Limited, which is a $25,000 vehicle, and it has quickly become one of our top-selling, one of our -- I think, our top three- or four-selling vehicles in the whole lineup. And when you compare that to the rest of the Touring average, without it, which is less than $20,000 on average a vehicle, we've seen significant favorable mix from that. In addition, within the Touring category is the CVO Ultra, has sold very well, and that's got a retail price of around $35,000 a unit. So that's added to a strong mix within the family. And then finally, even in the Sportsters, we have a fair amount of mix. 48 model, for example, the 1200, and it sells at over $10,000, and that is a very large part of the mix in the second quarter, which is also skewed the model mix within that family to be favorable. When we look at the Sportster, Sportster mix, it was at a high percentage of 24.4%, down a little bit from a year ago, which was about 26%. And really the reason that is, is there’s continued very strong demand for 48 and continued demand for Iron 883. So we're continuing to fill the pipeline. Sales in both of those vehicles are going very well. Now we expect the mix for the Sportster mix in the back half to be a higher percentage than last year, largely due to the fact that the fourth quarter was down. And I think the fourth quarter was about 13% of the overall mix in 2009. So as we lap that, we would expect a higher Sportster mix in the back half. And then, in general, mix is -- there’s a lot of factors that affect mix at Harley-Davidson. We've got family mix, which we've talked about, and that's the difference between selling a Touring bike and a Sportster, with very different selling prices. There’s model mix, which I just talked about, and the difference between an Ultra Limited versus a Road King, for example. But also we've got location mix. Where in the world we’re selling that product has a bearing on mix. Option mix, whether it has ABS brakes, wheels, cruise, security. And then the related businesses have a lot of mix variation as well. When you look at parts, we sell a can of oil for a couple of dollars versus a replacement engine at several thousand dollars. Accessories from a foot peg to a GPS system, and MotorClothes and licensing all contribute to a lot of mix variation at the company."

I believe it was, we're currently pricing, or we’re seeing that our dealers at or near MSRP, and has that changed over time? And it changes a very little bit. We're very pleased with the overall pricing, especially in the quarter, when we've seen the sales decline improve, and we continue to hold our pricing very well. When you look at some of the old-model years, and certainly, we've talked about that a lot, but we've got to put that in perspective as well. It is unusual for Harley-Davidson to have any carryover at this time of year, and -- but to put it in perspective, at this time, for the second quarter retail inventory, the model-year '09 so the carryover inventory that we have is less than 10% of the retail inventory that’s out in the system. And when you look at sales on a worldwide basis for the second quarter, our sales of that old model, our carryover model is less than 10% as well. I think in the United States during the second quarter, we sold about 84% current motorcycles, and again, the competition was more in the range of 30% current motorcycles. So while that does have an impact on the overall MSRP being at or near, or price being at or near MSRP, it's not a huge drag on that. The models that we are selling, the carryover models are at a modest reduction to MSRP, though. Most of the 2010 models are holding up very well at MSRP."

Some of that reduced production is flowing through with our retail inventories being down 21,000 units. So again, it's very difficult to look at it as we lap last year's production."

Harley-Davidson continues to make good progress at executing our strategy through ""Delivering Results Through Focus,"" and we are seeing the benefits of that progress in our earnings performance.
Harley-Davidson's first half earnings from continued operations were $0.89 a share. We saw continued improvement at HDFS, and there was a further moderation in the retail sales decline for new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales in the second quarter.
Over the past year and a half, we've taken many actions from an operations standpoint, in marketing and product development, at HDFS and in every aspect of our business to deal with the economy and focus our resources on long-term goals and priorities. So we thank our employees for the outstanding work they do each and every day. I continue to be impressed by the dedication they show to the company and to executing our strategy.
And I'd also like to recognize our dealers for their commitment to Harley-Davidson customers and delivering a premium Harley-Davidson experience in local markets around the world. It has been a challenging time for them, and they are doing a lot of great work.
So while we still have a lot of hard work ahead, when it comes to driving competitiveness and effective execution at every level in the organization, we believe that we're on the right path. And we are very purposefully transforming our entire company to be more flexible and customer responsive. In operations, the transformation at York is continuing on pace, and we are seeing remarkable changes in how people come to work every day, engaged and ready to do a great job for our customers. Last month, we started up the production of Trikes at York, the first product line to fully utilize the new operating system there.
Later this week, we will formally sit down with our Wisconsin unions to begin negotiations on agreements for a similar transformation of our Milwaukee area and Tomahawk production operations. Our goal and our preference is to find a way to close the large cost gaps and create a flexible operation in Wisconsin that enables us to produce closer to demand. At the same time, we have indicated that we will take whatever actions necessary to ensure a cost-effective and flexible operation.
We are also making great progress with changes to our product development approach and processes, which we expect to result in shorter lead times, greater cost effectiveness, and most importantly, even more product [ph] for our customers. After all, that's what it's all about, is bringing great products and experiences to our current customers and new customers alike.
We continue to expand our reach to new customers all around the globe. Retail new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales grew for the third straight quarter in Europe, which is our largest market region outside the U.S.
Over the past two weeks, three Harley-Davidson dealerships opened in India, in Hyderabad, Chandigarh and New Delhi. And we have established a subsidiary operation in China to improve sales and marketing capabilities, dealer support and distribution effectiveness, providing an enhanced customer experience. We expect four new dealerships to open in China this year, for a total of eight.
And in the U.S., no one is reaching new customers better than Harley-Davidson. Based on recently provided Polk data, we have been the heavyweight motorcycle category market leader in new motorcycle sales to young-adult men and women, ages 18 to 34, since at least 2006.
We have also been the heavyweight market leader since at least 2006 in new motorcycle sales to women riders, Hispanic riders and African-American riders ages 35 and older. And of course, we're also the market leader among Caucasian men ages 35 and older. And when it comes to new motorcycle sales to young adults in all sizes of on-road motorcycles, Harley-Davidson has been the U.S. market-share leader since 2008.
Clearly, we believe the Harley-Davidson brand, our products and experiences remain powerful and strong, with great appeal to both current and new customers in the U.S. as well as globally. And John will elaborate on this in his comments.
Next week at our Summer Dealer Meeting in Las Vegas, we will be sharing new products and programs with our global dealer network that we believe will extend the reach of the brand even farther.
And while there are still many challenges ahead, we continue to feel good about the progress we are making on many fronts. Our strategy of results through focus is clearly on track. 
Now let me turn it over to John."

During the second quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Related Products revenue from continuing operations was down 0.1%. Our solid financial performance in the quarter included slightly higher year-over-year shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, strong gross margins from the Motorcycle segment, and another good quarter from Harley-Davidson Financial Services. Income from continuing operations and earnings per share were both up over threefold.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 11. During the second quarter, our dealers’ retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 5.5% on a worldwide basis compared to last year. While economic conditions continue to be choppy, we are encouraged by the sequential moderation in the rate of retail sales decline over the last four quarters in both the United States and our international markets. In addition, the Europe region posted its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales increase, bringing our total international sales to year-ago levels for the second quarter.
Regarding market share, our U.S. market share increased by one percentage point in the second quarter to 52.5%, and the June year-to-date market share was 53.6%, down 0.5 percentage points from last year. Our market share in the U.S. is holding up despite ongoing price competition from many of our competitors.
On Slide 12, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the second quarter were up slightly compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were in line with our expectations and resulted in nearly 21,000 fewer units in U.S. dealer retail inventory than one year ago.
At 24.4% of the total, Sportster shipments were higher than the historical range of 18% to 22%, as initial dealer shipments of the new 48 motorcycle continue into the second quarter. We continue to expect that Sportster as a percent of total shipments will be within the historical range for the full year.
For the third quarter, we expect to ship between 53,000 and 58,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide, which is in line with last year's third quarter shipments of just over 54,000 units.
On Slide 13, you will see that the motorcycle inventory level in our U.S. dealer network is down compared to a year ago. While most of the inventory is current-model year, previous-model year motorcycle inventory is higher than normal at this time of year, and we will continue to support our dealers’ efforts to sell these motorcycles while carefully managing supply in line with demand.
Despite significantly reduced retail sales, the Harley-Davidson dealer network remains profitable as a whole and unrivaled in the motorcycle industry. In the second quarter, U.S. Harley-Davidson dealer retail sales were over 85% current model year bikes, while competitive brand dealers sold just over 30% current-year motorcycles.
We believe U.S. Harley-Davidson dealers continue to sell at or near MSRP for new bikes, and they are selling an increasing number of used bikes at their stores. We are focused on the health of the dealer network and are proceeding with our plan to encourage consolidation in select U.S. markets to help protect the integrity of our world-class dealer network. We believe that some contraction of the dealer network is healthy at this time.
On Slide 14, you will see revenue from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment for the second quarter was largely flat compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $184 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
We continue to be intensely focused on improving our cost structure and restructuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the quarter, we incurred $30.1 million in restructuring expenses. We are on track to deliver the full year expected total cost and savings associated with our restructuring activities, which are summarized on Slide 15. The potential costs and savings associated with our Wisconsin operation’s union negotiations, which Keith mentioned earlier, are not included on this chart. We will provide more information when we finalize and disclose a decision later this year.
On Slide 16, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 35%, 0.9 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was driven by a richer mix of products within the families and favorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and rising raw material costs.
Gross margin for the first six months was 35.7%, which was flat compared to prior year and exceeds our full year guidance range of 32% to 33.5%. We are very pleased with our first half margin performance and now expect gross margin will be between 32.5% and 34% for the full year. We do not expect that the second half will benefit from mix to the same extent as the first half, and we expect unfavorable headwinds from foreign currency exchange and raw material costs.
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 13.9% versus 15.3% in 2009. Operating margin was adversely impacted by an increase in restructuring costs and higher operating expenses.
Now moving on to our quarterly results for our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the second quarter, HDFS posted a $60.8 million profit, an improvement of $151.3 million compared to last year. Keep in mind that the year-over-year reconciliation as it is presented on this slide reflects $101.1 million of charges incurred in the second quarter of 2009 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2010. The key drivers of the second quarter 2010 improvement were: net interest income was favorable by $63.9 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables and an improvement in the net interest spread of the cost of funds that HDFS has decreased.
Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with on-balance sheet held-for-investment retail receivables, decreased by $61 million compared to the second quarter last year. The decrease was driven by $72.7 million provision established in the second quarter of 2009 that resulted from the reclassification of $3.14 billion in finance receivables held for sale to held for investment. Additionally, the remaining variance of $11.7 million was mostly due to the increase of on-balance sheet receivables in Q2 2010 versus last year, partially offset by a slight improvement in credit risk consumptions based on favorable credit performance.
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables was favorable by $4.5 million compared to last year, primarily due to a 28% reduction in wholesale receivables from prior year.
Also, in the second quarter 2009, HDFS recorded a charge of $28.4 million to write off all HDFS goodwill, which resulted in a commensurate year-over-year improvement this year.
And last, the $3.5 million all-other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer have securitization accounting. The items that existed last year were: Income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees, low comp adjustments and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest.
We are pleased to see HDFS is improving profitability. Lower cost for funds and improving credit performance have contributed to another positive quarter at HDFS. 
Larry will provide more detail on HDFS’s operations. Larry?"

During the second quarter, HDFS originated $653 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 5.4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. HDFS’s retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 47.1% in the first six months of 2010, down one percentage point compared to the same period last year.
Regarding competition, we continued to see increased activity, particularly in the Prime-Rated Customer segment.
At the end of second quarter, of the approximately $6.4 billion of net finance receivables, $5.6 billion were retail and $800 million were wholesale. We continue to see good credit performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January 2009. For the first six months of 2010, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes.
Now moving on to delinquencies and losses on Slide 20, where you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.5%, which is better than the comparable quarter-end results in 2008 and 2009. Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively reduce delinquency levels compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U.S.
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 65 basis points to 2.04% for the first half of 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and some improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
So in conclusion, HDFS remains the primary source of funding for Harley-Davidson wholesale and retail motorcycle lending, and our profit this quarter is encouraging. We continue to make progress as our cost of funds has decreased and the performance of our portfolio has improved compared to last year. 
Keep in mind, historically, delinquencies and losses have increased during the second half of the year as we move out of riding season. Additionally, with unemployment still near 10% and ongoing economic challenges, we'll continue to watch losses and delinquencies closely. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate at the present time, but we will continue to evaluate them on an ongoing basis. 
Now I'll turn it back to John."

As most of you know, several quarters ago, we began a comprehensive study of our strategic options related to HDFS's Retail Lending business. We reviewed numerous scenarios, which included selling the business, partnering and various other financing arrangements. 
Our criteria included a business structure or relationship that would provide a consistent and reliable source of financing to our dealers and customers, adequate control or influence over underwriting and pricing, a long-term relationship that would enhance the brand and an earnings stream back to the company reflective of the value of the business. We have concluded a thorough exploration of business models and relationships that might meet our criteria. And at this time, we believe that it is in the company's best interest to maintain our current captive finance model.
It comes down to this: At this time, we're not willing to give the keys away to a strategic asset that has served the company, our dealer network, our customers and our shareholders so well in the past and through the recent economic downturn. We are very pleased with the management of the business, especially through the recession, and are excited to move forward with our current business model. 
We believe there is much opportunity to improve our retail financing operations through continuous improvement of our underwriting, collections and service aspects of the business. HDFS's goal continues to be to provide credit, while delivering appropriate returns and profitability.
As we have done throughout the recession and as part of our regular management of the business, we will continue to evaluate financing options and alternatives to diversify HDFS's funding and manage its risk.
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.16 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities.
During the quarter, HDFS addressed a couple of debt maturities. The previous 364-day $625 million and three-year $950 million credit facilities were replaced with a 364-day $675 million and a three-year $675 million credit facility. HDFS also downsized the conduit to $600 million and extended it. Our cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity and cash in committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 22. I would like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash from continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of over $726 million during the first half of 2010. The Motorcycle business continues to generate strong cash. Of the total, the Motorcycle business generated $297 million of operating cash.
Our second quarter effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 29.2% compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The rate decrease was generally due to the non-recurrence of a $28.4 million nondeductible goodwill impairment charge incurred in the second quarter of 2009; the favorable conclusion of an IRS audit; and in connection with the settlement, an adjustment to income taxes payable. We now expect 2010 full year effective income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 36.0%.
On Slide 23, you'll find a summary of MV Agusta's business, which is presented as discontinued operations. During the second quarter, we posted an operating loss of $6.6 million, net of tax, and we wrote down the carrying value of MV Agusta's assets, resulting in a non-cash charge of $61.5 million, net of related-tax benefits. We continue to be in discussions with potential buyers for MV Agusta.
Looking forward to the remaining quarters of 2010, we continue to expect that the global economies will remain challenging, and we'll take a conservative approach to shipment volumes as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. On Slide 24, you will see that on a full year basis, our shipment and capital expenditure guidance for 2010 remained unchanged. And as I noted earlier, we have increased our expected gross margin range.
As we look back in the second quarter of 2010, we are pleased to see continued moderation in the rate of retail sales decline relative to previous quarters and continued profitability at HDFS, and we look forward to the launch of our 2011 model-year motorcycles next week.
Before we open the phone lines, I want to address a question that has been coming up in investor meetings. Many of you are asking what we believe the total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles will be in the future. More specifically, if we believe we will return to our 2006 peak retail sales of 349,000 motorcycles. As you know, we do not provide long-term sales forecasts, and I cannot give you a specific number. But I can tell you two things with absolute confidence: First, we are prudently managing the company in response to significantly lower volumes; and second, the brand remains strong and is a significant competitive advantage.
With regard to the first point, the world and the motorcycle market have changed, and we are taking appropriate action. By the end of 2010, we expect Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments in the year to be down approximately 40% from their 2006 peak. In response to lower volumes, we have been working hard to rightsize our manufacturing footprint, address labor contracts to gain manufacturing flexibility and competitiveness, reduce administrative costs and exit non-core businesses in order to focus on core operations. The result is a new business model with a lower breakeven point. We are executing a solid plan designed to regain the lion’s share of lost operating margin at significantly lower volumes. Restructuring has already delivered significant results, but we have not compromised the capacity for future growth. In fact, our plan will be able to more efficiently flex according to future demand. 
In addition, throughout the economic downturn, we have continued to invest in our future and have developed new products and features such as the Iron 883 and the new 48, invested in our Outreach Demographic segments in the United States and developed new international customers and markets.
In short, as the recovery continues and when volumes do increase, we will be in a strong position to capitalize on future opportunities, while positioning the company to better contend with future economic cycles and turbulence.
And my second point, when you are contemplating future demand, consider that the Harley-Davidson brand has continued to strengthen even through the severity of the recession. In the United States, when you look at Harley-Davidson's competitive position in terms of market share, we have gained a significant amount of market share since the end of 2007 and maintained a strong leadership position in the United States.
Internationally, the story is similar. Harley-Davidson has gained share in many international markets as well. In Europe, the single-largest heavyweight motorcycle market in the world, we have seen strong share gains during the last several years and retail sales growth in the past three quarters.
However, the power of the brand is even more clearly evident when you look at total demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States on Slide 25. Despite the severity of the recession, when combining retail sales of both new and used motorcycles, Harley-Davidson's total retail sales in the United States were down 2% in 2008, 12.8% in 2009 and up 1.3% through May in 2010.
Despite our continued strong measures of brand strength, as the recession deepened in late 2008, many of our customers were forced to sell their motorcycles. This increased the supply of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the United States and changed the ratio of used-to-new sales from about 1:1 in 2007 to about 2:1 in 2009. Consequently, the values of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles declined significantly from 2006 and 2007 levels.
In an effort to improve used-bike pricing and return to a more normal ratio of used-to-new-bike sales, we continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand. We believe we have made progress toward our goal of restoring used-bike prices and further strengthening the brand. 
Our strategy is focused on extending our powerful brand and exploring opportunities that exist. As Keith mentioned, we are extending the Harley-Davidson experience to a much greater base of potential customers than ever before. For example, we expect to add 100 to 150 new international dealerships through 2014, including dealerships in 19 countries this year. We look to design products and features that are desired by international customers. 
In the United States, we expect to strengthen our leadership position in the young adult, women, Hispanic and African-American markets by delivering relevant products and experiences. And of course, we will continue to serve our core customers with products and experiences to fulfill their dreams.
So while I can't tell you definitely what the future demand looks like, I can assure you that we are managing the business prudently, given today's difficult environment, and continue to invest in our future.
We are ready to expand our sales when the world economies improve, and we'll remain disciplined as we manage the company. And now, let's open the call up to your questions."

And again, our strategy is to continue to be very disciplined and aggressively manage supply in line with demand in order to push up used-bike prices. So we’re on our way, Sharon, but we still have a fair amount to go to get back to the 2006 and 2007 level of used-bike prices, which is our goal."

Our largest exposure is to the euro. And we certainly manage that exposure through several vehicles. One is we've got a fair amount of natural hedges, and that comes from the purchased parts that we bring back to the United States, the manufacturer of our bikes. Operating expenses are spent in our European operations. And we have outstanding debt on our balance sheet of about $200 million in euro-denominated debt. So those act as a natural hedge versus currency exposures. And then in addition to that, we buy forwards on typically over a 12-month period of time. And in the first quarter, we saw revenue certainly benefit from the exchange rates, and we had some unfavorable -- about $7 million of unfavorability. And in the second quarter, we saw a reversal of rates. The average euro for the second quarter was about $1.28 versus $1.36, and that hit revenue by about $9 million, and overall cost, we’re talking about $10 million -- I’m sorry, the impact of $10 million. So as we look forward to the third and fourth quarter, the average euro exchange rate was $1.43 in the third quarter and $1.48 in the fourth quarter. And currently, I think as of yesterday, we’re sitting at $1.29. So again, we've got some natural hedges to protect us in the back half as well as some financial forwards. We do expect some headwinds and some unfavorable variances due to currency, but largely protected."

The largest driver of motorcycle mix during the quarter was actually the mix of products within families, not the mix between families. Typically, the mix between families is the largest driver of motorcycle mix variation. So when we look at the overall $24 million, Ed, the biggest drivers of mix within family come from within the Touring segment. So a year ago, we introduced the Ultra Limited, which is a $25,000 vehicle, and it has quickly become one of our top-selling, one of our -- I think, our top three- or four-selling vehicles in the whole lineup. And when you compare that to the rest of the Touring average, without it, which is less than $20,000 on average a vehicle, we've seen significant favorable mix from that. In addition, within the Touring category is the CVO Ultra, has sold very well, and that's got a retail price of around $35,000 a unit. So that's added to a strong mix within the family. And then finally, even in the Sportsters, we have a fair amount of mix. 48 model, for example, the 1200, and it sells at over $10,000, and that is a very large part of the mix in the second quarter, which is also skewed the model mix within that family to be favorable. When we look at the Sportster, Sportster mix, it was at a high percentage of 24.4%, down a little bit from a year ago, which was about 26%. And really the reason that is, is there’s continued very strong demand for 48 and continued demand for Iron 883. So we're continuing to fill the pipeline. Sales in both of those vehicles are going very well. Now we expect the mix for the Sportster mix in the back half to be a higher percentage than last year, largely due to the fact that the fourth quarter was down. And I think the fourth quarter was about 13% of the overall mix in 2009. So as we lap that, we would expect a higher Sportster mix in the back half. And then, in general, mix is -- there’s a lot of factors that affect mix at Harley-Davidson. We've got family mix, which we've talked about, and that's the difference between selling a Touring bike and a Sportster, with very different selling prices. There’s model mix, which I just talked about, and the difference between an Ultra Limited versus a Road King, for example. But also we've got location mix. Where in the world we’re selling that product has a bearing on mix. Option mix, whether it has ABS brakes, wheels, cruise, security. And then the related businesses have a lot of mix variation as well. When you look at parts, we sell a can of oil for a couple of dollars versus a replacement engine at several thousand dollars. Accessories from a foot peg to a GPS system, and MotorClothes and licensing all contribute to a lot of mix variation at the company."

When you look at some of the old-model years, and certainly, we've talked about that a lot, but we've got to put that in perspective as well. It is unusual for Harley-Davidson to have any carryover at this time of year, and -- but to put it in perspective, at this time, for the second quarter retail inventory, the model-year '09 so the carryover inventory that we have is less than 10% of the retail inventory that’s out in the system. And when you look at sales on a worldwide basis for the second quarter, our sales of that old model, our carryover model is less than 10% as well. I think in the United States during the second quarter, we sold about 84% current motorcycles, and again, the competition was more in the range of 30% current motorcycles. So while that does have an impact on the overall MSRP being at or near, or price being at or near MSRP, it's not a huge drag on that. The models that we are selling, the carryover models are at a modest reduction to MSRP, though. Most of the 2010 models are holding up very well at MSRP."

And again, last year we took production down a significant amount in the fourth quarter to adjust the inventory levels. And that's been very successful in this quarter. Some of that reduced production is flowing through with our retail inventories being down 21,000 units. So again, it's very difficult to look at it as we lap last year's production."

We’ve picked up a fair amount of share in that segment. We're also getting dealers involved in selling used bikes, which we've been working on with them for several years. So a lot of good things have happened. But what we do believe is as we limit the new-bike inventories, or keep it in line with demand, we will see the used bikes as they clear the market, those prices come up, and we’ll start to move toward a more normalized used-to-new ratio.

As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it's clear to me that we're making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels,",944,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it's clear to me that we're making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels, so that we can succeed not only at today's volumes but more importantly, grow and restore greater profitability over the long-term. Without question, a lot of hard work lies ahead along with many challenges. The economy is yet to turn around in a convincing way, and many consumers remain on the sidelines. However, as I look at all we've accomplished since we announced our new strategy to deliver results through focus one year ago almost to this day, I am proud of everyone in our organization. Through the outstanding efforts of our entire team, we are bringing our strategy of focus in the Harley-Davidson brand to life. 
So let me start off with a thank you to all of our employees. You are showing that as one company, one team working in one direction, we have accomplished a lot. I also want to thank our dealers, who in most of our global markets have faced the toughest business climate in their lifetimes. But our market share gains demonstrate that working together, Harley-Davidson and its dealers continue to provide a great lifetime experience for our customers.
What we set out to do one year ago was nothing short of transforming our company and our business. And there is no aspect of our business that is going untouched or unchallenged. In this process, we believe we are positioning Harley-Davidson for future prosperity. 
Let me review some of what we've accomplished. We have begun to implement a new operating structure at our York plant enabled by a new labor agreement. This new continuous improvement production system focuses on greater flexibility for surges to meet seasonal and other volume needs and enhanced ability to vary product mix in line with customer expectations and greater production efficiency overall. Again, special recognition goes out to our York employees. In addition to our management team, both the local and international union officials have shown tremendous leadership. 
I was in New York a couple of weeks ago. I walked at the factory floor, it was a great opportunity to talk with our employees. And I have to tell you just how impressed I was with the new operating model that is coming to light there. Thanks to the best thinking of all of our employees. But more than that, I was especially impressed by the attitude of the York workforce in the face of all of the changes. They truly get why this work is so important and what the difference it makes now that they are implementing it and living it. 
At Harley-Davidson Financial Services, we have seen great improvement through our strategic focus on the performance of our Financial Services business, and have delivered strong profitability in the past three quarters. We have completed the divestiture of MV Agusta and exited the Buell business in order to focus our resources and energies on growth through the Harley-Davidson brand. We have seen Harley-Davidson strength and its lead in the U.S. in new motorcycle sales to young adults, not just in the heavyweight category but across all sizes of on-road motorcycles. In 2008, we became the overall market leader to young adults, defined as customers 18 to 34 years old. And in 2009, we expanded that lead. In fact, we sold more new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to today's generation of young adults than we did to the boomers when they were young adults. Our brand has great appeal to these consumers, and we have a great opportunity with this customer base. 
We are also driving our international strategy through our entering into markets like India and our expansion in others like China and Central and Eastern Europe. Over the past 12 months, we have opened 27 new dealerships in international markets. In the Europe region, sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are up 5.6% through nine months compared to last year, as we have continued to gain share. A transformation in product development is currently underway, and becoming more deeply routed each day. Through lean engineering principles and disciplines, we expect to greatly compress development cycle times to bring product wow to the marketplace more quickly. We have achieved new labor agreements in Wisconsin that when they take effect in 2012, will enable the same kind of flexibility to deliver on customer expectations that we are bringing to York. Change is never easy, and I know our we ask our unionized Wisconsin employees to make a difficult choice. And like York, the union officials demonstrated great leadership during this challenging time.  Together, we are making the necessary changes across our entire company, which we believe will allow us to succeed in a competitive global marketplace. 
Those are just some of the highlights of everything that is underway across the entire enterprise for the past year since we rolled out our new strategy. Without a doubt, we have our work cut out for us. but we're intensely focused on those things over which we have control. We have a clear vision for the future, and we have a clear strategy to take us there.  All of these tremendous efforts are going to allow us to better focus on growth opportunities going forward. I am extremely proud of all that we have accomplished so far, and I'm confident we will accomplish much more in the future. Now let me turn it over to John, who will provide details on the quarter."
277444,113574615,80130,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 7. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quart",1364,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 7. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quarter included slightly lower year-over-year shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and improved gross margin, offset by higher SG&A and restructuring charges versus last year. Harley-Davidson Financial Services had another strong quarter. Both income from continuing operations and earnings per share were up during the quarter.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 8. During the quarter, our worldwide dealers retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 7.7% compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales were down 9.4% and continued to be affected by choppy economic conditions. While the U.S. market was down over 14% during the quarter, our market share strengthened up nearly three percentage points to 56.5% from last year. On a year-to-date basis, our U.S. market share was up 0.6 percentage points to 54.5% versus the prior year. 
In the Europe region, Harley-Davidson retail sales were up 11.4% during the quarter compared to last year's third quarter. On a year-to-date basis through August, the overall market was down 2.4%, and our market share increased to 12% compared to 11.5% last year.  In other international markets, Harley-Davidson retail sales in the Latin American region were up 4.6%. The Asia Pacific region was down 12.1%, largely driven by softness in Japan, and Canada was down 26.7%, lapping a relatively strong year-ago quarter. Overall, our international sales were down 3.6% for the quarter.
On Slide 9, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the third quarter were down slightly compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were at the low end of our expectations, and resulted in approximately 18,000 fewer new units in U.S. dealer retail inventory than one year ago.
We are tightening our expected range for full year shipments, and now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide. For the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 41,000 and 46,000 motorcycles, which is 14% to 28% higher than last year's fourth quarter. 
Sportster represented 20% of total shipments in the quarter. We expect fourth quarter's mix of Sportster to be higher than last year's 12.9% mix in the fourth quarter, which was impacted by a shutdown of that production line last year. We continue to expect that Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Slide 10 provides a snapshot of the overall U.S. dealer network. As we have said, we are focused on the health and integrity of the Harley-Davidson dealer network. For the quarter, overall retail inventory was down. And more importantly, dealers have significantly fewer prior model year motorcycle at the time of model year changeover than they did last year. We started shipping the 2011 motorcycles in late July, and the new models including SuperLow, Road Glide Ultra and models featuring the new power peg have been well received. MSRP pricing on the 2011 models in aggregate is flat compared to last year both in the U.S. and on a global basis. 
In addition to improved inventory position, we believe U.S. dealers continue to sell our motorcycles at or near MSRP. While dealers' profitability has certainly been impacted, we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. Dealers continue to carefully manage the businesses and refine their operations as needed. We do expect and are encouraging some contraction of the network. 
On Slide 11, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment for the third quarter was down nearly 2% compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $178 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 12. We continue to be intensely focused on improving our cost structure and restructuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the quarter, we incurred $67.5 million in restructuring expenses, largely driven by expenses associated with Wisconsin operation restructuring, which we announced last month. As you will see on the slide, we have refined costs and savings associated with our overall restructuring activities. Costs have been re-timed across 2010 to 2012, and we expect the total range was reduced by approximately $10 million. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities but have re-timed expected savings in 2010 through 2012.
On Slide 13, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 34.9%, 1.5 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was driven by a richer mix of products and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing and raw material cost. Gross margin for the first nine months was 35.5%, which was up slightly compared to prior year and exceeds our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. Our full year gross margin expectations have not changed and therefore, we expect gross margin to be lower in the fourth quarter as a result of our expectations to produce fewer units compared to the previous three quarters this year. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect Sportster mix to be higher than last year's fourth quarter, which was lower than the historical range.
On Slide 14, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 9.3% versus 11.8% in 2009. SG&A in the quarter was adversely impacted by the company's short-term incentive plan accruals compared to the prior year. This year, we have accrued in each quarter for a potential 2010 year end STIP [Short-Term Incentive Plan] payout. If you recall during the first half of last year, we accrued for an expected 2009 year-end STIP payout. And in the third quarter, the potential for payout was eliminated when we significantly reduced our shipment guidance, which prevented us for meeting the established target goals. As a result, we reversed the first half accrual than the third quarter last year, which reduced SG&A. 
Additionally, while this year's third quarter SG&A increased compared to last year, as you look forward, keep in mind that we have onetime items in the fourth quarter of last year, which we don't expect to repeat in 2010, including a $19 million charge related to warranty and recall. 
Now moving on to the quarterly results for our Financial Services segment on Slide 15. In the quarter, HDFS posted a $50.9 million profit, an improvement of $82.4 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the third quarter 2010 improvement were: net interest income was favorable by $63.3 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables, and an improvement in the net interest spread as the cost of funds that HDFS has decreased, which includes the impact of the transfer of debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009.
Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables, decreased by $23.3 million primarily due to a $28 million charge to increase reserves during last year's third quarter. This year-over-year change was partially offset by the need to re-provide for losses on the increased on-balance sheet receivables. Our credit risk assumptions in the retail portfolio did not change significantly from the prior quarter.
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables is favorable by $6.9 million compared to last year, due to an approximately $5 million net increase in reserves during last year's third quarter. In addition, there was a 24% reduction in the wholesale receivables balance compared to last year's third quarter. The unfavorable $11.9 million all other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer had securitization accounting. The items that existed last year were: income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest. 
We are pleased to see another positive quarter in HDFS. Larry will provide more details on HDFS's operation now. Larry?"

During the third quarter, HDFS originated $543.3 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.6% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 48% for the first nine months of 2010, down 1.1 percentage points compared to the same period last year.
Regarding competition, we continued to see increased activity, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment. At the end of the third quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.5 billion were retail and $0.7 billion were wholesale. 
We continue to see good credit performance on early stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January of 2009. For the first nine months of 2010, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes.
Now moving on to delinquency and losses on Slide 17, where you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.83%. Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively reduce delinquency levels compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U.S. As I mentioned during last quarter's call, historically, delinquencies and losses increased during the second half of the year, as we move out of writing season.
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 66 basis points to 2.04% for the first nine months in 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress in HDFS during the third quarter. But we remain cautious given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment near 10% and the fact that we are moving out of writing season. Now let me turn it back to John."

We are pleased that HDFS is making progress towards their goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns and profitability.  Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 18. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we have $1.55 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.04 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. Our cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs and cash and our committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 19. I would like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash from continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.17 billion during the first nine months of 2010. The Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flow. Of the total, the Motorcycle business generated $523.7 million of operating cash. 
Through the first nine months of 2010, our effective income tax rate from the continuing operations was 34% compared to 47.7% for the same period last year. The year-to-date 2010 effective tax rate through the third quarter was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase in the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing, offset by the tax impact of federal healthcare reform legislation. The 2009 effective tax rate for the same period was unfavorably impacted by a onetime tax charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and nondeductible goodwill charge.
On Slide 20, you'll find a summary of MV Agusta business, which is presented as discontinued operations. As most of you know, we completed the sale of MV Agusta. Through June 2010, losses on discontinued operations net of taxes totaled $103.5 million. During the third quarter of 2010, the loss from discontinued operations was $4.9 million net of taxes.
As we have been expecting, the global economies continue to struggle, and we'll continue to take a conservative approach as we manage the business. On Slide 21, you will see that on a full year basis, we have increased the low end of our expected shipment range. We now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide, as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. Through continuous improvement and careful management of capital expenditures, we now expect full year capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which includes between $75 million and $90 million related to restructuring. Gross margin guidance for 2010 remains unchanged."

We completed the sale of MV Agusta to focus on Harley-Davidson brand and completed labor negotiations with our Wisconsin unions, which will improve flexibility and ongoing manufacturing cost structure when the contract is implemented in 2012. Carryover retail inventory was significantly reduced to make way for exciting 2011 model year product offerings. We also continued profitability at HDFS, and we continue to deliver on strong financial performance with the increase in gross margin and good cash flow with the Motor Company.
Continued challenges in the economy and threshold of the retail customer reinforced our commitment to maintain cautious -- to remain cautious during the recovery. We'll continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand in an effort to move for a more normal ratio of used to new bike sales, which we expect overtime will improve used bike pricing. While progress will likely reflect the choppiness of the overall economic recovery, we believe we have made progress in this area for the strengthening of the brand. 
We are executing a solid plan designed to lower our breakeven point and regain operating margin at significantly lower volumes. Restructuring has already delivered significant results, and we have not compromised the capacity for future growth. In fact, our plan is to be more efficiently responding to future demand. We continue to invest in our future and have demonstrated that with the introduction of the new model year 2011 motorcycles and ongoing international market development and through our outreach marketing efforts. 
And as I've said before, I can't tell you definitely when retail growth will return, but I can assure you that we are managing the business prudently with a focus on our future. We are ready to expand our sales when the world economies improve, and we'll remain disciplined as we manage the company. And now, let's open the call up to your questions."

One of the obvious one is mix between families, and that would be Sportsters versus touring or our cruising motorcycles. It was always mix within -- also mix within families that affects pretty dramatically. And what we're seeing in the results in this quarter as well as the previous couple of quarters is some of the mix within family. For example, the Ultra Limited that we introduced a year ago, July, is the $25,000 Ultra, and that is replacing a lot of the Ultras that we used to sell at a price around $20,000. So we're moving up within the product spectrum within families. In addition when you look at Sportster, you got the 48 model, which is the 1200, and that's bumping up against year-ago results of Iron 883, which was lower priced. So there's a lot of mix within family that's affecting our results. In addition for the quarter, when we look at the introduction of new products in model year 2011, we've added what we call the power pack. It's standard on three models including the Road King classic, the Ultra and the Road Glide Ultra, and that again takes up the sales price. And that's provides a higher power of motor, a 103-cubic-inch motor along with standard ABS [anti-lock braking system] and a security system. So we expect that to continue as again, we lap our model year '10 motorcycle sales in the next year, and we've got other things that affect mix. And we've got mix of our related products, when you look at P&A, the difference between selling and replacement engine versus the net cover, very big difference with the mix as well, same thing with General Merchandise and our licensed product."

And then as we look forward, this is going to be the fourth year barring something crazy in the fourth quarter.

As you look, James, over the three quarters previous including this quarter, we've been down anywhere from 18,000 to 22,000 units. In the fourth quarter, we're going to lap a quarter where we took out a tremendous amount of inventory a year ago, right as we shut down in particular Kansas City, we shut down most of the quarter. So as we look forward, inventories will grow and grow off a lower base than that base of 18,000 units lower as we head in the third quarter. And we're going to be lapping the number of fourth quarter where we took down a lot of inventory. So we'll be more in line. The change in the inventory will not be as great in the fourth quarter because a lot of that was taken out a year ago. And we feel very comfortable where we are with overall inventories, especially as we look at as we exit the fourth quarter versus a year ago, our inventories are one, much lower and in a position that we believe is adequate for the network to grow and to keep upward pressure on used bike prices. And then secondly, the mix of inventory is dramatically better this year than a year ago. Especially when you look at the carryover models, a year ago, we had the highest by far of any carryovers, because of the 35% decline in U.S. retail sales in the second quarter. So we feel great about the number that carryover relationship of carryover models as well as the mix by family is in much better position than it was a year ago."

And then the other question is on your margin guidance. By maintaining your full year guidance, you're kind of implying Q4 gross margin in the 20% range. And I guess if we look at what you've done so far this year, your margins there are back similar to 2008 levels, even though your productions are a lot lower. And so I guess why would that not continue in the fourth quarter even with Sportster mix ramping back up to normal levels?

Anyway, as we look at year-to-date, margins were 35.5%, and that's up by 0.5 point versus a year ago. And we look at overall margin guidance which is 32.5% to 34%, we would certainly expect the fourth quarter margins to be down below that. There's four reasons really why we're looking at the margins to be lower. The first and the biggest impact is that we expect lower shipments in the fourth quarter versus the previous three quarters. So if we look at the first three quarters on average, we've averaged about 55,000 shipments per quarter, and now our expectations are 41,000 to 46,000 expected in the fourth quarter. And obviously, that will have a big impact on the margin structure because of the fixed cost that are absorbed by a much fewer units. And as we look at the fourth quarter last year, margins were at 20.3%. When you adjustment for the Buell, onetime, they're still pretty low at 26%. The second reason is the one that you had mentioned, Robin, is as far as our mix, it's expected to be higher versus last year, which was 12.9% of the mix. So we would expect a higher mix of Sportster, which will affect profitability through the mix. Additionally, in the transformation that's going on in York, right now, we are looking to outsource a lot of the non-core products, and that's happening in this quarter as well as on the next couple of quarters. And with that, as we outsource that product, we have some inefficiencies in trying to duplicate overhead, as we move those products out of that facility, shut down the facility and move it to suppliers. So that will provide some unfavorable variances in the fourth quarter. And then finally, we expect headwinds on currency and metals to continue."

As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it is clear to me that we are making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels so that we can succeed not only at today's volumes, but more importantly, grow and restore greater profitability over the long term.
Without question, a lot of hard work lies ahead, along with many challenges. The economy is yet to turn around in a convincing way, and many consumers remain on the sidelines. However, as I look at all we have accomplished since we announced our new strategy to deliver results through focus, one year ago almost to this day, I am proud of everyone in our organization. Through the outstanding efforts of our entire team, we are bringing our strategy of focus on the Harley-Davidson brand to life.
So let me start off with a thank you to all of our employees. You are showing that as one company, one team, working in one direction, we have accomplished a lot. Also, I want to thank our dealers, who in most of our global markets have faced the toughest business climate in their lifetimes. But our market share gains demonstrate that working together, Harley-Davidson and its dealers continue to provide a great lifetime experience for our customers.
What we set out to do one year ago was nothing short of transforming our company and our business and there is no aspect of our business that is going untouched or unchallenged. In this process, we believe we are positioning Harley-Davidson for future prosperity.
Let me review some of what we have accomplished. We have begun to implement a new operating structure at our York plant, enabled by a new labor agreement. This new continuous improvement production system focuses on greater flexibility or surges to meet seasonal and other volume needs, and enhance stability to vary product mix in line with customer expectations and greater production efficiency overall.
Again, special recognition goes out to our York employees. In addition to our management team, both the local and international union officials have shown tremendous leadership. I was in York a couple of weeks ago, where I walked the factory floor and it was a great opportunity to talk with our employees, and I have to tell you just how impressed I was with the new operating model that is coming to life there, thanks to the best thinking of all of our employees. But more than that, I was especially impressed by the attitude of the York work force in the face of all the changes. They truly get why this work is so important and what a difference it makes, now that they are implementing it and living it.
At Harley-Davidson Financial Services, we have seen great improvement through our strategic focus on the performance of our Financial Services business and have delivered strong profitability in the past three quarters.
We have completed the divestiture of MV Agusta and exited the Buell business in order to focus our resources and energies on growth through the Harley-Davidson brand. We are seeing Harley-Davidson strengthen its lead in the U.S. in new motorcycle sales to young adults, not just in the heavyweight category, but across all sizes of on-road motorcycles.
In 2008, we became the overall market leader to young adults, defined as customers 18 to 34 years old, and in 2009, we expanded that lead. In fact, we sell more new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to today's generation of young adults than we did to the boomers when they were young adults. Our brand has great appeal to these consumers and we have a great opportunity with this customer base.
We are also driving our international strategy. Few are, entering into markets like India and our expansion in others like China and Central and Eastern Europe. Over the past 12 months, we have opened 27 new dealerships in international markets. In the Europe region, sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are up 5.6% through nine months compared to last year, as we have continued to gain share.
A transformation in product development is firmly underway and becoming more deeply rooted each day. Through lean engineering principles and disciplines, we expect to greatly compress development cycle times to bring product wow to the marketplace more quickly.
We have achieved new labor agreements in Wisconsin, that when they take effect in 2012, will enable the same kind of flexibility to deliver our customer expectations that we are bringing to York. Change is never easy, and I know we asked our unionized Wisconsin employees to make a difficult choice. And like York, the union officials demonstrated great leadership during this challenging time. Together, we are making the necessary changes across our entire company, which we believe will allow us to succeed in a competitive global marketplace.
Those are just some of the highlights of everything that is underway across the entire enterprise in the past year, since we rolled out our new strategy. Without doubt, we have our work cut out for us. We are intensely focused on those things over which we have control. We have a clear vision for the future, and we have a clear strategy to take us there.
All of these tremendous efforts are going to allow us to better focus on growth opportunities going forward. I am extremely proud of all that we have accomplished so far, and I am confident we will accomplish much more in the future.
Now let me turn it over to John, who will provide details on the quarter.

Our financial performance in the",1357,"Thanks, Keith; and good morning, everyone. I will review the financial results starting on slide seven. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quarter included slightly lower year-over-year shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and improved gross margin, offset by higher SG&A and restructuring charges versus last year. Harley-Davidson Financial Services had another strong quarter. Both income from continuing operations and earnings per share were up during the quarter.
Moving onto retail sales on slide eight; during the quarter, our worldwide dealers' retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 7.7% compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales were down 9.4% and continued to be affected by choppy economic conditions. While the U.S. market was down over 14% during the quarter, our market share strengthened, up nearly 3 percentage points to 56.5% from last year. On a year-to-date basis, our U.S. market share is up 0.6 percentage points to 54.5% versus prior year.
In the Europe region, Harley-Davidson retail sales were up 11.4% during the quarter compared to last year's third quarter. On a year-to-date basis through August, the overall market was down 2.4% and our market share increased to 12% compared to 11.5% last year.
In other international markets, Harley-Davidson retail sales in the Latin American region were up 4.6%. The Asia Pacific region was down 12.1%, largely driven by softness in Japan; and Canada was down 26.7%, lapping a relatively strong year-ago quarter. Overall, our international sales were down 3.6% for the quarter.
On slide nine, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the third quarter were down slightly compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were at the low end of our expectations, and resulted in approximately 18,000 fewer new units in U.S. dealer retail inventories than one year ago. We are tightening our expected range for full year shipments and now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide. For the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 41,000 and 46,000 motorcycles, which is 14% to 28% higher than last year's fourth quarter.
Sportsters represented 20% of total shipments in the quarter. We expect fourth quarter's mix of Sportsters to be higher than last year's 12.9% mix in the fourth quarter, which was impacted by a shutdown of that production line last year. We continue to expect that Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Slide 10 provides a snapshot of the overall U.S. dealer network. As we have said, we are focused on the health and integrity of the Harley-Davidson dealer network. For the quarter, overall retail inventory was down, and more importantly, dealers had significantly fewer prior model year motorcycles at the time of model year changeover than they did last year.
We started shipping the 2011 motorcycles in late July and the new models including SuperLow, Road Glide Ultra, and models featuring the new PowerPak have been well received.
MSRP pricing on the 2011 models in aggregate is flat compared to last year, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. In addition to improved inventory position, we believe U.S. dealers continue to sell our motorcycles at or near MSRP. While dealers' profitability has certainly been impacted, we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. Dealers continue to carefully manage their businesses and refine their operations as needed. We do expect and are encouraging some contraction of the network.
On slide 11, you will see revenue for the motorcycles and related products segment for the third quarter was down nearly 2% compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue per Harley-Davidson unit sold increased $178 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on slide 12, we continue to be intensely focused on improving our cost structure and restructuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the quarter, we incurred $67.5 million in restructuring expenses, largely driven by expenses associated with Wisconsin operations restructuring, which we announced last month. As you will see on the slide, we have refined costs and savings associated with our overall restructuring activities.
Costs have been retimed across 2010 through 2012 and the expected total range was reduced by approximately $10 million. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities, but have retimed expected savings in 2010 through 2012.
On slide 13, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 34.9%, 1.5 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was driven by a richer mix of products and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing and raw material costs.
Gross margin for the first nine months was 35.5%, which was up slightly compared to prior year, and exceeds our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. Our full year gross margin expectations have not changed, and therefore, we expect gross margins to be lower in the fourth quarter as a result of our expectations to produce fewer units compared to the previous three quarters of this year. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect Sportster mix to be higher than last year's fourth quarter, which was lower than the historical range.
On slide 14, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 9.3% versus 11.8% in 2009. SG&A in the quarter was adversely impacted by the company's short-term incentive plan accruals compared to the prior year. This year, we have accrued in each quarter for a potential 2010 year-end split payout. If you recall, during the first half of last year, we accrued for an expected 2009 year-end split payout. Then in the third quarter, the potential for payout was eliminated when we significantly reduced our shipment guidance, which prevented us from meeting the established target goals.
As a result, we reversed the first half accruals in the third quarter of last year, which reduced SG&A. Additionally, while this year's third quarter SG&A increased compared to last year, as you look forward, keep in mind that we had one-time items in the fourth quarter of last year, which we don't expect to repeat in 2010, including a $19 million charge related to warranty and recall.
Now moving on to quarterly results for our Financial Services segment on slide 15; in the quarter, HDFS posted a $50.9 million profit, an improvement of $82.4 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the third quarter 2010 improvement were: net interest income was favorable by $63.3 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables and an improvement in the net interest spread as the cost of funds at HDFS has decreased, which includes the impact of the transfer of debt from HDFS to HD, Inc. in 2009.
Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables decreased by $23.3 million, primarily due to $28 million charge to increase reserves during last year's third quarter. This year-over-year change was partially offset by the need to re-provide for losses on the increased on-balance sheet receivables. Our credit risk assumptions in the retail portfolio did not change significantly from the prior quarter.
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables is favorable by $6.9 million compared to last year, due to an approximately $5 million net increase in reserves during last year's third quarter. In addition, there was a 24% reduction in the wholesale receivables balance compared to last year's third quarter.
The unfavorable $11.9 million all other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer have securitization accounting. The items that existed last year were income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees, and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest.
We are pleased to see another positive quarter at HDFS.
Larry will provide more details on HDFS' operation now. Larry?

During the third quarter, HDFS originated $543.3 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.6% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S.
HDFS' retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 48% for the first nine months of 2010, down 1.1 percentage points compared to the same period last year. Regarding competition, we continued to see increased activity, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment.
At the end of the third quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.5 billion were retail and $0.7 billion were wholesale. We continued to see good credit performance on early-stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January of 2009.
For the first nine months of 2010, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime, compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes.
Now moving on to delinquency and losses on slide 17, where you will see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.83%. Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies, and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively reduce delinquency levels compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U.S. As I mentioned during last quarter's call, historically, delinquencies and losses increased during the second half of the year, as we move out of riding season.
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 66 basis points to 2.04% for the first nine months in 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting, and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles.
We are pleased with the progress at HDFS during the third quarter, but we would remain cautious, given the continuing economic challenges, with unemployment near 10%, and the fact that we are moving out of riding season.
Now, let me turn it back to John.

We are pleased that HDFS is making progress towards their goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns and profitability.
Now let us take a look at cash and liquidity on slide 18. You will see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.55 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.04 billion of available liquidity through bank, credit, and conduit facilities. Our cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities.
Now, I will review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on slide 19. I would like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash from continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.17 billion during the first nine months of 2010. The Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flow. Of the total, the Motorcycle business generated $523.7 million of operating cash.
Through the first nine months of 2010, our effective income tax rate for the continuing operations was 34% compared to 47.7% for the same period last year. The year-to-date 2010 effective tax rate through the third quarter was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase of the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing, offset by the tax impact of federal healthcare reform legislation. The 2009 effective tax rate for the same period was unfavorably impacted by a one-time tax charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and non-deductible goodwill charge.
On slide 20, you will find a summary of MV Agusta business, which is presented as discontinued operations. As most of you know, we concluded the sale of MV Agusta. Through June 2010, losses on discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $103.5 million. During the third quarter of 2010, the loss from discontinued operations was $4.9 million, net of taxes.
As we have been expecting, the global economies continue to struggle and we will continue to take a conserve approach as we manage the business. On slide 21, you will see that on a full year basis, we have increased the low end of our expected shipment range. We now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide as we continue to aggressively manage supply and demand. Through continuous improvement and careful management of capital expenditures, we now expect full year capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which includes between $75 million and $90 million related to restructuring. Gross margin guidance for 2010 remains unchanged.

We completed the sale of MV Agusta to focus on Harley-Davidson brand and completed labor negotiations with our Wisconsin unions, which will improve flexibility and ongoing manufacturing cost structure, when the contract is implemented in 2012.
Carryover retail inventory was significantly reduced to make way for exciting 2011 model year product offerings. We also continued profitability at HDFS and we continued to deliver on strong financial performance with the increasing gross margin and good cash flow at the motor company.
Continued challenges in the economy and pressure on the retail customer reinforced our commitment to remain cautious through the recovery. We will continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand, in an effort to move for a more normal ratio of used to new bike sales, which we expect over time will improve used bike pricing. While progress will likely reflect the choppiness of the overall economic recovery, we believe we have made progress in this area, further strengthening the brand.
We are executing a solid plan designed to lower our breakeven point and regain operating margins at significantly lower volumes. Restructuring has already delivered significant results, and we have not compromised the capacity for future growth. In fact, our plan is more officially respond to future demand. We continue to invest in our future, and have demonstrated that with the introduction of the new model year 2011 motorcycles, in ongoing international market development, and through our outreach marketing efforts.
And as I have said before, I can't tell you definitely when retail growth will return, but I can assure that we are managing the business prudently with the focus on our future. We are ready to expand our sales when world economies improve and will remain disciplined as we manage the company.

One of the obvious ones is mix between families and that would be Sportsters versus touring or our cruising motorcycles. There is always mix within tails, so mix within family that affects pretty dramatically, and what we are seeing in the results in this quarter as well as the previous couple of quarters, is some of the mix within family. For example, the Ultra Limited that we introduced a year ago in July is a $25,000 Ultra, and that is replacing a lot of the Ultras that we used to sell at a price around $20,000, so moving up within the product spectrum within families.
In addition, when you look at Sportster, you got the 48 model, which is a 1200 and that is bumping up against year-ago results of 883, Iron 883, which is lower priced. So there is a lot of mix within families that is affecting our results.
In addition, for the quarter, when we look at the introduction of new products in 2011 or model year 2011, we have added what we call the PowerPak. It is standard on three models, including the Road King Classic, the Ultra, and the Road Glide Ultra and that again takes up the sale price and that provides a higher powered motor, a 103 cubic inch motor, along with standard ABS and a security system. So, we expect that to continue, as again we lap model year '10 motorcycle sales into next year and we have had other things that affect mix. And we have got mix of our related products, when you look on P&A. The difference between selling a replacement engine versus a nut cover, very big differences in mix as well, same thing with general merchandise and our licensed products.

And as you can see in our financial results, we have been realizing some un-favorability in the metals complex, about $9 million on a year-to-date basis. For the short term, we would expect that trend to continue just because it is flowing through; things are flowing through our supply chain.
As far as India and China, your question about India and China, I mean, we look at these as both very important markets for us, particularly into the future. And you know, there is a lot of work to be done there around tariffs and around manufacturing capabilities, et cetera, but certainly, when you look at our strategy, our strategy is focused on those areas and growing our sales in those areas as we go forward. India, we hope and I think four of the five dealerships that we planned have opened so far this year, and the fifth will open soon. We have been very successful in selling bikes there. I mean, we didn't have a plan to sell a large amount of bikes initially, but I think we are on plan, what we thought it would be. The interest, the affection for the brand is incredible, and we see it as a big market for us going forward.

When we look at the euro, we have got some natural hedges in place as parts that we buy back from Europe as well as some of the SG&A spending that we do there.

My question is surrounding inventories as we look forward. Historically, during the fourth quarter, you build retail level inventories anywhere between 25,000 and 35,000 units, meaning you shipped that much more into the channel versus what sold out of the channel ahead of the spring selling season. Last year, you actually drew down inventory a little bit. Obviously, you are not going to get to the practice of giving guidance on that or retail assumptions, but just directionally, what can you tell us about what to expect? Should it be closer to sort of historical levels or was last year not necessarily an outlier? And then as we look forward, you know, this is going to be the fourth year borrowing something crazy in the fourth quarter - this is going to be the fourth straight year, pretty meaningful inventory reductions at retail. Do you feel comfortable that you can get back to sort of one-for-one wholesale or retail as you look forward to 2011?

As you look, James, over the three quarters previous, including this quarter, we have been down anywhere from 18,000 to 22,000 units. In the fourth quarter, we are going to lap a quarter where we took out a tremendous amount of inventory a year ago, right, as we shut down, in particular Kansas City, we shut down most of the quarter. So, as we look forward, inventories will grow or grow up a lower base and that base is 18,000 units lower as we end the third quarter, and we are going to be lapping the number of fourth quarter where we took down a lot of inventory. So, we will be more in line, the change in the inventory will not be as great in the fourth quarter because a lot of that was taken out a year ago.
And we feel very comfortable where we are with overall inventories, especially as we look at it as we exit the third quarter versus year ago, our inventories are one, much lower and in a position that we believe is adequate for the network to grow and to keep upward pressure on used bike prices; and then secondly, the mix of inventory is dramatically better this year than a year ago, especially when you look at the carryover models, a year ago we had the highest level by far of any carryovers, because of a 35% decline in U.S. retail sales in the second quarter. So, we feel great about the number, the carryover, relationship of carryover models as well as the mix by family is in much better position than it was a year ago.

First is, you talked about the HDFS, your market share of new bikes sold for the year-to-date, I wonder if you could give us some market share for this quarter versus last quarter? And then my other question is on your margin guidance. By maintaining your full year guidance, you are kind of implying Q4 gross margin in the 20% range, and I guess if we look at what you have done so far this year, your margins are back similar to 2008 levels, even though your production is lot lower. And so I guess why would that, you know, not continue in the fourth quarter, even with Sportster mix ramping back up to normal levels. In Q4 of 2008, you had margins in the low 30% range, even with Sportsters in the mix. So, I am just trying to think about, why your margins would be in the 21% to 28% range, squaring that with everything else we have seen?

As we look at year-to-date margins were 35.5% and it is up half a point versus year ago, and we look at overall margin guidance, which is 32.5% on t",322,"Robin, I will start with the second question and then Larry can jump in on the HDFS market share question. As we look at year-to-date margins were 35.5% and it is up half a point versus year ago, and we look at overall margin guidance, which is 32.5% on the 34.0%, we would certainly expect the fourth quarter margins to be down below that. There is four reasons, really why we are looking at the margins to be lower. The first and the biggest impact is that, we expect lower shipments in the fourth quarter versus the previous three quarters. So, if we look at the first three quarters on average, we have averaged about 55,000 shipments per quarter, and now our expectations are 41,000 to 46,000 expected in the fourth quarter and obviously, that will have a big impact on the margin structure, because of the fixed costs that are absorbed by much fewer units. And as we looked at the fourth quarter last year, margins were at 20.3%; and you adjust for the Buell one-time they are still pretty low at 26%.
The second reason is the one that you had mentioned, Robin, is that Sportster mix is expected to be higher versus last year, which was 12.9% of the mix. So we would expect a higher mix of Sportsters, which will affect profitability through mix. Additionally, in the transformation that is going on in York, right now we are looking to outsource a lot of the non-core products and that is happening in this quarter as well as on the next couple of quarters and with that, as we outsource that product, we have some inefficiencies in carrying duplicate overheads as we move those products out of that facility, shutdown the facility, and move it to suppliers. So, that will provide some unfavorable variances in the fourth quarter, and then finally, expect headwinds on currency and metals to continue.

The first half of Q3 was really characterized by transitioning between model years. We stopped shipment of model year '10 production and held model year '11 production until late July, early August. So therefore, inventories in the first half of the dealer network where bled down quite significantly versus the prior year and as I told you, we had some dealers saying that inventories were so tight that their sales were being delayed. The second half of the year was characterized by very strong dealer sales of model year 2011 bikes. The bikes have been very well received by our dealers and customers, and while the overall inventories are still down, the mix of inventories, as I mentioned previously, has dramatically improved with better family mix, certainly better new models versus old models or old model years, and we did see an improvement in the second half of the quarter.

As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it's clear to me that we're making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels",940,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it's clear to me that we're making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels so that we can succeed not only at today's volumes, but more importantly, grow and restore greater profitability over the long-term. Without question, a lot of hard work lies ahead along with many challenges. The economy is yet to turn around in a convincing way, and many consumers remain on the sidelines. However, as I look at all we've accomplished since we announced our new strategy to deliver results through focus one year ago almost to this day, I am proud of everyone in our organization. Through the outstanding efforts of our entire team, we are bringing our strategy of focus in the Harley-Davidson brand to life. 
So let me start off with a thank you to all of our employees. You are showing that as one company, one team working in one direction, we have accomplished a lot. I also want to thank our dealers, who in most of our global markets have faced the toughest business climate in their lifetimes. But our market share gains demonstrate that working together, Harley-Davidson and its dealers continue to provide a great lifetime experience for our customers.
What we set out to do one year ago was nothing short of transforming our company and our business. And there is no aspect of our business that is going untouched or unchallenged. In this process, we believe we are positioning Harley-Davidson for future prosperity. 
Let me review some of what we've accomplished. We have begun to implement a new operating structure at our York plant enabled by a new labor agreement. This new continuous improvement production system focuses on greater flexibility for surges to meet seasonal and other volume needs and enhanced ability to vary product mix in line with customer expectations and greater production efficiency overall. Again, special recognition goes out to our York employees. In addition to our management team, both the local and international union officials have shown tremendous leadership. 
I was in York a couple weeks ago where I walked the factory floor, and it was a great opportunity to talk with our employees. And I have to tell you just how impressed I was with the new operating model that is coming to light there, thanks to the best thinking of all of our employees. But more than that, I was especially impressed by the attitude of the York workforce in the face of all of the changes. They truly get why this work is so important and what a difference it makes now that they are implementing it and living it. 
At Harley-Davidson Financial Services, we have seen great improvement through our strategic focus on the performance of our Financial Services business, and have delivered strong profitability in the past three quarters. We have completed the divestiture of MV Agusta and exited the Buell business in order to focus our resources and energies on growth through the Harley-Davidson brand. We have seen Harley-Davidson strengthen its lead in the U.S. in new motorcycle sales to young adults, not just in the heavyweight category but across all sizes of on-road motorcycles. In 2008, we became the overall market leader to young adults, defined as customers 18 to 34 years old. And in 2009, we expanded that lead. In fact, we sold more new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to today's generation of young adults than we did to the boomers when they were young adults. Our brand has great appeal to these consumers, and we have a great opportunity with this customer base. 
We are also driving our international strategy through our entering into markets like India and our expansion in others like China and Central and Eastern Europe. Over the past 12 months, we have opened 27 new dealerships in international markets. In the Europe region, sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are up 5.6% through nine months compared to last year, as we have continued to gain share. A transformation in product development is currently underway, and becoming more deeply routed each day. Through lean engineering principles and disciplines, we expect to greatly compress development cycle times to bring product wow to the marketplace more quickly. We have achieved new labor agreements in Wisconsin that when they take effect in 2012, will enable the same kind of flexibility to deliver on customer expectations that we are bringing to York. Change is never easy, and I know we asked our unionized Wisconsin employees to make a difficult choice. And like York, the union officials demonstrated great leadership during this challenging time.  Together, we are making the necessary changes across our entire company, which we believe will allow us to succeed in a competitive global marketplace. 
Those are just some of the highlights of everything that is underway across the entire enterprise for the past year since we rolled out our new strategy. Without doubt, we have our work cut out for us, but we're intensely focused on those things over which we have control. We have a clear vision for the future, and we have a clear strategy to take us there.  All of these tremendous efforts are going to allow us to better focus on growth opportunities going forward. I am extremely proud of all that we have accomplished so far, and I'm confident we will accomplish much more in the future. Now let me turn it over to John, who will provide details on the quarter."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 7. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quart",1362,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 7. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quarter included slightly lower year-over-year shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and improved gross margin, offset by higher SG&A and restructuring charges versus last year. Harley-Davidson Financial Services had another strong quarter. Both income from continuing operations and earnings per share were up during the quarter.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 8. During the quarter, our worldwide dealers retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 7.7% compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales were down 9.4% and continued to be affected by choppy economic conditions. While the U.S. market was down over 14% during the quarter, our market share strengthened up nearly three percentage points to 56.5% from last year. On a year-to-date basis, our U.S. market share was up 0.6 percentage points to 54.5% versus the prior year. 
In the Europe region, Harley-Davidson retail sales were up 11.4% during the quarter compared to last year's third quarter. On a year-to-date basis through August, the overall market was down 2.4%, and our market share increased to 12% compared to 11.5% last year.  In other international markets, Harley-Davidson retail sales in the Latin American region were up 4.6%. The Asia Pacific region was down 12.1%, largely driven by softness in Japan, and Canada was down 26.7%, lapping a relatively strong year-ago quarter. Overall, our international sales were down 3.6% for the quarter.
On Slide 9, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the third quarter were down slightly compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were at the low end of our expectations, and resulted in approximately 18,000 fewer new units in U.S. dealer retail inventory than one year ago.
We are tightening our expected range for full year shipments, and now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide. For the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 41,000 and 46,000 motorcycles, which is 14% to 28% higher than last year's fourth quarter. 
Sportsters represented 20% of total shipments in the quarter. We expect fourth quarter's mix of Sportsters to be higher than last year's 12.9% mix in the fourth quarter, which was impacted by a shutdown of that production line last year. We continue to expect that Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Slide 10 provides a snapshot of the overall U.S. dealer network. As we have said, we are focused on the health and integrity of the Harley-Davidson dealer network. For the quarter, overall retail inventory was down. And more importantly, dealers have significantly fewer prior model year motorcycles at the time of model year changeover than they did last year. We started shipping the 2011 motorcycles in late July, and the new models including SuperLow, Road Glide Ultra and models featuring the new PowerPak have been well received. MSRP pricing on the 2011 models in aggregate is flat compared to last year both in the U.S. and on a global basis. 
In addition to improved inventory position, we believe U.S. dealers continue to sell our motorcycles at or near MSRP. While dealers' profitability has certainly been impacted, we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. Dealers continue to carefully manage their businesses and refine their operations as needed. We do expect and are encouraging some contraction of the network. 
On Slide 11, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment for the third quarter was down nearly 2% compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $178 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 12. We continue to be intensely focused on improving our cost structure and restructuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the quarter, we incurred $67.5 million in restructuring expenses, largely driven by expenses associated with Wisconsin operations restructuring, which we announced last month. As you will see on the slide, we have refined costs and savings associated with our overall restructuring activities. Costs have been re-timed across 2010 to 2012, and we expect the total range was reduced by approximately $10 million. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities, but have re-timed expected savings in 2010 through 2012.
On Slide 13, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 34.9%, 1.5 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was driven by a richer mix of products and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing and raw material costs. Gross margin for the first nine months was 35.5%, which was up slightly compared to prior year and exceeds our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. Our full year gross margin expectations have not changed and therefore, we expect gross margin to be lower in the fourth quarter as a result of our expectations to produce fewer units compared to the previous three quarters this year. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect Sportster mix to be higher than last year's fourth quarter, which was lower than the historical range.
On Slide 14, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 9.3% versus 11.8% in 2009. SG&A in the quarter was adversely impacted by the company's short-term incentive plan accruals compared to the prior year. This year, we have accrued in each quarter for a potential 2010 year-end STIP [Short-Term Incentive Plan] payout. If you recall during the first half of last year, we accrued for an expected 2009 year-end STIP payout. And in the third quarter, the potential for payout was eliminated when we significantly reduced our shipment guidance, which prevented us from meeting the established target goals. As a result, we reversed the first half accrual in the third quarter last year, which reduced SG&A. 
Additionally, while this year's third quarter SG&A increased compared to last year, as you look forward, keep in mind that we had onetime items in the fourth quarter of last year, which we don't expect to repeat in 2010, including a $19 million charge related to warranty and recall. 
Now moving on to the quarterly results for our Financial Services segment on Slide 15. In the quarter, HDFS posted a $50.9 million profit, an improvement of $82.4 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the third quarter 2010 improvement were: net interest income was favorable by $63.3 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables, and an improvement in the net interest spread as the cost of funds at HDFS has decreased, which includes the impact of the transfer of debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009.
Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables, decreased by $23.3 million primarily due to a $28 million charge to increase reserves during last year's third quarter. This year-over-year change was partially offset by the need to re-provide for losses on the increased on-balance sheet receivables. Our credit risk assumptions in the retail portfolio did not change significantly from the prior quarter.
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables is favorable by $6.9 million compared to last year, due to an approximately $5 million net increase in reserves during last year's third quarter. In addition, there was a 24% reduction in the wholesale receivables balance compared to last year's third quarter. The unfavorable $11.9 million all other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer had securitization accounting. The items that existed last year were: income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest. 
We are pleased to see another positive quarter at HDFS. Larry will provide more details on HDFS's operation now. Larry?"

During the third quarter, HDFS originated $543.3 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.6% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 48% for the first nine months of 2010, down 1.1 percentage points compared to the same period last year.
Regarding competition, we continued to see increased activity, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment. At the end of the third quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.5 billion were retail and $0.7 billion were wholesale. 
We continue to see good credit performance on early stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January of 2009. For the first nine months of 2010, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes.
Now moving on to delinquency and losses on Slide 17, where you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.83%. Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively reduce delinquency levels compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U.S. As I mentioned during last quarter's call, historically, delinquencies and losses increased during the second half of the year, as we move out of riding season.
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 66 basis points to 2.04% for the first nine months in 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS during the third quarter, but we remain cautious given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment near 10% and the fact that we are moving out of riding season. Now let me turn it back to John."

We are pleased that HDFS is making progress towards their goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns and profitability.  
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 18. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.55 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.04 billion of available liquidity through bank, credit and conduit facilities. Our cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 19. I would like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash from continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.17 billion during the first nine months of 2010. The Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flow. Of the total, the Motorcycle business generated $523.7 million of operating cash. 
Through the first nine months of 2010, our effective income tax rate from the continuing operations was 34% compared to 47.7% for the same period last year. The year-to-date 2010 effective tax rate through the third quarter was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase of the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing, offset by the tax impact of federal healthcare reform legislation. The 2009 effective tax rate for the same period was unfavorably impacted by a onetime tax charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and nondeductible goodwill charge.
On Slide 20, you'll find a summary of MV Agusta business, which is presented as discontinued operations. As most of you know, we completed the sale of MV Agusta. Through June 2010, losses on discontinued operations net of taxes totaled $103.5 million. During the third quarter of 2010, the loss from discontinued operations was $4.9 million net of taxes.
As we have been expecting, the global economies continue to struggle, and we'll continue to take a conservative approach as we manage the business. On Slide 21, you will see that on a full year basis, we have increased the low end of our expected shipment range. We now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide, as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. Through continuous improvement and careful management of capital expenditures, we now expect full year capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which includes between $75 million and $90 million related to restructuring. Gross margin guidance for 2010 remains unchanged."

We completed the sale of MV Agusta to focus on Harley-Davidson brand and completed labor negotiations with our Wisconsin unions, which will improve flexibility and ongoing manufacturing cost structure when the contract is implemented in 2012. Carryover retail inventory was significantly reduced to make way for exciting 2011 model year product offerings. We also continued profitability at HDFS, and we continue to deliver on strong financial performance with increasing gross margin and good cash flow at the Motor Company.
Continued challenges in the economy and pressure on the retail customer reinforced our commitment to maintain cautious -- to remain cautious through the recovery. We'll continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand in an effort to move for a more normal ratio of used to new bike sales, which we expect over time will improve used bike pricing. While progress will likely reflect the choppiness of the overall economic recovery, we believe we have made progress in this area for the strengthening of the brand. 
We are executing a solid plan designed to lower our breakeven point and regain operating margin at significantly lower volumes. Restructuring has already delivered significant results, and we have not compromised the capacity for future growth. In fact, our plan is to be more efficiently responding to future demand. We continue to invest in our future and have demonstrated that with the introduction of the new model year 2011 motorcycles and ongoing international market development and through our outreach marketing efforts. 
And as I've said before, I can't tell you definitely when retail growth will return, but I can assure you that we are managing the business prudently with a focus on our future. We are ready to expand our sales when the world economies improve, and we'll remain disciplined as we manage the company. And now, let's open the call up to your questions."

One of the obvious one is mix between families, and that would be Sportsters versus Touring or our Cruising motorcycles. It was always mix within -- also mix within families that affects pretty dramatically. And what we're seeing in the results in this quarter as well as the previous couple of quarters is some of the mix within family. For example, the Ultra Limited that we introduced a year ago in July is a $25,000 Ultra, and that is replacing a lot of the Ultras that we used to sell at a price around $20,000. So we're moving up within the product spectrum within families. In addition when you look at Sportster, you got the 48 model, which is a 1200, and that's bumping up against year-ago results of the 883, Iron 883, which is lower priced. So there's a lot of mix within family that's affecting our results. In addition for the quarter, when we look at the introduction of new products in model year 2011, we've added what we call the PowerPak. It's standard on three models including the Road King Classic, the Ultra and the Road Glide Ultra, and that again takes up the sales price. And that's provides a higher power of motor, a 103-cubic-inch motor along with standard ABS [anti-lock braking system] and a security system. So we expect that to continue as again, we lap our model year '10 motorcycle sales in the next year. And we've got other things that affect mix. And we've got mix of our related products, when you look at P&A, the difference between selling a replacement engine versus a nut cover, very big difference with the mix as well, same thing with General Merchandise and our licensed products."

As you look, James, over the three quarters previous including this quarter, we've been down anywhere from 18,000 to 22,000 units. In the fourth quarter, we're going to lap a quarter where we took out a tremendous amount of inventory a year ago, right as we shut down -- in particular Kansas City, we shut down most of the quarter. So as we look forward, inventories will grow and grow off a lower base than that base of 18,000 units lower as we head in the third quarter. And we're going to be lapping the number of fourth quarter where we took down a lot of inventory. So we'll be more in line. The change in the inventory will not be as great in the fourth quarter because a lot of that was taken out a year ago. And we feel very comfortable where we are with overall inventories, especially as we look it as we exit the fourth quarter versus a year ago, our inventories are one, much lower and in a position that we believe is adequate for the network to grow and to keep upward pressure on used bike prices. And then secondly, the mix of inventory is dramatically better this year than a year ago. Especially when you look at the carryover models, a year ago, we had the highest level by far of any carryovers, because of the 35% decline in U.S. retail sales in the second quarter.

Anyway, as we look at year-to-date, margins were 35.5%, and that's up by 0.5 point versus a year ago.

Anyway, as we look at year-to-date, margins were 35.5%, and that's up by 0.5 point versus a year ago. And we look at overall margin guidance which is 32.5% to 34%, we would certainly expect the fourth quarter margins to be down below that. There's four reasons really why we're looking at the margins to be lower. The first and the biggest impact is that we expect lower shipments in the fourth quarter versus the previous three quarters. So if we look at the first three quarters on average, we've averaged about 55,000 shipments per quarter, and now our expectations are 41,000 to 46,000 expected in the fourth quarter. And obviously, that will have a big impact on the margin structure because of the fixed cost that are absorbed by a much fewer units. And as we look at the fourth quarter last year, margins were at 20.3%. And the adjustment for the Buell, onetime, they're still pretty low at 26%. The second reason is the one that you had mentioned, Robin, is as far as our mix, it's expected to be higher versus last year, which was 12.9% of the mix. So we would expect a higher mix of Sportsters, which will affect profitability through the mix. Additionally, in the transformation that's going on in York, right now we are looking to outsource a lot of the non-core products, and that's happening in this quarter as well as on the next couple of quarters. And with that, as we outsource that product, we have some inefficiencies in trying to duplicate overhead, as we move those products out of that facility, shut down the facility and move it to suppliers. So that will provide some unfavorable variances in the fourth quarter. And then finally, we expect headwinds on currency and metals to continue."

The first half of Q3 was really characterized by transitioning between model years. We stopped shipment of model year '10 production in mid-June and held model year '11 production until late July, early August. So therefore, the inventories in the first half, the dealer network were bled down quite significantly versus the prior year. And I have told you we had some dealers saying that inventories were so tight that their sales were being delayed. The second half of the year was characterized by very strong dealer sales of model year 2011 bikes. The bikes have been very well received by our dealers and customers. And while the overall inventories are still down, the mix of inventories, as I've mentioned previously, has dramatically improved with better family mix, certainly better new models versus old models or old model years, and we did see an improvement in the second half of the quarter."

As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it's clear to me that we're making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels",940,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As I look at where Harley-Davidson stands today, it's clear to me that we're making solid progress against our goal, which is to transform our business at all levels so that we can succeed not only at today's volumes, but more importantly, grow and restore greater profitability over the long-term. Without question, a lot of hard work lies ahead along with many challenges. The economy is yet to turn around in a convincing way, and many consumers remain on the sidelines. However, as I look at all we've accomplished since we announced our new strategy to deliver results through focus one year ago almost to this day, I am proud of everyone in our organization. Through the outstanding efforts of our entire team, we are bringing our strategy of focus in the Harley-Davidson brand to life. 
So let me start off with a thank you to all of our employees. You are showing that as one company, one team working in one direction, we have accomplished a lot. I also want to thank our dealers, who in most of our global markets have faced the toughest business climate in their lifetimes. But our market share gains demonstrate that working together, Harley-Davidson and its dealers continue to provide a great lifetime experience for our customers.
What we set out to do one year ago was nothing short of transforming our company and our business. And there is no aspect of our business that is going untouched or unchallenged. In this process, we believe we are positioning Harley-Davidson for future prosperity. 
Let me review some of what we've accomplished. We have begun to implement a new operating structure at our York plant enabled by a new labor agreement. This new continuous improvement production system focuses on greater flexibility for surges to meet seasonal and other volume needs and enhanced ability to vary product mix in line with customer expectations and greater production efficiency overall. Again, special recognition goes out to our York employees. In addition to our management team, both the local and international union officials have shown tremendous leadership. 
I was in York a couple weeks ago where I walked the factory floor, and it was a great opportunity to talk with our employees. And I have to tell you just how impressed I was with the new operating model that is coming to light there, thanks to the best thinking of all of our employees. But more than that, I was especially impressed by the attitude of the York workforce in the face of all of the changes. They truly get why this work is so important and what a difference it makes now that they are implementing it and living it. 
At Harley-Davidson Financial Services, we have seen great improvement through our strategic focus on the performance of our Financial Services business, and have delivered strong profitability in the past three quarters. We have completed the divestiture of MV Agusta and exited the Buell business in order to focus our resources and energies on growth through the Harley-Davidson brand. We have seen Harley-Davidson strengthen its lead in the U.S. in new motorcycle sales to young adults, not just in the heavyweight category but across all sizes of on-road motorcycles. In 2008, we became the overall market leader to young adults, defined as customers 18 to 34 years old. And in 2009, we expanded that lead. In fact, we sold more new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to today's generation of young adults than we did to the boomers when they were young adults. Our brand has great appeal to these consumers, and we have a great opportunity with this customer base. 
We are also driving our international strategy through our entering into markets like India and our expansion in others like China and Central and Eastern Europe. Over the past 12 months, we have opened 27 new dealerships in international markets. In the Europe region, sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles are up 5.6% through nine months compared to last year, as we have continued to gain share. A transformation in product development is currently underway, and becoming more deeply routed each day. Through lean engineering principles and disciplines, we expect to greatly compress development cycle times to bring product wow to the marketplace more quickly. We have achieved new labor agreements in Wisconsin that when they take effect in 2012, will enable the same kind of flexibility to deliver on customer expectations that we are bringing to York. Change is never easy, and I know we asked our unionized Wisconsin employees to make a difficult choice. And like York, the union officials demonstrated great leadership during this challenging time.  Together, we are making the necessary changes across our entire company, which we believe will allow us to succeed in a competitive global marketplace. 
Those are just some of the highlights of everything that is underway across the entire enterprise for the past year since we rolled out our new strategy. Without doubt, we have our work cut out for us, but we're intensely focused on those things over which we have control. We have a clear vision for the future, and we have a clear strategy to take us there.  All of these tremendous efforts are going to allow us to better focus on growth opportunities going forward. I am extremely proud of all that we have accomplished so far, and I'm confident we will accomplish much more in the future. Now let me turn it over to John, who will provide details on the quarter."

I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 7. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quart",1362,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the financial results starting on Slide 7. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and related products revenue from continuing operations was down 1.9%. Our financial performance in the quarter included slightly lower year-over-year shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and improved gross margin, offset by higher SG&A and restructuring charges versus last year. Harley-Davidson Financial Services had another strong quarter. Both income from continuing operations and earnings per share were up during the quarter.
Moving on to retail sales on Slide 8. During the quarter, our worldwide dealers retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 7.7% compared to last year. In the U.S., retail sales were down 9.4% and continued to be affected by choppy economic conditions. While the U.S. market was down over 14% during the quarter, our market share strengthened up nearly three percentage points to 56.5% from last year. On a year-to-date basis, our U.S. market share was up 0.6 percentage points to 54.5% versus the prior year. 
In the Europe region, Harley-Davidson retail sales were up 11.4% during the quarter compared to last year's third quarter. On a year-to-date basis through August, the overall market was down 2.4%, and our market share increased to 12% compared to 11.5% last year.  In other international markets, Harley-Davidson retail sales in the Latin American region were up 4.6%. The Asia Pacific region was down 12.1%, largely driven by softness in Japan, and Canada was down 26.7%, lapping a relatively strong year-ago quarter. Overall, our international sales were down 3.6% for the quarter.
On Slide 9, you will see wholesale shipments to our dealers for the third quarter were down slightly compared to last year. Shipments in the quarter were at the low end of our expectations, and resulted in approximately 18,000 fewer new units in U.S. dealer retail inventory than one year ago.
We are tightening our expected range for full year shipments, and now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide. For the fourth quarter, we expect to ship between 41,000 and 46,000 motorcycles, which is 14% to 28% higher than last year's fourth quarter. 
Sportsters represented 20% of total shipments in the quarter. We expect fourth quarter's mix of Sportsters to be higher than last year's 12.9% mix in the fourth quarter, which was impacted by a shutdown of that production line last year. We continue to expect that Sportster, as a percent of total shipments, will be within the historical range of 18% to 22% for the full year.
Slide 10 provides a snapshot of the overall U.S. dealer network. As we have said, we are focused on the health and integrity of the Harley-Davidson dealer network. For the quarter, overall retail inventory was down. And more importantly, dealers have significantly fewer prior model year motorcycles at the time of model year changeover than they did last year. We started shipping the 2011 motorcycles in late July, and the new models including SuperLow, Road Glide Ultra and models featuring the new PowerPak have been well received. MSRP pricing on the 2011 models in aggregate is flat compared to last year both in the U.S. and on a global basis. 
In addition to improved inventory position, we believe U.S. dealers continue to sell our motorcycles at or near MSRP. While dealers' profitability has certainly been impacted, we believe the U.S. dealer network in aggregate remains profitable. Dealers continue to carefully manage their businesses and refine their operations as needed. We do expect and are encouraging some contraction of the network. 
On Slide 11, you will see revenue for the Motorcycles and Related Products segment for the third quarter was down nearly 2% compared to last year. During the quarter, average revenue for Harley-Davidson units sold increased $178 from the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
Turning to restructuring on Slide 12. We continue to be intensely focused on improving our cost structure and restructuring the business to be stronger and more profitable in the future. During the quarter, we incurred $67.5 million in restructuring expenses, largely driven by expenses associated with Wisconsin operations restructuring, which we announced last month. As you will see on the slide, we have refined costs and savings associated with our overall restructuring activities. Costs have been re-timed across 2010 to 2012, and we expect the total range was reduced by approximately $10 million. We continue to expect total ongoing annual savings of between $290 million and $310 million upon completion of restructuring activities, but have re-timed expected savings in 2010 through 2012.
On Slide 13, you will see gross margin in the quarter was 34.9%, 1.5 percentage points above the same quarter last year. This was driven by a richer mix of products and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing and raw material costs. Gross margin for the first nine months was 35.5%, which was up slightly compared to prior year and exceeds our full year guidance range of 32.5% to 34%. Our full year gross margin expectations have not changed and therefore, we expect gross margin to be lower in the fourth quarter as a result of our expectations to produce fewer units compared to the previous three quarters this year. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect Sportster mix to be higher than last year's fourth quarter, which was lower than the historical range.
On Slide 14, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 9.3% versus 11.8% in 2009. SG&A in the quarter was adversely impacted by the company's short-term incentive plan accruals compared to the prior year. This year, we have accrued in each quarter for a potential 2010 year-end STIP [Short-Term Incentive Plan] payout. If you recall during the first half of last year, we accrued for an expected 2009 year-end STIP payout. And in the third quarter, the potential for payout was eliminated when we significantly reduced our shipment guidance, which prevented us from meeting the established target goals. As a result, we reversed the first half accrual in the third quarter last year, which reduced SG&A. 
Additionally, while this year's third quarter SG&A increased compared to last year, as you look forward, keep in mind that we had onetime items in the fourth quarter of last year, which we don't expect to repeat in 2010, including a $19 million charge related to warranty and recall. 
Now moving on to the quarterly results for our Financial Services segment on Slide 15. In the quarter, HDFS posted a $50.9 million profit, an improvement of $82.4 million compared to last year. The key drivers of the third quarter 2010 improvement were: net interest income was favorable by $63.3 million compared to last year as a result of the increase in on-balance sheet receivables, and an improvement in the net interest spread as the cost of funds at HDFS has decreased, which includes the impact of the transfer of debt from HDFS to H-D Inc. in 2009.
Next, the provision for retail credit losses, which is associated with all on-balance sheet retail receivables, decreased by $23.3 million primarily due to a $28 million charge to increase reserves during last year's third quarter. This year-over-year change was partially offset by the need to re-provide for losses on the increased on-balance sheet receivables. Our credit risk assumptions in the retail portfolio did not change significantly from the prior quarter.
Next, the impact of the provision for wholesale receivables is favorable by $6.9 million compared to last year, due to an approximately $5 million net increase in reserves during last year's third quarter. In addition, there was a 24% reduction in the wholesale receivables balance compared to last year's third quarter. The unfavorable $11.9 million all other line primarily reflects the net effect of the fact that we no longer had securitization accounting. The items that existed last year were: income on retained securitization interest, servicer fees and the impact of impairment charges associated with retained securitization interest. 
We are pleased to see another positive quarter at HDFS. Larry will provide more details on HDFS's operation now. Larry?"

During the third quarter, HDFS originated $543.3 million in retail motorcycle loans, down 7.6% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. HDFS's retail market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 48% for the first nine months of 2010, down 1.1 percentage points compared to the same period last year.
Regarding competition, we continued to see increased activity, particularly in the prime-rated customer segment. At the end of the third quarter, of the approximately $6.2 billion of net finance receivables, $5.5 billion were retail and $0.7 billion were wholesale. 
We continue to see good credit performance on early stage delinquencies and defaults for loans originated after we made significant underwriting adjustments in January of 2009. For the first nine months of 2010, 80% to 85% of our new loan originations were prime compared to our historical experience of approximately 75% prior to these underwriting changes.
Now moving on to delinquency and losses on Slide 17, where you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 4.83%. Our increased collection staffing levels, modified collection strategies and changes in underwriting have enabled us to effectively reduce delinquency levels compared to last year, despite high unemployment in the U.S. As I mentioned during last quarter's call, historically, delinquencies and losses increased during the second half of the year, as we move out of riding season.
Annualized retail credit losses improved by 66 basis points to 2.04% for the first nine months in 2010, driven by lower frequency of loss, the impact of changes in underwriting and improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. We are pleased with the progress at HDFS during the third quarter, but we remain cautious given the continuing economic challenges with unemployment near 10% and the fact that we are moving out of riding season. Now let me turn it back to John."

We are pleased that HDFS is making progress towards their goal of providing credit, while delivering appropriate returns and profitability.  
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 18. You'll see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.55 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, HDFS had approximately $1.04 billion of available liquidity through bank, credit and conduit facilities. Our cash strategy continues to require maintaining a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 19. I would like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. First, with regards to operating cash from continuing operations, the company generated operating cash of $1.17 billion during the first nine months of 2010. The Motorcycle business continued to generate strong cash flow. Of the total, the Motorcycle business generated $523.7 million of operating cash. 
Through the first nine months of 2010, our effective income tax rate from the continuing operations was 34% compared to 47.7% for the same period last year. The year-to-date 2010 effective tax rate through the third quarter was favorably impacted by the settlement of an IRS audit and an increase of the tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing, offset by the tax impact of federal healthcare reform legislation. The 2009 effective tax rate for the same period was unfavorably impacted by a onetime tax charge related to Wisconsin tax law change and nondeductible goodwill charge.
On Slide 20, you'll find a summary of MV Agusta business, which is presented as discontinued operations. As most of you know, we completed the sale of MV Agusta. Through June 2010, losses on discontinued operations net of taxes totaled $103.5 million. During the third quarter of 2010, the loss from discontinued operations was $4.9 million net of taxes.
As we have been expecting, the global economies continue to struggle, and we'll continue to take a conservative approach as we manage the business. On Slide 21, you will see that on a full year basis, we have increased the low end of our expected shipment range. We now expect to ship between 207,000 and 212,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide, as we continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand. Through continuous improvement and careful management of capital expenditures, we now expect full year capital expenditures to be between $190 million and $210 million, which includes between $75 million and $90 million related to restructuring. Gross margin guidance for 2010 remains unchanged."

We completed the sale of MV Agusta to focus on Harley-Davidson brand and completed labor negotiations with our Wisconsin unions, which will improve flexibility and ongoing manufacturing cost structure when the contract is implemented in 2012. Carryover retail inventory was significantly reduced to make way for exciting 2011 model year product offerings. We also continued profitability at HDFS, and we continue to deliver on strong financial performance with increasing gross margin and good cash flow at the Motor Company.
Continued challenges in the economy and pressure on the retail customer reinforced our commitment to maintain cautious -- to remain cautious through the recovery. We'll continue to aggressively manage the supply of new motorcycles in line with demand in an effort to move for a more normal ratio of used to new bike sales, which we expect over time will improve used bike pricing. While progress will likely reflect the choppiness of the overall economic recovery, we believe we have made progress in this area for the strengthening of the brand. 
We are executing a solid plan designed to lower our breakeven point and regain operating margin at significantly lower volumes. Restructuring has already delivered significant results, and we have not compromised the capacity for future growth. In fact, our plan is to be more efficiently responding to future demand. We continue to invest in our future and have demonstrated that with the introduction of the new model year 2011 motorcycles and ongoing international market development and through our outreach marketing efforts. 
And as I've said before, I can't tell you definitely when retail growth will return, but I can assure you that we are managing the business prudently with a focus on our future. We are ready to expand our sales when the world economies improve, and we'll remain disciplined as we manage the company. And now, let's open the call up to your questions."

One of the obvious one is mix between families, and that would be Sportsters versus Touring or our Cruising motorcycles. It was always mix within -- also mix within families that affects pretty dramatically. And what we're seeing in the results in this quarter as well as the previous couple of quarters is some of the mix within family. For example, the Ultra Limited that we introduced a year ago in July is a $25,000 Ultra, and that is replacing a lot of the Ultras that we used to sell at a price around $20,000. So we're moving up within the product spectrum within families. In addition when you look at Sportster, you got the 48 model, which is a 1200, and that's bumping up against year-ago results of the 883, Iron 883, which is lower priced. So there's a lot of mix within family that's affecting our results. In addition for the quarter, when we look at the introduction of new products in model year 2011, we've added what we call the PowerPak. It's standard on three models including the Road King Classic, the Ultra and the Road Glide Ultra, and that again takes up the sales price. And that's provides a higher power of motor, a 103-cubic-inch motor along with standard ABS [anti-lock braking system] and a security system. So we expect that to continue as again, we lap our model year '10 motorcycle sales in the next year. And we've got other things that affect mix. And we've got mix of our related products, when you look at P&A, the difference between selling a replacement engine versus a nut cover, very big difference with the mix as well, same thing with General Merchandise and our licensed products."

As you look, James, over the three quarters previous including this quarter, we've been down anywhere from 18,000 to 22,000 units. In the fourth quarter, we're going to lap a quarter where we took out a tremendous amount of inventory a year ago, right as we shut down -- in particular Kansas City, we shut down most of the quarter. So as we look forward, inventories will grow and grow off a lower base than that base of 18,000 units lower as we head in the third quarter. And we're going to be lapping the number of fourth quarter where we took down a lot of inventory. So we'll be more in line. The change in the inventory will not be as great in the fourth quarter because a lot of that was taken out a year ago. And we feel very comfortable where we are with overall inventories, especially as we look it as we exit the fourth quarter versus a year ago, our inventories are one, much lower and in a position that we believe is adequate for the network to grow and to keep upward pressure on used bike prices. And then secondly, the mix of inventory is dramatically better this year than a year ago. Especially when you look at the carryover models, a year ago, we had the highest level by far of any carryovers, because of the 35% decline in U.S. retail sales in the second quarter. So we feel great about the number, the carryover, relationship of carryover models as well as the mix by family is in much better position than it was a year ago."

And I guess if we look at what you've done so far this year, your margins there are back similar to 2008 levels, even though your productions are a lot lower. And so I guess why would that not continue in the fourth quarter even with Sportster mix ramping back up to normal levels?

Anyway, as we look at year-to-date, margins were 35.5%, and that's up by 0.5 point versus a year ago. And we look at overall margin guidance which is 32.5% to 34%, we would certainly expect the fourth quarter margins to be down below that. There's four reasons really why we're looking at the margins to be lower. The first and the biggest impact is that we expect lower shipments in the fourth quarter versus the previous three quarters. So if we look at the first three quarters on average, we've averaged about 55,000 shipments per quarter, and now our expectations are 41,000 to 46,000 expected in the fourth quarter. And obviously, that will have a big impact on the margin structure because of the fixed cost that are absorbed by a much fewer units. And as we look at the fourth quarter last year, margins were at 20.3%. And the adjustment for the Buell, onetime, they're still pretty low at 26%. The second reason is the one that you had mentioned, Robin, is as far as our mix, it's expected to be higher versus last year, which was 12.9% of the mix. So we would expect a higher mix of Sportsters, which will affect profitability through the mix. Additionally, in the transformation that's going on in York, right now we are looking to outsource a lot of the non-core products, and that's happening in this quarter as well as on the next couple of quarters. And with that, as we outsource that product, we have some inefficiencies in trying to duplicate overhead, as we move those products out of that facility, shut down the facility and move it to suppliers. So that will provide some unfavorable variances in the fourth quarter. And then finally, we expect headwinds on currency and metals to continue."
