While",1692,"Thank you, Barry and thank all of you for joining us on today's call. This morning, we reported fourth quarter results that were well below our expectations for the business. For the quarter, we reported $0.31 in adjusted diluted earnings per share. While there were several reasons for our shortfall in the quarter, the single biggest challenge to the business was increased margin pressure across the Fresh Dairy Direct and Morningstar businesses exacerbated by an inflationary dairy complex.I'll give you more detail on the fourth quarter results in a moment, but first I'd like to put them in context for the full year 2009.2009 as a whole was a highly successful year for Dean Foods. Operating profits in total and for each of our business segments were the highest in our history. Full year operating income grew 10% in 2009 on top of the 7% growth we reported in 2008. Moreover, we built the necessary capability to transform our business and our initiatives to reduce cost took hold as we delivered over $75 million in cost savings in the first year of our $300 million cost reduction program. Finally, we strategically built our portfolio, adding Alpro to become the clear global soy leader, and Heartland and Foremost Farms to strengthen our core fluid milk franchise.Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.59, up 22% from 2008 and well ahead of the algorithm for low double-digit earnings per share growth that we discussed at our analyst meeting a year ago. Again, all in all, it was a strong year.As the year came to a close however, several of our businesses fell short of expectations. At Fresh Dairy Direct, retailer and competitive pressures that have been apparent through much of the year became more pronounced in the back half of Q4 and were exacerbated by sharply rising dairy commodities. Morningstar profits were challenged by volume softness, steep commodity inflation and a charge incurred to renegotiate a distributor contract. At WhiteWave, we significantly stepped up advertising and marketing to sport our brands and invest behind very strong performance from new innovation in our creamer business.The dairy processing industry is not immune from the economic downturn that continues to reverberate through the packaged food sector. You may have seen a recent Wall Street Journal article that highlighted the impact of deflation on food processors and retailers. Conventional milk is an important category for retailers. It enjoys nearly 90% household penetration. This ubiquity, combined with the category's frequency of purchase, make it a key traffic driver for grocery retailers.In 2009, raw dairy commodity prices fell to historic lows. As these lower costs were passed through into the marketplace, retailers lowered their margins on milk to hit key price points and to demonstrate strong value to consumers. In an effort to keep or win share in a challenging economy. As one large retailer comments to me recently, the fluid milk category in 2009 was ""hotly contested.""The magnitude of this margin compression is best demonstrated by looking at the average per gallon retail price of milk versus the per gallon Class I mover or raw cost of milk. The difference between those two prices is the money available to cover retailer and processor cost and to generate profit. This margin over milk has been steadily declining since the beginning of 2009.Initially this margin compression was largely absorbed by the retailers. As the year progressed however, and particularly in the fourth quarter, an increasingly consolidated and more powerful retail base began to seek and obtain price concessions from processors. We believe this has affected the entire industry and along with a continued shift from branded products to private labels, clearly impacted our results in the fourth quarter. This pressure underscores the importance of our strategy to differentially reduce cost versus our competitors. As a result, we remain singularly focused on our cost reduction efforts and committed to maintaining our leading position in volume during this period of margin compression.While walnut [ph] cost were at historically low levels for much of the year, in the fourth quarter, prices moved significantly higher rising from $10.93 in September to $13.99 in December. For the quarter, the Class I milk price averaged $13.07 per hundredweight, a 26% sequential increase from Q3. The mover stepped up again in January to $15.03 but eased a bit in February. This move up in price to more normalized levels should help the farm community recover some of the lost profitability they experienced during early 2009 and is healthier for the whole value chain in the long run.Going forward, we currently expect Class I prices to trade in a modest range up or down from the current level. Given our belief that the transition to higher milk prices was largely complete by January, we do not currently expect milk price volatility to be a significant driver of our performance in 2010.However, given the current commodities forecast in the new higher price level, we do expect shrink costs and lower returns from excess cream sales to create some modest additional headwinds for the Fresh Dairy Direct business in 2010 compared to 2009.The heightened competitive environment makes it clear that our strategy to drive differentiated customer value at Fresh Dairy Direct, from cost reductions and capability building, are critical to our success. The breadth and scope of our manufacturing and distribution systems gives us opportunities to reduce costs that are unique among the players in the industry. By driving to a differentiated cost and capability position, we were able to offer a strong value proposition, unmatched service and category leadership to our customers making us a valued partner.In 2009, we lowered our cost by over $75 million including $60 million within the Fresh Dairy Direct business. We entered 2010 with considerable momentum behind our cost reduction initiatives. Current market challenges and our commitment to shareholders demand our continued focus on these efforts and we have a line of sight to over $90 million in incremental cost savings in 2010.Turning to the balance of our business, WhiteWave-Morningstar had a very strong year with segment operating profit up 25% versus 2008. The businesses in the segment remain well-positioned, but Morningstar in particular faced challenges as we closed out the year. Let me address WhiteWave first.While category growth in soy and organic milk, like other premium categories, slowed in 2009, our Silk and Horizon brands both gained share and post improved operating performance in the fourth quarter. Our creamers business which has benefited from increased coffee consumption at home and the robust innovation pipeline posted a strong fourth quarter with solid share and sales growth. We chose to invest behind that momentum in Q4. We significantly stepped up marketing and advertising for International Delight and Land O'Lakes, and the launch of Silk PureAlmond. Our creamer lines have been a bright spot for us in 2009 and continue to carry strong momentum into the New Year. The net result of significantly stepped up marketing spend in Q4 at WhiteWave was a flat operating performance compared to Q4 '08. In the context of the full year, it's clear our investment over the last several years in WhiteWave bore fruit in 2009 with strong double-digit operating profit growth and over 200 basis points expansion in operating margin for the year.At Alpro, our European soy platform that we acquired midyear was a solid contributor in the quarter with mid-single-digit net sales growth and a solid operating profit performance in the quarter. The business has performed consistent with our expectations to date and we remain excited about our Alpro as a key part of our global sigh business.Morningstar also posted very strong full year results with solid double-digit operating profit growth. In the fourth quarter however, volume softness, deep commodity inflation and a charge incurred to renegotiated distributor contract led to a year-over-year decline in operating profits. Morningstar's fourth quarter results were down meaningfully on a year-over-year basis against a very difficult comparison, driven by rising butterfat costs compared to butterfat costs that plummeted in the prior-year period.Let me give you a bit more perspective on Morningstar. As you may know, Class II butterfat is an important input for our Morningstar business. Through the first three quarters of 2009, the Class II butterfat environment was fairly stable, which aided Morningstar's strong full year profit growth. In the fourth quarter however, butterfat prices rose considerably from $1.23 in September to $1.55 per pound in December, significantly challenging Morningstar's profitability as their pricing lagged this move in the commodity.The first quarter of 2010 is also likely to be challenging for Morningstar as butterfat costs have continued to rise in Q4. So let me summarize my remarks.On the whole, 2009 was a very successful year. Operating income grew 10% on top of 7% growth the year before. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 22% on top of 8% growth in 2008. While delivering these results, we've made significant progress against our important strategic initiatives. However, as we closed out the year, significant challenges emerged from retailer and competitive pressure and industry-wide margin compression. We're responding to this challenge by focusing on maintaining or growing our volumes and continuing to drive down costs, which we're uniquely positioned to do giving us a competitive advantage to win in this dynamic environment.From an earnings and share perspective, we are focused this year on holding the gains we've made while driving the transformation of our business. We faced a challenging market as we begin 2010 and in Q1, we comped against the highest operating profit quarter in the company's history. Nonetheless, with our aggressive drive to lower cost, and our strong industry position, we expect to resume earnings growth in the back half of the year with increasing momentum as the year progresses.For the full year, we're expecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.54 and $1.64, inclusive of the effects of the higher number of shares outstanding related to the equity offering we completed in the second quarter of 2009.With that, let me turn the call over to Jack for a more detailed review of our financial results and forward guidance.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the financial performance in the quarter and for the full year as well offer some detail on our forward outlooks and we plan to offer additional detail next Friday at Cagney.To close out 2009, I am both proud of the strong step forward in our full year results, as well as disappointed in our fourth quarter performance. Our full year performance in 2009 was very strong across the board. We delivered the best operating profit year in the company's history at $693 million, a full year growth rate of 10%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% to reach $1.59. Fresh Dairy Direct posted excellent volume growth and 9% profit growth. In a challenging year for premium-branded products in the food service business, WhiteWave-Morningstar delivered 25% growth in operating profits.We drove strong cash flow performance and added to our business portfolio through key acquisitions. In addition, we built capability to accelerate the increasing momentum behind the transformation of the business especially our cost savings initiative.However, these strong full-year results stand in contrast to a challenging fourth quarter. Given the very strong fourth quarter of 2008 and the growing pressures on the business we saw in Q2 and Q3, we had entered the fourth quarter expecting results to be below year-ago. However, the magnitude of the year-over-year decline in our results was greater than anticipated. As we've talked about in our previous earnings call, we had been dealing with a noticeable uptick in pressures on the business throughout 2009 as the recession increased consumer and retailer emphasis on value and lower overall, commodity costs were reflected in the marketplace. And these pressures on the business increased significantly later in the fourth quarter as commodity costs rose, impacting both reporting segments and driving our performance in the quarter below our expectations.Consolidated operating income in the quarter was $151 million down 21% from a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.31 that were $0.05 behind our ingoing guidance. We are not content with this performance but as Gregg pointed out, it underscores the importance of the cost reduction strategies we've been pursuing over the past year.Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of the reporting segments in more detail starting with Fresh Dairy Direct. We are focused in Fresh Dairy Direct on maintaining or growing our volume base as we weather this challenging environment. And indeed with the benefit of our recent acquisitions, Fresh Dairy Direct had a very strong quarter of volume growth with a 4.6% increase in fluid milk volumes versus the balance of the industry that we estimate was down nearly two points.On a full-year basis, our fluid milk volumes increased 2.7%. We ended the year with about 38% of the U.S. fluid milk category. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain or expand our share position in this period of significant margin pressure on the industry.Fresh Dairy Direct operating income increased 9% for the year but was down 12% in the fourth quarter due to a tough year-ago comparison and the increased margin pressures particularly in the back half of the quarter as our Private Label business continue to grow at the expense of the Branded business. Also impacting results in the quarter were increasing shrink related to rising dairy commodities and lower profits for excess cream sales.In the WhiteWave-Morningstar segment, fourth quarter net sales increased 8% to $762 million including sales from our Alpro acquisition that was completed in July. Our branded portfolios at WhiteWave and Alpro increased sales 19% to $501 million due to the benefits of the Alpro acquisition and strong sales growth in our creamers business at WhiteWave, offset by continued category softness in the U.S. soy and organic milk categories.Consistent with recent performance, we held or increased our share position across all of our key branded product lines in soy, organic milk and creamers. Looking more specifically at the sales performance of our key national brand, Horizon Organic milk increased its share in the quarter on flat sales as the organic milk category remained sluggish in response to a difficult economy. In our creamers business, International Delight again had a strong quarter sales growth with our Coffeehouse Inspirations line and seasonal flavors driving some strong net sales growth as well as solid share expansion in the quarter. Our branded creamers portfolio, which includes both International Delight and Land O'Lakes creamers, increased sales in the mid single digits on an adjusted basis.Silk soymilk also increased share in the category during the quarter through solid marketing support. Silk net sales were roughly flat when adjusted for the unprofitable food service contract we exited late last year. You may have recently seen a new Silk product in your local grocery store. Leveraging the strong brand equity of Silk, we've just launched Silk PureAlmond to respond to the growing demand for almond milk products. While it's still early in the product's launch, we are optimistic about the future of this flank or product line.Alpro, the second part of our global soy platform, increased sales mid-single digits over the previous year on a constant currency basis as they continue to lead European soy sales, expand our geographic reach and increase per capita consumption.Morningstar net sales declined 10% in the quarter to $259 million. The year-over-year decline at Morningstar is due primarily to the pass through of lower commodity costs but was also impacted by the low single-digit volume decline.The WhiteWave-Morningstar segment operating income in the quarter was down 12% from a year ago to $61 million due to the impact of the Hero JV and a profit decline at Morningstar. At Morningstar, volume softness, speed Class II butterfat commodity inflation and charge incurred to renegotiate a distributor contract, led to a year-over-year decline in operating profit versus a tough Q4 2008 overlap.Additionally, we made a change in the reporting of our Hero euro JV from Corporate to the WhiteWave-Morningstar segment. This change, retroactive to January 2009, better aligns the business reporting and operating structure of the joint venture. As a result of this change, WhiteWave-Morningstar operating income was $4 million lower in the quarter.At WhiteWave, we increased marketing spending to support innovation in the CoffeeHouse creamers business as well as for the launch of Silk PureAlmond. This strategy is consistent with our expectation for a renewed topline growth as we head into 2010. Within the quarter however, the increase in marketing support contributed to essentially flat year-over-year operating profit for WhiteWave.Alpro continues to perform in line with our expectations from a profit point of view and turned in another solid quarter. Now let me turn to several corporate items.Adjusted corporate costs to continue to be above year-ago levels and in line with the previous two quarters. In the fourth quarter, these costs totaled $57 million, the year-over-year increase is due in part to the capability build-out of our supply chain R&D and IT functions that will drive cost compression going forward. Additionally, legal expense, incentive compensation and pension expense also increased meaningfully.In 2010, corporate expense is expected to remain roughly at this level of quarterly spend with limited year-over-year growth other than Q1.On a consolidated basis, we are reporting $151 million of operating income for the fourth quarter, down 21% from last year's fourth quarter. With a benefit of lower average debt balances, interest expense in the quarter was $14 million below year ago levels resulting in adjusted diluted earnings of $0.31 per share on a fully diluted base of 183 million shares that is up 27 million shares due primarily to the equity offering in spring 2009.For the full year, consolidated operating income rose 10% to reach $693 million, the highest in our history. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% to reach $1.59. Our full year tax rate for 2009 was 38.2% compared to 38.3% in 2008.Consistent with the previous year, net cash from operations in 2009 was a very strong $659 million despite the fourth quarter step up in dairy commodities that directly impacts working capital. Capital expenditures for 2009 came in at $268 million. Looking ahead to next year, we anticipate capital spending up to $300 million but we will carefully manage the pace of that spend to support ongoing debt pay down.In addition, please note the Q4 cash investments include payment of $88 million to close our Heartland acquisitions. Overall, free cash flow from continuing operations for the full year 2009 was a very strong $391 million bringing our total free cash flow over the past two years to just above $850 million.Now I want to update you on the balance sheet. As of December 31, total outstanding debt to just under $4.2 billion. Our leveraged ratio of funded EBITDA, as defined by our credit agreement, stepped up a bit this quarter due to the impact of losing the very strong fourth quarter 2008 and our trailing 12-month EBITDA calculation and the funding of Heartland acquisition in the quarter. As of year end, our leveraged ratio stood at 4.16 times.Our leveraged ratio is likely to take a step up again next quarter as we lap the strong first quarter of 2009 but we remain committed to deleveraging the balance sheet and continue to be focused on our goal of reaching 3.5 times funded debt to EBITDA. For 2010, we expect to be below four times by year end and now anticipating approaching our goal of 3.5 times by midyear 2011.We also continue to enjoy very strong levels of liquidity. As of December 31, total unfunded and available revolver and accounts receivable securitization capacity stood at approximately $1.3 billion.As Gregg said, for the full year, we are expecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.54 and $1.64. Looking at how 2010 will likely play out from an EPS growth perspective, the first quarter presents a challenging overlap. The first quarter 2009 was the strongest overall performance in the company's history and benefited from a lower share count before the equity offering in the second quarter of 2009. With this in mind, and reflecting the current challenges we face, we are expecting first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.25 and $0.30.As we look at the balance of the year however, the overlaps in the commodity outlook become less daunting. And we expect to be back posting strong quarterly year-over-year growth by the back half of the year.So to summarize, plainly said, 2009 was a strong year for Dean with a difficult finish. The currently challenging marketing environment however, just adds to our resolve and urgency to move forward in strategies we have outlined. Our clear focus as an organization is on reducing cost to extend our advantage in the marketplace for the long-term. In 2010, we will leverage the strong momentum we have behind our cost reduction initiative while limiting incremental investments. We are confident in our strategic direction and expect to emerge from the current market with a strengthened competitive position.With that, I'll conclude my comments by again congratulating our teams on a successful year while acknowledging that the fourth quarter is an indication of how far we have yet to go on our journey as a company and accepting it as a challenge to accelerate the pace of change in our transformation initiatives. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I hope to see many of you at Cagney next week. I'd now like to ask the operator to open up the call for your questions. Operator?"

We started the quarter relatively strong but December was an extremely difficult one. Part of that I think has to do with the sharp move up in butterfat costs at Morningstar, a meaningful part of it. Morningstar prices its product by and large, or a large part of its product, prior to the announcement of the class price for the following months. So we had prices at Morningstar that did not anticipate the sharp rise in December butterfat costs in the market as December opened up and there's just no way to recover that during the month of December. So we had a difficult month in December in the Morningstar business. We also had a difficult month in Dairy. And there, I would say that we both have a deterioration of the mix between private label and brands in December, which hurt our margins. We had more competitive pushback with respect to taking price in the rising price environment so we had some price concessions in the month of December. And frankly, in the month of December, on the Fresh Dairy Direct side, I'm just not sure we executed as well as we normally do on a rising price environment. So really within the quarter, it's also a tale of different months, a strong start to the quarter and a very poor finish to Q4."

Shouldn't there be some catch up? I know that butterfat prices have continued to rise. You mentioned the continued difficult first quarter. When should we start to see some catch up and some ability to pass through those higher butterfat costs and what's preventing it? And the second question is, in terms of the continued impact of high butterfat prices on the FDD business, the fluid dairy direct (sic) [Fresh Dairy Direct] business, we're not back to the situation like 2007 where you saw an inversion of the price of skim and fat. So going forward, how is the higher butterfat price impacting your profitability in the traditional Fluid Milk business?"

And the butterfat price is stabilizing, it's at a higher level. It looks like coming out of January and into the back half of Q1. So we expect Morningstar's catch up in margins to happen during Q1. Now that's different from recapturing the margin shrink that we experienced from November to December. Now that's a phenomenon that occurs when the butterfat price drops meaningfully and of course, you saw that in last year's fourth quarter or in 2008's fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2009 when Morningstar's profitability and margins blew out because they underestimated the drop in butterfat cost in terms of the forecast. So I think we'll be back to a more normalized pricing and margin environment as butterfat stabilizes here in the back half of Q1. When that moves down and we in fact, recapture the lost profitability is something that I don't have a good crystal ball on it at this point in time. With respect to the impact of higher butterfat prices on Fresh Dairy Direct and higher milk prices in general, clearly, there is no evidence that we're moving back to this inverted situation in 2007. However, in 2009, we had about as favorable a spread between the cost of skim and the cost of fat as we have experienced in industry history at least in recent history. So as milk prices have moved up, skim price has moved up. And the spread between fat and skim has narrowed somewhat, which, as I said, in my prepared remarks leads to a slight narrowing of the profitability from excess cream sales. Nothing inverted but a slight narrowing. And of course, as we lose physical product in the manufacturing process, or experience what they call shrink, we're now losing at a higher value than we did last year because the Class I mover's at $15 instead of $10. So again that is a modest slight headwind in 2010, not a significant headwind like we saw in 2007 and 2008."

The general comment around price pass-through is something that I wanted to just spend a brief moment on. We continued to pass the price to rising commodity costs through to our customers. The margin compression comes from discrete, one-off price negotiations that are uncorrelated to the rising environment. So, customers are aggressively shopping for more attractive prices on their private labels and liquid milk. There's excess capacity in this industry. They are bidding processors against one another and that's leading to discrete incidences of margin compression. So, if not a circumstance of any customers saying the milk price went up $0.10 a gallon this quarter, I'm not taking it. It's more a matter of a long-term renegotiation around the extent of the existing operating margin in the business. And that is being driven, I think, by the dynamic represented on one of the slides that we put up. The amount by which retailers themselves have compressed their margins on milk and now they're coming back to the processing industry trying to extract some participation in that margin compression as they pick to represent value to their customers. So, that's the overall dynamic, not one of some sort of breakdown of the basic industry course of dealing around passing through monthly prices changes. So, I'll turn it over to Jack for the pricing."

So, while many of our competitors are private, some of them published financial results and of course, to our M&A activities we have the opportunity to see the financial results of many of our other competitors. And based on what we see from published financial results of some our largest private competitors and from the companies that we have acquired over time, is that, first, we have a consistent and significant cost advantage vis-à-vis the company set that we have acquired and the companies whose operations that we can see. That is manifested in a profitability differential between ourselves and what I would call our largest and most capable competitors that we can see several hundred basis points. So we are confident in the quality of our cost position in this industry. As we've gone through 2009 and this greatly expanded margins driven by dropping commodities in Q4 '08 and Q1 '09 have played out in the market place, and this competitive intensity is risen, we've also demonstrated, I think time and again in our bidding activity with respect to a competitively good business. That we're very well-positioned. And you'll see that in the steady growth of our market share and volumes over the course of 2009. So, while there is an erosion of margin in the marketplace, the people that we compete against, whether they're private or not have to maintain some ongoing level of profitability and our cost differentiation has lead us to be successful in growing our market share during this period of time. So, it is a period of time of pressure from the customer environment with respect to our margins, but we are growing our share during this period of time. We're steadily driving down our cost and frankly, we think this leads to an improvement on our competitive position and share position as we come out of this."

There's not one simple answer to your question. What I would say is the larger competitors that we have, the published financial statements, you see a significant down shift in their operating profit margins over the 2007 to 2009 time period. They have not gone into negative operating profit territory except perhaps during certain short periods during that time horizon. However, when you get into the universe of smaller less well-positioned operators, including some of the ones that we've acquired or some of the ones that have gone out of business that we picked up their share, they clearly have moved into negative operating profit territory, at least for a more extended period of time. And yes, you see them actively seeking to exit the business. Now they don't tend to fold up and just go out of business, although that has happened on occasion. They seek to sell and realize whatever they can for their operations. Foremost Farms in Wisconsin will be a good example of that. Right-owned by a large coop.

When you see this margin over milk move from $2 to $1.56, within that $1.56, $0.6 IRI average, you have large retailers from time to time selling milk at zero or negative retail margins.

Well, on our branded products, we're clearly -- -- when the GAAP blows up to the retailer using his private label to drive foot traffic in the store and selling it at zero or negative margins, the GAAP between that retail private label and our brands blows out.

So I'm not going to swim against the tide and try and make the argument that commodity movements aren't important here. Here's what I would say, is that, in February of 2009, at our Investor Day, we were coming off a year in which we had delivered $1.30 per share of earnings on a significantly lower share count than we have today, and then we ultimately experience in 2009. In 2009, we drove profit growth in excess of 20% against that higher share count. And we're basically guiding flat in 2010. Had milk not fallen from $20 to under $10 and stayed there for most of 2010, I think the earnings progression you would have seen would have looked more like $1.30, $1.40, $1.43 and maybe $1.58 or $1.60 which is the algorithm that you described. So that pegs the question of what one ought to expect in terms of the ongoing volatility of the underlying commodity. So this last commodity cycle I think has to be viewed in the context of 2006 or 2009. So in 2006 we had a dairy commodity that was sort of an $11, $12 Class I mover average. In 2007, we all experienced across every business and every aspect of our lives, stunning commodity volatility. So milk effectively doubled off of that price in 2007. Gasoline, diesel fuel tripled. We went into the bubble of 2007 and early 2008. The bubble exploded in late 2008 we had a commodity crash. And we've lived with that low price through much of 2009. Everybody knew it wasn't sustainable because farmers were losing money at a marginal cost level. But we had to work excess supply of the marketplace. And so coming in 2010, we actually have a milk price forecast that has more normal historical levels of volatility in it. We see movement around this $15 level of going to have $2 up-and-down either direction, that is modest typical seasonal volatility in the milk commodity. But I think the world is an unpredictable enough place and I cannot guarantee that's actually how it plays out. If that is the way that it plays out, you'll see us revert to the kind of profit growth algorithm that we described in early 2009. Because our underlying business on the brand side is being driven by steady modest volume and price dynamics and a very effective and stable cost structure and our milk business is being driven by a multiyear relatively foreseeable reduction in our underlying cost structure that we continue to believe is advantage versus what our competitive set can accomplish. So while we're living through some margin compression here, over time, we are going to separate ourselves from the rest of the processing industry, the excess capacity that has dragged margins around in the back half of 2009 will begin to diminish over time as the weaker of those players can't keep pace with what's happening in the industry in terms of processing capability. And I think we can ultimately find our way and an algorithm that is as predictable as we and you would like us to have. So, I guess to summarize that long response to your question, I hope that the bullwhip that started in 2007 has sort of played out finally at the end of 2009, and that we move back to a more stable algorithm. Underlying everything that's happening in the gross margin environment of our business, we're steadily driving down costs. And we are largely finished with the capability building that we needed to do in order to make that come to life."

Remember, it's the midyear pickup of Alpro that is probably the primary driver of the increase on the operating expense lines, both selling and distribution and G&A. So I think you really need to kind of parse that all through. The one slice where we have had some G&A growth has been in the corporate expense area, which we talked about today. That was largely to support IT supply-chain and R&D and we also had some impacts at legal expense, et cetera. And we kind of see that really behind us other than maybe one more quarter in Q1 and that growth should be, should taper of. If you look at G&A across the business units, you'll see actually pretty good performance in terms of an operating expense point of view across FDD, WhiteWave and Morningstar.

So, at least we don't foresee them as being there in 2010. So what was driving prices higher over that period, you will recall were first supply shortfalls in OCNA, which is the largest export market. We don't expect those to recur. Certainly not at the levels that have -- that existed in 2007 and 2008, a rapidly declining U.S. dollar which made U.S. stocks significantly more attractive from a global perspective. Creeping but unrecognized declining global stocks through 2006 and early 2007 that sort of took the market by surprise when global stocks were largely exhausted. In mid-2007, we have an environment today where we have significant U.S. and global stocks of dairy commodities. We have an industry in China that is significantly larger in terms of production than it was in the 2006-2007 time horizon. So they have moved to onshore significantly more of their own production. And while you still have Asia-Pacific this relatively strong, the rest of the world is relatively weak in terms of its ability to consume dairy products. So,  we actually see a moderate demand environment and a supply environment that is frankly still adjusting to oversupply. So there are a few other technical factors around the U.S. marketplace that I think will put a damper on supply. The biggest one that I would mention is that technology does work even in these kinds of industries. So there's a phenomenon that's now just really taking hold in the U.S. dairy industry that revolves around how dairy cows are inseminated. You have to cause[ph] a dairy cow to have a calf in order to continue to lactate. So, they're inseminating dairy cows artificially to do that and it used to be, you get one calf, you'd get one heifer, it was sort of a 50-50 sex distribution. Now the producers of artificial insemination products have figured out how to only produce heifers so they have sex semen. Now every cow that's born, or virtually every cow that's born is a potential replacement heifer, as opposed to have them being beef than half of them going into the milking lines. So you just have this debt function change in the level of pressure on new supply in the U.S. industry, which frankly is one of the reasons it was so difficult to work off the excess supply in 2009. And one of the reasons why, we think you're going to continue to see pressure on the supply side in 2010. It's changed the economics for a dairy farmer of maintaining and growing their supply. So at least through 2010, we don't see the forces in play that are going to lead to the kind of price volatility that we saw in 2007 and 2008. Again, I'm not going to bet on my crystal ball in the world of commodity volatility, but certainly the factors that drove things the last time are not in place today."

Before we begin, I would like to bring your attention to the change we made in our segment reporting to reflect the evolution of our long-term strategy. Our two operating segments are now Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar and WhiteWave-Alpro. The is a clear divergence between the strategies and objectives of these two business segments. Our branded businesses at WhiteWave-Alpro, which now have more scale and importance in the portfolio with last year's acquisition of Alpro, will succeed by driving growth through effective marketing and innovation. That is our focus and strategy. 
Our traditional dairy businesses at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar are the less branded and less differentiated. Their success will be driven by cost and service leadership, which is our strategic focus in these businesses. This segment shift allows us to focus and deepen our ongoing integration efforts in the supply chain and commercial aspects of the business. We believe these revised segments will increase the internal focus and better align our financial reporting with how we manage the business to the benefit of both management and investors. There is additional historical segment financial information reflecting the recast of this alignment in today's press release. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gregg for his opening remarks. Gregg?"

Despite a stro",1373,"Thank you, Barry, and thank all of you for joining us on today's call. As you know, we entered 2010 facing substantial margin pressure in our Milk business, as retailers compressed private label margins to attract value-conscious consumers. Despite a strong performance at WhiteWave-Alpro, these very low private label retails drained the profit pool of our regional brands and led the consolidated results that were below our expectations. Consolidated operating income of $123 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 were both down considerably from the very strong results of year ago.
Looking more closely at the drivers of this performance within the businesses, at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, the industry pressures we discussed with you last quarter in the CAGNY continue to impact results. For the quarter, gross profit at FDD-Morningstar declined 11% or $68 million to $573 million. Within this segment, the performance of our Fluid Milk business remains our biggest issue and drove about 2/3 of the gross profit decline at FDD-Morningstar. Of the gross margin decline in Milk, the bulk of the decline resulted from lower volumes in our regional brands, as consumers continue to trade down the private label. The remainder was the result of continued direct pressure on private label pricing.
The balance of the gross margin decline at FDD-Morningstar was the result of volume softness in several of our ancillary product categories, including juice, juice drinks, cultured products and ice cream, as well as channel softness in the food service arena. Our pricing of cultured and creamer products also lagged the rapid rise in Class II dairy commodities during the quarter, further impacting segment profitability.
Looking more closely at Milk, pressure on regional brands remains intense as retailers continue to offer private label gallons at margins well below historical norms. The reduction in private label margins has widened the price gap at retail between the regional brands and private label to the point we're trading down, and thus, private label share gains have accelerated. Not surprisingly, our most profitable brands with the largest price premiums have suffered the most. 
While total volumes have been largely unaffected, this mix shift from brands into private label is eroding our gross margin. Our ability to directly impact this erosion in the short term is limited, as neither of our choices is attractive. We can reduce the price gap by lowering our branded pricing, thereby reducing our branded margins, where we can hold price and continue to lose branded share into private label.
We also continue to be impacted by direct pricing pressure from retailers. Retailers have invested heavily in the category to pursue their low-priced strategies. In many cases, private label milk is being priced by retailers at or below their cost. As a result, retailers seek to mitigate the impact on their P&Ls through price concession from processors. This price compression is further pressuring our results. 
This hyper-competitive retail activity began in early 2009 as raw milk prices hit historic lows and unemployment peaked. I continue to believe that the retail industry will at some point return to more normal private label milk margins, as continued discounting no longer moves foot traffic and retailers seek to restore their profit pool. However, it is not clear when that will happen, leaving us cautious about segment results for the balance of the year. 
As I said, these issues generally have minimal effect on overall sales volumes. And with the benefit of our acquisitions, we continue to post solid, fluid milk volume and share growth in the period. Fluid milk volumes increased 3% compared to the balance of the industry that we believe was down approximately 2%.
We continue to see positive impact on cost from our efforts in conversion and distribution. But given the gross margin pressures on the business, it's clear that we must accelerate our cost reduction efforts. Gross margin compression, combined with higher fuel and freight cost, drove a 41% decline in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar operating margin against a tough year-ago comparison to $127 million. 
Looking ahead, our inability to predict the end of the retailer price wars makes it difficult to forecast how the balance of the year will play out. However, if current price and mix pressures continue, the reduction in margins could impact segment operating profit by up to $100 million over the balance of the year. In the meantime, to begin to combat this margin pressure, we're actively looking for areas in our portfolio where we can increase prices. Perhaps more importantly, we're significantly accelerating our cost reduction efforts, as we strive to drive down the cost curve and position ourself to win in an industry increasingly focused on price and value.
With a sharpened focus on portfolio revenue management and the benefits of our ongoing cost initiative, we did see some improvement in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar results as the first quarter progressed. However, at the end of the day, current industry pressures have created a significant pricing problem in our business. Price gaps are at levels that our brands cannot support and accelerated trade-down continues. Our industry remains highly competitive, and our ability to impact this problem directly to pricing on gallons of milk is limited.
The cost reduction strategy we have been pursuing is our single most important area of focus. We have discussed goals of $90 million in cost savings in 2010 and $300 million over three to five years. It is now clear that we have to be much more aggressive in both the timing and the magnitude of our efforts. Going forward, these efforts will include an increase in the scale of the initiatives we currently have underway, as well as an increase in the scope of these efforts across the business. We are developing plans to accelerate productivity across our entire cost structure, including production, distribution, sales, administration and corporate expenditures. 
In that vein, we announced a new cost reduction and restructuring initiative this morning in the FDD-Morningstar business that will eliminate 350 to 400 positions on top of the approximately 100 positions we have already eliminated in 2010. We expect this additional action to result in annualized savings of approximately $25 million.
At WhiteWave-Alpro, the story is quite different. The strong performance that drove double-digit profit growth in 2009 continued into the first quarter of this year and accelerated, as volume-driven top line growth returned across all key brands. First quarter net sales increased 35% to $485 million. Approximately 26% of the sales growth is attributable to our Alpro acquisition, with about nine points of growth attributable to WhiteWave. Importantly, all of our key brands reported solid net sales growth in the quarter, and volume grew slightly ahead of sales.
Consumers appear to be cautiously returning to value-added brands, and we are benefiting from this trend. In addition to these secular trends, we are driving our brands with strong innovation in marketing, particularly in the dairy, milk alternative and creamer categories. Our Branded Creamer business continued to be a standout in the portfolio, with International Delight growing more than 25% and a Land O'Lakes creamers up high single digits. This growth is on the back of solid innovation and world-class marketing. International Delight creamers grew their share in the category by three full points in the quarter.
The organic milk category also return to growth in the first quarter. Horizon Organic outperformed the category and grew mid single digits in both volume and net sales in the quarter. Our Silk brand demonstrated strong growth in the quarter, with mid-single-digit net sales growth on the back of a very strong launch of our Silk PureAlmond line of almond beverages. Alpro continues to perform well with high single-digit volume and net sales growth across the business. 
Our strong brand performance plus the Alpro acquisition drove 54% growth in segment operating income to $44 million. Operating income at WhiteWave, excluding Alpro, grew 34%. Our value-added branded business frankly is running on all cylinders. Looking ahead, we expect this top and bottom line growth to continue with the expectations for strong double-digit full year operating income growth in our WhiteWave-Alpro segment. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack for a more detailed review of the financial results. Jack?"
34883,102234733,60563,"Dean Foods Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 10, 2010",2010-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Dean Foods Company","Executives","Thanks, Gregg.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items before turning the call back to Gregg for some closing remarks and opening the lines up for your questions.
Our first quarter performance eliminates the differences between the two segments with accelerated net sales and profit growth at WhiteWave-Alpro, offset by continued significant challenges at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Corporate expense of $48 million remained above year-ago levels but was down a bit from the run rate of the previous three quarters. For the balance of the year, we do not expect any meaningful year-over-year growth in corporate expense, as our period of stepped-up investment is over, and we are working to reduce this expense over time as an element of our cost reduction program. In total, first quarter consolidated operating income was 40% below year-ago results at $123 million. 
Within the consolidated results, total company gross profit declined $8 million. A $68 million decline in gross profit at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar was largely offset by strong gross profit growth at WhiteWave-Alpro. Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased $74 million over the year-ago period. 
I'd like to provide some clarity into the drivers of these expenses in the quarter. Of the $74 million of operating expense growth, approximately 60% is directly related to the acquisition of Alpro Foremost and Heartland, which were completed in 2009. Other meaningful contributions to operating expense growth include higher fuel-related costs at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar and increased marketing expense at WhiteWave-Alpro to support continued momentum behind our value-added branded portfolio. 
Below the line, interest expense declined $10 million from the year-ago period as the result of lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. Our tax rate in the quarter was just under 35%, down from 39% a year ago, aided by our international tax rate and an increase in the U.S. domestic manufacturing deduction, as well as the one-time effect of finalizing certain tax audits in the quarter. We expect our full year tax rate to be 37% to 38%. Net income of $42 million drove first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.23 well below year-ago results, as we lapped the best quarter in our history and a lower share count. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $71 million, subtracting net capital expenditures of $43 million from this yield of free cash flow of $28 million. For the full year, we anticipate capital spending of $250 million to $300 million, but we would point investors to the low end of this range as we prudently manage the pace of that spending to support ongoing debt paydowns. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total outstanding net debt at quarter end stood at $4.16 billion, down $27 million from last quarter. As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt-to-EBITDA, as defined by our credit agreement, stepped up a bit this quarter due to the impact of losing the very strong first quarter of 2009 and our trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.43x versus the current covenant of 5x and a year-end covenant step-down to 4.5x. To further support our debt paydown efforts, we continue to aggressively manage net operating working capital. On a year-over-year basis, net operating working capital was essentially flat despite a 23% increase in the Class I Mover, which allowed for a continued debt reduction in the quarter.
Given the continuing challenges in the business, we are not on pace against our previously stated goal of deleveraging the balance sheet to approximately 3.5x funded debt-to-EBITDA by mid-2011. In addition, over the medium term, we must ensure adequate operating flexibility against the final covenant step-down to 4.5x at the end of the year. Therefore, we continue to closely monitor the capital market and may choose to address our refinancing needs sooner than we previously anticipated. Both the bank and high-yield financing markets have significantly improved over the past year, affording us multiple debt financing options to consider.

Before we open up the call for questions, let me give you some perspective on our forward outlook. At WhiteWave-Alpro, we're on a solid path of volume sales and profit growth that we expect to continue through 2010. Our branded business is very strong with significant momentum. We expect to drive volume-led top line growth through effective marketing and innovation and to leverage this growth into another year of strong operating income growth. 
At Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, the road ahead appears rocky, with the retail price environment that appears unsustainable but is not yet abated. That makes it difficult to provide accurate guidance beyond the immediate quarter. The current pressures on FDD-Morningstar had a significant impact on Q1 results and could impact the balance of year operating covenants by up to $100 million if retailers continue to pursue a strategy of aggressive price promotion on private label milk. Additionally, dairy commodity prices are now expected to trend higher through the balance of the year, which could further pressure results.
Concerns about rising non-fat dry milk and butter prices have several economists predicting a rise in the Class I milk price of $3 to $4 per hundredweight over the balance of the year. The uncertainty in these forecast adds to our caution as we look out over the balance of the year. 
For the time being, we're going to provide specific guidance only for the next quarter where our visibility is better. In this case, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be $0.23 to $0.28, essentially in line with Q1 results. While we hope to see a more positive environment in the back half of the year, the uncertainty surrounding whether or when that will occur leads us to suspend our full year guidance for the present time. 
I've now been in the dairy industry for nearly two decades. And while we faced our share of challenges over that time, today's challenges represent a unique moment in our industry. Processors were under pressure in ways that we have not experienced before. Periods of industry difficulty typically separate the strong from the weak. The longer these challenges persist, the more difficult it becomes for cost-disadvantaged competitors to survive. Pressures like we're expressing today should accelerate industry consolidation among the lowest and most sufficient and capable processors. We're a cost leader in the industry today and are committed to extending our lead going forward.
Our size and scale afford us opportunities to meaningfully extend our cost leadership position, and we are aggressively attacking those opportunities. The urgency, momentum and confidence we have in our ability to reduce cost have all increased. While it's too early to comment specifically on our plans to expand the scale and scope of our cost reduction efforts beyond what we've announced today, we expect meaningful progress in the quarters to come, as we work to combat these market pressures and build a sustainably differentiated position in our industry. 
We believe that taking more aggressive action now will enable us to emerge from the current market challenges in a stronger position versus our competitors and will fuel our long-term success. The winner in the traditional dairy category will be the low-cost producer and Dean will be that company. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today and ask the operator to open the call for your questions. Operator?"

But clearly things have deterioration from that, from where we were a couple of months ago. I'm just wondering if you could give me a little bit more clarity on exactly what changed since then? It also seems that as we go into the next quarter, you've got less of a step-up in SG&A spending, Alpro is obviously coming through. WhiteWave is coming through better than it is, and it has been of late. And so it seems as though that the Fluid Milk business is actually getting worse rather than better.

So you have industry leaders on the retail side who are pricing private labels as aggressively or more aggressively as they have throughout the back part of Q4 and into the beginning part of Q1. And while we had hoped to see those private retails begin to lift, we're in fact seeing the opposite. And so the mix out from brands to private labels is gaining steam. So the basic math on that is on average, if you look across our portfolio, we have about a $0.51 per gallon contribution margin difference between brand and private label. And that profit pool is eroding pretty rapidly."

So those parts of the country has simply blown out to double or more the price spread between private label and gallons, and that is punishing gallon volume or branded volume in those marketplaces. So we have marketplaces in the Southeast, for example, where our branded half gallons are more expensive than private label gallons. And we're just seeing in those environments rapid mix shift out of brands into private labels. So that's really driving it. As we said in the script in the prepared remarks, our performance improved during the quarter. We had a very soft start to January. We improved through March.

Our competitor, the rest of the industry is down in volume by 2% where we're flat on an x acquisition basis, rough number. And we see price realization in the category down four or five points, right? So very serious deleverage of our competitive set.

T",367,"Well, I think the first part of your question is an important question, and I would be making up a guess about what consumers will do if this trend reverses or when this trend reverses, because the retail industry has given up a ton of profit pool here. They will ultimately back away from this strategy as it stops moving share around, right? They're doing this to move share around and when that stops, then they'll go to restore the profit pool. So when that happens, some of the pressure will come off of our brands, and we will still have some brands in these marketplaces that have a premium over private label, right? This category is not going all private label. These brands have been around a long time and they have loyal consumers. On the other hand, I do think that where we had very high brand premiums, they will be permanently reduced. So I believe that our brand profit pool going forward will not return to its levels of 2008 and 2009, it will be some diminished level. And we'll know what that looks like after the retail profit pool gets restored, the private label retail profit pool. With respect to your last question, we had experienced and had talked about through 2009, 2008, as our brand premiums blew out against private labels, that we need to get our brands back in value and lower brand premiums in certain marketplaces, and we undertook to do that. And frankly, we were having good success with that in terms of holding and beginning to rebuild brand volume. But that was in a world in which retailers were taking 30 margins on private label and 30 to 35 margins on brand. In an environment where retailers are taking zero margins or 5% margins on private label, you just can't get your brands in value, as I discussed earlier to Alexia's question or Terry's question, without just tanking your P&L. The first half year has got to be retailers restoring some profit pool on private label milk. Until that happens, I think it's just going to be impossible to get a beat on where your brands are going."

But by our measure, that got worse sequentially in January, but it improved in February and March. And I understand it seems to be more about just private label versus branded milk, but in that -- I guess I'm getting at is as input costs go higher, should we assume that you're passing that along, especially on the private label milk? Is that getting passed along at all, or is that gap that we see at least narrow or getting better, is it really not getting better, is it the alternate channels that are working against that?"

That happens still with just perfect, almost perfect regularity. So milk goes up dime a gallon, our prices go up a dime a gallon. But we are experiencing mix shift, so that erodes our, if you will, our net margin over milk, not that our customers aren't taking the price increases, but we're mixing out of the consumer level from branded to private label. And then there is this competitive bidding phenomenon. So we're passing along $0.10 a gallon, but are retailers coming back to you and saying, well, yes, but I want you to take $0.01 out of the net margin that you make on a go-forward basis. So there's competitive bidding. There's pass-through, which has to work and does work in the industry and then there's mix shift. And that's the  net of what's driving our gross margin decline in the FDD business. As to whether the spread is getting better, we said at CAGNY, in the middle of February, that we saw retailers trying to take the price up, and we do see that. We see retailers trying to take the price up and particularly, in conjunction with months where the Class I Mover goes up, we're seeing people trying to pass that along plus a little bit more in their private label retail. But we didn't see people coming back in and driving it back down. So it's not holding yet in terms of this margin over milk going forward. So we've refined -- you'll notice our chart, we refined a little bit. We're now looking at private label margin over milk because that's really what's driving the category, as opposed to the branded margin over milk. And that's, I think, for us, that's the key indicator today, what are the private label guys doing in terms of margin over milk."

The most important one being that what retailers are trying to do is build their private labels as opposed to build store traffic. We are in deep and continual conversation with our retailers around this issue and this strategy. And I'm confident in saying that what a given retailer is trying to do with their private label here is not build their retailer brand. What they're trying to do is they're trying to move a shopper from chain X to their chain by being more deeply discounted on milk, and they're doing that through their private label. I think, look, these retailers are all very, very good at math. And they understand that they make more money on a gallon of branded milk because of both the higher price point and the higher margin that they take than they do on a gallon of private label. And that there is a role for brand in this category and that, that role is not going to go away as we come out of this deep period of discounting. But the math that we don't benefit from in the private label price compression math is that the shopper that comes in to buy a gallon of milk at $1.77 buys a bunch of other stuff on which they have much higher margins. So right now, the calculus is that if I can move shoppers to my store and put traffic, it pays out this milk price compression. Again, I'd make the point I made earlier, that math works only so long as you are advantaged as a retailer in this private label category versus other retailers, and I'm moving traffic around between my competitors and myself. We've got to a point where most of the industry's down here at these cheap price levels. And as retailers stop seeing store count, foot traffic change as a result of the things they're doing to promote, they will seek to restore what's a very big margin get back in this category. So this is not about building private label brands, this is about driving foot traffic and share at the retail level"

And so the incoming price offer from delevered competitors with excess capacity is you just hear more and more of that, right? So that's putting a bit of a lid on our ability to go to take price when the buyer's getting regular calls with people at least, suggesting that they're willing to lower it."

Before we begin, I would like to bring your attention to the change we made in our segment reporting to reflect the evolution of our long-term strategy. Our two operating segments are now Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar and WhiteWave-Alpro. The is a clear divergence between the strategies and objectives of these two business segments. Our branded businesses at WhiteWave-Alpro, which now have more scale and importance in the portfolio with last year's acquisition of Alpro, will succeed by driving growth through effective marketing and innovation. That is our focus and strategy. 
Our traditional dairy businesses at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar are the less branded and less differentiated. Their success will be driven by cost and service leadership, which is our strategic focus in these businesses. This segment shift allows us to focus and deepen our ongoing integration efforts in the supply chain and commercial aspects of the business. We believe these revised segments will increase the internal focus and better align our financial reporting with how we manage the business to the benefit of both management and investors. There is additional historical segment financial information reflecting the recast of this alignment in today's press release. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gregg for his opening remarks. Gregg?"
34883,102234733,63974,"Dean Foods Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 10, 2010",2010-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Dean Foods Company","Executives","Thank you, Barry, and thank all of you for joining us on today's call. As you know, we entered 2010 facing substantial margin pressure in our Milk business, as retailers compressed private label margins to attract value-conscious consumers. Despite a stro",1372,"Thank you, Barry, and thank all of you for joining us on today's call. As you know, we entered 2010 facing substantial margin pressure in our Milk business, as retailers compressed private label margins to attract value-conscious consumers. Despite a strong performance at WhiteWave-Alpro, these very low private label retails drained the profit pool of our regional brands and led the consolidated results that were below our expectations. Consolidated operating income of $123 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 were both down considerably from the very strong results of year ago.
Looking more closely at the drivers of this performance within the businesses, at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, the industry pressures we discussed with you last quarter in the CAGNY continue to impact results. For the quarter, gross profit at FDD-Morningstar declined 11% or $68 million to $573 million. Within this segment, the performance of our Fluid Milk business remains our biggest issue and drove about 2/3 of the gross profit decline at FDD-Morningstar. Of the gross margin decline in Milk, the bulk of the decline resulted from lower volumes in our regional brands, as consumers continue to trade down the private label. The remainder was the result of continued direct pressure on private label pricing.
The balance of the gross margin decline at FDD-Morningstar was the result of volume softness in several of our ancillary product categories, including juice, juice drinks, cultured products and ice cream, as well as channel softness in the food service arena. Our pricing of cultured and creamer products also lagged the rapid rise in Class II dairy commodities during the quarter, further impacting segment profitability.
Looking more closely at Milk, pressure on regional brands remains intense as retailers continue to offer private label gallons at margins well below historical norms. The reduction in private label margins has widened the price gap at retail between the regional brands and private label to the point we're trading down, and thus, private label share gains have accelerated. Not surprisingly, our most profitable brands with the largest price premiums have suffered the most. 
While total volumes have been largely unaffected, this mix shift from brands into private label is eroding our gross margin. Our ability to directly impact this erosion in the short term is limited, as neither of our choices is attractive. We can reduce the price gap by lowering our branded pricing, thereby reducing our branded margins, where we can hold price and continue to lose branded share into private label.
We also continue to be impacted by direct pricing pressure from retailers. Retailers have invested heavily in the category to pursue their low-priced strategies. In many cases, private label milk is being priced by retailers at or below their cost. As a result, retailers seek to mitigate the impact on their P&Ls through price concession from processors. This price compression is further pressuring our results. 
This hyper-competitive retail activity began in early 2009 as raw milk prices hit historic lows and unemployment peaked. I continue to believe that the retail industry will at some point return to more normal private label milk margins, as continued discounting no longer moves foot traffic and retailers seek to restore their profit pool. However, it is not clear when that will happen, leaving us cautious about segment results for the balance of the year. 
As I said, these issues generally have minimal effect on overall sales volumes. And with the benefit of our acquisitions, we continue to post solid, fluid milk volume and share growth in the period. Fluid milk volumes increased 3% compared to the balance of the industry that we believe was down approximately 2%.
We continue to see positive impact on cost from our efforts in conversion and distribution. But given the gross margin pressures on the business, it's clear that we must accelerate our cost reduction efforts. Gross margin compression, combined with higher fuel and freight cost, drove a 41% decline in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar operating margin against a tough year-ago comparison to $127 million. 
Looking ahead, our inability to predict the end of the retailer price wars makes it difficult to forecast how the balance of the year will play out. However, if current price and mix pressures continue, the reduction in margins could impact segment operating profit by up to $100 million over the balance of the year. In the meantime, to begin to combat this margin pressure, we're actively looking for areas in our portfolio where we can increase prices. Perhaps more importantly, we're significantly accelerating our cost reduction efforts, as we strive to drive down the cost curve and position ourself to win in an industry increasingly focused on price and value.
With a sharpened focus on portfolio revenue management and the benefits of our ongoing cost initiative, we did see some improvement in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar results as the first quarter progressed. However, at the end of the day, current industry pressures have created a significant pricing problem in our business. Price gaps are at levels that our brands cannot support and accelerated trade-down continues. Our industry remains highly competitive, and our ability to impact this problem directly to pricing on gallons of milk is limited.
The cost reduction strategy we have been pursuing is our single most important area of focus. We have discussed goals of $90 million in cost savings in 2010 and $300 million over three to five years. It is now clear that we have to be much more aggressive in both the timing and the magnitude of our efforts. Going forward, these efforts will include an increase in the scale of the initiatives we currently have underway, as well as an increase in the scope of these efforts across the business. We are developing plans to accelerate productivity across our entire cost structure, including production, distribution, sales, administration and corporate expenditures. 
In that vein, we announced a new cost reduction and restructuring initiative this morning in the FDD-Morningstar business that will eliminate 350 to 400 positions on top of the approximately 100 positions we have already eliminated in 2010. We expect this additional action to result in annualized savings of approximately $25 million.
At WhiteWave-Alpro, the story is quite different. The strong performance that drove double-digit profit growth in 2009 continued into the first quarter of this year and accelerated, as volume-driven top line growth returned across all key brands. First quarter net sales increased 35% to $485 million. Approximately 26% of the sales growth is attributable to our Alpro acquisition, with about nine points of growth attributable to WhiteWave. Importantly, all of our key brands reported solid net sales growth in the quarter, and volume grew slightly ahead of sales.
Consumers appear to be cautiously returning to value-added brands, and we are benefiting from this trend. In addition to these secular trends, we are driving our brands with strong innovation in marketing, particularly in the dairy, milk alternative and creamer categories. Our Branded Creamer business continued to be a standout in the portfolio, with International Delight growing more than 25% and a Land O'Lakes creamers up high single digits. This growth is on the back of solid innovation and world-class marketing. International Delight creamers grew their share in the category by three full points in the quarter.
The organic milk category also returned to growth in the first quarter. Horizon Organic outperformed the category and grew mid single digits in both volume and net sales in the quarter. Our Silk brand demonstrated strong growth in the quarter, with mid-single-digit net sales growth on the back of a very strong launch of our Silk PureAlmond line of almond beverages. Alpro continues to perform well with high single-digit volume and net sales growth across the business. 
Our strong brand performance plus the Alpro acquisition drove 54% growth in segment operating income to $44 million. Operating income at WhiteWave, excluding Alpro, grew 34%. Our value-added branded business frankly is running on all cylinders. Looking ahead, we expect this top and bottom line growth to continue with expectations for strong double-digit full year operating income growth in our WhiteWave-Alpro segment. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack for a more detailed review of the financial results. Jack?"
34883,102234733,63974,"Dean Foods Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 10, 2010",2010-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Dean Foods Company","Executives","Thanks, Gregg.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items before turning the call back to Gregg for some closing remarks and opening the line up for your questions.
Our first quarter performance illuminates the differences between the two segments with accelerated net sales and profit growth at WhiteWave-Alpro, offset by continued significant challenges at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Corporate expense of $48 million remained above year-ago levels but was down a bit from the run rate of the previous three quarters. For the balance of the year, we do not expect any meaningful year-over-year growth in corporate expense, as our period of stepped-up investment is over, and we are working to reduce this expense over time as an element of our cost reduction program. In total, first quarter consolidated operating income was 40% below year-ago results at $123 million. 
Within the consolidated results, total company gross profit declined $8 million. A $68 million decline in gross profit at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar was largely offset by strong gross profit growth at WhiteWave-Alpro. Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased $74 million over the year-ago period. 
I'd like to provide some clarity into the drivers of these expenses in the quarter. Of the $74 million of operating expense growth, approximately 60% is directly related to the acquisition of Alpro, Foremost and Heartland, which were completed in 2009. Other meaningful contributions to operating expense growth include higher fuel-related costs at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar and increased marketing expense at WhiteWave-Alpro to support continued momentum behind our value-added branded portfolio. 
Below the line, interest expense declined $10 million from the year-ago period as the result of lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. Our tax rate in the quarter was just under 35%, down from 39% a year ago, aided by our international tax rate and an increase in the U.S. domestic manufacturing deduction, as well as the one-time effect of finalizing certain tax audits in the quarter. We expect our full year tax rate to be 37% to 38%. Net income of $42 million drove first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.23 well below year-ago results, as we lapped the best quarter in our history and a lower share count. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $71 million, subtracting net capital expenditures of $43 million from this yield of free cash flow of $28 million. For the full year, we anticipate capital spending of $250 million to $300 million, but we would point investors to the low end of this range as we prudently manage the pace of that spending to support ongoing debt paydowns. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total outstanding net debt at quarter end stood at $4.16 billion, down $27 million from last quarter. As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt-to-EBITDA, as defined by our credit agreement, stepped up a bit this quarter due to the impact of losing the very strong first quarter of 2009 and our trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.43x versus the current covenant of 5x and a year-end covenant step-down to 4.5x. To further support our debt paydown efforts, we continue to aggressively manage net operating working capital. On a year-over-year basis, net operating working capital was essentially flat despite a 23% increase in the Class I Mover, which allowed for a continued debt reduction in the quarter.
Given the continuing challenges in the business, we are not on pace against our previously stated goal of deleveraging the balance sheet to approximately 3.5x funded debt-to-EBITDA by mid-2011. In addition, over the medium term, we must ensure adequate operating flexibility against the final covenant step-down to 4.5x at the end of the year. Therefore, we continue to closely monitor the capital market and may choose to address our refinancing needs sooner than we previously anticipated. Both the bank and high-yield financing markets have significantly improved over the past year, affording us multiple debt financing options to consider.
With that, I conclude my comments, and thank you for your continued interest in Dean Foods, and will turn the call back over to Gregg for some closing comments before opening up the call to your questions. Gregg?"

Before we open up the call for questions, let me give you some perspective on our forward outlook. At WhiteWave-Alpro, we're on a solid path of volume sales and profit growth that we expect to continue through 2010. Our branded business is very strong with significant momentum. We expect to drive volume-led top line growth through effective marketing and innovation and to leverage this growth into another year of strong operating income growth. 
At Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, the road ahead appears rocky, with the retail price environment that appears unsustainable but is not yet abated. That makes it difficult to provide accurate guidance beyond the immediate quarter. The current pressures on FDD-Morningstar had a significant impact on Q1 results and could impact the balance of year operating covenants by up to $100 million if retailers continue to pursue a strategy of aggressive price promotion on private label milk. Additionally, dairy commodity prices are now expected to trend higher through the balance of the year, which could further pressure results.
Concerns about rising non-fat dry milk and butter prices have several economists predicting a rise in the Class I milk price of $3 to $4 per hundredweight over the balance of the year. The uncertainty in these forecast adds to our caution as we look out over the balance of the year. 
For the time being, we're going to provide specific guidance only for the next quarter where our visibility is better. In this case, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be $0.23 to $0.28, essentially in line with Q1 results. While we hope to see a more positive environment in the back half of the year, the uncertainty surrounding whether or when that will occur leads us to suspend our full year guidance for the present time. 
I've now been in the dairy industry for nearly two decades. And while we faced our share of challenges over that time, today's challenges represent a unique moment in our industry. Processors were under pressure in ways that we have not experienced before. Periods of industry difficulty typically separate the strong from the weak. The longer these challenges persist, the more difficult it becomes for cost-disadvantaged competitors to survive. Pressures like we're expressing today should accelerate industry consolidation among the lowest and most sufficient and capable processors. We're a cost leader in the industry today and are committed to extending our lead going forward.
Our size and scale afford us opportunities to meaningfully extend our cost leadership position, and we are aggressively attacking those opportunities. The urgency, momentum and confidence we have in our ability to reduce cost have all increased. While it's too early to comment specifically on our plans to expand the scale and scope of our cost reduction efforts beyond what we've announced today, we expect meaningful progress in the quarters to come, as we work to combat these market pressures and build a sustainably differentiated position in our industry. 
We believe that taking more aggressive action now will enable us to emerge from the current market challenges in a stronger position versus our competitors and will fuel our long-term success. The winner in the traditional dairy category will be the low-cost producer and Dean will be that company. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today and ask the operator to open the call for your questions. Operator?"

T",367,"Well, I think the first part of your question is an important question, and I would be making up a guess about what consumers will do if this trend reverses or when this trend reverses, because the retail industry has given up a ton of profit pool here. They will ultimately back away from this strategy as it stops moving share around, right? They're doing this to move share around and when that stops, then they'll go to restore the profit pool. So when that happens, some of the pressure will come off of our brands, and we will still have some brands in these marketplaces that have a premium over private label, right? This category is not going all private label. These brands have been around a long time and they have loyal consumers. On the other hand, I do think that where we had very high brand premiums, they will be permanently reduced. So I believe that our brand profit pool going forward will not return to its levels of 2008 and 2009, it will be some diminished level. And we'll know what that looks like after the retail profit pool gets restored, the private label retail profit pool. With respect to your last question, we had experienced and had talked about through 2009, 2008, as our brand premiums blew out against private labels, that we need to get our brands back in value and lower brand premiums in certain marketplaces, and we undertook to do that. And frankly, we were having good success with that in terms of holding and beginning to rebuild brand volume. But that was in a world in which retailers were taking 30 margins on private label and 30 to 35 margins on brand. In an environment where retailers are taking zero margins or 5% margins on private label, you just can't get your brands in value, as I discussed earlier to Alexia's question or Terry's question, without just tanking your P&L. The first half year has got to be retailers restoring some profit pool on private label milk. Until that happens, I think it's just going to be impossible to get a beat on where your brands are going."

But by our measure, that got worse sequentially in January, but it improved in February and March. And I understand it seems to be more about just private label versus branded milk, but in that -- I guess I'm getting at is as input costs go higher, should we assume that you're passing that along, especially on the private label milk? Is that getting passed along at all, or is that gap that we see at least narrow or getting better, is it really not getting better, is it the alternate channels that are working against that?"

That happens still with just perfect, almost perfect regularity. So milk goes up dime a gallon, our prices go up a dime a gallon. But we are experiencing mix shift, so that erodes our, if you will, our net margin over milk, not that our customers aren't taking the price increases, but we're mixing out of the consumer level from branded to private label. And then there is this competitive bidding phenomenon. So we're passing along $0.10 a gallon, but a retailer's coming back to you and saying, well, yes, but I want you to take $0.01 out of the net margin that you make on a go-forward basis. So there's competitive bidding. There's pass-through, which has to work and does work in the industry and then there's mix shift. And that's the  net of what's driving our gross margin decline in the FDD business. As to whether the spread is getting better, we said at CAGNY, in the middle of February, that we saw retailers trying to take the price up, and we do see that. We see retailers trying to take the price up and particularly in conjunction with months where the Class I Mover goes up, we're seeing people trying to pass that along plus a little bit more in their private label retail. But we didn't see people coming back in and driving it back down. So it's not holding yet in terms of this margin over milk going forward. So we've refined -- you'll notice our chart, we refined a little bit. We're now looking at private label margin over milk because that's really what's driving the category, as opposed to the branded margin over milk. And that's, I think, for us, that's the key indicator today, what are the private label guys doing in terms of margin over milk."

The most important one being that what retailers are trying to do is build their private labels as opposed to build store traffic. We are in deep and continual conversation with our retailers around this issue and this strategy. And I'm confident in saying that what a given retailer is trying to do with their private label here is not build their retailer brand. What they're trying to do is they're trying to move a shopper from chain X to their chain by being more deeply discounted on milk, and they're doing that through their private label. I think, look, these retailers are all very, very good at math. And they understand that they make more money on a gallon of branded milk because of both the higher price point and the higher margin that they take than they do on a gallon of private label. And that there is a role for brand in this category and that, that role is nOt going to go away as we come out of this deep period of discounting. But the math that we don't benefit from in the private label price compression math is that the shopper that comes in to buy a gallon of milk at $1.77 buys a bunch of other stuff on which they have much higher margins. So right now, the calculus is that if I can move shoppers to my store and put traffic, it pays out this milk price compression. Again, I'd make the point I made earlier, that math works only so long as you are advantaged as a retailer in this private label category versus other retailers, and I'm moving traffic around between my competitors and myself. We've got to a point where most of the industry's down here at these cheap price levels. And as retailers stop seeing store count, foot traffic change as a result of the things they're doing to promote, they will seek to restore what's a very big margin get back in this category. So this is not about building private label brands, this is about driving foot traffic and share at the retail level"

Looking back over the past six quarters, the business environment has changed dramatically. In the first half of last year, we benefited from rapidly declining commodity costs and posted two of the best quarters in our history. By mid-summer, retailers had embarked on a strategy to drive store traffic through deeply discounting private label milk. This resulted in widening price gaps against our brands and pricing pressure on our Private Label Milk business, which was reflected in our results. Through the first half of this year, retailers have continued to drive this strategy even in the face of diminishing evidence of its effectiveness.
With this in mind, this morning, we announced second quarter net income of $53 million or $0.29 a share. These numbers are well below our very strong year-ago results, but they represent a step forward from the first quarter. At Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, the pressures that have impacted results over the last several quarters remain serious challenges to the business. Incremental pricing and continued progress against our cost reduction initiatives resulted in an increase in segment earnings over the first quarter. At WhiteWave-Alpro, strong volume-driven top line growth continued through the second quarter even as operating profit growth slowed a bit from the previous quarter due to higher marketing spend and supply chain cost, driven higher by surging new product volumes.
Also in the quarter, we completed an important amendment and extension of our bank credit facility that provides greater financial flexibility in this challenging environment and significantly improves the maturity schedule of our debt. With that introduction, let me begin by looking more closely at some of the internal and external factors that impacted our results.
After that, I'll offer some perspective on how these trends played out in our businesses during the second quarter and offer some comments on our forward outlook. Jack will take you through a number of corporate items and discuss the changes to our balance sheet during the quarter. Following Jack, we'll open up the call for your questions.
This is a unique time for food producers. Signs of recovery are beginning to appear across the higher rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, but lower- and middle-class consumers continue to struggle. In the grocery analysis [ph], this has led to weak volumes across many categories and weak comps at some value-oriented retailers in spite of strong promotional support. For example, the cereal category, which drives roughly 30% of milk consumption, was down mid-single digits for the quarter, contributing to a slight decline in industry conventional fluid milk volumes. 
In contrast to the challenges confronting fluid milk and many other staple categories, some value-added categories are seeing nice growth. Among these, the Non-Dairy Milk Alternatives category, that includes soy and almond milk, was strong in the quarter. Other categories that WhiteWave-Alpro operates in were also strong, including flavored coffee creamers and organic milk. The divergent results of our two operating segments in some ways reflect these broader economic and category trends.
Looking more closely at fluid milk, category volumes were down slightly in the quarter despite continued deep retailer discounting of private label gallons. Despite the lack of elasticity in the category, retailers continue to offer private label gallons at significantly reduced prices to drive traffic. The margin over private label milk, which is a rough measure of the spread between raw milk cost and retail pricing, remains well below year-ago level and is fundamentally unchanged from earlier in the year.
While the gap has tightened a bit, we continue to outperform our competition on a volume basis. The overall fluid milk market was down slightly in the quarter. Within this, our fluid milk volume was up slightly, while the balance of the market declined about a half a point. Our share expansion slowed a bit in the quarter due largely to the lapping of acquisitions and volume declines across some of our traditional grocery customer base. 
Outside of fluid milk, other categories, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, were also generally soft. Our Creamer, Cultured Products and Juice businesses all had modest volume declines. However, strong quick-serve restaurant demand drove solid growth in ice cream mix and aerosol products. In total, our Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar sales volumes were down modestly in the quarter. 
While we continue to face significant challenges in the quarter, our teams worked to improve pricing wherever possible to protect overall profitability. Gross profits were down $54 million on a year-over-year basis but improved by $12 million from the first quarter of this year to $584 million even as school milk volumes dropped off in the last month of the quarter. 
We continue to work to improve the quality of our data warehouse to better analyze the causes of change in our business. However, the key issue remains our core Milk business, which drove approximately 70% of the decline in the quarter. Within our Milk portfolio, brand pricing and margin improved somewhat versus the first quarter, but lower-branded volumes and continued margin compression negatively impacted the year-over-year results. 
In private label milk, pricing pressures increased in the second quarter and contributed more to the year-over-year gross profit decline as retailers worked to leverage excess capacity in the industry. Across the balance of the portfolio, general volume weakness and pricing pressure continued to negatively impact results at the gross margin level. These factors in combination more than offset strong progress in driving down conversion costs on a year-over-year basis.
While our results over the last several quarters have been driven by market forces that primarily affect gross margin, permanently reducing our system-wide cost structure remains our top priority. We are committed to becoming a differentiated, low-cost operation in delivering on our commitment to drive more than $300 million in cost savings at Dean. We've accelerated our efforts in this area and believe we are on track to realize over $100 million in savings in 2010 toward this goal on top of the $75 million achieved in 2009. 
As part of these efforts, the headcount reduction we announced last quarter is moving forward. These accelerated efforts to streamline operations and maximize efficiency have resulted in the elimination of over 360 positions across Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar so far. When combined with other initiatives, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar headcount is down by more than 700 positions since the beginning of the year.
In distribution, better technologies have led to a reduction of 350 routes over the last 18 months. The volume of fuel used in our DSD operations in the second quarter was 2% below last year, and distribution employee costs were down 5%. All in all, distribution cost per gallon in our DSD operations, excluding fuel, were 2% lower than the year-ago period. 
In network optimization, we recently announced an additional plant closure in the Southeast that will improve our asset utilization and reduce overall cost in that region, and we're preparing to launch larger projects over the next 18 months that will create a significant change in our cost structure in several key markets across the country. Accelerated cost reduction continues to be the number one priority for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Creating a differentiated cost position is critical to the long-term success of the business.
This continued focus on cost control, combined with our pricing initiatives in the quarter, led to a $20 million sequential improvement in operating income from the first quarter of this year to $147 million. That is still well below our very strong result last year and not where we need to be. But it is also a step forward from the first quarter of this year in what continues to be a very challenging market.
Our WhiteWave-Alpro business is operating against quite a different backdrop. The value-added consumer drove solid category growth in non-dairy milk alternatives, organic milk and creamers. This category growth and a strong pipeline of innovative products drove strong top line momentum at WhiteWave-Alpro. 
Total second quarter segment net sales increased 31% over last year to $459 million, reflecting the impact of the Alpro acquisition and continued solid growth at WhiteWave. On a like-for-like basis, both WhiteWave and Alpro increased net sales in the high-single digits in the quarter.
Consistent with last quarter, all of our key brands reported solid volume-driven sales growth in the quarter. Our largest business at WhiteWave is our Silk and Alpro Non-Dairy Milk Alternatives business. This area of the portfolio continues to perform very well. Driven by the continued success of Pure Almond, Silk achieved low-double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. We see the almond milk category as an important product extension for the brand as we expand Silk beyond soy. 
Alpro also continued to perform well in Europe, with both high-single-digit volume and net sales growth. Our Branded Creamers business again posted strong growth and continues to be a standout performer in our portfolio. International Delight net sales grew in the mid-teens and Land O'Lakes Half & Half net sales increased in the mid-single digits.
Competitive intensity has increased in the Flavored Creamer category, but we remain committed to driving volume growth through innovation in this important business. In the organic milk category, growth accelerated from the first quarter levels. This help support high single-digit growth in Horizon Organic branded milk sales, again, outperforming the category and increasing share. 
I should note that our WhiteWave results do not include the Rachel's business. This small business, which consists of yogurt and other dairy products sold primarily in the United Kingdom, has been moved to discontinued operations as a result of a sales agreement we've entered into. This sale will help us create greater focus on our remaining core businesses, and we expect this sale to be completed in the third quarter.
In terms of operating income, our strong brand growth performance and the benefits of the Alpro acquisition were partially offset by higher distribution costs and the timing of marketing investments on new products. The strong volume growth across the WhiteWave portfolio has driven increases in storage, handling and shipping costs as production capacity tightens. In total, segment operating income increased 18% in the quarter to $41 million. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the momentum of our Branded businesses and continue to expect solid volume-driven top line growth and strong full year operating income growth for the segment.
Before turning the call over to Jack to discuss corporate and balance sheet-related items, I'd like to offer some perspective on our forward outlook. At a high level, our current outlook for the business is fundamentally unchanged from our first quarter conference call. Consumers, particularly working-class consumers, remain underemployed and over-leveraged. Their economic anxiety is reflected in a highly promotional retail environment for private label milk that is driving negative Private Label versus Branded mix and margin compression for our Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business. 
Despite aggressive retail pricing, category volumes are soft. As a result, our expectations for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar performance have not changed from last quarter's call. 
On the other hand, our more value-added business at WhiteWave-Alpro, bolstered by increasingly confident upper-income consumers, continue to post strong volume, revenue and operating profit growth, a trend that we expect to continue, which should result in very solid annual profit growth for that segment.
Finally, we have put one of the major risk to our business behind us with the successful amendment and extension of our credit facilities. The increase flexibility of loosened covenants and extended maturities came at a cost of approximately $0.06 of additional interest expense from Q2 to Q3. 
In keeping with our recent practice, we'll offer guidance only for the upcoming quarter. Given that our view of the business conditions have not materially changed from the second quarter and given typical seasonal weakness in Q3 versus Q2, we expect earnings of $0.17 to $0.22 per share in the third quarter. Adjusting for the $0.06 of additional Q3 interest expense, our range of guidance for Q3 is essentially unchanged from the guidance range we gave you for Q2. 
With that, I'd like to again thank you for joining us on the call today and turn it over to Jack for a review of operating expenses and changes in our capital structure. After that, we'll open the call for your questions. Jack?"

I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items, as well as the important step forward in the highly successful amendment and extens",1096,"Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items, as well as the important step forward in the highly successful amendment and extension of our senior credit facilities during the quarter before opening the lines up for your questions.
Corporate expense of $54 million was 6% below year-ago level. As we've previously discussed, our period of stepped-up investment and corporate capability is over, and we expect essentially flat corporate expense over the balance of the year. Corporate expense did sequentially increase about $6 million from the first quarter of 2010. This increase was due in part to the timing of consulting expense and the completion of our move into our new headquarters building. Headcount remains effectively flat, and we are working to reduce this expense over time as part of our larger cost reduction program.
Within the consolidated results, total Dean Foods gross profit declined about $10 million from a year ago. Solid gross profit growth at WhiteWave and the acquisition impact of Alpro were offset by the weaker Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar results. 
Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased $37 million over the year-ago period. However, over 90% of the increase was related to the acquisition of Alpro and Heartland in the second half of 2009. 
At FDD-Morningstar, strong expense control resulted in total operating expense growth of less than 1%, which is down considerably when adjusted for higher fuel costs and the acquisition of Heartland Dairy, demonstrate our progress in reducing our cost structure. WhiteWave-Alpro operating cost rose primarily due to the acquisition of Alpro, as well as higher distribution costs and the timing of marketing expense at WhiteWave. We're pleased with the operating costs performance in the quarter, and we will continue to focus on driving SG&A efficiency in the business going forward.
In total, second quarter consolidated operating income was 26% below year-ago results at $133 million but an 8% improvement from the challenging start we had in the first quarter of 2010. Below the operating income line, interest expense declined $11 million from the year-ago period as a result of lower interest rate and the maturity of $800 million of interest rate swaps on March 31 of this year. Interest expense will step up going forward as a result of the amend-and-extend transaction we completed at the end of the quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment.
Our tax rate in the quarter was 37.1%. This is down from 37.9% a year ago, aided by an international tax rate and an increase in the U.S. domestic manufacturing deduction. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be between 37% to 38%. 
Net income of $53 million drove second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.29. As Gregg indicated, these results are well below year-ago levels but a step forward from the first quarter.
Net cash from operations through the second quarter of this year was $244 million. Subtracting capital expenditures of $113 million from this yield free cash flow of $131 million for the first six months of this year. I will update the outlook for the balance of the year capital spending in just a moment. 
To further support the generation of free cash flow and bolster our debt pay-down efforts, we continue to aggressively manage net operating working capital. Our cash conversion cycle was down three days from the year-ago period, resulting in net operating working capital that was essentially flat despite a 35% increase in the Class I Mover.
Total outstanding net debt at quarter end stood at $4.1 billion, down $64 million from the last quarter. As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA as defined by our credit agreement stepped up a bit this quarter despite continued debt reduction. This was due to the impact of losing the very strong second quarter of 2009 and our trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.68x versus the current covenant of 5.5x. 
At the end of the second quarter, we successfully completed an amendment and extension of our credit agreement. We enjoyed very strong support from our banking group, and we appreciate their commitment to Dean. The revised agreement results in a lengthened maturity profile, significantly reduced near-term amortizations and increased flexibility versus our leverage covenant. 
From a maturity schedule point of view, we significantly improved our profile with approximately 80% of our total outstanding debt now maturing 2014 or later, a far more balanced profile than before.
Our term loan amortization schedule has also significantly improved, with amortizations between 2010 and 2014 reduced by more than $950 million. We maintained strong liquidity through the transaction, preserving approximately $1.3 billion of currently available liquidity in our AR Securitization and Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we successfully modified our covenant structure to allow more flexibility as we invest capital to drive our long-term strategy and to weather the challenging competitive environment. Our revised leverage ratio covenant is 5.5x. The covenant steps down to 5x on June 30, 2011. The final step-down to 4.5x occurs at the end of 2012.
As you expect, pricing on the extended portions of the facility has been adjusted. The new pricing grids reflect excellent execution, given market conditions, including the absence of LIBOR floors. Given this adjustment, we now expect full year interest expense of between $238 million to $240 million, including approximately $66 million to $67 million in the third quarter. We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming support of our banking partners, confirming their confidence in our long-term strategy. 
With this deal in place, we plan to continue on the path toward our goal of deleveraging the balance sheet to 3.5x funded debt to EBITDA, balancing continued debt reduction and selected divestitures, such as the Rachel's transaction, against high-return capital investments targeted at extending our low-cost position.
With this in mind, we are now targeting capital spending at the higher end of our previously discussed $250 million to $300 million range, reflecting spend on high-return investments behind our strategies to drive to absolute lowest cost in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, as well as investments and additional capacity to support the strong volume growth at WhiteWave-Alpro.
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Barclays Back-To-School Conference next month. With that, I'd ask the operator to open up the call for your questions. Operator?"

And notwithstanding the retail data that shows up, our pricing, I think, has held relatively well, given the actions that we took during Q2. So part of what you see, I think, is retailers adjusting their relative margins in order to maintain a balance of Branded and Private Label, which, over the long run, they need in their stores. So we're reasonably satisfied with the pricing actions that we've taken in our Branded business. We do, however, continue to see, given the relatively larger price gaps, some volume erosion, although that has mitigated as we came through Q2, in terms of losing brands, mixing out to Private Label. So on the Branded side of the business, I'd say we have seen some improvements over the circumstances that existed in Q4 and Q1. We have been successful in taking some pricing.

So again, we made progress in reference to your first question in getting Branded product pricing, so that aspect has diminished. On the other hand, we continue to see pressure from retailers as they try and capitalize on excess capacity in the industry against private label pricing, and we continue to respond to that. We're going to defend our share in this environment and maintain a size of our business. The industry is going through, I think, a relatively long-term shakeout of capacity here. Retailers understand that. And the level of pricing intensity in private label has amped up a bit as we've gone from 2009 into 2010."

So again, in the prepared remarks, we focused on the fact that we have got to, over the long term, structurally reduce our cost structure and make sure that we're the surviving players as the industry consolidates here, and the winning player as the industry consolidates, because in a soft-volume environment and an environment where consumers continue to be pressured, I'm not sure that I would want to forecast that this process was going to stop.

And I think it will continue to happen over an extended period of time. I think you'll continue to see capacity come out of the industry because it makes economic sense for it to come out of the industry. As to Horizon, Horizon is clearly improving. There is no question about that, and the category is back to growing at a pretty healthy pace. So category volume's up mid to high-single digits over the past quarter. So very reassuring and encouraging developments in the category. While we are in a greatly improved financial position in Horizon compared to where we've been in the last year and half or so, we are not anywhere close to being back to what our level of profitability was going into the sort of tectonic shakeout in the industry that started in 2007. So we still got a long way to go in Organic. Frankly, we think that's encouraging because we think it raises the prospects of continuing profit growth in WhiteWave above and beyond perhaps volume growth in that category. But we're going to have to wait and see how that plays out over time. But we're encouraged by the changes in Organic milk."

They may have at-will arrangements that have time horizons on them, but they tend not to sign contracts that are classic supply contracts. So we can change relatively quickly as industry conditions begin to improve. Back to your question of what needs to happen to really get a lot of capacity out. Frankly, it's going to take one of two things to get a lot of capacity out, and we're clearly on one of the paths. In order to get meaningful capacity out of our system, we're going to have to step up our level of capital spending in order to create modern facilities that can supply broader geographies than our existing legacy, smaller, more fragmented facilities can supply. You're seeing us start to step up that level of capital spending. So within our own system, we've got a lot of stranded capacity out there in the 100 plants that we have in FDD, and we need to reconfigure that capacity and ultimately, the amount of capacity we've got dedicated to these individual product lines is going to have to go down, although, our business is not going to get smaller. So we're going to take our own excess capacity out. And you see us probably working more steadily at that than anybody else in the industry. And I think that's why our cost structure is today, lower than anybody else in the industry. So that's the plan that we're going to be on. The rest of the industry remains very highly fragmented. And I think, in order to enable capacity come out of the rest of the industry, it needs to consolidate in terms of an ownership consolidation. And whether one of the existing participants or a new participant is going to come in to drive that is an open question, and one that we don't have a lot of visibility into. But I think for a lot of the stranded capacity and the other 60% of the industry to come out, it needs to have a more consolidated ownership structure."

And that is if you go back and you look at our fluid milk volumes several quarters ago, and you track them on a weekly basis, we used to see, as you would expect, was a truly stable category with complete household penetration.

And by the time that you get to the end of the month, sales are down in what are meaningful percentages for a category like this, that's flat, it has been for 30 years. So you're seeing inter-month volume volatility, or a volume pattern emerging. And the only conclusion, I think, you can draw from that is there are people who are big consumers in this category, they're just running out of money, starting at the end of the month. And you'll recall, during the month of June and in part of July, the Congress stalemated over extending unemployment benefits for a large number of people. We saw that in our business in soft volumes. So that's really my concern about the category is that there are still a very large number of households in the U.S. who are very constrained in terms of disposable income, and they're cutting back wherever they can. And they're not cutting back just one category, they're trimming around the edges everywhere. And we see soft category volumes."

As you've seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges",2128,"Thank you, Barry, and thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. As you've seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges in our largest business, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Despite our poor consolidated performance, WhiteWave Alpro continued to perform exceptionally well and delivered significant top and bottom-line growth. However, given the relative size of the business, it was not enough to offset weakness in the much larger Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar segment. 
As we've noted on previous calls, our core dairy businesses performance has suffered material margin pressure from the fundamental adverse shifts in the market pricing of private-label milk and its related fallout. More recently, two other factors have impacted our business. We've experienced weakness in milk category volumes and other beverage and cultured product categories within Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Butterfat costs also spiked to unexpectedly high levels in Q3, which further compress segment operating performance. In light of these results, we continue to take aggressive steps to improve our result at FDD-Morningstar including accelerated cost reductions and as we recently announced, a realignment of the management and organization of the business.
With that overview, let me drill down a bit into each of the businesses, starting with Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar gross profits declined $44 million from the year-ago period. While the issues impacting results are much the same as we've been dealing with for the past year or so, the relative magnitude has changed a bit. The pricing pressures on the core dairy business that began last year continued through the third quarter. To attract customers in a tough climate, retailers have priced gallons of private-label milk at deep discounts. The margin over milk metric on the right of this chart that tracks the spread between retail pricing of private-label gallons of milk and the government mandated Class I Mover price remains essentially unchanged from prior periods, $0.40 to $0.50 a gallon below historical levels.  
This continues to impact the processing industry in two ways. First, it drives ongoing pricing pressure from processors such as Dean, as retailers look to reduce their cost across the category. Volume-hungry competitors have been aggressively for available business and contract renegotiations have been widespread. So far, we have successfully maintained and even grown our share. However, this competitive intensity has resulted in broad-based price concessions. The result of this pressure on our P&L accounted for the lion share of the year-over-year decline and segment gross profits in the quarter. The heavy competition in the market place will likely continue to impact the processing industry profits for some time to come.
Second, deeply discounted retail prices for private-label milk have widened gaps between our more profitable regional brands and private labels. Although the year-over-year impact has lessen, consumers looking for value have continued to trade down to private-label and our product mix continues to deteriorate as a result. In addition to our challenges in the fluid milk category, we have begun to experience volume weakness across the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio. These factors combined with the impact of steep butterfat inflation in the quarter drove our operating income bis [ph] this period.
In spite of continued aggressive private-label pricing, volume weakness in the fluid milk category that we began to see in the second quarter continued through the third. Part of this weakness can be explained by very aggressive promotion and low milk prices in the year-ago period Q3 2009, during which retailer feature ads in the category were more than twice as abundant and much more productive than this year. But we also continue to see interment [ph] trends of declining volumes throughout each month indicative of cash-strapped customers. It is clear that a significant segment of consumers are not just looking for value pricing, they are cutting back on purchases of even basic items.
These trends have had a pronounced impact on the fluid milk category which has slowed considerably. Fluid milk volumes across IRI measured channels were down more than 3.5% in the quarter from a year ago. Across all channels, total USDA fluid milk volumes declined approximately 1.6% in the quarter. Within this, our fluid milk volume growth has weakened from approximately 2% growth earlier in the year to essentially flat in the last two quarters. We began the quarter with volume growth of over 1% in July but volumes were down significantly in both August and September. We estimate that our competitors' volumes have been down more than 2.5% for the year, exacerbating the competitive intensity in the marketplace. 
While our volumes have outperformed the balance of the industry for some time, as we lapped the Heartland acquisition in early Q4, we believe our volume performance will likely converge with the overall market. As I mentioned, outside the fluid milk category, our product volumes in the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio have also experienced widespread softness, declining 6% in aggregate. Our other beverage products including juice, tea and water declined mid-single digits. Cultured products declined more than 10%, creamers declined low-single digits and the ice cream category was also soft in the quarter. 
In total, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar volumes declined 2% in the third quarter. The negative effect of this volume softness was amplified by the dramatic increase in Class II butterfat costs in the quarter, which created additional pressure on gross profits. Class II butterfat average $2.12 per pound in the quarter, an increase of 70% from the year-ago period and more than 25% above the second quarter.  As a reminder, Class II butterfat is a key input in our creamer, cultured and ice cream product businesses where the pass-through of changes and input cost is less efficient than fluid milk.
The continued gross margin pressure on the business, higher fuel costs and increased bad debt expenses all contributed to drive segment operating profit well below year-ago levels at $116 million. Without question, our best strategy to combat this continued P&L pressure is to relentlessly focus on permanently reducing structural costs. Our teams have made great progress on this initiative with $175 million in projected cost savings from the beginning of 2009 through the end of this year. We're committed to becoming a differentiated low-cost operation and are accelerating our efforts toward achieving our goal of $300 million of cost savings by the end of 2011, year three over our original three to five year target. 
Following completion of our initial goal, we then expect to drive at least $100 million in additional cost from the business each year for the next three to five years. We've driven progress on our cost initiatives in all of our targeted areas. Total headcount in the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business is down more than 1,000 positions in 2010 alone. Better technology has enabled the reduction of nearly 500 delivery routes since the beginning of 2009. Over the same period, fuel usage down 4% despite acquisitions. We've closed five facilities over that time, including one this year. Improved purchasing has produced more than $28 million in annual procurement savings.
Going forward, we're expanding on these efforts in additional areas like the G&A cost initiative we recently announced, which we expect to drive $30 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. We're also targeting reductions in milk procurement costs to improve logistics and in-sourcing those activities where it makes sense. You should also expect a material increase in our network optimization efforts over the coming years as we drive cost out of our system through remaking our manufacturing network. Stated simply, accelerated cost reduction continues to be the number one priority for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Creating a differentiated cost position is critical to the long-term success of the business. As a management team and as an organization, we're aligned on this priority with a number of initiatives focused on permanently reducing structural costs to stabilize and then rebuild the profitability of Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.
In addition to reducing cost, we think we can achieve substantial benefits by attacking the marketplace in a more integrated manner. To that end, we recently announced key executive changes that realign our organizational structure, an approach that we believe will make us more nimble and enhance our go-to market strategy. As many of you saw, we recently created the role of Chief Commercial Officer with the Chris Sliva, who is previously the President of our Morningstar Division assuming this post. Chris will have responsibility for directing the commercial strategy of both of the Fresh Dairy Direct and Morningstar Division's. This move is consistent with the broader initiative to tighten the alignment of the company's sales organization, commercial lines of business and customer relationships providing greater visibility, flexibility, efficiency and accountability. This is the first step in removing many of the artificial barriers that have historically existed between these two highly related businesses. Our goal is to go to customers with one Dean face and to act that way, all the way to the supply chain.
Let me now turn to our other segments, WhiteWave-Alpro. In contrast to our results at FDD-Morningstar, our WhiteWave-Alpro brand of segment continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, driven by solid top line sales. Third quarter segment net sales increased 8% over last year to $478 million, reflecting broad growth across the portfolio. Consistent with the first two quarters of this year, all of our key brands continue to drive solid volume-led sales growth in the quarter. Rising organic milk had an especially strong quarter with growth in the high-teens driven by our differentiated product offerings and continued solid category growth. Horizon has continued to outperform the category and gained additional share. 
Our Creamers business led by International Delight, also continued to post strong growth. International Delight sales increased in the low-double digits and market share continued to expand on the strength of continued strong category growth, our coffee house inspiration innovations and strong base business. Our new more indulgent Barbe's products are hitting the shelves now and we look forward to continued strong innovation-led growth behind this launch. Also in the quarter are more traditional Land O'Lakes creamer sales grew in the mid-single digits. Our plant-based beverage businesses of Silk and Alpro continue to perform well in the strength of our new Silk Pure Almond product. Overall, Silk net sales increased in the mid-single digits. 
The introduction of Silk Pure Almond has been a clear success as almond-based beverages now account for more than a quarter of the plant-based beverage category, and Pure Almond share within this segment is approaching 50%. We plan to continue to innovate in the category with additional products in 2011.  Alpro volumes and sales in the quarter increased high single digits on a constant currency basis and were roughly flat after currency translations.
This healthy growth across the top line drove 10% growth in segment operating income to $39 million. Flow-through from the top line was strong but would have been stronger if not for mounting production capacity constraints in the business that are driving increased outsourcing of manufacturing and higher distribution expenses. As we look ahead, we'll address these constraints by spending capital to increase production capacity at WhiteWave. Overall, this strength of our branded business continues. We expect a solid finish to the year in this business and continued momentum as we look ahead to the next.
Before turning the call over to Jack to discuss corporate items, I'd like to first comment on our outlook. Looking at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, in the near term, we expect this business to remain challenged as the retail environment continues to be very competitive and volumes across much of the portfolio remains soft. We expect a continuation of these pressures through the fourth quarter and into next year. Price concessions that have already been given will continue to impact year-over-year comparisons into 2011 regardless of whether we see a return to historical private-label retail pricing levels or not. As I mentioned, in order to offset these concessions, we will continue to intensely focus on our cost reduction efforts. I'm confident that in time we'll be able to get in front of the cost price squeeze in a way that will be difficult for our competitors to follow.
At WhiteWave-Alpro we expect the strong performance we've seen all year to continue to the fourth quarter, when our Creamers business typically does seasonally well. Given our run rate as we exited the third quarter, but keeping in mind the typical strong seasonality of Q4, we expect fourth quarter earnings of between $0.13 and $0.18 per adjusted diluted share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack. Jack?"

I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items. Corporate expense of $53 million was essentially in line with year-ago levels and down a bit from the second quarter of this year. Headcount within the corporate center declined 5% in the quarter and we expect headcount to continue to decline over the next several quarters as we begin to rollout the G&A-focused portion of our cost reduction program. 
Now let me turn to consolidated Dean results. With stronger WhiteWave-Alpro results offset by weakness at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, our consolidated gross profit decline $36 million from a year ago to $750 million. Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased $18 million over the year-ago period. Solid cost control was more than offset by the impact of higher fuel and freight cost across the business, especially at WhiteWave and part due to the capacity constrains that Gregg just discussed. And this line was also impact by the operating expenses related to the Heartland acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Total company G&A on an adjusted basis, which excludes the year-ago impact of DLCs was down modestly. Driving operating cost leverage continues to be an area of focus going forward and a key to offsetting the margin pressures across the business. In total, the heightened pressures on the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business more than offset our cost control progress in a strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro resulting in third quarter consolidated operating income that was 35% below year-ago results at $103 million.
Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $5 million from the year-ago period as a result of higher average interest rates related to the amendment and extension of our senior credit facilities earlier this year. Net income of $23 million drove third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.13.
Now before turning the call back over to Gregg, I'd like to make one last comment. You may have seen the announcement this morning that I am leaving Dean in a couple of weeks for another opportunity. This was a very hard decision for me. Over the past four and a half years, the challenge of transforming Dean from a role up to a more integrated operating company has been exhilarating. Today, the capability and plans are in place to accelerate structural cost reduction, realign our sales organization to ensure one face to the customer and continue the growth of the WhiteWave-Alpro business, which is now almost $2 billion. 
Overall, I am quite confident that this team will work through the current marketplace challenges and is building a much stronger Dean Foods. I know the finance organization and its leadership team now under Shaun Mara is now well positioned to step up its contribution. I am committed to delivering a seamless a transition as possible. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Gregg. Gregg?"
34883,114812954,86861,"Dean Foods Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Dean Foods Company","Executives","Thanks, Jack. In spite of the recent challenges to our P&L, cash flows remained strong in our business. Net cash from continuing operations through the third quarter of this year was $379 million. Subtracting net capital expenditures of $180 million from",631,"Thanks, Jack. In spite of the recent challenges to our P&L, cash flows remained strong in our business. Net cash from continuing operations through the third quarter of this year was $379 million. Subtracting net capital expenditures of $180 million from this, yields free cash flow of $199 million for the first nine months of this year. Since the completion of the Alpro acquisition in July of last year, we've generated $342 million in free cash flow, contributing to a significant reduction in debt since that time. 
To further support the generation of free cash flow and our debt pay-down efforts, we continue to aggressively manage working capital. Our cash conversion cycle decreased approximately three days from the year-ago period despite Class I milk and Class II butterfat prices averaging 50% and 70% higher, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Total outstanding net debt at quarter end stood at just under $4 billion, down $109 million from last quarter. As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt-to-EBITDA as defined by our credit agreements stepped up the bit this quarter despite continued debt reduction. This was due to the impact of reduced EBITDA in quarter three 2010 versus quarter three 2009. As of the end of the quarter our leverage ratio stood at 4.9x. 
We maintained strong liquidity with over $1.3 billion of currently available liquidity under our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. Earlier this year, we modified our covenant structure to allow more for flexibility as we invest capital to drive our long-term strategies and weather the challenging economic and competitive environment. As a reminder, our revised leverage covenant ratio is 5.5x. The covenant steps down to 5x on June 30 of 2011. We're monitoring our covenant compliance closely and plan to continue to balance capital spending against our debt pay-down objectives to maintain appropriate flexibility. 
Also, given recent results we're evaluating options to further align our balance sheet with the strategic and investment needs of the business, and to ensure adequate flexibility under our covenants. With this in mind, we expect capital spending of $300 million this year reflecting spend on high return investments behind our strategic priorities to drive to absolute lowest cost in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, as well as initial investments in capacity to support the strong growth at WhiteWave Alpro. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to improving these results. Our industry is going through a wrenching ordeal. We've made solid progress on our cost agenda but these ongoing pressures make it clear we need to accelerate our efforts. And we're doing just that. We're also working to build much needed capability including the improvement of our pricing and forecasting capabilities to drive more predictability in our results. These things take time and we appreciate your patience. I'm confident that will be able to get ahead of these market pressures, competitively differentiate ourselves across several spectrums and return to strong earnings growth trajectory.
Before I wrap up, I also want to take a moment to comment on Jack's upcoming departure. I want to publicly thank Jack for all of his contributions to Dean Foods. We're a much more capable company today than when Jack arrived. He helped bring a new level of rigor to our organization, centralize much of finance and help lead the strategic thinking that will drive our success in the future. He also conscientiously recruited and developed a deep bench of executive talent beneath him. Shaun Mara is a strong and capable leader and we look forward to his contributions to the company as he takes the baton from Jack later this month. Thank you, Jack. 
With that, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today on the call and ask the operator to open up the phones for questions."

First of all, you have the ongoing effect of concessions that have been made from period-to-period in private-label pricing, so the price between us and our customers. We continue to see downward pressure on pricing in the category and so you have an accumulation of lower prices as contracts have been renegotiated, really, over the last four or five quarters. So that is clearly one impact. Another significant impact in driving lower profitability in the quarter is frankly, we missed the volume here and we missed it pretty significantly. So through July of this year or in July, we had volumes actually up about 1% period-over-period. But we saw a very significant fall off in volumes particularly at retail which is the most efficient gallon-oriented part of our business, wherefore the total quarter volumes at retail ended up down almost 4%. So we had a significantly delevered manufacturing and distribution network over the back half of the quarter, and really see somewhat surprising softness in the category of fluid milk in the back half. So those are really the two big drivers as it relates to gallons of milk. The other factor that gets embedded in our FDD-Morningstar results that really doesn't get disaggregated is that about 2/3 of our business is liquid milk, the other 1/3 is largely comprised of Class II items, whether those are ice cream, cultured products, creams and creamers. And there we had a very significant spike up in the cost of raw materials throughout the third quarter that frankly resulted in somewhere on the order of $0.04 of unanticipated costs, a four net cents of earnings per share in our Class II businesses during the period. So those are really the big items."

We've got 100 manufacturing plants in the FDD-Morningstar network, rough numbers. And if you start walking away from meaningful amounts of volume, you're going to have a lot of stranded fixed cost in the business. So we need the volume that we've got in order to successfully pursue and complete this transformation agenda we have of getting structural cost out of the business. And the fact of the matter remains that while we're not making as much, we're still making money in the volume that we're retaining. So we're not retaining this money at loss-making margins or this volume, we're retaining it at smaller profit margins. So the industry is going through a big shakeout and it's, I think, the die is cast. It's got to go through this shakeout in order for it to return to any level of sort of sustainable healthy profitability and growth. And we're going to lead the transformation of this industry.

We are not further integrating WhiteWave with FDD-Morningstar. My commentary around organizational structure is that we are further integrating FDD and Morningstar which reside within the same segment. So apparently, that wasn't clear enough in our prepared comments but we have quite separate businesses between WhiteWave and Alpro. And it's important that we maintain quite separate businesses for lots of reasons. First of all, they're quite different and secondly, to your point, perfectly appropriately it allows us to maintain strategic flexibility to make decisions in the future that will maximize value for our shareholders. So I would just point out a couple of things with respect to the WhiteWave-Alpro portion of your comments. First of all, trust me, we get it. Where the values are in the business and we have a pretty keen sense of whether or not WhiteWave-Alpro is adequately reflected in our valuation. So we understand those dynamics. But I would also point out that to the extent we're creating value over time and driving operating income growth and ultimately value creation in our share price, is happening in WhiteWave-Alpro today as opposed to FDD-Morningstar. So for the long-term benefit of our current shareholders, owning WhiteWave-Alpro is a value-creating mechanism. The third thing I would point out is that these source of corporate structural activities that you allude to often come with a host of other cost complexities that aren't readily apparent on the surface. So for the time being, WhiteWave-Alpro is an important value-creating asset within the portfolio of Dean Foods. It is managed quite separately and is separable, and we're keenly aware of all the valuation issues that you're discussing."

I mentioned to you that volumes in our milk business in the back half of the quarter were down significantly. Well when our milk volumes are down, our production of butterfat is down, right? Because we're skimming butterfat out of milk that we sell, so we produce meaningfully less butterfat in Q3 than we had planned. So we bought much more butterfat outside the business and at much higher prices. And on top of that, we have this very, very hot summer in the United States. And in hot weather, cow's drink a lot of milk and they produce less butterfat per gallon. So the butterfat content of the milk that we received was lower than typical. So that drove really the spike in butterfat, with less availability of fat throughout the marketplace and we had sort of the double whammy of fat production internally. So there was a little bit of an odd anomalous Q3 as it relate to the butterfat, but really drove our cost up."

Just the way the pricing mechanisms work here, we do better when the price is falling because there's just some lag in the business and we suffer a little bit on the back half as the price rises. So we'll get some benefit as we always do in a falling commodity environment in the first half of 2011.

And it's hard to see in our capacity as well if you're not in the company. But I would say there's enough to have caused very significant price compression as we have moved into this recession with a very aggressive customer base on price. We do see signs that people are recognizing that they need less capacity in their own businesses. So we see industry volumes down to 1.5% to 2%. If you just look at our FDD milk business, we've got 100 plants. That means that net-net, as that volume has gone out, idled two entire facilities that I just don't need in this lower volume environment, and I've been taking share. So if the rest of the industry has 300 plants out there among the rest of the fluid milk segment and they're down 3% or 4% in terms of fluid milk volumes, then there is 10 to 12 plants that's been idle just by the decrease in volume. And there was other additional capacity when we went into this thing. So there's plenty of idle capacity out there that needs to come out. And we're seeing the signs that people are coming to grips with the fact that this situation is not going to abate like it has in the recent past. And people need to get their capacities right.

How I would characterize it is that this ball got rolling down the hill with lots of energy as a result of changes in the retail environment. So a recession consumers seeking value, retailers seeking to show value to their customers with key value items. And it often does, it starts with a few big retailers or a few new entrants and we have some each of those in the grocery category that gets things moving downhill. So when they get moving downhill, then there are collateral effects. And so as the retail price environment deteriorated, you get responses from the entire retail community now trying to stay in value and match. And then you get price pressure back up the supply chain with retailers looking for help in funding this strategy. So in that environment, you get a bit of a churning of the pot in which the buying community, the retail community, is leveraging the excess capacity that exists, and it exists throughout everybody's network. And now manufacturers, back to Judy Hong's point, start focusing on the fact that they got fixed cost infrastructure that they got it covered, and they compete to retain volume. So that's the basic dynamic. It started with the retail environment and it's rippled back into the processor environment. We really don't see, even with these changes in ownership of other processors, we don't see people actively seeking to grow their share, right? People are trying to hold volume in their facilities and then in declining category, ultimately that means growing share a little bit because there's less volume for everybody. So if you want to hold your volume, you got to take a little share. But we don't see people actively initiating lower pricing around the environment. It's more responsive. Let's not say it doesn't happen at all, again it's not black and white, but these plants are in fixed geographies and they can serve fixed markets and customer bases and people maybe look a little farther afield from their plants, but I think the processing industry is in a very reactive mode right now."

When I compare this quarter in terms of operating profit per gallon to the worst other one I've seen on record which would have Q2 '07.

I think you have to look at the flip side of the total profit pool as you look between retailers and processors. And that is the size of the investment that retailers have made in this industry is the encountering factor to keep in processors aggressive, right? Retailers have made significant investments over the last 12-plus months in this business and they're trying to recover some of that investment from processors. Processors are sitting with stranded fixed cost, so they're doing whatever they can do to hold onto their volumes. So they're being very aggressive from a price standpoint in order to avoid further deleverage. So I think, as Gregg commented, processor are not out trying to take other processors volumes. They're just trying to hold onto their own volume with retailers trying to extract concessions from the processor community. So that's the countering force in the overall profitability draining and the processor industry. Retailers are still trying to recover some profit pool. I think when you start seeing that abate, when they're investments starts becoming less, then you'll see a little of the pressure taken off processors. And I think you'll see margin start to stabilize on the processor side of the business."

As you have seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million, or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges in our largest business, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.
Despite our poor consolidated performance, WhiteWave-Alpro continued to perform exceptionally well and delivered significant top and bottom-line growth. However, given the relative size of the business, it was not enough to offset weakness in the much larger Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar segment. As we’ve noted on previous calls, our core dairy business’ performance has suffered material margin pressure from the fundamental adverse shifts in the market pricing of private label milk and its related fallout.
More recently, two other factors have impacted our business. We have experienced weakness in milk category volumes and other beverage and cultured product categories within Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Butterfat costs also spiked to unexpectedly high levels in Q3, which further compressed segment operating performance.
In light of these results, we continue to take aggressive steps to improve our results at FDD-Morningstar, including accelerated cost reductions and, as we recently announced a realignment of the management and organization of the business. With that overview, let me drill down a bit into each of the businesses starting with Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.
Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar gross profits declined $44 million from the year-ago period. While the issues impacting results are much the same as we’ve been dealing with for the past year or so, the relative magnitude has changed a bit. The pricing pressures on the core dairy business that began last year continued through the third quarter.
To attract customers in a tough climate, retailers have priced gallons of private label milk at deep discounts. The margin over milk metric on the right of this chart that tracks the spread between retail pricing of private label gallons of milk and the government-mandated Class I mover price remains essentially unchanged from prior periods, $0.40 to $0.50 a gallon below historical levels.
This continues to impact the processing industry in two ways. First, it drives ongoing pricing pressure from processors, such as Dean, as retailers look to reduce their costs across the category. Volume-hungry competitors have bid aggressively for available business, and contact renegotiations have been widespread. So far we have successfully maintained and even grown our share. However, this competitive intensity has resulted in broad-based price concessions.
The result of this pressure on our P&L accounted for the lion’s share of the year-over-year decline in segment gross profits in the quarter. The heavy competition in the marketplace will likely continue to impact the processing industry profits for some time to come.
Second, deeply discounted retail prices for private label milk have widened gaps between our more profitable regional brands and private labels. Although the year-over-year impact has lessened, consumers looking for value have continued to trade down to private label, and our product mix continues to deteriorate as a result.
In addition to our challenges in the fluid milk category, we have begun to experience volume weakness across the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio. These factors, combined with the impact of steep butterfat inflation in the quarter, drove our operating income dip this period.
In spite of continued aggressive private label pricing, volume weakness in the fluid milk category that we began to see in the second quarter continued through the third. Part of this weakness can be explained by very aggressive promotion and low milk prices in the year-ago period Q3 2009, during which retailer feature ads in the category were more than twice as abundant as and much more productive than this year.
But we also continue to see intra-month trends of declining volumes throughout each month, indicative of cash-strapped customers. It is clear that a significant segment of consumers are not just looking for value pricing, they are cutting back on purchases of even basic items. These trends have had a pronounced impact on the fluid milk category, which has slowed considerably.
Fluid milk volumes across IRI-measured channels were down more than 3.5% in the quarter from a year ago. Across all channels, total USDA fluid milk volumes declined approximately 1.6% in the quarter. Within this, our fluid milk volume growth has weakened from approximately 2% growth earlier in the year to essentially flat in the last two quarters.
We began the quarter with volume growth of over 1% in July, but volumes were down significantly in both August and September. We estimate that our competitors’ volumes have been down more than 2.5% for the year, exacerbating the competitive intensity in the marketplace. While all volumes have outperformed the balance of the industry for some time, as we lap the Heartland acquisition in early Q4, we believe our volume performance will likely converge with the overall market.
As I mentioned, outside the fluid milk category, our product volumes in the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio have also experienced widespread softness, declining 6% in aggregate. Our other beverage products, including juice, tea and water, declined mid-single digits. Cultured products declined more than 10%. Creamers declined low single digits. And the ice cream category was also soft in the quarter. In total, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar volumes declined 2% in the third quarter.
The negative effect of this volume softness was amplified by the dramatic increase in Class II butterfat costs in the quarter, which created additional pressure on gross profits. Class II butterfat averaged $2.12 per pound in the quarter, and increased 70% from the year-ago period and more than 25% above the second quarter. As a reminder, Class II butterfat is a key input in our creamer, cultured and ice cream products businesses, where the pass-through of changes in input costs is less efficient than fluid milk.
The continued gross margin pressure on the business, higher fuel costs and increased bad debt expenses all contributed to drive segment operating profit well below year-ago levels at $116 million. Without question, our best strategy to combat this continued P&L pressure is to relentlessly focus on permanently reducing structural costs. Our teams have made great progress on this initiative with $175 million in projected cost savings from the beginning of 2009 through the end of this year.
We’re committed to becoming a differentiated, low-cost operation and are accelerating our efforts toward achieving our goal of $300 million of cost savings by the end of 2011, year three of our original three to five year target. Following completion of our initial goal, we then expect to drive at least $100 million in additional costs from the business each year for the next three to five years.
We’ve driven progress on our cost initiatives in all of our targeted areas. Total head count in the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business is down more than 1,000 positions in 2010 alone. Better technology has enabled the reduction of nearly 500 delivery routes since the beginning of 2009. Over the same period, fuel usage is down 4%, despite acquisitions. We’ve closed five facilities over that time, including one this year. Improved purchasing has produced more than $28 million in annual procurement savings.
Going forward, we’re expanding on these efforts in additional areas like the G&A cost initiative we recently announced, which we expect to drive $30 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. We are also targeting reductions in milk procurement costs through improved logistics and in-sourcing those activities where it makes sense.
You should also expect a material increase in our network optimization efforts over the coming years, as we drive cost out of our system through remaking our manufacturing network. Stated simply, accelerated cost reduction continues to be the number one priority for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Creating a differentiated cost position is critical to the long-term success of the business. As a management team and as an organization, we are aligned on this priority with a number of initiatives focused on permanently reducing structural cost to stabilize and then rebuild the profitability of Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.
In addition to reducing costs, we think we can achieve substantial benefits by attacking the marketplace in a more integrated manner. To that end, we recently announced key executive changes that realign our organizational structure; an approach that we believe will make us more nimble and enhance our go to market strategy. As many of you saw, we recently created the role of Chief Commercial Officer with Chris Sliva, who was previously the President of our Morningstar division, assuming this post.
Chris will have responsibility for directing the commercial strategy of both the Fresh Dairy Direct and Morningstar divisions. This move is consistent with a broader initiative to tighten the alignment of the company’s sales organization, commercial lines of business and customer relationships, providing greater visibility, flexibility, efficiency and accountability. This is the first step in removing many of the artificial barriers that have historically existed between these two highly related businesses. Our goal is to go to customers with one Dean Face and to act that way all the way through the supply chain.
Let me now turn to our other segment, WhiteWave-Alpro. In contrast to our results at FDD-Morningstar, our WhiteWave-Alpro branded segment continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, driven by solid top-line sales. Third quarter segment net sales increased 8% over last year to $478 million, reflecting broad growth across the portfolio. Consistent with the first two quarters of this year, all of our key brands continued to drive solid volume-led sales growth in the quarter. Horizon Organic milk had an especially strong quarter, with growth in the high teens driven by our differentiated product offerings and continued solid category growth. Horizon has continued to outperform the category and gain additional share.
Our creamers business, led by International Delight, also continued to post strong growth. International Delight sales increased in the low double digits and market share continued to expand on the strength of continued strong category growth, our CoffeeHouse Inspiration innovations and strong base business. Our new, more indulgent Breve products are hitting the shelves now, and we look forward to continued strong innovation-led growth behind this launch.
Also in the quarter, our more traditional Land O’Lakes creamer sales grew in the mid-single digits. Our plant-based beverage businesses of Silk and Alpro continued to perform well on the strength of our new Silk PureAlmond product. Overall, Silk net sales increased in the mid-single digits. The introduction of Silk PureAlmond has been a clear success, as almond-based beverages now account for more than a quarter of the plant-based beverage category. And PureAlmond’s share within this segment is approaching 50%.
We plan to continue to innovate in the category with additional products in 2011. Alpro volumes and sales in the quarter increased high single digits on a constant-currency basis and were roughly flat after currency translation. This healthy growth across the top-line drove 10% growth in segment operating income to $39 million. Flow-through from the top-line was strong, but would have been stronger if not for mounting production capacity constraints in the business that are driving increased outsourcing of manufacturing and higher distribution expenses.
As we look ahead, we will address these constraints by spending capital to increase production capacity at WhiteWave. Overall, the strength of our branded business continues. We expect a solid finish to the year in this business and continued momentum as we look ahead to the next.
Before turning the call over to Jack to discuss corporate items, I’d like to first comment on our outlook. Looking at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, in the near term we expect this business to remain challenged as the retail environment continues to be very competitive and volumes across much of the portfolio remain soft. We expect a continuation of these pressures through the fourth quarter and into next year. Price concessions that have already been given will continue to impact year-over-year comparisons into 2011, regardless of whether we see a return to historical private label retail pricing levels or not.
As I mentioned, in order to offset these concessions, we will continue to intensely focus on our cost reduction efforts. I am confident that in time we will be able to get in front of the cost price squeeze in a way that will be difficult for our competitors to follow.
At WhiteWave-Alpro we expect the strong performance we’ve seen all year to continue through the fourth quarter when our creamer’s business typically does seasonally well. Given our run rate as we exited the third quarter and keeping in mind the typical strong seasonality of Q4, we expect fourth quarter earnings of between $0.13 and $0.18 per adjusted diluted share.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jack. Jack?

I’ll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items. Corporate expense of 53 million was essentially in line with year-ago levels and down a bit from the second quarter of this year. Headcount within the Corporate Center declined 5% in the quarter. And we expect head count to continue to decline over the next several quarters as we begin to roll out the G&A-focused portion of our cost reduction program.
Now let me turn to consolidated Dean results. With stronger WhiteWave-Alpro results offset by weakness at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, our consolidated gross profit declined $36 million from a year ago to 750 million. Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased 18 million over the year-ago period.
Solid cost control was more than offset by the impact of higher fuel and freight costs across the business, especially at WhiteWave, in part due to the capacity constraints that Gregg just discussed. And this line was also impacted by the operating expenses related to the Heartland acquisition that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Total company G&A on an adjusted basis, which excludes the year-ago impact of deal fees, was down modestly. Driving operating costs leverage continues to be an area of focus going forward and a key to offsetting the margin pressures across the business.
In total, the heightened pressures on the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business more than offset our cost control progress and the strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro, resulting in third quarter consolidated operating income that was 35% below year-ago results at 103 million.
Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $5 million from the year-ago period as a result of higher average interest rates related to the amendment and extension of our senior credit facilities earlier this year. Net income of 23 million drove third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.13.
Now before turning the call back over to Gregg, I’d like to make one last comment. You may have seen the announcement this morning that I am leaving Dean in a couple of weeks for another opportunity. This was a very hard decision for me. Over the past four and a half years, the challenge of transforming Dean from a roll-up to a more integrated operating company has been exhilarating.
Today, the capability and plans are in place to accelerate structural cost reduction, realign our sales organization to ensure one face to the customer, and continue the growth of the WhiteWave-Alpro business, which is now almost $2 billion.
Overall, I am quite confident that this team will work through the current marketplace challenges and is building a much stronger Dean Foods. I know the Finance organization and its leadership team, now under Shaun Mara, is now well positioned to step up its contribution. I am committed to delivering as seamless a transition as possible.
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Gregg. Gregg?

Net cash from continuing operations through the third quarter of this year was $379 million. Subtracting net capital expenditures of $180 million from this yields free cash flow of $199 million for the first nine months of this year. Since the completion of the Alpro acquisition in July of last year, we have generated $342 million in free cash flow, contributing to a significant reduction in debt since that time.
To further support the generation of free cash flow and our debt pay-down efforts, we continue to aggressively manage working capital. Our cash conversion cycle decreased approximately three days from the year-ago period, despite Class I milk and Class II butterfat prices averaging 50% and 70% higher, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Total outstanding net debt at quarter-end stood at just under $4 billion, down $109 million from last quarter.
As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA, as defined by our credit agreement, stepped up a bit this quarter despite continued debt reduction. This was due to the impact of reduced EBITDA in quarter three 2010 versus quarter three 2009. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.9 times. We maintain strong liquidity with over $1.3 billion of currently available liquidity under our accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facilities.
Earlier this year, we modified our covenant structure to allow more flexibility as we invest capital to drive our long-term strategies and weather the challenging economic and competitive environment. As a reminder, our revised leverage covenant ratio is 5.5 times. The covenant steps down to 5 times on June 30 of 2011. We are monitoring our covenant compliance closely and plan to continue to balance capital spending against our debt pay-down objectives to maintain appropriate flexibility.
Also, given recent results, we are evaluating options to further align our balance sheet with the strategic and investment needs of the business and to ensure adequate flexibility under our covenants. With this in mind, we expect capital spending of $300 million this year, reflecting spend on high return investments behind our strategic priorities to drive to absolute lowest costs in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, as well as initial investments in capacity to support the strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro.
I want to reiterate our commitment to improving these results. Our industry is going through a wrenching ordeal. We’ve made solid progress on our cost agenda, but these ongoing pressures make it clear we need to accelerate our efforts, and we’re doing just that. We’re also working to build much needed capability, including the improvement of our pricing and forecasting capabilities to drive more predictability in our results. These things take time and we appreciate your patience.
I’m confident that we’ll be able to get ahead of these market pressures, competitively differentiate ourselves across several spectrums and return to strong earnings growth trajectory.
Before I wrap up, I also wanted to take a moment to comment on Jack’s upcoming departure. I want to publicly thank Jack for all of his contributions to Dean Foods. We’re a much more capable company today than when Jack arrived. He helped bring a new level of rigor to our organization, centralize much of Finance, and helped lead the strategic thinking that will drive our success in the future. He also conscientiously recruited and developed a deep bench of executive talent beneath him. Shaun Mara is a strong and capable leader, and we look forward to his contributions to the company as he takes the baton from Jack later this month. Thank you, Jack.

First of all, you have the ongoing effect of concessions that have been made from period to period in private label pricing, so the price between us and our customers. We continue to see downward pressure on pricing in the category and so you have an accumulation of lower prices as contracts have been renegotiated really over the last four or five quarters.
So that is clearly one impact. Another significant impact in driving lower profitability in the quarter is, frankly, we missed the volume here and we missed it pretty significantly. So through July of this year, or in July, we had volumes actually up about 1% period-over-period, but we saw very a significant fall off in volumes, particularly at retail, which is the most efficient gallon-oriented part of our business, where for the total quarter, volumes at retail ended up down almost 4%.
So we had a significantly de-levered manufacturing and distribution network over the back half of the quarter. And see some somewhat surprising softness in the category of fluid milk in the back half. So those are really the two big drivers as it relates to gallons of milk.
The other factor that gets embedded in our FDD-Morningstar results that really doesn’t get disaggregated is that about two-thirds of our business is liquid milk. The other third is largely comprised of Class II items, whether those are ice cream, cultured products, creams and creamers. And there we had a very significant spike-up in the cost of raw materials throughout the third quarter that, frankly, resulted in somewhere on the order of $0.04 of unanticipated costs $0.04 net of earnings per share in our Class II businesses during the period. So those are really the big items.

We’ve got 100 manufacturing plants in the FDD-Morningstar network, rough numbers. And if you start walking away from meaningful amounts of volume, you’re going to have a lot of stranded fixed cost in the business. So we need the volume that we’ve got in order to successfully pursue and complete this transformation agenda we have of getting structural cost out of the business. And the fact of the matter remains that, while we’re not making as much, we’re still making money in the volume that we’re retaining.
So we’re not retaining this money at loss making margins or this volume. We’re retaining it at smaller profit margins. So the industry is going through a big shake out, and it’s I think the die is cast. It’s got to go through this shake out in order for it to return to any level of sustainable healthy profitability and growth. And we’re going to lead the transformation of this industry, and in order to do so, I think you’ll see us hold our share.

We are not further integrating WhiteWave with FDD-Morningstar. My commentary around organizational structure is that we are further integrating FDD and Morningstar, which reside within the same segment.
So apparently that wasn’t clear enough in our prepared comments, but we have quite separate businesses between WhiteWave and Alpro. And it’s important that we maintain quite separate businesses for lots of reasons. First of all, they are quite different. And secondly, to your point, perfectly appropriately, it allows us to maintain strategic flexibility to make decisions in the future that will maximize value for our shareholders.
So I would just point out a couple of things with respect to the WhiteWave-Alpro portion of your comments. First of all, trust me, we get it where the values are in the business and we have a pretty keen sense of whether or not WhiteWave-Alpro is adequately reflected in our valuation. So we understand those dynamics. But I would also point out that to the extent we are creating value over time and driving operating income growth and ultimately value creation in our share price, it’s happening in WhiteWave-Alpro today as opposed to FDD-Morningstar.
So for the long-term benefit of our current shareholders owning WhiteWave-Alpro is a value creating mechanism. The third thing I would point out is that these sorts of corporate structural activities that you allude to often come with a host of other costs and complexities that aren’t readily apparent on the surface. So for the time being, WhiteWave-Alpro is an important value creating asset within the portfolio of Dean Foods. It is managed quite separately and is separable, and we are keenly aware of all of the valuation issues that you’re discussing.

So, but I would say there is enough to have caused very significant price compression as we’ve moved into this recession with a very aggressive customer base on price. We do see signs that people are recognizing that they need less capacity in their own businesses. So we see industry volumes down 1.5% to 2%.
If you just look at our FDD milk business, we’ve got 100 plants. That means that net-net as that volume’s gone out, I’ve idled two entire facilities that I just don’t need in this lower volume environment and I’ve been taking share. So if the rest of the industry has 300 plants out there among the rest of the fluid milk segment and they’re down 3% or 4% in terms of fluid milk volumes, then there is 10 to 12 plants that’s been idled just by the decrease in volume and there was other additional capacity when we went into this thing.
So there is plenty of idle capacity out there that needs to come out and we’re seeing the signs that people are coming to grips with the fact that this situation is not going to abate like it has in the recent past and people need to get their capacities right.

Cheese is starting to move down, so we fully expect the mover to come down the Class I mover, driven by both fat and skim, through the next say, five to six months. Then we expect it to bottom. This is our preliminary view sometime in Q2 of next year and start heading back up to around these same levels. So that’s the overall view of the Class I mover from where we sit today going forward.

No, I think the primary logic train there is that you’re seeing significant increases in input costs for farmers, right. So you’re seeing the grain complexes because of the global markets and quantitative easing, growth in the emerging or recently emerged marketplaces, putting upward pressure on grain supplies. Most of the cows in the US are fed, not grazed, so farmers’ costs are increasing significantly. And as opposed to maybe the last cycle like this in ‘07,’08, you have farmer balance sheets in much worse condition than they were going into ‘07. So the logic train is capacity comes out on the farm side much more quickly this time than it did last time and that drives a more rapid rebound in the cost of milk in the back half of 2011. That’s the logic.

How I would characterize it is that this ball got rolling down the hill with lots of energy as a result of changes in the retail environment. So a recession, consumers seeking value, retailers thinking to show value to their customers with key value items and, as it often does, it starts with a few big retailers or a few new entrants, and we have some of each of those in the grocery category that get things moving downhill. So when they get moving downhill, then there are collateral effects. And so as the retail price environment deteriorated, you get responses from the entire retail community now trying to stay in value and match. And then you get a price pressure back up the supply chain with retailers looking for help in funding this strategy.
So in that environment you get a bit of a churning of the pot in which the buying community, the retail community, is leveraging the excess capacity that exists. And it exists throughout everybody’s network. And now manufacturers, back to Judy Hong’s point, start focusing on the fact that they’ve got fixed cost infrastructure that they’ve got to cover and they compete to retain volume. So that’s the basic dynamic.
It started with the retail environment, and its rippled back into the processor environment. We really don’t see even with these changes in ownership of other processors, we don’t see people actively seeking to grow their share, right. People are trying to hold volume in their facilities, and in a declining category, ultimately that means growing share a little bit, because there is less volume for everybody. So if you want to hold your volume, you’ve got to take a little share. But we don’t see people actively initiating lower pricing around the environment. It’s more responsive. That’s not to say it doesn’t happen at all. Again, it’s not black and white.
But these plants are in fixed geographies and they can serve fixed markets and customer bases, and people maybe look a little farther afield from their plants. But I think the processing industry is in a very reactive mode right now.

I think you have to look at the flip side of the total profit pool as you look between retailers and processors and that is the size of the investment that retailers have made in this industry is the countering factor to keeping processors aggressive, right.
Retailers have made significant investments over the last 12 plus months in this business and they’re trying to recover some of that investment from processors. Processors are sitting with stranded fixed costs, so they’re doing whatever they can do to hold onto their volume. So they’re being very aggressive from a price standpoint in order to avoid further de-leverage.
So I think, as Gregg commented, people aren’t processors are not out trying to take other processor’s volumes. They are just trying to hold onto their own volume with retailers trying to extract concessions from the processor community. So that’s the countering force in the overall profitability drain in the processor industry, retailers still trying to recover some profit pool. I think when you start seeing that abate, when their investment starts becoming less, then you’ll see a little of the pressure taken off processors and I think you’ll see margins start to stabilize on the processor side of the business.

The industry has always gone through ups and downs. And the downs have always been followed within relatively short order by ups, usually driven by the commodity cycle.

As you've seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges",2115,"Thank you, Barry, and thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. As you've seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges in our largest business, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Despite our poor consolidated performance, WhiteWave-Alpro continued to perform exceptionally well and delivered significant top and bottom-line growth. However, given the relative size of the business, it was not enough to offset weakness in the much larger Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar segment. 
As we've noted on previous calls, our core dairy business’ performance has suffered material margin pressure from the fundamental adverse shifts in the market pricing of private-label milk and its related fallout. More recently, two other factors have impacted our business. We've experienced weakness in milk category volumes and other beverage and cultured product categories within Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Butterfat costs also spiked to unexpectedly high levels in Q3, which further compressed segment operating performance. In light of these results, we continue to take aggressive steps to improve our result at FDD-Morningstar including accelerated cost reductions and, as we recently announced, a realignment of the management and organization of the business.
With that overview, let me drill down a bit into each of the businesses, starting with Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar gross profits declined $44 million from the year-ago period. While the issues impacting results are much the same as we've been dealing with for the past year or so, the relative magnitude has changed a bit. The pricing pressures on the core dairy business that began last year continued through the third quarter. To attract customers in a tough climate, retailers have priced gallons of private-label milk at deep discounts. The margin over milk metric on the right of this chart that tracks the spread between retail pricing of private-label gallons of milk and the government-mandated Class I Mover price remains essentially unchanged from prior periods, $0.40 to $0.50 a gallon below historical levels.  
This continues to impact the processing industry in two ways. First, it drives ongoing pricing pressure from processors such as Dean as retailers look to reduce their cost across the category. Volume-hungry competitors have bid aggressively for available business, and contract renegotiations have been widespread. So far, we have successfully maintained and even grown our share. However, this competitive intensity has resulted in broad-based price concessions. The result of this pressure on our P&L accounted for the lion’s share of the year-over-year decline and segment gross profits in the quarter. The heavy competition in the market place will likely continue to impact the processing industry profits for some time to come.
Second, deeply discounted retail prices for private-label milk have widened gaps between our more profitable regional brands and private labels. Although the year-over-year impact has lessened, consumers looking for value have continued to trade down to private-label, and our product mix continues to deteriorate as a result. In addition to our challenges in the fluid milk category, we have begun to experience volume weakness across the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio. These factors, combined with the impact of steep butterfat inflation in the quarter drove our operating income bis [ph] this period.
In spite of continued aggressive private-label pricing, volume weakness in the fluid milk category that we began to see in the second quarter continued through the third. Part of this weakness can be explained by very aggressive promotion and low milk prices in the year-ago period, Q3 2009, during which retailer feature ads in the category were more than twice as abundant and much more productive than this year. But we also continue to see increment [ph] trends of declining volumes throughout each month, indicative of cash-strapped customers. It is clear that a significant segment of consumers are not just looking for value pricing, they are cutting back on purchases of even basic items.
These trends have had a pronounced impact on the fluid milk category, which has slowed considerably. Fluid milk volumes across IRI-measured channels were down more than 3.5% in the quarter from a year ago. Across all channels, total USDA fluid milk volumes declined approximately 1.6% in the quarter. Within this, our fluid milk volume growth has weakened from approximately 2% growth earlier in the year to essentially flat in the last two quarters. We began the quarter with volume growth of over 1% in July, but volumes were down significantly in both August and September. We estimate that our competitors' volumes have been down more than 2.5% for the year, exacerbating the competitive intensity in the marketplace. 
While our volumes have outperformed the balance of the industry for some time, as we lapped the Heartland acquisition in early Q4, we believe our volume performance will likely converge with the overall market. As I mentioned, outside the fluid milk category, our product volumes in the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio have also experienced widespread softness, declining 6% in aggregate. Our other beverage products, including juice, tea and water, declined mid-single digits. Cultured products declined more than 10%, creamers declined low-single digits and the ice cream category was also soft in the quarter. 
In total, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar volumes declined 2% in the third quarter. The negative effect of this volume softness was amplified by the dramatic increase in Class II butterfat costs in the quarter, which created additional pressure on gross profits. Class II butterfat averaged $2.12 per pound in the quarter, an increase of 70% from the year-ago period and more than 25% above the second quarter. As a reminder, Class II butterfat is a key input in our creamer, cultured and ice cream product businesses, where the pass-through of changes and input cost is less efficient than fluid milk.
The continued gross margin pressure on the business, higher fuel costs and increased bad debt expenses all contributed to drive segment operating profit well below year-ago levels at $116 million. Without question, our best strategy to combat this continued P&L pressure is to relentlessly focus on permanently reducing structural costs. Our teams have made great progress on this initiative, with $175 million in projected cost savings from the beginning of 2009 through the end of this year. We're committed to becoming a differentiated, low-cost operation and are accelerating our efforts toward achieving our goal of $300 million of cost savings by the end of 2011, year three over our original three-to-five-year target. 
Following completion of our initial goal, we then expect to drive at least $100 million in additional cost from the business each year for the next three to five years. We've driven progress on our cost initiatives in all of our targeted areas. Total headcount in the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business is down more than 1,000 positions in 2010 alone. Better technology has enabled the reduction of nearly 500 delivery routes since the beginning of 2009. Over the same period, fuel usage is down 4%, despite acquisitions. We've closed five facilities over that time, including one this year. Improved purchasing has produced more than $28 million in annual procurement savings.
Going forward, we're expanding on these efforts in additional areas like the G&A cost initiative we recently announced, which we expect to drive $30 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. We're also targeting reductions in milk procurement costs to improve logistics and in-sourcing those activities where it makes sense. You should also expect a material increase in our network optimization efforts over the coming years as we drive cost out of our system through remaking our manufacturing network. Stated simply, accelerated cost reduction continues to be the number one priority for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Creating a differentiated cost position is critical to the long-term success of the business. As a management team and as an organization, we're aligned on this priority with a number of initiatives focused on permanently reducing structural costs to stabilize and then rebuild the profitability of Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.
In addition to reducing cost, we think we can achieve substantial benefits by attacking the marketplace in a more integrated manner. To that end, we recently announced key executive changes that realign our organizational structure, an approach that we believe will make us more nimble and enhance our go-to market strategy. As many of you saw, we recently created the role of Chief Commercial Officer with Chris Sliva, who was previously the President of our Morningstar Division, assuming this post. Chris will have responsibility for directing the commercial strategy of both the Fresh Dairy Direct and Morningstar Division's. This move is consistent with the broader initiative to tighten the alignment of the company's sales organization, commercial lines of business and customer relationships, providing greater visibility, flexibility, efficiency and accountability. This is the first step in removing many of the artificial barriers that have historically existed between these two highly related businesses. Our goal is to go to customers with one Dean face and to act that way, all the way to the supply chain.
Let me now turn to our other segments, WhiteWave-Alpro. In contrast to our results at FDD-Morningstar, our WhiteWave-Alpro branded segment continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, driven by solid top-line sales. Third quarter segment net sales increased 8% over last year to $478 million, reflecting broad growth across the portfolio. Consistent with the first two quarters of this year, all of our key brands continue to drive solid volume-led sales growth in the quarter. Horizon Organic milk had an especially strong quarter with growth in the high teens driven by our differentiated product offerings and continued solid category growth. Horizon has continued to outperform the category and gained additional share. 
Our Creamers business, led by International Delight, also continued to post strong growth. International Delight sales increased in the low-double digits and market share continued to expand on the strength of continued strong category growth, our coffee house inspiration innovations and strong base business. Our new, more indulgent Barbe's products are hitting the shelves now, and we look forward to continued strong, innovation-led growth behind this launch. Also in the quarter, our more traditional Land O'Lakes creamer sales grew in the mid-single digits. Our plant-based beverage businesses of Silk and Alpro continue to perform well in the strength of our new Silk PureAlmond product. Overall, Silk net sales increased in the mid-single digits. 
The introduction of Silk PureAlmond has been a clear success, as almond-based beverages now account for more than a quarter of the plant-based beverage category, and PureAlmond share within this segment is approaching 50%. We plan to continue to innovate in the category with additional products in 2011. Alpro volumes and sales in the quarter increased high single digits on a constant currency basis and were roughly flat after currency translations.
This healthy growth across the top line drove 10% growth in segment operating income to $39 million. Flow-through from the top line was strong but would have been stronger if not for mounting production capacity constraints in the business that are driving increased outsourcing of manufacturing and higher distribution expenses. As we look ahead, we'll address these constraints by spending capital to increase production capacity at WhiteWave. Overall, the strength of our branded business continues. We expect a solid finish to the year in this business and continued momentum as we look ahead to the next.
Before turning the call over to Jack to discuss corporate items, I'd like to first comment on our outlook. Looking at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, in the near term, we expect this business to remain challenged as the retail environment continues to be very competitive and volumes across much of the portfolio remain soft. We expect a continuation of these pressures through the fourth quarter and into next year. Price concessions that have already been given will continue to impact year-over-year comparisons into 2011, regardless of whether we see a return to historical private-label retail pricing levels or not. As I mentioned, in order to offset these concessions, we will continue to intensely focus on our cost-reduction efforts. I'm confident that in time, we'll be able to get in front of the cost-price squeeze in a way that will be difficult for our competitors to follow.
At WhiteWave-Alpro, we expect the strong performance we've seen all year to continue through the fourth quarter, when our Creamers business typically does seasonally well. Given our run rate as we exited the third quarter, but keeping in mind the typical strong seasonality of Q4, we expect fourth quarter earnings of between $0.13 and $0.18 per adjusted diluted share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack. Jack?"

I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items. Corporate expense of $53 million was essentially in line with year-ago levels and down a bit from the second quarter of this year. Headcount within the corporate center declined 5% in the quarter, and we expect headcount to continue to decline over the next several quarters as we begin to rollout the G&A-focused portion of our cost-reduction program. 
Now let me turn to consolidated Dean results. With stronger WhiteWave-Alpro results offset by weakness at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, our consolidated gross profit decline $36 million from a year ago to $750 million. Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased $18 million over the year-ago period. Solid cost control was more than offset by the impact of higher fuel and freight cost across the business, especially at WhiteWave, in part due to the capacity constrains that Gregg just discussed. And this line was also impact by the operating expenses related to the Heartland acquisition that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Total company G&A on an adjusted basis, which excludes the year-ago impact of DLCs, was down modestly. Driving operating cost leverage continues to be an area of focus going forward and a key to offsetting the margin pressures across the business. In total, the heightened pressures on the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business more than offset our cost control progress in a strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro, resulting in third quarter consolidated operating income that was 35% below year-ago results at $103 million.
Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $5 million from the year-ago period as a result of higher average interest rates related to the amendment and extension of our senior credit facilities earlier this year. Net income of $23 million drove third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.13.
Now before turning the call back over to Gregg, I'd like to make one last comment. You may have seen the announcement this morning that I am leaving Dean in a couple of weeks for another opportunity. This was a very hard decision for me. Over the past four and a half years, the challenge of transforming Dean from a roll-up to a more integrated operating company has been exhilarating. Today, the capability and plans are in place to accelerate structural cost reduction, realign our sales organization to ensure one face to the customer and continue the growth of the WhiteWave-Alpro business, which is now almost $2 billion. 
Overall, I am quite confident that this team will work through the current marketplace challenges and is building a much stronger Dean Foods. I know the finance organization and its leadership team, now under Shaun Mara, is now well positioned to step up its contribution. I am committed to delivering as seamless a transition as possible. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Gregg. Gregg?"

Net cash from continuing operations through the third quarter of this year was $379 million. Subtracting net capital expenditures of $180 million from this yields free cash flow of $199 million for the first nine months of this year. Since the completion of the Alpro acquisition in July of last year, we've generated $342 million in free cash flow, contributing to a significant reduction in debt since that time. 
To further support the generation of free cash flow and our debt pay-down efforts, we continue to aggressively manage working capital. Our cash conversion cycle decreased approximately three days from the year-ago period despite Class I milk and Class II butterfat prices averaging 50% and 70% higher, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Total outstanding net debt at quarter end stood at just under $4 billion, down $109 million from last quarter. As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt-to-EBITDA as defined by our credit agreements stepped up a bit this quarter despite continued debt reduction. This was due to the impact of reduced EBITDA in quarter three 2010 versus quarter three 2009. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.9x. 
We maintained strong liquidity with over $1.3 billion of currently available liquidity under our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. Earlier this year, we modified our covenant structure to allow more flexibility as we invest capital to drive our long-term strategies and weather the challenging economic and competitive environment. As a reminder, our revised leverage covenant ratio is 5.5x. The covenant steps down to 5x on June 30 of 2011. We're monitoring our covenant compliance closely and plan to continue to balance capital spending against our debt pay-down objectives to maintain appropriate flexibility. 
Also, given recent results, we're evaluating options to further align our balance sheet with the strategic and investment needs of the business and to ensure adequate flexibility under our covenants. With this in mind, we expect capital spending of $300 million this year, reflecting spend on high return investments behind our strategic priorities to drive to absolute lowest cost in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, as well as initial investments in capacity to support the strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to improving these results. Our industry is going through a wrenching ordeal. We've made solid progress on our cost agenda, but these ongoing pressures make it clear we need to accelerate our efforts. And we're doing just that. We're also working to build much-needed capability, including the improvement of our pricing and forecasting capabilities to drive more predictability in our results. These things take time, and we appreciate your patience. I'm confident that we’ll be able to get ahead of these market pressures, competitively differentiate ourselves across several spectrums and return to strong earnings growth trajectory.
Before I wrap up, I also want to take a moment to comment on Jack's upcoming departure. I want to publicly thank Jack for all of his contributions to Dean Foods. We're a much more capable company today than when Jack arrived. He helped bring a new level of rigor to our organization, centralize much of finance and help lead the strategic thinking that will drive our success in the future. He also conscientiously recruited and developed a deep bench of executive talent beneath him. Shaun Mara is a strong and capable leader, and we look forward to his contributions to the company as he takes the baton from Jack later this month. Thank you, Jack.

First of all, you have the ongoing effect of concessions that have been made from period to period in private-label pricing, so the price between us and our customers. We continue to see downward pressure on pricing in the category, and so you have an accumulation of lower prices as contracts have been renegotiated, really, over the last four or five quarters. So that is clearly one impact. Another significant impact in driving lower profitability in the quarter is, frankly, we missed the volume here, and we missed it pretty significantly. So through July of this year, or in July, we had volumes actually up about 1% period-over-period. But we saw a very significant fall off in volumes, particularly in retail, which is the most efficient gallon-oriented part of our business, wherefore the total quarter volumes at retail ended up down almost 4%. So we had a significantly delevered manufacturing and distribution network over the back half of the quarter and really see somewhat surprising softness in the category of fluid milk in the back half. So those are really the two big drivers as it relates to gallons of milk. The other factor that gets embedded in our FDD-Morningstar results that really doesn't get disaggregated is that about 2/3 of our business is liquid milk, the other 1/3 is largely comprised of Class II items, whether those are ice cream, cultured products, creams and creamers. And there we had a very significant spike-up in the cost of raw materials throughout the third quarter that, frankly, resulted in somewhere on the order of $0.04 of unanticipated costs, a four net cents of earnings per share in our Class II businesses during the period. So those are really the big items."

And the fact of the matter remains that while we're not making as much, we're still making money in the volume that we're retaining. So we're not retaining this money at loss-making margins, or this volume, we're retaining it at smaller profit margins. So the industry is going through a big shakeout, and it's, I think, the die is cast.

We are not further integrating WhiteWave with FDD-Morningstar. My commentary around organizational structure is that we are further integrating FDD and Morningstar, which reside within the same segment. So apparently, that wasn't clear enough in our prepared comments, but we have quite separate businesses between WhiteWave and Alpro. And it's important that we maintain quite separate businesses for lots of reasons. First of all, they're quite different, and secondly, to your point, perfectly appropriately, it allows us to maintain strategic flexibility to make decisions in the future that will maximize value for our shareholders. So I would just point out a couple of things with respect to the WhiteWave-Alpro portion of your comments. First of all, trust me, we get it. Where the values are in the business, and we have a pretty keen sense of whether or not WhiteWave-Alpro is adequately reflected in our valuation. So we understand those dynamics. But I would also point out that to the extent we're creating value over time and driving operating income growth and ultimately value creation in our share price, is happening in WhiteWave-Alpro today as opposed to FDD-Morningstar. So for the long-term benefit of our current shareholders, owning WhiteWave-Alpro is a value-creating mechanism. The third thing I would point out is that these source of corporate structural activities that you allude to often come with a host of other costs and complexities that aren't readily apparent on the surface. So for the time being, WhiteWave-Alpro is an important value-creating asset within the portfolio of Dean Foods. It is managed quite separately and is separable, and we're keenly aware of all the valuation issues that you're discussing."

And Terry, there was another dynamic that was important for us in the third quarter that, frankly, was really unusual in this third quarter. I mentioned to you that volumes in our milk business in the back half of the quarter were down significantly. Well when our milk volumes are down, our production of butterfat is down, right? Because we're skimming butterfat out of milk that we sell, so we produced meaningfully less butterfat in Q3 than we had planned, so we bought much more butterfat outside the business and at much higher prices. And on top of that, we had this very, very hot summer in the United States. And in hot weather, cows drink a lot of milk, and they produce less butterfat per gallon. So the butterfat content of the milk that we received was lower than typical. So that drove, really, the spike in butterfat, with less availability of fat throughout the marketplace, and we had sort of a double whammy of fat production internally. So it was a little bit of an odd, anomalous Q3 as it related to butterfat, but it really drove our cost up."

So just for a working hypothesis, at this point in time, we think the mover in 2011 looks a lot like the mover in 2010. So it may well be a tale of two halves again. Just the way the pricing mechanisms work here, we do better when the price is falling because there's just some lag in the business, and we suffer a little bit on the back half as the price rises. So we'll get some benefit as we always do in a falling commodity environment in the first half of 2011. On the other hand, we are working hard as a business in order to make our pass-through even better, right? So we would happily forgo the margin accretion that we get on the down-side in order to not suffer the compression on the up-side.

If you just look at our FDD milk business, we've got 100 plants. That means that net-net, as that volume has gone out, I’ve idled two entire facilities that I just don't need in this lower-volume environment, and I've been taking share. So if the rest of the industry has 300 plants out there among the rest of the fluid milk segment and they're down 3% or 4% in terms of fluid milk volumes, then there is 10 to 12 plants that's been idle just by the decrease in volume.

And we have very strong share positions in almost all of those categories. And I think all of the people that we compete with in those spaces are going to be taking price. So we heard Sara Lee come out this morning saying, ""Hey, we got lots of commodity inflation. We're going to be out there taking price."" And they're just the last of a long line of folks who have said that. So that will be the -- we're going to have to take some price to maintain our profitably at WhiteWave-Alpro. And we believe in that segment of the industry, the dynamics are much more favorable to taking price than they are in liquid milk."

How I would characterize it is that this ball got rolling down the hill with lots of energy as a result of changes in the retail environment. So a recession, consumers seeking value, retailers seeking to show value to their customers with key value items. And as it often does, it starts with a few big retailers or a few new entrants, and we have some each of those in the grocery category, that gets things moving downhill. So when they get moving downhill, then there are collateral effects. And so as the retail price environment deteriorated, you get responses from the entire retail community, now trying to stay in value and match. And then you get price pressure back up the supply chain with retailers looking for help in funding this strategy. So in that environment, you get a bit of a churning of the pot in which the buying community, the retail community, is leveraging the excess capacity that exists, and it exists throughout everybody's network. And now manufacturers, back to Judy Hong's point, start focusing on the fact that they got fixed-cost infrastructure that they got to cover, and they compete to retain volume. So that's the basic dynamic. It started with the retail environment, and it's rippled back into the processor environment. We really don't see, even with these changes in ownership of other processors, we don't see people actively seeking to grow their share, right? People are trying to hold volume in their facilities, and then in declining category, ultimately that means growing share a little bit because there's less volume for everybody. So if you want to hold your volume, you got to take a little share. But we don't see people actively initiating lower pricing around the environment. It's more responsive. That’s not to say it doesn't happen at all. Again, it's not black and white, but these plants are in fixed geographies and they can serve fixed markets and customer bases and people maybe look a little farther afield from their plants, but I think the processing industry is in a very reactive mode right now."

When I compare this quarter in terms of operating profit per gallon to the worst other one I've seen on record, which would have Q2 '07. Other than Q1 this year, Q2 '07 worked about, by my estimates of what you've told us, like 4% gallon growth, whatever, we're about 32% below in profit per gallon for you. If you take effect to the $36 million in quarterly cost savings you'd achieved as of last September, with the 145 [ph] number you told us.

I think you have to look at the flip-side of the total profit pool as you look between retailers and processors. And that is the size of the investment that retailers have made in this industry is the encountering factor to keeping processors aggressive, right? Retailers have made significant investments over the last 12-plus months in this business, and they're trying to recover some of that investment from processors. Processors are sitting with stranded fixed costs, so they're doing whatever they can do to hold onto their volumes. So they're being very aggressive from a price standpoint in order to avoid further deleverage. So I think, as Gregg commented, processors are not out trying to take other processors volumes. They're just trying to hold onto their own volume with retailers trying to extract concessions from the processor community. So that's the countering force in the overall profitability drain in the processor industry. Retailers are still trying to recover some profit pool. I think when you start seeing that abate, when their investments starts becoming less, then you'll see a little of the pressure taken off processors. And I think you'll see margins start to stabilize on the processor side of the business."

As you've seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges",2115,"Thank you, Barry, and thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. As you've seen this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $23 million or $0.13 per share. These results are clearly disappointing and reflect continued significant challenges in our largest business, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Despite our poor consolidated performance, WhiteWave-Alpro continued to perform exceptionally well and delivered significant top and bottom-line growth. However, given the relative size of the business, it was not enough to offset weakness in the much larger Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar segment. 
As we've noted on previous calls, our core dairy business’ performance has suffered material margin pressure from the fundamental adverse shifts in the market pricing of private-label milk and its related fallout. More recently, two other factors have impacted our business. We've experienced weakness in milk category volumes and other beverage and cultured product categories within Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Butterfat costs also spiked to unexpectedly high levels in Q3, which further compressed segment operating performance. In light of these results, we continue to take aggressive steps to improve our result at FDD-Morningstar including accelerated cost reductions and, as we recently announced, a realignment of the management and organization of the business.
With that overview, let me drill down a bit into each of the businesses, starting with Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar gross profits declined $44 million from the year-ago period. While the issues impacting results are much the same as we've been dealing with for the past year or so, the relative magnitude has changed a bit. The pricing pressures on the core dairy business that began last year continued through the third quarter. To attract customers in a tough climate, retailers have priced gallons of private-label milk at deep discounts. The margin over milk metric on the right of this chart that tracks the spread between retail pricing of private-label gallons of milk and the government-mandated Class I Mover price remains essentially unchanged from prior periods, $0.40 to $0.50 a gallon below historical levels.  
This continues to impact the processing industry in two ways. First, it drives ongoing pricing pressure from processors such as Dean as retailers look to reduce their cost across the category. Volume-hungry competitors have bid aggressively for available business, and contract renegotiations have been widespread. So far, we have successfully maintained and even grown our share. However, this competitive intensity has resulted in broad-based price concessions. The result of this pressure on our P&L accounted for the lion’s share of the year-over-year decline and segment gross profits in the quarter. The heavy competition in the market place will likely continue to impact the processing industry profits for some time to come.
Second, deeply discounted retail prices for private-label milk have widened gaps between our more profitable regional brands and private labels. Although the year-over-year impact has lessened, consumers looking for value have continued to trade down to private-label, and our product mix continues to deteriorate as a result. In addition to our challenges in the fluid milk category, we have begun to experience volume weakness across the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio. These factors, combined with the impact of steep butterfat inflation in the quarter drove our operating income bis [ph] this period.
In spite of continued aggressive private-label pricing, volume weakness in the fluid milk category that we began to see in the second quarter continued through the third. Part of this weakness can be explained by very aggressive promotion and low milk prices in the year-ago period, Q3 2009, during which retailer feature ads in the category were more than twice as abundant and much more productive than this year. But we also continue to see increment [ph] trends of declining volumes throughout each month, indicative of cash-strapped customers. It is clear that a significant segment of consumers are not just looking for value pricing, they are cutting back on purchases of even basic items.
These trends have had a pronounced impact on the fluid milk category, which has slowed considerably. Fluid milk volumes across IRI-measured channels were down more than 3.5% in the quarter from a year ago. Across all channels, total USDA fluid milk volumes declined approximately 1.6% in the quarter. Within this, our fluid milk volume growth has weakened from approximately 2% growth earlier in the year to essentially flat in the last two quarters. We began the quarter with volume growth of over 1% in July, but volumes were down significantly in both August and September. We estimate that our competitors' volumes have been down more than 2.5% for the year, exacerbating the competitive intensity in the marketplace. 
While our volumes have outperformed the balance of the industry for some time, as we lapped the Heartland acquisition in early Q4, we believe our volume performance will likely converge with the overall market. As I mentioned, outside the fluid milk category, our product volumes in the balance of the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar portfolio have also experienced widespread softness, declining 6% in aggregate. Our other beverage products, including juice, tea and water, declined mid-single digits. Cultured products declined more than 10%, creamers declined low-single digits and the ice cream category was also soft in the quarter. 
In total, Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar volumes declined 2% in the third quarter. The negative effect of this volume softness was amplified by the dramatic increase in Class II butterfat costs in the quarter, which created additional pressure on gross profits. Class II butterfat averaged $2.12 per pound in the quarter, an increase of 70% from the year-ago period and more than 25% above the second quarter. As a reminder, Class II butterfat is a key input in our creamer, cultured and ice cream product businesses, where the pass-through of changes and input cost is less efficient than fluid milk.
The continued gross margin pressure on the business, higher fuel costs and increased bad debt expenses all contributed to drive segment operating profit well below year-ago levels at $116 million. Without question, our best strategy to combat this continued P&L pressure is to relentlessly focus on permanently reducing structural costs. Our teams have made great progress on this initiative, with $175 million in projected cost savings from the beginning of 2009 through the end of this year. We're committed to becoming a differentiated, low-cost operation and are accelerating our efforts toward achieving our goal of $300 million of cost savings by the end of 2011, year three over our original three-to-five-year target. 
Following completion of our initial goal, we then expect to drive at least $100 million in additional cost from the business each year for the next three to five years. We've driven progress on our cost initiatives in all of our targeted areas. Total headcount in the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business is down more than 1,000 positions in 2010 alone. Better technology has enabled the reduction of nearly 500 delivery routes since the beginning of 2009. Over the same period, fuel usage is down 4%, despite acquisitions. We've closed five facilities over that time, including one this year. Improved purchasing has produced more than $28 million in annual procurement savings.
Going forward, we're expanding on these efforts in additional areas like the G&A cost initiative we recently announced, which we expect to drive $30 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. We're also targeting reductions in milk procurement costs to improve logistics and in-sourcing those activities where it makes sense. You should also expect a material increase in our network optimization efforts over the coming years as we drive cost out of our system through remaking our manufacturing network. Stated simply, accelerated cost reduction continues to be the number one priority for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar. Creating a differentiated cost position is critical to the long-term success of the business. As a management team and as an organization, we're aligned on this priority with a number of initiatives focused on permanently reducing structural costs to stabilize and then rebuild the profitability of Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.
In addition to reducing cost, we think we can achieve substantial benefits by attacking the marketplace in a more integrated manner. To that end, we recently announced key executive changes that realign our organizational structure, an approach that we believe will make us more nimble and enhance our go-to market strategy. As many of you saw, we recently created the role of Chief Commercial Officer with Chris Sliva, who was previously the President of our Morningstar Division, assuming this post. Chris will have responsibility for directing the commercial strategy of both the Fresh Dairy Direct and Morningstar Division's. This move is consistent with the broader initiative to tighten the alignment of the company's sales organization, commercial lines of business and customer relationships, providing greater visibility, flexibility, efficiency and accountability. This is the first step in removing many of the artificial barriers that have historically existed between these two highly related businesses. Our goal is to go to customers with one Dean face and to act that way, all the way to the supply chain.
Let me now turn to our other segments, WhiteWave-Alpro. In contrast to our results at FDD-Morningstar, our WhiteWave-Alpro branded segment continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, driven by solid top-line sales. Third quarter segment net sales increased 8% over last year to $478 million, reflecting broad growth across the portfolio. Consistent with the first two quarters of this year, all of our key brands continue to drive solid volume-led sales growth in the quarter. Horizon Organic milk had an especially strong quarter with growth in the high teens driven by our differentiated product offerings and continued solid category growth. Horizon has continued to outperform the category and gained additional share. 
Our Creamers business, led by International Delight, also continued to post strong growth. International Delight sales increased in the low-double digits and market share continued to expand on the strength of continued strong category growth, our coffee house inspiration innovations and strong base business. Our new, more indulgent Barbe's products are hitting the shelves now, and we look forward to continued strong, innovation-led growth behind this launch. Also in the quarter, our more traditional Land O'Lakes creamer sales grew in the mid-single digits. Our plant-based beverage businesses of Silk and Alpro continue to perform well in the strength of our new Silk PureAlmond product. Overall, Silk net sales increased in the mid-single digits. 
The introduction of Silk PureAlmond has been a clear success, as almond-based beverages now account for more than a quarter of the plant-based beverage category, and PureAlmond share within this segment is approaching 50%. We plan to continue to innovate in the category with additional products in 2011. Alpro volumes and sales in the quarter increased high single digits on a constant currency basis and were roughly flat after currency translations.
This healthy growth across the top line drove 10% growth in segment operating income to $39 million. Flow-through from the top line was strong but would have been stronger if not for mounting production capacity constraints in the business that are driving increased outsourcing of manufacturing and higher distribution expenses. As we look ahead, we'll address these constraints by spending capital to increase production capacity at WhiteWave. Overall, the strength of our branded business continues. We expect a solid finish to the year in this business and continued momentum as we look ahead to the next.
Before turning the call over to Jack to discuss corporate items, I'd like to first comment on our outlook. Looking at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, in the near term, we expect this business to remain challenged as the retail environment continues to be very competitive and volumes across much of the portfolio remain soft. We expect a continuation of these pressures through the fourth quarter and into next year. Price concessions that have already been given will continue to impact year-over-year comparisons into 2011, regardless of whether we see a return to historical private-label retail pricing levels or not. As I mentioned, in order to offset these concessions, we will continue to intensely focus on our cost-reduction efforts. I'm confident that in time, we'll be able to get in front of the cost-price squeeze in a way that will be difficult for our competitors to follow.
At WhiteWave-Alpro, we expect the strong performance we've seen all year to continue through the fourth quarter, when our Creamers business typically does seasonally well. Given our run rate as we exited the third quarter, but keeping in mind the typical strong seasonality of Q4, we expect fourth quarter earnings of between $0.13 and $0.18 per adjusted diluted share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack. Jack?"

I'll take a few minutes to walk through the consolidated financial performance in the quarter and discuss a few corporate items. Corporate expense of $53 million was essentially in line with year-ago levels and down a bit from the second quarter of this year. Headcount within the corporate center declined 5% in the quarter, and we expect headcount to continue to decline over the next several quarters as we begin to rollout the G&A-focused portion of our cost-reduction program. 
Now let me turn to consolidated Dean results. With stronger WhiteWave-Alpro results offset by weakness at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, our consolidated gross profit decline $36 million from a year ago to $750 million. Below the gross profit line, total company operating expenses increased $18 million over the year-ago period. Solid cost control was more than offset by the impact of higher fuel and freight cost across the business, especially at WhiteWave, in part due to the capacity constrains that Gregg just discussed. And this line was also impact by the operating expenses related to the Heartland acquisition that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Total company G&A on an adjusted basis, which excludes the year-ago impact of DLCs, was down modestly. Driving operating cost leverage continues to be an area of focus going forward and a key to offsetting the margin pressures across the business. In total, the heightened pressures on the Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar business more than offset our cost control progress in a strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro, resulting in third quarter consolidated operating income that was 35% below year-ago results at $103 million.
Below the operating income line, interest expense increased $5 million from the year-ago period as a result of higher average interest rates related to the amendment and extension of our senior credit facilities earlier this year. Net income of $23 million drove third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.13.
Now before turning the call back over to Gregg, I'd like to make one last comment. You may have seen the announcement this morning that I am leaving Dean in a couple of weeks for another opportunity. This was a very hard decision for me. Over the past four and a half years, the challenge of transforming Dean from a roll-up to a more integrated operating company has been exhilarating. Today, the capability and plans are in place to accelerate structural cost reduction, realign our sales organization to ensure one face to the customer and continue the growth of the WhiteWave-Alpro business, which is now almost $2 billion. 
Overall, I am quite confident that this team will work through the current marketplace challenges and is building a much stronger Dean Foods. I know the finance organization and its leadership team, now under Shaun Mara, is now well positioned to step up its contribution. I am committed to delivering as seamless a transition as possible. 
With that, now let me turn the call back over to Gregg. Gregg?"
34883,114812954,87132,"Dean Foods Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Dean Foods Company","Executives","Thanks, Jack. In spite of the recent challenges to our P&L, cash flows remain strong in our business. Net cash from continuing operations through the third quarter of this year was $379 million.

Net cash from continuing operations through the third quarter of this year was $379 million. Subtracting net capital expenditures of $180 million from this yields free cash flow of $199 million for the first nine months of this year. Since the completion of the Alpro acquisition in July of last year, we've generated $342 million in free cash flow, contributing to a significant reduction in debt since that time. 
To further support the generation of free cash flow and our debt pay-down efforts, we continue to aggressively manage working capital. Our cash conversion cycle decreased approximately three days from the year-ago period despite Class I milk and Class II butterfat prices averaging 50% and 70% higher, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Total outstanding net debt at quarter end stood at just under $4 billion, down $109 million from last quarter. As expected, our leverage ratio of funded debt-to-EBITDA as defined by our credit agreements stepped up a bit this quarter despite continued debt reduction. This was due to the impact of reduced EBITDA in quarter three 2010 versus quarter three 2009. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.9x. 
We maintained strong liquidity with over $1.3 billion of currently available liquidity under our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. Earlier this year, we modified our covenant structure to allow more flexibility as we invest capital to drive our long-term strategies and weather the challenging economic and competitive environment. As a reminder, our revised leverage covenant ratio is 5.5x. The covenant steps down to 5x on June 30 of 2011. We're monitoring our covenant compliance closely and plan to continue to balance capital spending against our debt pay-down objectives to maintain appropriate flexibility. 
Also, given recent results, we're evaluating options to further align our balance sheet with the strategic and investment needs of the business and to ensure adequate flexibility under our covenants. With this in mind, we expect capital spending of $300 million this year, reflecting spend on high return investments behind our strategic priorities to drive to absolute lowest cost in Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, as well as initial investments in capacity to support the strong growth at WhiteWave-Alpro. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to improving these results. Our industry is going through a wrenching ordeal. We've made solid progress on our cost agenda, but these ongoing pressures make it clear we need to accelerate our efforts. And we're doing just that. We're also working to build much-needed capability, including the improvement of our pricing and forecasting capabilities to drive more predictability in our results. These things take time, and we appreciate your patience. I'm confident that we’ll be able to get ahead of these market pressures, competitively differentiate ourselves across several spectrums and return to strong earnings growth trajectory.
Before I wrap up, I also want to take a moment to comment on Jack's upcoming departure. I want to publicly thank Jack for all of his contributions to Dean Foods. We're a much more capable company today than when Jack arrived. He helped bring a new level of rigor to our organization, centralize much of finance and help lead the strategic thinking that will drive our success in the future. He also conscientiously recruited and developed a deep bench of executive talent beneath him. Shaun Mara is a strong and capable leader, and we look forward to his contributions to the company as he takes the baton from Jack later this month. Thank you, Jack. 
With that, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today on the call and ask the operator to open up the phones for questions."

First of all, you have the ongoing effect of concessions that have been made from period to period in private-label pricing, so the price between us and our customers. We continue to see downward pressure on pricing in the category, and so you have an accumulation of lower prices as contracts have been renegotiated, really, over the last four or five quarters. So that is clearly one impact. Another significant impact in driving lower profitability in the quarter is, frankly, we missed the volume here, and we missed it pretty significantly. So through July of this year, or in July, we had volumes actually up about 1% period-over-period. But we saw a very significant fall off in volumes, particularly in retail, which is the most efficient gallon-oriented part of our business, wherefore the total quarter volumes at retail ended up down almost 4%. So we had a significantly delevered manufacturing and distribution network over the back half of the quarter and really see somewhat surprising softness in the category of fluid milk in the back half. So those are really the two big drivers as it relates to gallons of milk. The other factor that gets embedded in our FDD-Morningstar results that really doesn't get disaggregated is that about 2/3 of our business is liquid milk, the other 1/3 is largely comprised of Class II items, whether those are ice cream, cultured products, creams and creamers. And there we had a very significant spike-up in the cost of raw materials throughout the third quarter that, frankly, resulted in somewhere on the order of $0.04 of unanticipated costs, a four net cents of earnings per share in our Class II businesses during the period. So those are really the big items."

And the fact of the matter remains that while we're not making as much, we're still making money in the volume that we're retaining. So we're not retaining this money at loss-making margins, or this volume, we're retaining it at smaller profit margins.

First of all, they're quite different, and secondly, to your point, perfectly appropriately, it allows us to maintain strategic flexibility to make decisions in the future that will maximize value for our shareholders. So I would just point out a couple of things with respect to the WhiteWave-Alpro portion of your comments. First of all, trust me, we get it. Where the values are in the business, and we have a pretty keen sense of whether or not WhiteWave-Alpro is adequately reflected in our valuation. So we understand those dynamics. But I would also point out that to the extent we're creating value over time and driving operating income growth and ultimately value creation in our share price, is happening in WhiteWave-Alpro today as opposed to FDD-Morningstar. So for the long-term benefit of our current shareholders, owning WhiteWave-Alpro is a value-creating mechanism. The third thing I would point out is that these source of corporate structural activities that you allude to often come with a host of other costs and complexities that aren't readily apparent on the surface. So for the time being, WhiteWave-Alpro is an important value-creating asset within the portfolio of Dean Foods. It is managed quite separately and is separable, and we're keenly aware of all the valuation issues that you're discussing."

And Terry, there was another dynamic that was important for us in the third quarter that, frankly, was really unusual in this third quarter. I mentioned to you that volumes in our milk business in the back half of the quarter were down significantly. Well when our milk volumes are down, our production of butterfat is down, right? Because we're skimming butterfat out of milk that we sell, so we produced meaningfully less butterfat in Q3 than we had planned, so we bought much more butterfat outside the business and at much higher prices. And on top of that, we had this very, very hot summer in the United States. And in hot weather, cows drink a lot of milk, and they produce less butterfat per gallon. So the butterfat content of the milk that we received was lower than typical. So that drove, really, the spike in butterfat, with less availability of fat throughout the marketplace, and we had sort of a double whammy of fat production internally. So it was a little bit of an odd, anomalous Q3 as it related to butterfat, but it really drove our cost up."

So first half, pretty steadily declining mover followed by pretty significant escalation back up to around these levels at year end. So just for a working hypothesis, at this point in time, we think the mover in 2011 looks a lot like the mover in 2010. So it may well be a tale of two halves again. Just the way the pricing mechanisms work here, we do better when the price is falling because there's just some lag in the business, and we suffer a little bit on the back half as the price rises. So we'll get some benefit as we always do in a falling commodity environment in the first half of 2011. On the other hand, we are working hard as a business in order to make our pass-through even better, right? So we would happily forgo the margin accretion that we get on the down-side in order to not suffer the compression on the up-side. So it's a pretty complicated process, and it requires a lot of coordination with your customers and some different ways of thinking about pricing in this category. But we would like to remove as much of that lag and drag from the business as possible. So you may start to see some of the benefits of that work as we go through 2011.

And it's hard to see in our capacity as well if you're not in the company. But I would say there's enough to have caused very significant price compression as we have moved into this recession with a very aggressive customer base on price. We do see signs that people are recognizing that they need less capacity in their own businesses. So we see industry volumes down to 1.5% to 2%. If you just look at our FDD milk business, we've got 100 plants. That means that net-net, as that volume has gone out, I’ve idled two entire facilities that I just don't need in this lower-volume environment, and I've been taking share. So if the rest of the industry has 300 plants out there among the rest of the fluid milk segment and they're down 3% or 4% in terms of fluid milk volumes, then there is 10 to 12 plants that's been idle just by the decrease in volume. And there was other additional capacity when we went into this thing. So there's plenty of idle capacity out there that needs to come out. And we're seeing the signs that people are coming to grips with the fact that this situation is not going to abate like it has in the recent past. And people need to get their capacities right.

How I would characterize it is that this ball got rolling down the hill with lots of energy as a result of changes in the retail environment. So a recession, consumers seeking value, retailers seeking to show value to their customers with key value items. And as it often does, it starts with a few big retailers or a few new entrants, and we have some each of those in the grocery category, that gets things moving downhill. So when they get moving downhill, then there are collateral effects. And so as the retail price environment deteriorated, you get responses from the entire retail community, now trying to stay in value and match. And then you get price pressure back up the supply chain with retailers looking for help in funding this strategy. So in that environment, you get a bit of a churning of the pot in which the buying community, the retail community, is leveraging the excess capacity that exists, and it exists throughout everybody's network. And now manufacturers, back to Judy Hong's point, start focusing on the fact that they got fixed-cost infrastructure that they got to cover, and they compete to retain volume. So that's the basic dynamic. It started with the retail environment, and it's rippled back into the processor environment. We really don't see, even with these changes in ownership of other processors, we don't see people actively seeking to grow their share, right? People are trying to hold volume in their facilities, and then in declining category, ultimately that means growing share a little bit because there's less volume for everybody. So if you want to hold your volume, you got to take a little share. But we don't see people actively initiating lower pricing around the environment. It's more responsive. That’s not to say it doesn't happen at all. Again, it's not black and white, but these plants are in fixed geographies and they can serve fixed markets and customer bases and people maybe look a little farther afield from their plants, but I think the processing industry is in a very reactive mode right now."

When I compare this quarter in terms of operating profit per gallon to the worst other one I've seen on record, which would have Q2 '07. Other than Q1 this year, Q2 '07 worked about, by my estimates of what you've told us, like 4% gallon growth, whatever, we're about 32% below in profit per gallon for you. If you take effect to the $36 million in quarterly cost savings you'd achieved as of last September, with the 145 [ph] number you told us. So when I think about that and then I think about the branded to private label mix that you suffered, it has to be much worse at these other regionals, because they're going to do a lot less private label business than you are, so they're going to feel worse trade-down, if you will, whatever you want to call it, that impact of going from branded to private label profits. What's the number? Where is it? These guys are half due, are not making a return on their assets, and have you seen any -- I mean, forget about what you're hearing in the marketplace, has anybody filed? Has anybody liquidated? Is anybody getting out of the business that you've heard of in the industry?"

I think you have to look at the flip-side of the total profit pool as you look between retailers and processors. And that is the size of the investment that retailers have made in this industry is the encountering factor to keeping processors aggressive, right? Retailers have made significant investments over the last 12-plus months in this business, and they're trying to recover some of that investment from processors. Processors are sitting with stranded fixed costs, so they're doing whatever they can do to hold onto their volumes. So they're being very aggressive from a price standpoint in order to avoid further deleverage. So I think, as Gregg commented, processors are not out trying to take other processors volumes. They're just trying to hold onto their own volume with retailers trying to extract concessions from the processor community. So that's the countering force in the overall profitability drain in the processor industry. Retailers are still trying to recover some profit pool. I think when you start seeing that abate, when their investments starts becoming less, then you'll see a little of the pressure taken off processors. And I think you'll see margins start to stabilize on the processor side of the business."

But I would remind you that one year ago on our call, we were talking about the third quarter of what was going to be our most profitable year ever. And that is true for everybody in the industry, right? We just made a historically anomalously high amount of money. And so everybody came into this with pretty full provisions. And people are going to have to believe that this is the new normal, which I think you're hearing us say, we think it is, and are going to have to experience it for a while before they look for a different course of action. The industry has always gone through ups and downs, and the downs always been followed within relatively short order by ups, usually driven by the commodity cycle. And I'm not sure everybody sees it the same way we do. In terms of stressed consumers, much more aggressive retailers and more well-informed and educated retailers and pressure of a perceives [ph] as the marketplace has changed as fundamentally as we believe it has changed.
