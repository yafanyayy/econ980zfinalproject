The fourth quarter was a period of modest economic recovery with continuing improvement in credit markets and a more positive tone for the equity markets, though challenges remain. I'll focus my comments on fourth quarter and 2009 results with Terry providing additional detail, and then close with some thoughts about 2010 and where we stand in implementing our strategy for growing our fee-based Global Asset Management and Accumulation businesses.Given overall market conditions, we view fourth quarter results as solid in a year that demonstrated the benefits of business and investment portfolio diversification and the resilience of our businesses. Strong improvement from U.S. Asset Accumulation and Principal International drove total company operating earnings up 12% from a year-ago quarter. These two segments added $44 million in operating earnings reflecting higher average assets under management, strong expense management and the benefit of having vibrant businesses in emerging international markets which have not been impacted as significantly by the economic recession.Principal International delivered $870 million of positive net cash flow for the quarter. Other highlights include: total company return on equity of 10.6%, a 40 basis point sequential improvement due to growth in our fee-based high return businesses; continued strong performance from the investment portfolio with net realized capital losses of $59 million, a level comparable to the second and third quarters; and continued improvement in net unrealized losses about $350 million for U.S. invested assets in the fourth quarter, with credit spreads narrowing by about $1.2 billion, partially offset by an increase due to higher interest rates.Because of our strong asset liability management, this increase in interest rates is not an economic issue. We view 2009 as a very solid year for The Principal. During some of the most challenging capital market and economic conditions in 75 years, we delivered $804 million of operating earnings, a decrease of only 15% and $590 million of net income, an increase of 39%.GAAP book value including other comprehensive income more than tripled from a year ago to $23.05 per share as of December 31, 2009, reflecting the significant turmoil and illiquidity in the market at that time. During the year, our assets performed in line with our expectations as did our liabilities. We saw a $6.3 billion decline in net unrealized losses in 2009 with $8.2 billion of improvement from credit spreads narrowing, partially offset by a $1.9 billion increase due to higher interest rates.Assets under management improved $38 billion in 2009 to $285 billion, creating the opportunity for earnings growth in 2010. And our GAAP balance sheet was strengthened by more than $2 billion in 2009 as a result of the equity and debt raises along with strong net income. In total, we entered 2010 in a stronger and more competitive position than at any time in our history as a public company.Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing where we are in the process of economic recovery and how that may impact our businesses in the short-term. As we have said many times before, we have always been very disciplined about the liabilities we put on the books as well as where we invest our capital in order to produce the best long-term returns for shareholders. During 2009, we scaled back the Investment Only business as part of our overall, capital management efforts. In line with our goals for the year, the Investment Only business is now just over 25% of general account liabilities, with a reduction in the block freeing up $165 million of capital. Our current plan is to continue to scale back this business as much tighter spreads in the market today are resulting in a return on capital that we do not believe is attractive. Now let me turn to full service accumulation and the impact of the economic recession. For the year, we had net cash flow of 2.5% of beginning of year account value, below our long-term target. Because of the recession, we saw recurring deposits, that is new deposits from existing clients, decline about $700 million from 2008 due to participants being laid off, masses being suspended and a slight scaling back of participant deferrals. Given that recurring deposits have increased on average by about $1.4 billion a year over the past four years, we estimate the impact of the recession on recurring deposits in 2009 to be in excess of 2.5% of beginning of year account values. The good news is that we are seeing recovery in these areas, and expect that to continue as we move into 2010.Finally, the lower volume of sales activity in the marketplace and the general decline in equity values during 2008, further depressed transfer deposits that come from plans that are moved to The Principal. Transfer deposits were down in 2009 by $2.7 billion or 3.4% of beginning of year account value. Again, there is good news. We are seeing pipelines build. October and November were our two most active months of the year for quote activity. And on a sequential basis, fourth quarter sales more than doubled to $1 billion. So we remain confident in our ability to have full service accumulation, net cash flow get back to the 4% to 6% of beginning of year account value, as more normal job market and economic conditions return.Let me close this section by citing some third-party sources that put full service accumulation, net cash flow and sales into context. According to Cerulli Associates, the economic recession caused the 401(k) universe to be a net outflow during 2008 and 2009. They estimate $30 billion of outflows in 2008 and $43 billion of outflows in 2009, with outflows expected to improve in 2010 as the economy continues to recover. Compared to that, full service accumulation had net inflows of $5.5 billion in 2008 and $2 billion in 2009.The Life Insurance, Marketing and Research Association or LIMRA regularly reports key 401(k) metrics. So let me mention a few key findings from their most recent survey through nine months. We are one of only three firms adding more than 100,000 participants. We were one of only four firms adding more than $2 billion in 401(k) assets. And we were one of only five firms adding more than 1,000 plans.In summary, while the economic recovery will continue to cause some challenges, we remain confident in the competitiveness of our 401(k) and defined contribution products. And we believe more normal growth will resume for full service accumulation over the next few quarters assuming employment recovers. I'd like to conclude my comments with some thoughts about our progress in implementing our small-medium business, asset accumulation, asset management strategy and how that positions us for success over the longer term.  While we want to maintain a well diversified and small-medium business-focused business strategy, our priority is growing our U.S. Retirement business, including full service accumulation, mutual funds and separately managed accounts, along with our International Accumulation businesses and our Global Asset Management business. Beyond offering a stronger growth profile, these businesses are fee-based, high-return businesses that require minimal capital for growth. As a result of this strategy, we've seen strong assets under management growth since 2001 despite essentially flat markets. Total assets under management are up $186 billion for a compounded annual growth rate of 14%. During this period, we grew full service accumulation account values by $53 billion, an increase of nearly 125%. For what may have escaped this much attention is growth in other areas. Principal Global Investors, with $66 billion of higher third-party assets under management, an eightfold increase. Principal International, with $31 billion of higher assets under management, also an eightfold increase. And Principal funds with $25 billion of higher account values, a fourfold increase.Going forward, our ability to continue to grow the U.S. retirement businesses will depend upon our success with independent distribution, particularly our key alliance partners such as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, UBS, Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo.  We have been working diligently to build deep and lasting relationships with these partners. Despite the market turmoil in 2009, we generated $8.5 billion of sales from independent distribution for full service accumulation, mutual funds and separately-managed accounts. This translates into a three-year compounded annual growth rate in excess of 50%. So it is clear we are making very good progress in our efforts to build lasting relationships across the full range of asset accumulation products in our most significant channel.Future success for Principal International will result from successfully exporting our U.S. retirement expertise to selected key emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. In Latin America, we have achieved a compounded annual growth rate of more than 20% over the last five years for both operating earnings and assets under management. The memorandum of understanding with Banco Brasil provides for extension of our exclusive relationship for another 23 years.While the change in ownership percentage from 46% to 25% will have an impact on near-term results, the increased size and reach of Banco Brasil enhances the long-term growth potential in this key market. We're implementing the same model in high-growth markets in Asia. That is, to combine our retirement and asset management expertise with strong local distribution partners. In China, for example, we increased assets under management by $1.4 billion or 30% in 2009. And in Malaysia, our asset management expertise was recognized by Asia Asset Management with CIMB-Principal Asset Management named Best Institutional House of the Year and CIMB-Principal Islamic named Islamic Fund House of the Year.Finally, for Principal Global Investors, our key will be a disciplined, focused effort to manage assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term investments while employing our multi-boutique strategy to drive assets under management growth. Reflecting the success of our multi-boutique strategy, each of the three boutiques we've had for more than four years, Columbus Circle, Post and Spectrum, has a compounded annual growth rate for assets under management in excess of 25%.In closing, we enter 2010 with a well-crafted strategy focused on high-growth, high-return businesses, but with a diversification to see us through challenging times. We believe that served us well in 2009 and it will allow us to achieve our longer-term goal of 11% to 13% growth in earnings per share as markets continue to recover along with the economy.Terry?"

This morning, I'm going to focus on four areas. I'll cover operating earnings and how the results are emerging as the economic recovery builds. I'll cover net income, including performance on the investment portfolio. I'll provide an update",925,"Thanks, Larry. This morning, I'm going to focus on four areas. I'll cover operating earnings and how the results are emerging as the economic recovery builds. I'll cover net income, including performance on the investment portfolio. I'll provide an update on expense management and I'll wrap up with some comments on the strength of our position as we enter 2010.Starting with fourth quarter 2009 results, total company operating earnings improved $22 million or 12% compared to the year-ago quarter. This reflects 6% higher average assets under management and strong expense management. Two segments drove the improvement. U.S. Asset Accumulation earnings improved $23 million or 22% on $7 billion or 4% higher average account values. Growth for this segment was even more impressive, up $47 million or 70% excluding results for the Investment Only business, which as you know we are scaling back.  The Accumulation businesses added about 2% net cash flow and the Guaranteed businesses generated negative net cash flow, reflecting our scale back of Investment Only. Principal International's earnings improved $21 million, more than doubling from a year-ago quarter.Roughly half of the improvement reflects strong performance on a local basis with the increase also reflecting recovery in macroeconomic conditions as well as a $3 million after-tax from realized capital gains in Brazil. Principal International added $11.5 billion of assets under management during the year to reach a record $34.6 billion at year end.  The gain was driven not only by market performance and favorable currency movements but importantly, by record net cash flows, $3.2 billion or 14% of beginning of year assets under management.Global Asset Management earnings were down on a reported basis, but up 35% excluding earnings in certain post advisory contracts which were sold in first quarter of 2009, and performance fees in the prior-year quarter of about $16 million after tax on a contract where performance fees are determined every five years. On a sequential basis, total company earnings were down $38 million or 16%. The variance reflects a number of items, the largest being seasonality of health division claims. And benefits in third quarter 2009 from early redemption of MTNs and lower DAC amortization expense.  Excluding items impacting comparability between periods, earnings improved 9% sequentially on 5% higher average AUM, demonstrating that we are continuing to see positive operating leverage as our assets under management build.Fourth quarter was also another solid quarter for net income at $142 million. Net realized capital losses in fourth quarter 2009 were $59 million, compared to $189 million of losses in fourth quarter 2008. Compared to a year-ago quarter, fixed maturity credit related impairments in sales were down $43 million, an improvement of 42%. Losses on commercial mortgage whole loans were up only $1 million or 7% and have been fairly stable over the past five quarters.We expect total credit related realized capital losses to decline in 2010 with improvement in corporate credit losses more than offsetting higher losses from commercial mortgages and CMBS. I'd also reiterate our expectation that over the course of the cycle losses on our commercial mortgage whole loan portfolio will come in around 2% pre-tax.  These results demonstrate the organization's discipline and investment expertise. Our strong asset liability management process, discipline around the liabilities we take on and the assets we match against them, enable us to avoid selling in an illiquid market.In our expertise in corporate credit and real estate coupled with adherence to internal credit exposure guidelines, has helped us keep losses to a manageable level. We are very confident in our investment portfolio and the strength of our capital and liquidity. We are now positioned to take advantage of opportunities to improve return on invested assets, but as always, we'll do so with discipline, particularly given the ongoing uncertainty in the environment.Moving to expense management, we reduced the fixed component of compensation and other by approximately $290 million or 60% compared to 2008. This translates into a reduction from our original 2009 budget of more than $400 million.Let me close with a few thoughts on the strength of our position as we enter 2010. Principal Global Investors starts the year with $205 billion in assets under management, an increase of 8%. Combined, account values for full service accumulation and mutual funds totaled $127 billion, both businesses up 20% from a year ago. Finally, Principal International starts the year with a record $35 billion of assets under management, 50% higher than when we started 2009. As a quick reminder, several items will impact comparability between 2009 and 2010. Continued scaleback of Investment Only, the change in our economic interest in Brasilprev, our investment in the health division, and an increase in weighted average shares outstanding. That said, the increase in assets under management and account values from a year ago positions our fee-based businesses, businesses that are not capital intensive and do not rely on general account guarantees, for strong revenue growth in 2010. Let me also comment on our risk-based capital ratio and capital position going into 2010. As of year-end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be in the range of 415% to 425%. We also have substantial cash at the holding company providing additional flexibility. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we had $1.5 billion of total excess capital at year-end. About half at the life company and half at the holding company. Clearly, we have continued to effectively balance a focus on operating earnings growth with discipline in managing our capital. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

But as we've said in our comments over the last couple of quarters, Jimmy, we are generally seeing an increase in pipeline quarter-over-quarter and you are seeing that now start to translate into sales. One of the things that I think needs to be factored into this is that the time it takes from sort of when things enter pipeline and to when it enters into sold cases, can often be somewhere between two and three quarters, but as I said in my comments, we are seeing that build. In terms of withdrawals, again, one of the things I would say here as a general comment before I ask Dan to comment further, is that we've always described withdrawals, Jimmy, as being somewhere in the range of about 16% to 18% on an annualized basis. And that usually comes from about 10% to 12% member withdrawal and about 6% to 7% sort of employer-based withdrawal. And that's generally the area within which the withdrawals are staying. The comparison to 2008 as we've said before, is always a difficult one because 2008 was far and away our best year for retention, both at the member level and the contract level. But with that, let me have Dan give you a little bit more color."

The first half of the year reflecting lay off, we saw about $700 million of higher than normal member level withdrawals, in the second-half member level withdrawals have actually kind of returned to what we would call a normal level. Third quarter of '09 member level withdrawals were about 2.5 percentage points of beginning of quarter account balances, and in the fourth quarter, it was 2.4%. So about a push during that period of time. If we shift our attention into contract level withdrawals, they were better than normal in 2008, we've talked about that past. In the latter half of 2009, it actually picked up and there is a number of reasons for that. We're addressing them in a number of ways. The first way in which we're addressing is adjusting our service model which enable us to be more competitive while maintaining pricing discipline on that block of business. The second is to aggressively push for enhancements to our Principal TP hedge program offering third-party administrators more choice and flexibility in servicing these clients. If we try to just normalize the fourth quarter results as we've discussed earlier, the difference in large part between our historical loss and withdrawals for employers versus the fourth quarter is the difference of about 0.6%, which equates to about $500 million during that period of time. We did lose one large client nearly $300 million, and we lost a stable-value contract that would have been about $70 million. So again, when you start normalizing these results you can see that again we focus our attention back toward attracting new business and get recurring deposits going back in the right direction."

As far as unusual items, I don't think there is anything unusual in that. The DAC also will also increase as the earnings increases because that's just the way the DAC calculation works, a factor applied to your expected gross profits.

So it's certainly something that has been under discussion, but I would also say that you'd see no real efforts to this point on the part of Congress to do anything. The impact of DRD as a practical matter on the principle continues to sort of come down year by year, and a lot of that is a result of more and more of the assets going into international equity, which doesn't get the benefit of DRD and more and more assets going into the mutual fund chastity which also doesn't get DRD. So the impact of DRD continues to come down. It's in the range of about $70 million on an annualized basis, which again, is probably somewhere in the range of $0.20 or so. We continually are told that if there were to be any change, and again, I would emphasize, if there were to be any change, it would be very much of a graded-in prospective change phased in over a recently long period of time, like five or seven years.

And again, as I talked to our people and I read the commentary from others, the legal counsel and others, Randy. Again, what I find consistently, and what I hear consistently is that it would have a very, very minor impact. And really, I think at the end of the day, this is something that is more about, if you will, political sort of maybe feel-good situation in regard to insurance reform. But as a practical matter, I don't know that it would really do anything to unnecessarily introduce competition. If you think about, for example, health insurance business, you're going to go across state lines to buy insurance from somebody else who quite likely doesn't have a network that's of any value to you because they operate in different states. So again, it's one of those things that sort of sounds good, feels good, but as a practical matter, really isn't a factor today, in terms of competition in health business."

And then, maybe a more details question for Larry or for Dan, you've mentioned some of the struggles that the 401(k) industry has had in terms of generating net flows and growth, and I think we all understand the reasons why, but what that also might suggest to me is at some point the opportunity for plan sponsors to kind of put the screws on the industry and try to squeeze out some pricing especially as they're struggling with the impact of the weak economy. So just wondering if you could give any thoughts on that and whether or not you're seeing that in some of quote activity that you've talked about recently?"

Total retirement suites still for us represents about 65% of our it sales, still value of being dry from our clients. They're looking for a coordinated approach for ESOP non-qualified deferred comp and defined contribution.  Most of the questions coming around defined benefit have to do with helping them either freeze those plans, or terminate those plans, if and when interest rates move in the direction that will allow them to do that. The other one I would tell you is it's highlighted the importance of this retire security, the ability to go out and provide guidance and education to plan participants, helping these plans become more productive or for plan participants. And then maybe a closing comment that relates to price. There is price sensitivity as you point out, which is why we have made the decision to start bifurcating our business model that would allow for lower price, and those instances where the customer's asking for fewer services than what we've provided in the past,  whereas, before there's more one-size-fits-all bundled between our emerging dynamic and institutional.

So 2009, again, you're seeing the withdrawals higher than 2008 but very, very much in line with historical trends. In terms of the Health business, as I've said before, health Business remains the first benefit that a small medium owner puts in. It remains the most active part for many, many employed benefit advisers. And so it is an entree for us. And it gives us great opportunity to sell other products primarily for the adviser. I certainly have mentioned in the past. There isn't a lot of cross-sell between health and pension, but what that forgets is there is a lot of cross-sell at the adviser level. The adviser who sells health insurance often sells other employee benefit products. We would be the first to agree that in order to be in the business you have to have to run it profitably. And if you look at the ROEs in the health business, the ROE in the Health business is was 15% in 2008 and is 11% in 2009. I view that as acceptable performance albeit with the ROE that we have in 2009. We've got to strengthen the platform, we've got to do what we need to do, to make sure that we're doing the things around managing care, so we get a proper return in those businesses.

I think for the first time, we are seeing serious intent in the part of the administration in terms of Department of Labor and Treasury to think about what we now need to do as a nation, given that we've accumulated three-point-some trillion dollars of 401(k) assets. What are we going to do to now ensure that, that money be used for the retirement security of the baby boom generation. And we're very excited about that, as you know, we have a full range of payout solutions. And so, I think again, we're well-positioned to be a net winner if and when Congress decides they want to do something in regards to income solutions. So let me stop there."

So again, yes the contract level withdrawals are higher. But at the same time, I would argue that it isn't a very unusual time. If you want to look specifically at contracts, the difference in contracts from '08 to '09, we wrote 988 fewer actual contracts. We also had 260 increase in the number of plans that terminated. These were vaporized, these are gone, no longer planned, they didn't transfer to anybody else. We actually saw an improvement of 537 fewer contracts lapses between 2008 and 2009. So again we attribute a lot of this to just how disruptive this economy's has been throughout 2008 and into 2009.

And it became clear to us that you needed to have, if you will more control, not only in order to negotiate directly, but quite frankly, in order to negotiate better terms under those network agreements without getting too much into the detail. And so we've begun the process of creating our own networks, primarily in those areas where we know we can get competitive discounts. And so what that does, is it puts us into more of a regional capacity, and frankly it puts us in more of the geographic areas that would be, I would say sort of second-tier markets. So that would include things like, down through the Midwest, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma perhaps over to Tennessee and to Georgia, and that particular areas. So you don't see us, for example, in the have industrial areas, we do a whole lot on the West Coast. So that's kind of the focus. And as a result of that, I think in the past couple of years, we have gained much, much more control of price competitiveness as well as reimbursement mechanisms. And we just have to continue to work at that. And hopefully, then as the economy rebuilds, you'll see sort of the membership begin to stabilize and then turn around."

As most of you probably already know, John Egan recently joined The Principal as our new Investor Relations Officer.  He is replacing Tom Graf who will be retiring later this month after 38 years of service with the organization.  I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Tom for his significant contributions over the course of his career and to welcome John to the company.
Moving to results, first quarter was a very solid start to the year for The Principal as we delivered our best operating earnings quarter in two years and our best net income quarter in 2.5 years.  Each of our growth engines delivered strong improvement in assets under management which coupled with ongoing expense discipline produced strong operating leverage.
It was a quarter in which the continuous implementation of our strategy even during the crisis began to show positive results and a quarter in which our investment portfolio continued to perform well and in line with our expectations.
Compared to the same period a year ago, we achieved strong improvement across a range of key measures. At $256 million, operating earnings were up $92 million or 56%, driving earnings per share up 25%.  Net income was up $78 million or 69% as realized capital losses remain manageable and continue to emerge as expected.
Assets under management were up $57 billion or 24% to $293 billion.  As of quarter end, we had recovered more than three-fourths of the drop in assets under management from our high as of yearend 2007 to our low on March 31, 2009.  
Book value, including other comprehensive income per share, was up 212%.  This reflects continued improvement in net unrealized losses including nearly $1 billion of pretax improvement in the first quarter for fixed maturity securities primarily from narrowing credit spreads.
In addition, on a sequential basis, total company operating return on equity improved to 11.5%, up 90 basis points from year end after improving 40 basis points in the fourth quarter.  While down from a year ago, this reflects our May 2009 equity raise, the full impact of which will be realized next quarter.
Overall, across a broad range of measures, from the bottom line measures of operating earnings and net income, to top line items like sales, flows, and assets under management, results are emerging in line with or better than our expectations for the businesses.
While we’re benefiting from improvement in the credit and equity markets, we believe the results demonstrate continued strong execution of our diversified business strategy.  This has enabled us to deliver very solid results even as high unemployment continues to affect each of our employee benefit businesses.
As the economy improves we expect to see an acceleration of our growth given that small and medium businesses have historically been the primary source of job creation.  Terry will follow my comments with further detail on the quarter including a discussion of the investment portfolio.  I’ll focus my comments on execution, our ongoing progress implementing our strategy to grow our asset accumulation businesses in the US, Latin America, and Asia, and our global asset management business.  
On execution, our ongoing progress implementing our strategy to grow our asset accumulation businesses in the US, Latin America and Asia and our global asset management business.  As I mentioned, operating earnings improved substantially from a year ago.  Our growth engines, the US accumulation businesses, Principal International and Principle Global Investors contributed $90 million of our $92 million improvement, more than doubling from a year ago on a combined basis.  
These gains reflect improvement in the investment markets, the depth and breadth of our asset management and accumulation offerings and our increasing momentum with key third party distribution alliances.  The gains also reflect the ongoing positive benefits of our prior expense actions and continuing expense discipline which is producing strong operating leverage as assets under management continues to build.  
In the first quarter 2010, the US accumulation businesses delivered $950 million of positive net cash flows, down from a year ago when we had a single large retirement sale but solidly better then the past three quarters.  On $1.7 billion of sales in the first quarter, full service accumulation delivered $640 million of net cash flow.  Total retirement suite accounted for 63% of sales during the quarter based on assets and continues to provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Driven by our steady improvement in sales, transfer deposits for the first quarter were 9% higher than our result for the last two quarters of 2009 combined.  
Full service accumulation sales pipeline and “activity” continues to build steadily as advisors renew their focus on growing their businesses, though still down from 2008 levels.  However, small business owners reported little pickup in their sales or confidence in March with only one of the ten components of the small business optimism index showing improvement.  
The environment also continues to pressure recurring deposits which were down 5% or $170 million from a year ago.  The good news is that many of these pressures our easing.  For the first time in four quarters we saw a sequential increase in total eligible plan participants.  And plan sponsors are beginning to restore matching contributions and we’ve seen a small number of employers re-hire eliminated positions.  As a quick reminder, second quarter has historically been our lowest quarter of flows for this business with seasonally low sales resulting in seasonally low transfer deposits.
Moving to principal funds on $2.1 billion of sales, we delivered $110 million of net cash flows in the first quarter.  This was our best quarter of flows since June 2008 and compares to an industry in outflow for the quarter.  Excluding money market, principal funds achieved net cash flows of approximately $170 million for the quarter and more than $600 million over the trailing 12 months.  Principal funds long-term sales improved 15% from a year ago.  
This reflects continued success with our national channel of outside broker dealers, our largest distribution channel for funds which delivered a 35% improvement in sales from a year ago.  It also reflects good success with recent product launches such as our global diversified income fund which captured $210 million of new investments in its first quarter of active marketing. 
Global asset management had unaffiliated out flows of $1.2 billion in the first quarter.  Institutional search activity in the US and around the world remains subdued and substantially below 2008 levels. Over the past couple of quarters, we’ve also seen out flows from our stable value funds due to rebalancing as well as rebalancing out of equities as some institutions have taken gains after the market run up.  
But here again, we see an improving picture.  Unaffiliated deposits increased more than 20% from year end including more than $1 billion of funding during the quarter from new clients.  Recent new client wins have covered a wide range of offerings from large and small cap growth to [Asia] equities to fixed-income for clients in the US, Europe and Asia.  We’re also seeing search activity pick-up in a number of areas.  In North America where consultants are estimating that search activity will pick up by 10% in 2010 and in Latin American, Asia and the Middle East, where we’re seeing significant pick-up in search activity from sovereign investors.  
Moving to Principal International, first quarter net cash flows was $700 million excluding money market withdrawals in India.  Over the trailing 12 months Principal International’s net cash flows exceeded $3 billion or 13% of beginning of period assets under management.  As announced last Friday, we signed a definitive agreement to renew our joint venture with Banco Brazil for an additional twenty-three years.  Brasilprev is a pension market leader in Brazil reflecting the strength of Banco Brazil’s distribution platform as the largest bank in Latin America and The Principal’s expertise in retirement.  
Our joint venture has enjoyed remarkable success in its first ten years, including compounded annual growth and operating earnings of 25% over the past five years and 30% compounded annual growth in assets under management.  We believe that future opportunity is even greater as a result of recent acquisitions by Banco that further expand their distribution platform as well as their client base which now stands at 54 million customers.  As an early sign of this, customer deposits since signing the Memorandum of Understanding in October 2009, are up 57% compared to the same period a year ago.  
I mentioned earlier that we’ve continued to execute our global asset accumulation and asset management strategy even in the face of the financial crisis over the past two years.  As another example of this, about a year ago we expanded our distribution relationship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch which previously covered mutual funds, separately managed accounts and nonqualified deferred compensation to also cover defined contribution plans and our offshore [Dublin] funds.  
Over the trailing 12 months this relationship has produced $1.1 billion of sales on a combined basis.  This translates into 27% growth over the same period ending a year ago and illustrates the competitive advantages we gain by offering multiple asset management and accumulation products on alliance partner platforms.  
I’d also like to comment on our current equity and excess capital positions.  At $8.7 billion at quarter end, stockholders equity is at its highest level for the principal as a publicly traded company.  This reflects improvement in asset valuations, capital raising activities in 2009 and growth in retained earnings.  Excess capital at $1.8 billion is also a historical high for the company.  
This means that we are at one of the strongest financial positions in our history which is a positive that some environmental uncertainties remain.  While we’re committed to holding higher levels of capital in the future, we believe our strong earnings profile and improved market fundamentals will present an opportunity to increase shareholder value over time.  As always, we’ll look at capital deployment options in a disciplined and thoughtful way.  
I’ll take one more minute to cover three unrelated areas.  First, we believe that US commercial real estate have bottomed and that the rebound in the REIT and CMBS pricing will continue to provide additional positive momentum.  This momentum will ultimately bring positive cash flows to the market. 
Second, we’re seeing good results and positive feedback around our America Rebuilds Media and Advertising Campaign.  Individuals are increasing their focus on financial planning and their commitment to savings.  We expect this to have a very positive impact on The Principal brand.  
Finally, I’d like to mentioned that we’ve been fortunate to receive some very important, third party recognition in 2010.  For the eighth straight year, we were named a top 50 Company by the National Association of Female Executives.  We received two [Lipper] fund awards for consistent multi-year performance and achievement that showcases our investment expertise and long-term view.  
Brasilprev was recognized as the number one company in the pension segment for customer service.  And The Principal was recognized again by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world’s most ethical companies, one of only three financial services companies to make the list.  
We believe these awards demonstrate the true character of the organization and that The Principal remains a company that customers and investors can rely on.

Startin",1187,"This morning I’m going to focus on three areas, operating earnings and how results are emerging as the economic recovery builds, net income, including the continued solid performance of the investment portfolio, and a strong capital position.  
Starting with first quarter 2010 results, total company operating earnings improved $92 million or 56% compared to a year ago quarter.  This reflects 20% higher average assets under management, prior expense actions and ongoing expense discipline.  Against 19% growth and fee revenues from a year ago, we kept operating expenses essentially flat.  
Our three asset and accumulation segments drove the improvement in operating earnings from a year ago.  U.S. asset accumulation earnings improved $64 million or 69% on $22 billion or 16% higher average count values.  Full service accumulation earnings increased $25 million or 49% from a year ago to $76 million for first quarter 2010, primarily due to a 24% increase in average account values.  
Individual annuities earnings increased $26 million from a year ago to $31 million for first quarter 2010.  The improvement reflects an 11% increase in average account values and $17 million in higher amortization in a deferred policy acquisition costs for first quarter 2009, primarily due to unfavorable equity market performance in that period.  Principal funds earnings increased $8 million from a year ago to $10 million for first quarter 2010, primarily due to a 27% increase in average account values.  
Principal International’s earnings improved $21 million up 123% from a year ago quarter.  Roughly one-third of the improvement reflects strong performance on a local basis.  The remainder reflects improvement from the unfavorable macro-economic conditions that dampened prior year quarter results.  Principal International had added more than $12 billion of assets under management over the trailing 12 months to reach a record $35.7 billion at quarter end.  
The gain reflects not only strong investment performance and favorable currency movements but also continued strong net cash flows as Larry noted.  Principal global investors’ earnings improved $5 million or 76% on 13% growth and average assets under management.  Excluding real estate where asset values declined modestly from a year ago, investment management fees increased 21%.  At the same time PGI reduced total compensation costs by 2% and held total expenses flat.  At $70 million in the first quarter compared to $72 million in the prior year quarter, earnings for the life and health insurance segment were also solid.  
Individual life earnings were $31 million compared to $23 million a year ago.  The increase reflects growth in the block of business and ongoing expense management.  Premium deposits for the division are up 13% from a year ago reflecting a strong increase in single premium universal life sales and steady improvement in UL and BUL renewal deposits.  The health division had operating earnings of $26 million in first quarter compared to $32 million a year ago.  The change primarily reflects a decline in the insured medical covered members.  
The division continues to invest and building proprietary networks and improving claims management in order to improve pricing and gain traction on both new sales and retention.  Specialty benefit earnings were $14 million compared to $17 million in first quarter 2009.  The decline from a year ago primarily reflects unfavorable group disability claims experience.  We do not view this is a systemic issue.  Incidence is down and we view the higher average new claims we experienced this quarter as a temporary phenomenon.  
In thinking about our run rate for total company earnings on a go forward basis, investors should consider several items.  There is seasonality in certain businesses.  The health division has seasonally high earnings in the first quarter with losses in the fourth quarter and specialty benefits earnings are low in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher group life and dental plans. 
 I’d reiterate our expectations that earnings for the life and health insurance segment will be essentially flat in 2010 compared to 2009.   However, there are some unknowns around cost of compliance with health care and regulatory reform that could influence results for the health division and the segment.
I’d also remind you that the definitive agreement related to Brasilprev changes are economic interest in the joint venture reducing Principal International’s earnings run rate by approximately $10 million to $12 million per quarter after tax starting in the third quarter, with about half of that impact in the second quarter.  Reflecting this change in earnings run rate, we expect segments return on equity a year in 2010 to be approximately 9%, returning to 11% in 2012.  
As one final item, investment only earnings benefitted by about three cents per share in the first quarter primarily from a receivable recovery and our opportunistic early redemption of medium term notes.  At $191 million in the first quarter, total company net income was solid as well.  Net realized capital losses were $57 million, a fifth consecutive quarter of very manageable losses in the $50 million to $60 million range.  
This reflects strong asset liability management which enabled us to avoid forced selling and broad asset diversification which lengthens the period over which losses emerge in a downturn making losses more manageable.  Losses on fixed maturity credit related impairments in sales improved 21% from a year ago quarter is lower losses on corporate bonds more than offset higher losses on CMBS and residential asset backed securities.  
Losses on commercial whole loans were also down from a year ago, a drop of 42% and at $11 million, our lowest quarter of losses since year end 2008.  We continue to expect credit related losses to improve and estimate they will be approximately $100 million lower in 2010 after tax then in 2009.  
Let me quickly cover our limited sovereign exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.  As of March 31, it totaled $70 million.  In addition, we have no exposure to Greek or Portuguese banks.  Let me also comment on a risk based capital ratio and capital position.  As of quarter end, we estimate our risk based capital ratio to be in the range of 440% to 450%.  
We also have substantial cash at the holding company providing additional flexibility.  Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we had $1.8 billion of total excess capital at quarter end,  about $1 billion at the life company and about $800 million at the holding company.  Given the strength of our balance sheet, investors are re-focusing their intention on our growth prospects.  
So let me close with a few thoughts on the strength of our position going forward.  PGI starts a second quarter with $212 billion of assets under management, 17% higher than this time a year ago.  Combined account values for full service accumulation and mutual funds, totaled $132 billion, up 30% from a year ago.  
Finally, Principal International goes into the second quarter with a record $36 billion of assets under management, an increase of 52%.  This increase in assets under management and account values positions our fee-based businesses, businesses that are not capital intensive and do not rely on general account guarantees, for continued strong revenue growth in 2010.  
This concludes our prepared remarks.

I would say that we’ve been commenting over the last couple of quarters that we have been seeing increases in what we call created pipeline which is sort of the new business that’s dropping into the pipeline.  Again there are several cuts that we could take.  But we’ve been seeing increases in creative pipeline.  
So, I guess I would take a bit of exception to the notion that we sort of missed the first quarter renewal. I think that we have seen a participation in the first quarter renewal when you saw the $1.7 billion.  So, I think it is meaningful.  I think again you’re seeing that creative pipeline pick up. 
Just to give you a sense of it in the first quarter the creative pipeline was up about 36% or so.  So, I think we’re again we’re seeing this build quarter by quarter.  We’re seeing it build in terms of new sales.  We’re seeing it build in terms of transfer deposits.  So, I think we are definitely riding the wave that’s going along.  I don’t think there’s any indication we’ve missed any of that.

The first element is to run the business in a profitable way to control the loss ratio and I think the experience of the last several quarters has indicated we’re very much in good shape on that.
The second element which is a little bit more difficult is ultimately stabilizing and growing the membership base.

One is around network development which we’re doing in Tennessee, we’re doing in Georgia, we’re doing in Texas.  This will take several years for us to turn this business unit around but the network development clearly is a big part of that turnaround strategy as well as renegotiating some of our leased networks.
And then maybe the last comment is related to the healthcare reform.  We don’t have all the answers today and we’re studying that very closely.  And again this minimum loss ratio is one of the key drivers that we’ll have to respond to very quickly here in the course of the next couple of quarters.

Let me just make a couple of comments generally.  Again I think that one of the reasons quite frankly Andrew that we have come through the financial crisis in ’08 and ’09 in my opinion better than many of our peers is because the balance and the risk diversification that we have in our businesses.  And one big element of that is the risk based nature of those businesses.
So, I actually look at 2008 and 2009 and I think it was actually very beneficial for the organization to have those businesses and to have the relative stability of the operating earnings that they provided. And I’m very very much aware of that as we go forward.  And I would be very concerned about anything that would tend to cause the loss in the diversification.
Second thing is obviously I think we continue to do a good job of managing it financially or at least remain above a 15% level which I think is a very very strong performance.
And third I’d just say that any sort of sale that would result from those businesses and I don’t know why I do that since I like the diversification and the return, but any sale that I would make of those would end up being a dilutive sale by the time I ended up paying taxes, losing the covariance benefits and then having to deal with orphaned overheads.
So, it doesn’t seem to me given the significance of those businesses to our S&B strategy that I can find very much reason to want to do that.

And then you saw during the financial crisis more focus on that, and actually an increase about a year ago in terms of the general account as a percent of the account value.  
What you're seeing now as the economy's recovering is that general account is actually declining, and it's not only in terms of absolute dollars, but in terms of a percentage of the account value as well.  So those higher revenue dollars coming from the general account type of investment is declining, as both a dollar amount as well as a percent.  So that's contributing to that revenue decline as a percent of account value.  
Now that being said, there's less cost of providing the interest credited to them, so there's an offset in the benefit claims' settlement as well.  So that gets down to the point where Larry had talked about, is the return to profitability.  Is even though you're seeing a decline in the revenue, you're seeing a decline in the expenses as well and improving the margin overall.

Having said that I don’t think that there’s any senior management team or any board of directors that can come out of a set of years like 2008 and 2009 and not conclude that one of the learning’s that you’re going to have coming out of that is that you’d probably be holding somewhat higher levels of capital going forward than you have in the past.
And I think historically what we’ve said is that we had sort of in the old days a targeted level of excess capital $400 million to $800 million and you can think that the levels going forward will be somewhat higher than that.  But at the same time I don’t know that would be $1.8 billion.  But we still have a number of quarters.  We’ve got to see an economic recovery that takes hold.  We’ve got to see stability in the drift which we actually saw in the first quarter.  And then finally what I’d say is I think that so long as the four rating agencies all continue to have the US life insurance industry on a negative outlook I think we’ll need to see some changed views of the outlook going forward by the rating agencies in order to get them more comfortable around capital management as well.

As most of you probably already know, John Egan recently joined The Principal as our new Investor Relations Officer. He's replacing Tom Graf, who will be retiring later this month after 38 years of service with the organization. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Tom for his significant contributions over the course of his career and to welcome John to the company.
Moving to results. First quarter was a very solid start to the year for The Principal, as we delivered our best operating earnings quarter in two years and our best net income quarter in 2.5 years. Each of our growth engines delivered strong improvement in assets under management, which coupled with ongoing expense discipline, produced strong operating leverage. It was the quarter in which the continuous implementation of our strategy, even during the crisis, began to show positive results in a quarter in which our investment portfolio continued to perform well and in line with our expectations. 
Compared to the same period a year ago, we achieved strong improvement across a range of key measures. At $256 million, operating earnings were up $92 million or 56%, driving earnings per share up 25%. Net income was up $78 million or 69% as realized capital losses remained manageable and continue to emerge as expected. Assets under management were up $57 billion or 24% to $293 billion. As of quarter end, we had recovered more than 3/4 of the drop in assets under management from our high as of year end 2007 to our low on March 31, 2009. And book value, including other comprehensive income per share was up 212%. This reflects continued improvement in net unrealized losses, including nearly $1 billion of pretax improvement in the first quarter for fixed maturity securities primarily from narrowing credit spreads. 
In addition, on a sequential basis, total company operating return on equity improved to 11.5%, up 90 basis points from year end after improving 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. While down from a year ago, this reflects our May 2009 equity raise, the full impact of which will be realized next quarter. 
Overall, across a broad range of measures, from the bottom line measures of operating earnings and net income to top line items like sales, flows and assets under management, results are emerging in line with or better than our expectations for the businesses. While we're benefiting from improvement in the credit and equity markets, we believe the results demonstrate continued strong execution of our diversified business strategy. This has enabled us to deliver very solid results, even as high unemployment continues to affect each of our Employee Benefit businesses. 
As the economy improves, we'd expect to see an acceleration of our growth given that small and medium businesses have historically been the primary source of job creation. Terry will follow my comments with further detail on the quarter, including a discussion of the investment portfolio. I'll focus my comments on execution, our ongoing progress, implementing our strategy to grow our Asset Accumulation businesses in the U.S., Latin America and Asia in our Global Asset Management business.
As I mentioned, operating earnings improved substantially from a year ago. Our growth engines, the U.S. Accumulation businesses, Principal International and Principal Global Investors contributed $90 million of our $92 million improvement, more than doubling from a year ago on a combined basis. These gains reflect the improvement in the investment markets, the depth and breadth of our Asset Management and Accumulation offerings and our increasing momentum with key third-party distribution alliances. The gains also reflect the ongoing positive benefits of our prior expense actions and continuing expense discipline, which is producing strong operating leverage as assets under management continues to build. 
In the first quarter 2010, the U.S. Accumulation businesses delivered $950 million of positive net cash flows, down from a year ago when we had a single large retirement sale but solidly better than the past three quarters. On $1.7 billion of sales in the first quarter, Full Service Accumulation delivered $640 million of net cash flow. Total retirement suite accounted for 63% of sales during the quarter based on assets, and continues to provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Driven by our steady improvement in sales, transfer deposits for the first quarter were 9% higher than our result for the last two quarters of 2009 combined. Full Service Accumulation sales pipeline and ""activity"" continues to build steadily as advisors renew their focus on growing their business, though still down from 2008 levels. 
However, small business owners reported little pick up in their sales or confidence in March with only one of the 10 components of the Small Business Optimism Index showing improvement. The environment also continues to pressure recurring deposits, which were down 5% or $170 million from a year ago. The good news is that many of these pressures are easing. For the first time in four quarters, we saw a sequential increase in total eligible plan participants. And plan sponsors are beginning to restore matching contributions. And we've seen a small number of employers rehire eliminated positions. As a quick reminder, second quarter has historically been our lowest quarter of flows for this business, with seasonally low sales resulting in seasonally low transfer deposits.
Moving to Principal Funds. On $2.1 billion of sales, we delivered $110 million of net cash flows in the first quarter. This was our best quarter of flows since June 2008 and compares to an industry in outflow for the quarter. Excluding money market, Principal Funds achieved net cash flows of  approximately $170 million for the quarter and more than $600 million over the trailing 12 months. Principal Funds long term sales improved 15% from a year ago. This reflects continued success with our national channel of outside broker-dealers, our largest distribution channel for funds, which delivered a 35% improvement in sales from a year ago. It also reflects good success with recent product launches, such as our Global Diversified Income Fund, which captured $210 million of new investments in its first quarter of active marketing.
Global Asset Management had unaffiliated outflows of $1.2 billion during the first quarter. Institutional search activity in the U.S. and around the world remains subdued and substantially below 2008 levels. Over the past couple of quarters, we've also seen outflows from our Stable Value Funds due to rebalancing as well as rebalancing out of equities as some institutions have taken gains after the market run up. But here again, we see an improving picture. Unaffiliated deposits increased more than 20% from year end, including more than $1 billion of funding during the quarter from new clients. Recent new client wins have covered a wide range of offerings from large and small cap growth to Asia equities to fixed income for clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. We're also seeing search activity pick up in a number of areas. In North America, where consultants are estimating that search activity will pick up by 10% in 2010. And in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, where we're seeing significant pick up in search activity from sovereign investors. 
Moving to Principal International, first quarter net cash flows were $700 million excluding money market withdrawals in India. Over the trailing 12 months, Principal International's net cash flows exceeded $3 billion or 13% of beginning of period assets under management. As announced last Friday, we've signed a definitive agreement to renew our joint venture with Banco Brasil for an additional 23 years. Brasilprev is a pension market leader in Brazil, reflecting the strength of Banco Brasil's distribution platform of as largest bank in Latin America and the  Principal's expertise in retirement. 
Our joint venture has enjoyed remarkable success in its first 10 years, including compounded annual growth in operating earnings of 25% over the past five years and 30% compounded annual growth in assets under management. We believe the future opportunity is even greater as a result of recent acquisitions by Banco that further expand our distribution platform, as well as our client base, which now stands at 54 million customers. 
As an early sign of this, customer deposits and signing the Memorandum of Understanding in October 2009 are up 57% compared to the same period a year ago. I mentioned earlier that we've continued to execute our Global Asset Accumulation and Asset Management strategy even in the face of the financial crisis over the past two years. 
As another example of this, about a year ago, we  expanded our distribution relationship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which previously covered mutual funds, separately managed accounts and non-qualified deferred compensation to also cover defined contribution plans and our offshore Dublin funds. Over the trailing 12 months, this relationship has produced $1.1 billion of sales on a combined basis. This translates into 27% growth over the same period ending a year ago and illustrates the competitive advantages we gain by offering multiple Asset Management and Accumulation products on Alliance partner platforms. 
I'd also like to comment on our current equity and excess capital positions. At $8.7 billion at quarter end, stockholders' equity is at its highest level for the Principal as a publicly traded company. This reflects improvement in asset valuations, capital raising activities in 2009 and growth in retained earnings. Excess capital at $1.8 billion is also a in historical high for the company. This means we are at one of the strongest financial positions in our history, which is a positive given that some environmental uncertainties remain. While we're committed to holding higher levels of capital in the future, we believe our strong earnings profile in improving market fundamentals will present an opportunity to increase shareholder value over time. As always, we'll look at capital deployment options in a disciplined and thoughtful way. 
I'll take one more minute to cover three unrelated areas. First, we believe U.S. commercial real estate values have bottomed and that the rebound in the REIT and CMBS pricing will continue to provide additional positive momentum. This momentum will ultimately bring positive cash flows to the market. Second, we're seeing good results and positive feedback around our America Rebuilds media and advertising Campaign. Individuals are increasing their focus on financial planning and their commitment to savings. We expect this to have a very positive impact on the Principal brand. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that we've been fortunate to receive some very important third party recognition in 2010. For the eighth straight year, we were named a Top 50 Company by the National Association of Female Executives. We received two Lipper Fund Awards for a consistent multi-year performance and achievement that showcases our investment expertise and long term view. 
Brasilprev was recognized as the number one company in the Pension segment for customer service.
And the Principal was recognized again, by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies, one of only three financial services companies to make the list. We believe these awards demonstrate the true character of the organization and that the Principal remains a company that customers and investors can rely on. Terry?"

This morning I'm going to focus on three areas: Operating earnings and how results are emerging as the economic recovery builds; net income, including the continued solid performance of the investment portfolio; and our strong capital position. 
Starting with first quarter 2010 results, total company operating earnings improved $92 million or 56% compared to a year ago quarter. This reflects 20% higher average assets under management, prior expense actions and ongoing expense discipline. Against 19% growth in fee revenues from a year ago, we kept operating expenses essentially flat.
Our three Asset Management and Accumulation segments  drove the improvement in operating earnings from a year ago. U.S. Asset Accumulation earnings improved $64 million or 69% on $22 billion, or 16% higher  average comp values. Full Service Accumulation earnings increased $25 million or 49% from a year ago to $76 million for first quarter 2010, primarily due to a 24% increase in average account values.
Individual annuities earnings increased $26 million from a year ago to $31 million for first quarter 2010. The improvement reflects an 11% increase in average account values and $17 million of higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for first quarter 2009, primarily due to unfavorable equity market performance in that period.
Principal Funds earnings increased $8 million from a year ago to $10 million dollars for first quarter 2010, primarily due to a 27% increase in average account values. Principal International's earnings improved $21 million, up 123% from a year ago quarter. Roughly 1/3 of the improvement reflects strong performance on a local basis. The remainder reflects improvement from the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions that dampen prior year quarter results. 
Principal International had added more than $12 billion of assets under management over the trailing 12 months to reach a record $35.7 billion at quarter end. The gain reflects not only strong investment performance and favorable currency movements but also continued strong net cash flows, as Larry noted. 
Principal Global Investors' earnings improved $5 million dollars or 76% on 13% growth in the average assets under management. Excluding real estate, where asset values declined modestly from a year ago, investment management fees increased 21%. At the same time, PGI reduced total compensation cost by 2% and held total expenses flat. 
At $70 million in the first quarter, compared to $72 million in the prior year quarter, earnings for the Life and Health Insurance segment were also solid. Individual Life earnings were $31 million compared to $23 million a year ago. The increase reflects growth in the block of business and ongoing expense management. Premium and deposits for the division are up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a strong increase in single premium. Universal Life sales and steady improvement in UL and VUL renewal deposits. 
The Health division had operating earnings of $26 million in first quarter compared to $32 million a year ago. The change primarily reflects a decline in the insured medical covered members. The division continues to invest in building proprietary networks in improving claims management, in order to improve pricing and gain traction on both new sales and retention. 
Specialty Benefit earnings were $14 million compared to $17 million in first quarter 2009. The decline from a year ago primarily reflects unfavorable group disability claims experience. We do not view this as a systemic issue. Incidence is down and we view the higher average new claims we experienced this quarter as a temporary phenomenon. 
In thinking about our run rate for total company earnings on a go forward basis, investors should consider several items. There is seasonality in certain businesses. The Health division has seasonally high earnings in the first quarter with losses in the fourth quarter. And Specialty Benefits earnings are low in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher group life and dental plans. 
I'd reiterate our expectations that earnings for the Life and Health Insurance segment will be essentially flat in 2010 compared to 2009.  However, there are some unknowns around cost of compliance with healthcare and regulatory reform that could influence results for the Health division in this segment. 
I'd also remind you that the definitive agreement related to Brasilprev changes our economic interest in the joint venture. Reducing Principal International's earnings run rate by approximately $10 million to $12 million per quarter after tax starting in the third quarter, with about half of that impact in the second quarter. Reflecting this change in earnings run rate, we expect segment's return on equity at year end 2010 to be approximately 9%, returning to 11% in 2012. 
As one final item, Investment Only earnings benefited by about $0.03 per share in the first quarter, primarily from a receivable recovery and our opportunistic early redemption of medium term notes. 
At $191 million in the first quarter, total company net income was solid as well. Net realized capital losses were $57 billion, a fifth consecutive quarter of very manageable losses in the $50 million to $60 million range. This reflects strong asset liability management, which enabled us to avoid forced selling and broad asset diversification, which lengthens the period over which losses emerge in a downturn, making losses more manageable. Losses on fixed maturity credit-related impairments and sales improved 21% from a year ago quarter, as lower losses on corporate bonds more than offset higher losses on CMBS and residential asset-backed securities. 
Losses on commercial mortgage whole loans were also down from a year ago, a drop of 42%. And at $11 million, our lowest quarter of losses since year end 2008. We continue to expect credit-related losses to improve and estimate they will be approximately $100 million lower in 2010 after-tax than in 2009.
Let me quickly cover our limited sovereign exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. As of March 31, it totaled $70 million. In addition, we have no exposure to Greek or Portuguese banks. Let me also comment on our risk-based capital ratio and capital position. As of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be in the range of 440% to 450%. We also have substantial cash at the holding company providing additional flexibility. Relative to a 350% RBC ration, we had $1.8 billion of total excess capital at quarter end, about $1 billion at the life company and about $800 million at the holding company. Given the strength of our balance sheet, investors are refocusing their attention on our growth prospects. 
So let me close with a few thoughts on the strength of our position going forward. PGI starts at second quarter with $212 billion of assets under management, 17% higher than this time a year ago. Combine the comp values for Full Service Accumulation and Mutual Funds totaled $132 billion, up 30% from a year ago. Finally, Principal International goes into the second quarter with a record $36 billion of assets under management, an increase of 52%. This increase in assets under management and account values positions our fee-based businesses, businesses that are not capital intensive and do not rely on general account guarantees, for continued strong revenue growth in 2010. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

I think again, you're seeing that Creative Pipeline pick up, just to give you a sense of it in the first quarter, the Creative Pipeline was up about 36% or so.

And one big element of that is the risk-based nature of those businesses. So I actually look at 2008 and 2009, and I think it was actually very beneficial for the organization to have those businesses and to have the relative stability of the operating earnings that they provided. And I'm very, very much aware of that as we go forward, and I would be very concerned about anything that would tend to cause a loss in the diversification. Second thing is, obviously, I think we continue to do a good of managing it, financially. Our ROEs remain above at 15% level, which I think is a very, very strong performance. And third, any sort of sale that would result from those businesses -- and I don't know why I do that since I like the diversification and the return, but any sales that I would make of those would end up being a dilutive sales by the time I ended up paying taxes, losing the covariance benefits and then having to deal with orphaned overhead. So it doesn't seem to me, given the significance of those businesses to our SMB strategy that I can find very much reason to want to do that."

And I think historically what we've said is that we had sort of in the old days, the targeted level of excess capital $400 million to $800 million, and you can think that the levels going forward will be somewhat higher than that. But at the same time, I don't know that will be $1.8 billion, but we still have a number of quarters we've got to see. We've got to see an economic recovery that takes hold. We've got to see sort of stability in the drift, which we actually saw in the first quarter. And then finally, what I'd say is I think that so long as the four rating agencies, all continue to have the U.S. life insurance industry on  negative outlook, I think we'll need to see some change to views of the outlook going forward by the rating agencies in order to get them more comfortable around capital management as well.

You also -- in the seasonality of our Group Life and Dental business, that has seasonally low earnings in the first quarter, and you should see some pickup in that throughout the year. The investment is scaling back, and we're not going to go ahead and make any estimations of the opportunities towards MT [ph] (01:04:17) and buybacks that we had in the first quarter, so that, you need to take into consideration.

In my prepared remarks, I’d like to briefly discuss the results for second quarter in 2010 to date, discuss the ongoing implementation of our global strategy and close with a few comments about the future. Terry, will cover the results in more detail following my comments.
Let’s start with second quarter results. In view of the slowdown in economic growth and negative returns for the equity market in second quarter, we view the operating results of $204 million or $0.63 per share as solid. If you adjust results for both the second quarter 2010 and 2009, for DAC amortization true-ups associated with equity market returns, we see second quarter 2010 results of $215 million against second quarter 2009 results of $186 million, an increase of 16%.
Looking at the results for our growth engines, Principal International, Principal Global Investors, and Principal Funds all had reported double digit earnings growth, improving 33% on a combined basis. If you adjust the performance of full service accumulation or the impact of equity market true-ups on DAC amortization, you see operating earnings up 21%.
In terms of other financial metrics, book value per share including AOCI ended the quarter at $26.23 up 4.6% from last quarter and up 62% from a year ago. We also moved in to a net unrealized capital gain position as of June 30th, from a $4.8 billion net unrealized capital loss position a year ago.
This improvement in financial metrics reflects the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the economy recovers. It also demonstrates the value of our strong asset liability management, the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio and our liquidity management. All of which allows us to weather even extended periods of market stress and dislocation.
As we have said before, it is difficult to draw conclusions in business trends from a single quarter. But in general, we view sales and deposits as an improving picture with results being more mixed for net cash flows.
Second quarter, again, demonstrated the importance of our international businesses as Principal International generated a record $1.5 billion in net cash flows in second quarter, bringing their 12-month total to a record $3.4 billion or 12% of beginning of period assets.
Principal Funds and individual annuities also delivered positive flows for the quarter of approximately $130 million each, thanks to solid sales.
Full service accumulation has negative flows of $330 million for second quarter. This reflects the seasonality of sales with lower transfer deposits usually in the second quarter and the loss of a larger case based primarily on price. Importantly, we are seeing a steady increase in sales pipeline.
Sales activity, which was $918 million for the quarter up 27% and recurring deposits, which were up 1% over second quarter 2009. This is the first increased in recurring deposits in seven quarters.
Full service accumulation net cash flow remains positive through six months and we expect flows to be positive for the full year against an industry projected by Siruly [ph] to be an outflow in 2010.
Other positive indicators besides pipeline or their close rates continue to improve and proprietary investment performance results are solid.
We expect full year 2010 full service accumulation sales to come in about 15 to 20% higher than 2009 due to our alliance distribution efforts and the competitiveness of our Total Retirement Sweep Platform, an operating margin for full service accumulation remains steady and in line with our expectations.
Principal Global Investors had unaffiliated or third party outflows of $1.6 billion during second quarter. Although their investment performance remains generally good across all asset classes, new deposits for this quarter were low relative to historic levels reflecting a decline in institutional searches in the U.S. and around the world. We also saw higher institutional withdrawals during the quarter as clients continued to change investment and asset allocation strategies and made withdrawals for the purpose of making benefit payments.
That said, unaffiliated deposits had been stable over the past several quarters and are trending up modestly from year end 2009. We continue to be search competitive and continue to win business. Second quarter deposits of $3.3 billion included more than $800 million of funding from new clients covering a wide range of offerings from large and small cap growth to high yield and preferred securities.
As I mentioned, investment performance remains solid overall and has not been a driver of client withdrawals. For Principal Global Investors and its affiliates as of quarter end, 78% of funds were in the top two Morningstar quartiles for the one-year period, 53% for the three-year period and 64% for the five-year period. This includes particular strength in asset allocation funds were 75% or more of our offerings were in the top two Morningstar quartiles for each of the one, three and five-year periods.
As institutions continue to gradually rebalance out of fixed incomes into higher risk assets, we’re seeing flows into assets in which we have particular strength, international and emerging market equities as well as currency. We also expect to benefit as institutions, retail investors and high net worth individuals move money in domestic equities to the stronger U.S. equity managers such as Columbus Circle and Edge.
We are also seeing substantial interest in new searches for core U.S. commercial real estate. Given the strength of our pipeline, dollars committed to fund in the third quarter and the pickup we’re beginning to see in institutional search activity, our outlook for institutional flows remains positive for the rest of 2010.
Moving to six-month performance, it is easier to see the underlying trends and we’re pleased with the results overall. Each of our growth engines delivered strong improvement in assets under management, which coupled with ongoing expense discipline, produced strong operating leverage.
Total company earnings at $459 million through midyear are up $95 million or 26% on 13% higher average assets under management.
Looking at our three growth engines, earnings for the U.S. accumulation businesses are up 37%. PGI’s earnings are up 62% and Principal International’s earnings are up 57%.
At $325 million, net income improved solidly as well, up 23% compared to the six months ended a year ago.
These results reflect the value of our broad and geographically diverse mix of businesses. The revenue and earnings stability of our risk businesses, the steady deposit flow from our employer sponsored retirement businesses and the superior earnings growth from asset management and accumulation businesses in Asia and Latin America.
Now, I’d like to spend a few minutes discussing the ongoing implementation of our strategy even during this difficult economic environment.
In the U.S., we continue to make progress placing multiple products on third party distribution platforms reflecting our ongoing focus on meeting customer needs across the accumulation to payout continuum. As a result, during the second quarter, each of our three largest U.S. accumulation businesses Full Service Accumulation, Mutual Funds and Individual Annuities delivered double digit sales growth compared to the year ago quarter, driving a $650 million or 22% improvement in combined sales.
We’ve also continued to broaden our distribution by putting more focus on third party administrators, which is not only resulting in new sales but also helping us retain business, where customers are looking to move to an unbundled solution.
For the first half of 2010, we sold or retained more than a half billion dollars of business through third party administrators, an increase of more than 75% from the same period a year ago.
At Principal International, we continue to work closely with bank partners to increase penetration of their existing customer base.
In the third quarter, our China joint venture will also begin marketing its recently approved Qualify Domestic Institutional Investor or QDII Fund, a fund investing in international securities for Chinese investors. A significant portion of the $700 million quota will be managed by Principal Global Investors.
We also continue to tap into growth opportunities in Southeast Asia. This includes the recent purchase by our Malaysian joint venture of a Thai mutual fund company and its subsequent successful launch of a property fund.
In June, Siruly [ph] released their asset management industry projections through 2014. This study speaks to the outstanding growth potential for Principal International and Principal Global Investors.
Total global assets under management are projected to increase by 44% between 2009 and 2014 for a compounded annual gross rate of about 8%. While growth in the U.S. is expected to be solid at 7% per year, more telling are the projections for growth in countries in countries where Principal International has built a significant presence, Brazil, Chile, China and Mexico are projected to have the highest growth rates of all countries in the report with mutual fund asset growth ranging from 14 to 19% and retirement asset growth ranging from 13 to 24%.
This affirms the appropriateness of our strategy and the significant opportunity we have going forward to grow our businesses given our strong positioning in these markets today.
Let me close with some thoughts on the future. Our outlook remains one of cautious optimism. We expect a more moderate but sustainable expansion. We do not view recent slowing growth as the start of a more severe slowdown or a double dip recession, and we continue to see signs in many of our businesses that support this, including improvement from a year ago and recurring contributions to define contribution plans and in fewer retirement plan terminations.
I recently returned from a trip to Asia, more convinced than ever that the strategy we’ve been pursuing for the last 10 years to export our retirement and asset management expertise is the right one. In aligning our domestic expertise with some of the largest distribution partners in the world, we’ve positioned the principal for superior long-term growth.
Between two of our joint venture partners, Banco do Brasil and China Construction Bank, we have accessed to more than 200 million customers through some 18,000 branches in two markets that are relatively untapped and that are projected to be among the five largest middle class populations by 2025.
Next a few comments on a recently passed financial regulatory reform. We do not anticipate any material impact on our operations or results. One area we are watching is the impact of reform on the derivatives markets. While we support transparency on swaps and derivatives, it may increase hedging cost in the longer term, which could have some modest impact, and well not a part of regulatory reform, we believe higher capital standards for the life industry are likely in the future.
A few final points. We believe that we will continue to see improving fundamentals for corporate credit and commercial real estate. We believe that losses in these areas have pit and that the future losses will be quite manageable. Because of the improvement in asset valuations, our capital raising activities in 2009 in growth and retained earnings, stockholders equity is at its highest level for the Principal as a publicly traded company, $9 billion at quarter end.
While we intend to hold more capital, which Terry will discuss in more detail. We have substantial flexibility with $2 billion in excess capital above a 350% risk based capital ratio at midyear.
We’ll continue to look for appropriate opportunities to deploy some of this capital. Our priorities for capital use are unchanged with our first priority to support existing business, although our action to grow our fee-based businesses and pullback on investment only means we need less for this, and our second priority, mergers and acquisitions, where we are seeing an increase in opportunities both domestically and internationally.
As we’ve demonstrated in the past, we’ll continue to deploy capital in a disciplined and thoughtful way.
Terry?

This morning I’ll focus on operating earnings, including continued strong expense management, net income including continued solid performance of the investment portfolio and I’ll also comment further on our strong and flexible capital position.
Starting with total company results, second quarter 2010 operating earnings at $204 million, were up 1.5% compared to a year ago quarter. There were a number of items impacting comparability between periods. The two largest were higher DAC amortization expense in the current quarter due to equity market true-ups totaling $26 million after tax between individual annuities, full service accumulation and individual life, and $7 million of lower after tax earnings from investment only reflecting the absence of earnings this quarter from early redemptions of medium term notes.
Excluding these items, total company earnings improved 20% on 17% higher average assets under management. Let me quickly quantify a couple of the larger items impacting our reported earnings per share of $0.63.
DAC true-ups for market performance and the U.S. asset accumulation segment as well as the individual life division, dampened second quarter earnings by $0.04 per share in total. Life and health segment earnings were also dampened earnings were also dampened by $0.03 per share primarily due to reserved development and strengthening in the health division.
As Larry indicated, our asset management and accumulation growth engines continued to deliver strong performance and we continue to benefit from our ongoing discipline around expense management.
Through midyear, we held operating expenses essentially flat against 13% growth in average assets under management. We’ve strategically reduced expenses in the guaranteed businesses and in the life and health segment. This has enabled us to increase investment in our asset management and accumulation growth engines in the areas of distribution resources, product development and technology to drive productivity gains.
Though earnings for the U.S.S. accumulation segment were down $8 million on a reported basis, the accumulation businesses, which are the segments growth engines delivered 20% growth adjusting for DAC equity market true-ups relative to an 18% increase in average account values.
Principal Fund’s earnings improved 75% from a year ago on 23% higher average account values. Full service accumulation earnings again adjusting for DAC market true-ups grew 21% on 19% higher average account values, reflecting the rebound in account values and continued expense management, full service accumulations operating return on account values through midyear is up 11% to 30 basis points on an annualize basis. The drop in individual annuity as earnings from a year ago, primarily reflects a $14 million after tax increase in DAC amortization expense compared to the year ago quarter.
Principal International earnings improved $6 million or 19% from the year ago quarter on 41% growth in average asset under management. Excluding approximately $3 million of reserve adjustments that dampen current quarter results, earnings growth for the segment was consistent with the growth in assets under management.
Principal International has added $9 billion of asset under management over the trailing 12 months to reach a record $38 billion at quarter end. The gain reflects not only strong investment performance and favorable currency movement, but also continued strong net cash flow.
Principal Global Investor’s earnings improved $4 million or 50% on 11% growth in average assets under management. Excluding real estate where asset values decline modestly from a year ago, investment management fees increased 17%.
At $55 million in the second quarter, compared to $58 million in the prior year quarter, earnings for the Life and Health Insurance segment were also solid. Earnings from Specialty Benefits were up slightly from a year ago.
Importantly, during the quarter, the division experienced sequential growth in premium and fees for the first time since fourth quarter 2008, improved lapse rates from a year ago across all four lines of business and favorable claims results in a group disability income line after unfavorable experience in the first quarter.
Health earnings were down $1 million in line with the decline in the covered members. Favorable experience in the group medical block overall was offset by the need to strengthen reserves within our small block of individual conversion policies.
Individual Life earnings were $26 million compared to $28 million a year ago as growth in the block of business was offset by the impact of market performance on DAC amortization expense.
A quick explanation of the variances from a year ago for benefits and claims expense and DAC amortization expense, we had high growth death claims during the second quarter, which were substantially offset by reinsurance. On an economic basis, our loss in these claims was $2 million after tax. However, due to gap reinsurance accounting, we defer recognition of [inaudible] to cover the benefit of reinsurance. This resulted in an increase in benefits and claims expense and a decrease in fee revenues, which was partially offset by deferred recognition of related DAC amortization expense.
Excluding DAC market true-ups and the impact of reinsurance accounting, division earnings in the second quarter were just over $30 million. Before moving on, I’d had to remind you of the seasonality of health division results, I’d reiterate our expectation for essentially flat earnings for the Life and Health segment in 2010 compared to 2009. With the caveat that unknowns around healthcare and regulatory reform could influence results in a Health division and the segment.
I’d also remind you that the change in our economic interest in the Brasilprev joint venture reduces Principal International’s earnings run rate by approximately $10 to 12 million per quarter after tax starting in the third quarter. The second quarter impact was about 1/3 of that based upon the effective date of the new 23-year shareholder’s agreement.
Moving to net income, we view our$134 million results in the second quarter as solid. Net realized capital losses remain manageable at $70 million. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect strong asset liability management and broad asset diversification. Second quarter was a continuation of the steady improvement and credit related losses over the past several quarters.
We, again, saw sequential improvement in corporate credit and from structured risk including CMBS. We also saw sequential improvement from commercial mortgage whole loans, which had its lowest quarter of losses since year end 2008.
Net losses from these categories totaled $46 million in the second quarter, less than half of the losses in the year ago quarter.
Other significant items contributing to current quarter net realized capital losses are $26 million losses on derivative marks, primarily related to interest rate hedging and the impact of declining rates during the quarter, of $72 million capital gain from the change in the company’s economic interest in the Brasilprev joint venture and a $42 million capital loss for Principal Bank, primarily related to its portfolio of home equity loans.
This reflects increased reserves and write-offs due to recent increases in delinquencies and in the banks estimate of loss severity. We will continue to monitor, model and stress this portfolio going forward.
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimated our risk-based capital ratio to be around 440%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2 billion of total excess capital split evenly between the life company and the holding company. The split at midyear reflects a $300 million distribution from the life company to the holding company, which represents roughly half our distribution capacity for the full year.
Given our equity and excess capital positions, we are at one of the strongest financial points in our history, a positive in light of continued environmental uncertainty. Even with our commitment to holding a higher component of excess capital as cushion currently around $1 billion, we clearly have substantial financial flexibility.
As you know, two of the rating agencies recently took the life insurance industry of negative outlook. This along with improving market fundamentals and our businesses ongoing ability to generate free cash flow gives us the ability to increase shareholder value overtime through a strategic capital of redeployment.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions.

Sorry, if my comments were cutting in and out during the early part. What I said there to sort of summarize our view for the year, Steven, is that we expect the 2010 full service accumulation sales to be up approximately - I think we said 15 to 20% over 2009.
Again, we are seeing generally positive trends albeit it’s still a bit early, but we’re seeing positive trends in sales pipeline. We’re seeing positive trends in close rates and as I said, our investment performance from PGI, other affiliates as well as some of our other sub-advisers, generally I would say remains good.
I’ll make a couple of quick comments on the health and 401-K matching and Dan Houston may want to add a little bit more.
In terms of the health business, we have seen some sort of favorable reserve development there. To your point as to whether that’s from people not going to the doctor or what all the factors maybe, I don’t really have that at my hands other than there has been favorable reserve developments, so there does seem to be some trends along the line you indicate. And as far as 401-K, it’s interesting there had been a number of articles here in the last week or so, and I think that by and large those article seem to square pretty well with our experience. Many of our plans are written with a discretionary match, so it’s a little hard to know whether it’s really been “suspend” or whether it’s just - it’s a match that can be discretionary.
But having said that, we think that somewhere between 20 and 25% matches have been restored. I think that’s not completely inconsistent with what was in the Wall Street Journal or what I think was in some of the Hewitt Information a week ago, but Dan might want to comment.

So, I guess Larry from your commentary, it doesn’t sound like there’s too much competition that’s destructive there. So, can we expect kind of stabilization on fees relative to account values and maybe another way to hit this is could we think about Principal being able to maintain kind of 30% ROA in the FSA business going forward?

The one caveat is that again as we have said before, Randy, there is a mix of business issue that’s involved here. So, for example, on our ESOP [ph] business, employer securities provide little if any in the way of fee revenue. Our proprietary investment options generate a higher degree of fee revenue. So, there is very much a mix of business issue here. And so the caveat, in terms of maintaining fees, the answer is yes with the caveat that we’re assuming there’s not a substantial shift or change in mix of business, so that will be the only thing that you’ll need to watch and you can see that in the financial supplement. You can track that quarter by quarter and kind of see how does various buckets are trending and I’ll let Dan add his comments.

We again have, if you use the 350 RBC and we could - people might have different lines, but just to have a common measuring stick, there’s about $2 billion of excess capital. And our thinking right now is that as we look both to higher capital requirements that I alluded to in my remarks, plus we’re very sensitive also around sort of near-term obligations of the holding company. We probably be of a mind today, that we would want to hold somewhere around $1 to 1.2 billion.
The higher amount does not necessarily mean, however, that we have a desire to go out in the next quarter or two and spend down the remaining amount. As I said, I think that the rating agencies, two of the four have moved the industry to neutral, so there are some again some signs that are positive. And so I think as we go forward, as we keep adding to our excess capital position, as the economy and the markets normalize, I think that sort of 750 million number will grow and we will and we’re currently working on lots of plans and ideas around ways to deploy it.

As you said and again you’ve written and commented on this, which I appreciate, we have made conscious decisions here to pullback on some of the more capital intensive businesses particularly the IO business and that has very positive implications going forward.
We used to talk about needing 50% of operating earnings to support the growth of the businesses. We haven’t really retested that in detail to give you a new number today, but clearly because of the pullback of IO, we would need less than that sort of that 50% number going forward. So, we will be generating higher amounts of free cash flow. We will be adding to our excess capital position. And again as we go forward and through the rest of 2010 into 2011, we will need to have and we have been working and continue to have a plan for capital deployment, but again I think it’s a little bit early to be pulling the trigger on that.
So, for now, it’s a very nice position to be in. we want to continue to watch the things that are going on. We have the opportunity to be very opportunistic both in global asset management, in international and U.S. retirement that’s where the capital will go to, and so we just like the position we’re in and we’ll see how it works out over the next quarter or two.

But in terms of ROE growth, the fact that we’re holding higher capital, we think probably impacts ROE around 56 to 60 basis points. But having said that, I think our current ROE of about 10.6, I think is still reasonably competitive within the industry.
Having said that, I guess we still believe that we have the opportunity to grow that ROE even at these higher levels of capital, we’ll continue to grow that ROE about 50 basis points a year, so there’s really been no change around that because of the fee nature of our growth businesses. We see opportunities to continue to grow from this kind of 10.5 to 10.6% levels.
In terms of numbers of plans, that’s really a combination of two things. Number one, there’s fewer startup plans, so we’re not writing quite as many plans in this kind of an environment and number two, of course, there are a few more terminations of plans meaning very small employers who go out of business. So, again, we think those are trends that will normalize and reverse themselves overtime.
Quickly on the HELOC, I would just comment that is basically a portfolio that was purchased through a few different sources, but basically those are all correspondents. We don’t necessarily have a basis to originate those, and again that activity was ceased as of a number of years ago, so we’re not having to be adding any of those home equity loans in the portfolio over the last couple of last years.

So, the economic impact of it, this quarter was about $2 million. However, accounting practice does not allow you to recognize the reinsurance reimbursement during the current period and you have to spread that over the life of the portfolio, which could be 75 years plus and so there’s going to be very little impact. The net effect of this in several different lines through geography was a $5 million tax impact of the underwriting of the reinsurance amortization or impact.
As a result, we said that at $2 million economic impact versus a $5 million gap impact generated lower earnings in the life line by about $3 million after tax this quarter. Therefore, we feel that that was an appropriate adjustment to make to our EPS in the current period.

You can point or one can point to two or three clients who rebalance in particular ways and therefore that cost us flows during the quarter. But it’s very hard to generalize about a process that goes across a lot of client, and I will not hesitate to do that.
I think really is the way to look at is that not only as Larry mentioned quoting Siruly [ph] the DC industry in an outflow, but the DB industry also industry also is or the DB funds across the country are also in that outflows. So to have - was it 1.6 billion of net outflow, 2% of the total non-affiliate book of business, it’s actually not a particularly bad result given the influence of the economy on the funds.
And really the key towards turning positive is that clients start allocating both U.S. and international clients to the active strategies we’re in, and we see signs of that as coming and we’d be disappointed to see continued negative flows through the next two quarters, but it’s very difficult to predict client movement. We do have participation in quite few searches at the moment and our search competitive in the number of popular investment choices, but I do think that it’s very hard to predict at this point whether it will actually turn positive in the next two quarters. So, for the next two or three years, it will remain very positive.

I will focus my comments on three areas this morning. First, results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010; second, thoughts on capital management and third, progress on implementation of our strategy during these challenging times. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments.
Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses in third quarter and see increasing signs of growth across the businesses. We saw a sequential improvement in operating earnings, assets under management, book value per share and net income.
Operating earnings for the third quarter were $219 million, up 15% from last quarter and up 15% from the year ago quarter on a normalized basis. Year-to-date earnings increased 19% over last year, primarily due to higher assets under management and our ongoing expense discipline.
During the quarter, we saw assets under management grow by over 7% and had $2.3 billion of positive net cash flow from our growth engines. To remind you, we define the accumulation businesses within U.S. Asset Accumulation, Principal Global Investors and Principal International as our higher growth engines.
As we look deeper at the business segments, U.S. Asset Accumulation financial results were solid and the sales picture continues to improve. We view full service accumulation year-to-date sales of $3.5 billion as positive in an environment that remains challenging.
As a reminder, we said Full Service Accumulation sales will be higher in the second half of this year and we remain confident that we will finish 2010 with full year sales 15% to 20% above 2009 full year results of $5 billion.
Total retirement suite continues to set us apart from competitors contributing 60% of total Full Service Accumulation sales for 2010. Principal Funds continues to see very strong growth as a result of having some new and innovative products that appeal to investors. Principal Funds generated a record $790 million of net cash flow for the quarter.
An example of these innovative products is our Global Diversified Income Fund. Still in its infancy at less than two years old, the fund reached $1 billion in assets under management this quarter. Fewer than 3% of all funds registered at the same time have reached the $1 billion milestone.
The market continues to search for yield putting our high yield and preferred security strategies in high demand and showcasing our retirement asset allocation expertise all 11 of our Target Date Fund options have top quartile Morningstar peer group performance for the one year period.
Principal Global Investors saw a return to a somewhat more normal quarter, positive unaffiliated net cash flow of $800 million highlights our success in attracting money to specialize investments options such as real estate and currency as well as in high yield and international equities. While the number of institutional clients seeking mandates is still depressed, we are seeing activity build each quarter.
Shifting our focus to international markets, Principal International had an outstanding third quarter with strong net cash flow and investment performance leading to a record $42 billion in assets under management.
Despite a lower economic interest in BrasilPrev, Principal International remains a strong growth driver as we continue to deliver our retirement and asset management expertise in key emerging markets. Our reach in these markets is extensive.
In Brazil, China and Malaysia alone, we have access to more than $200 million individual customers and more than five million business customers through our partnerships with Banco do Brasil, the predictive largest bank in Latin America, China Construction Bank, the second largest commercial bank in the World and CIMB Group, the fifth largest financial services provider in Southeast Asia.
Our presence in key international markets most for more than 10 years gives us an advantage over competitors to capitalize on the rapidly growing middle class and privatization of pension systems.
Moving to risk businesses, in light of our decision to exit insured medical and the administrative services only businesses, we renamed the Life and Health segment U.S. Insurance Solutions which now comprises the Individual Life and Specialty Benefits divisions.
With year-to-date operating earnings of $141 million, the segment contributes solid earnings and a return on equity of 11.5%. Importantly, this business provides product, debt and breadth for the broader financial security needs of small to medium size businesses and individuals and keeps us connected to thousands of advisors that are active in these businesses.
Let me comment quickly on our investment portfolio performance this quarter. Once again credit losses trended down. The portfolio continues to performance better than our beginning of the year expectations, thanks to a strong recovery in both corporate credit and commercial real estate. Our portfolio is built for the long-term and the portfolio construction is the right fit to support our liabilities.
Purposeful diversification continues to benefit our financial results during this challenging time whether it be the strength of our international operations offsetting a slowdown in the U.S. retirement market during the economic crisis or our mix of fee-based and risk-based products.
Today, approximately 65% of our company earnings are tied to fee-based products which are not directly impacted by a low interest rate environment. Less than 10% of Principal Life’s general and guaranteed separate accounts are crediting interest at the minimum guaranteed levels which means our earnings are much less impacted than our peers in this low interest rate environment.
Signings in the third quarter indicate that the risk of a double-dip recession is fading. However, we expect the U.S. economic recovery to continue to be choppy. The September U.S. small business optimism index remains unchanged since June and the job market recovery is still sluggish.
Despite this, as I mentioned at the outset of the call, our businesses are seeing increased signs of growth and we believe we are at or near an inflection point, most notably, recurring deposits in full service accumulation relative to third quarter 2009 increased for the second straight quarter which we see as a sign of future growth.
We’re seeing increased interest in Employee Stock Ownership Plans or ESOPs. Thus far in 2010, we’ve been selected to assist in more than 70 ESOP consulting opportunities, up from 14 in 2009.
ESOP engagements are a window into what is happening in small and medium-sized business market. Our ESOP expertise provides a unique opportunity to cross-sell other retirement products and further capture the assets as the relationship grows over time.
A return to positive long-term fund flows in the mutual industry and record net cash flow for Principal Funds, continued strong net cash flow and record assets under management for Principal International, an increase in global institutional search activity driving positive unaffiliated net cash flow for Principal Global Investors, an increase in Specialty Benefits premiums for the second quarter in a row after five quarters of decline as well as a stabilization of membership levels and a recovery in Individual Life sales both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
Overall, the results continue to demonstrate that Principal has the right mix of products and services that advisors, businesses, and individuals are looking for as the U.S. economy continues to rebuild. Now, I want to touch on capital management.
First of all, as we announced yesterday, we are pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% common stock dividend increase, which is a sign of our confidence in our businesses as well as our commitment to deliver shareholder value.
We will continue to weigh all the options to deploy capital and make decisions that are in the long-term interest of our shareholders. We see increased merger and acquisition opportunities in the international areas and global asset management, which would fit nicely within our business model.
In addition, we view share repurchase as an attractive option. With all options, we will be very disciplined as we look to put excess capital to work and we look forward to providing more details on our capital strategy at our Investor Day on December 9.
My third and final topic is to discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy. Our focus remains the same to help growing businesses individuals and institutional clients achieve financial security and success.
We have continued to work on the implementation of our strategy even during the financial crisis, with important steps like renewing our BrasilPrev joint venture for 23 years, entering attractive new emerging markets like Indonesia and Thailand and adding new U.S. distribution relationships like Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
We are excited about the long-term growth opportunities for all of our businesses. We have the expertise and right business mix to work with advisors to help the large under-served and under-penetrated market of small- to medium-sized businesses meet their business owner and employee benefits needs.
In the U.S. Health, 78 million baby boomers, 80 million echo boomers and everyone in between with their savings, protection and retirement income needs, continue to export and grow our retirement and asset management expertise in select international markets where we already have an established footprint and strong local distribution partners and to grow our proven global multi-boutique asset management model.
Obviously, the biggest strategic decision for the quarter was to wind down the health business which demonstrates our discipline to focus on our opportunities for growth, while maintaining a diversified business portfolio. The investment needed to achieve scale to stay competitive in a rapidly changing healthcare industry did not make sense for us as we focus on overall value for our shareholders.
We do not expect to wind down to have any meaningful impact on our Specialty Benefits business. Over the past few years, we have deliberately built Specialty Benefits as a standalone business with a dedicated sales team and focused employees and infrastructure.
Less than 5% of Specialty Benefits premiums are tied to medical. Overall, our hybrid business model of asset management and risk-based products is poised for superior growth as we look out over the next 10 years to 15 years and beyond.
We export our U.S. leadership and expertise in retirement, asset accumulation and asset management to select emerging markets. We are in markets with fast growing middle income populations. We’re optimistic about the positive momentum we are seeing in all our lines of business. All opportunities, both domestically and abroad will deliver long-term results and shareholder value.
Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out some recent recognition that we’ve received across our businesses. CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management was recently named Best Asset Management House at the International Takaful Awards in London 2010.
While currently a small portion of our global asset management business, there is little doubt that Shariah compliant funds have great growth potential. We are pleased to get in on the ground floor and we win awards as we go.
Additionally, the Principal was named InformationWeek 500 for the 13th straight year and made our ninth appearance on the Working Mother 100 Best Companies list.
We believe this third party recognition demonstrates the true character of the organization and that the Principal remains a company, advisors and customers want to do business with and investors can trust. Terry?

This morning I’ll focus on operating earnings including continued strong expense management, details on the accounting implications of our exit from the health business, net income including continued solid performance of the investment portfolio and finally an update on our improving capital position and strong balance sheet.
Again, we view third quarter as solid and have seen several inflection points for many of our lines of business. As Larry highlighted, we are seeing many positive trends and are excited about our growth opportunities going forward.
Starting with total company results, third quarter 2010 operating earnings were $219 million or $0.68 per share, flat compared to the third quarter last year. However, there were a number of items influencing comparability between periods.
These include opportunistic early redemption of medium-term notes in third quarter 2009, the reduced economic interest in our BrasilPrev joint venture and the impact of equity markets, model enhancements and assumption changes on DAC amortization.
Excluding these items, total company earnings improved 15% over third quarter 2009 on 10% higher average assets under management, a very solid result reflecting our operational leverage.
Let me quickly quantify the larger items influencing third quarter 2010 reported earnings per share of $0.68. DAC amortization true-ups for equity market performance and modeling assumptions benefited Full Service Accumulation, Individual Annuities and Principal International by $0.04 and negatively impacted Individual Life by $0.02.
Adjusting for significant impacts to DAC amortization both positive and negative, is consistent with prior periods. As a result, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.66 per share.
Now let me discuss the business unit results, starting with U.S. Asset Accumulation earnings normalized for strong fee income from early redemption of medium-term notes in third quarter 2009 and DAC and amortization true-ups due to the equity markets, current quarter earnings are in line with the increase in average account values compared to a prior year period.
Reflecting continued expense management, full service accumulation’s third quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 14% on a 9% increase in average account values compared to the prior year quarter.
To reinforce Larry’s earlier comments, our strong October sales further reinforces our confidence and we expect Full Service Accumulation sales to be up 15% to 20% over last year. We expect to end the year with a positive net cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion against the projected industry outflows in 2010 according to the independent research firm Cerulli.
In the third quarter Principal Funds had $2.5 billion in sales, record net cash flow of $790 million and continued success from our extensive retail distribution network.
The drop in Individual Annuity earnings from a year ago primarily reflects a $6 million after-tax increase in DAC and amortization expense due to equity markets compared to third quarter 2009 and reduced interest margins in our Fixed Deferred Annuity business.
Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 43% from a year ago. The improvement reflects a 5% growth in average assets under management, strong expense management and a significant increase in transaction fees which are trending up more to normal levels.
Additionally, unaffiliated net cash flow was a positive $800 million. We are cautiously optimistic about future flows as we are starting to see mandates fund in specialized investment options where we have expertise such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities.
We are pleased with the third quarter funding of our China Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor or QDII which is a fund issued by CCB Principal Asset Management that invests in international securities for Chinese investors.
The majority of these assets will be managed by PGI. We are one of a select group that is being authorized by the Chinese government to offer this product and although a small step, this is a great opportunity going forward.
Moving to Principal International, where operating earnings were at $33 million, third quarter 2010 benefited from a $3 million of DAC amortizations due to favorable market conditions.
Principal International has added $8 billion of assets under management year-to-date; $3 billion of that is positive net cash flow resulting in a record $42 billion of assets under management.
Earnings were strong despite lower economic interest in our joint venture business BrasilPrev which was offset by solid investment performance.
When we adjust for foreign exchange, inflation in Latin America and the new ownership percentage in BrasilPrev, Principal International operating earnings grew at 20% year-over-year.
U.S. Insurance Solutions had operating earnings of $47 million for the third quarter compared to $56 million in the prior year quarter. Individual Life with operating earnings of $23 million compared to $30 million in the year-ago quarter accounted for the majority of this difference. Operating earnings were negatively impacted by updates to the DAC model and assumptions.
Mortality was in line for the quarter despite GAAP reinsurance accounting that required us to defer recognition, partially offset by DAC amortization expense. The current quarterly run rate for Life’s operating earnings remains about $30 million. Individual Life sales were up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year.
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings were $25 million for the third quarter 2010 compared to $26 million to the prior year quarter, largely due to the decline in members from a year ago. However, we are pleased that membership is stabilizing and premiums grew again for the second straight quarter after five quarters of premium declines.
Overall, sales were very strong in the quarter, up 16% over the year ago quarter because of strong individual disability sales and an increased focus on our core markets for our group lines of business.
Next, I’d like to review the accounting treatment impact from the health exit. Earnings from health, which are premiums, fees and claims paid are now excluded from operating earnings and show up in the Corporate segment below the line as another after-tax adjustment.
The corporate overhead that was allocated to health, approximately $8 billion after-tax per quarter, is now being included in the Corporate segment’s operating earnings. These changes are retroactive and we estimate they will reduce full year 2010 operating earnings per share results $0.18 to $0.20. Therefore, the short-term quarterly run rate for the corporate operating segment will be a negative $25 million to $30 million.
As we have demonstrated in the past, we will diligently manage expenses against revenue to offset this additional overhead, and over time we expect that corporate operating earnings run rate to return to the current quarterly run rate of a negative $20 million to $25 million.
Corporate operating earnings for the third quarter 2010 was a negative $24 million. This includes the allocation of overhead expenses for the Health exit, which was offset by higher interest on excess capital.
Additionally, third quarter 2010 Corporate segment net income includes 49 million of one-time after-tax expenses related to planned severance and goodwill write down as a result of our exit from the Health business. The net capital we expect to free up as a result of this transaction is between $100 and $120 million and will become available as the liabilities roll off our balance sheet.
In addition, we anticipate receiving compensation from United Healthcare as the membership transitions, which will be reflected in the other after-tax adjustments in the Corporate segment. We will earn a portion of this starting in fourth quarter 2010 and the rest will be spread throughout the transition period.
Moving to total company net income, we view our $142 million result in the third quarter as solid, once you reconcile the accounting treatment for the Health business to exit. After-tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $31 million in the third quarter compared to $53 million in the year ago quarter, and as we continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit related losses over the past several quarters.
We also continue to see sequentially improvement in CMBS and commercial mortgage whole loans. Commercial mortgages at $7 million after-tax had its lowest quarter of losses since year-end 2008. Corporate credit losses also remained very low. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification and strong asset liability management.
Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share excluding AOCI ended the quarter at a record $27.71, up 5% from a year-ago quarter. We finished the quarter at $1.5 billion net unrealized capital gain position, up $1.2 billion from last quarter. This is the primary reason that book value per share including AOCI was $29.20, also an all-time record.
Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio is 15%. The increase in these financial metrics reflect the ongoing improvement in credit market as the U.S. economy rebuilds.
As Larry indicated, our hybrid business model is less capital-intensive and will help us weather the current low interest rate environment of our nearly $60 billion of Principal Life’s general and guaranteed separate accounts, roughly a third includes a minimum interest rate guarantee, and less than 10% is currently at those minimums.
Of the remaining portion, not yet at minimums, we have an average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. Given our ability to reduce crediting rates coupled with our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to a low interest rate environment.
Interest rates in the international markets we’re in are currently increasing providing a natural hedge to our U.S. business. If the current interest rate environment persists for the foreseeable future, we would expect 2011 earnings to be reduced by 1% to 2%.
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be around 450%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.2 billion of total excess capital split evenly between the Life company and the Holding company.
Even with our commitment to hold a higher component of excess capital as cushion currently around $1 billion, we clearly have substantial financial flexibility.
As you know, three of the four rating agencies have the Life Insurance industry on stable outlook. This along with improving market fundamentals and our businesses ongoing ability to generate free cash flow gives us the ability to increase shareholder value over time through strategic capital redeployment.
Once again, we are pleased with our solid results. More importantly, we are excited about the developing positive trends in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions.

What I’d say to be really candid with you and others that are listening is nobody knows. Nobody knows whether over time is 350 going to become the standard of is the new standard going to be something closer to 400. I hear you and other speculate on that over time and I think the reality is that none of us know the answer to that, which is partly why I think we’ll continue to be a little bit cautious. Having said, we’re obviously at the strongest point in our history.
Another point I would make is that I think that the insurance industry just like the banking industry undergoing Basel III, we’re going to see new Prudential standard, we’re going to see Solvency II. We’re going to see Principles-Based Reserves, coming to the insurance industry sometime in 2013-14. I think the good news for us is that with a lesser percentage of our businesses tied to insurance that will have a less dramatic impact, but having that there is still some uncertainty.
But realistically, I would say that deployable capital today is probably somewhere in that, maybe $500 million to $750 million. I think that the action the Board took yesterday in terms of 10% increase in dividend should tell you a lot about both how the Board thinks that our businesses are operating as well as how the Board sees our excess capital position.

Having said that, again, I think the main reason for caution as I was describing earlier and I guess the way I would think about is, is that I think as we continue to get into each quarter of 2011, I think the likelihood increases around the opportunity to potentially have some budget if you will for M&A as well as some budget for return of capital to shareholder in some fashion and obviously given where the stock is trading today, our share repurchase is a very, very attractive option I said in my comment.

As you said lesser margins, we’ve commented on that. It’s primarily consulting fees.
In terms of corporate tax rate, DRD is running about the same level as it has run in years past. It’s been around the range of $75 million. I suppose one could speculate that maybe corporations sitting with a $1 trillion of cash on their collective balance sheets might be paying out more dividends, but we haven’t seen sort of clear trends in that. We are seeing on the international side, I think there is going to be some increase in tax rates.

Tom, the ESOP assets are counted in our Full Service numbers, the number for the third quarter was $220 million versus the prior quarter of $129 million.

Just a couple of quick measures, they’d give us confidence around Q4. One would be around the sheer number of advisors requesting a proposal likely to be on track this year to hit a record high, which tells us that our efforts in building our alliance partnerships are good. We’ve got about a 5% increase on a year-to-date basis of our pipeline. Our close rates have ticked up nicely.
We also had, if you look at the number of plans sold roughly up 21% and we are showing good track record there in the other. In closing comment I have made is the TPA initiative is well underway. We’re seeing very good tracking working with those advisors that prefer a local TPA.

So there seems to be as you indicated, may be there’s a lesser amount this quarter, may be there’s a lesser amount of FSA DAC amortization, but there would be equal numbers of offsetting factors that in our view would say we think $0.66 is a fair run rate and you then apply the normal metrics relative to growing AUM and other things that would then get you to what would be the Q4 run rate and going into 2011. So I think we are talking the same thing when we talk about $0.66.

Wanted to explore one area which is, I mean obviously the commentary is more positive around the sales numbers, but the plan count continues to decline about 3% year-over-year, continues to decline sequentially albeit slightly better than it did last quarter, and I guess in the past you’ve attributed to plan terminations, fewer new plan startups, I guess the question is when do you think that the plans are going to stabilize generally, but I think more important than that is if you strip out the impact of plan terminations and normalized kind of new starts, what would that plan count look like sequentially or year-over-year, how you want to look at it.

The takeover plans were down approximately 30% from where there were a year ago. Startup plans from year ago were down 50%. If we just look at plan terms, remember that’s different than contract terms. These are people who have eliminated their plans. They are down 30% from a year ago and contract terms are up about 10%.
When we look at that period of time in the historical ‘04 through ‘07 time frame, what you’d really find out is our contract withdrawals are up about 100 basis points from a normal run rate. Still the biggest efficiency we have is around transfer deposits. It’s up 300 basis points compared to the same period of time. If you look closely and talk to the advisors, what they would tell you is that it seems like we’ve reached kind of at the bottom here, relative to the economic recovery and it’s a slow build out from here. But we feel genuinely optimistic about our ability to retain plans through some of our revised service models that help lower the price to our TPA initiative and through our expanded lines partnerships.

That’s not necessarily because employment is growing, but at least employment shrinkage has stopped. We’re starting to see deferrals come up a little bit, so we’re starting to see matches come back a little bit.

We’re all in the same page and what we’re talking about are what we believe to be our best estimates if you will of commitments that is plans that do have every intention to transfer to us over the remaining, if you will, now two months of the year. So, it is in large measure based on commitments.
Having said that, I’ve been around this business long enough that I have seen plans that told us they were going to transfer on 12/15 come in on 1/15/2011. Now that’s not going to make any difference over the longer term trend lines if you will for the business, but there is always just a level of cautiousness and conservatism relative to is everything that we are told is going to show up in December might some of that carryover into the first quarter.
All that’s possible but if we apply all of our kind of normal experience, we look at all of the measures that we get from our sales offices, we do expect to have that kind fourth quarter in the range that you indicate but there is always one or two plans that can fall one way or the other that might influence it, but we feel very good about where we’re going for the reasons Dan mentioned, close rates are up, investment performance is strong, advisors are coming back.

First, you talked about Solvency III and Principal’s base reserving but it would seem to that certainly relative to the Life peer group, the protection businesses are a much smaller part of your story. All of the focuses, whether it’s Solvency, whether it’s IFRS, they are really driven on the liability side, which again is where you haven’t taken the risk, unlike perhaps the variable annuity writers. I’m not sure why you’re as cautious about that, maybe you could help us with that?
Secondly, I think the big question here on capital management, Larry, as I remember in analyst meeting a couple of years ago, where you were up there and talking about an ROE projection, getting up to 16%, 17%, 18%, here we’re stuck in under 10% and if I take your number, okay, of what the true if like excess is of 5 to 7.50, and we take that out maybe we can stretch the ROE for the company this quarter to 11%, but what doesn’t seem to be addressed to me is why are you running 400 to 500 to 600 points than below what you said before was your goal when the projection business is even going to be smaller now?
And then finally, Terry, could you just clarify what the DAC adjustments were on the Life line, was that related to secondary guarantee, well, and what did you change?

But having said that, it is one of the important things that we’re looking at, along with as I said before, the whole question from the Financial Stability Oversight Council as to what is going to be a systemically significant institution. I think that is one that probably is going to happen sooner and may well in fact involve us as compared to some of the other life peers, so that’s something we need to think about.
In terms of ROE, again the issues, if you look at the fundamental businesses that we’re running, I will still argue much as I did three, four years ago that we have the ability to build ROE to a higher level than do many of our Life peers. Now at the current time, again we are in a period where there doesn’t seem to be that much value from the standpoint of investors in terms of wanting to see that ROE improvement. I think that will change over time and I think we will be more confident in rationalizing our capital base to grow our ROE over time, but I am every bit as confident of our ability over the long-term to hit a 15% ROE today as I was back in 2004 and 2005.
And in fact we do projections every year, we do very detailed projections and as you know, we remain committed to that one rule of thumb that indicates we plan to grow ROE 50 basis points a year because as we began to shift towards international and asset management and asset accumulation, our ROE’s potential is probably higher today than it was in 2005. So again it’s just a matter of time and it’s a rationalization of capital and I’ll let Terry cover the DAC amortization.

First, results for the third quarter in the first 9 months of 2010. Second, thoughts on capital management and third, progress on the implementation of our strategy during these challenging times. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses in third quarter and see increasing signs of growth across the businesses. We saw a sequential improvement in operating earnings, assets under management, book value per share and net income. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $219 million, up 15% from last quarter and up 15% from the year-ago quarter on a normalized basis. Year-to-date earnings increased 19% over last year primarily due to higher assets under management and our ongoing expense discipline.
During the quarter, we saw assets under management grow by over 7% and had $2.3 billion of positive net cash flow from our growth engines. To remind you, we defined the accumulation businesses within U.S. Asset Accumulation Principal Global Investors and Principal International as our higher growth engines. As we look deeper at the business segments, U.S. Asset Accumulation's financial results were solid and the sales picture continues to improve. We view full-service accumulation year-to-date sales of $3.5 billion as positive in an environment that remains challenging. As a reminder, we said full-service accumulation sales will be higher in the second half of this year and we remain confident that we will finish 2010 with full-year sales, 15% to 20% above 2009 full-year results of $5 billion. Total Retirement Suite continues to set us apart from competitors contributing 60% of total full service accumulation sales for 2010. Principal Funds continues to see very strong growth, as a result of having some new and innovative products that appeal to investors. Principal Funds generated a record $790 million of net cash flow for the quarter. An example of these innovative products is our global diversified income fund. Still in its infancy at less than 2 years old, the fund reached $1 million in assets under management this quarter. Fewer than 3% of all the funds registered at the same time have reached the $1 billion milestone. The market continues to search for yield, putting our high yield and preferred securities strategies in high demand. And showcasing our retirement asset allocation expertise all 11 of our target date fund options have top quartile MorningStar Peer Group Performance for the 1-year period.
Principal Global Investors saw a return to a somewhat more normal quarter. Positive unaffiliated net cash flow of $800 million highlights our success in attracting money to specialize investment options, such as real estate and currency, as well as in high yield and international equities. While the number of institutional clients seeking mandates is still depressed, we are seeing activity build each quarter.
Shifting our focus to international markets, Principal International had an outstanding third quarter, with strong net cash flow and investment performance leading to a record $42 billion in assets under management. Despite a lower economic interest in Brasilprev, Principal International remains a strong growth driver as we continue to deliver our retirement and asset management expertise in key emerging markets. Our reach in these markets is extensive. In Brazil, China and Malaysia alone, we have access to more than 200 million individual customers and more than 5 million business customers through our partnerships with Banco Brazil, the largest bank in Latin America; China Construction Bank, the second-largest commercial back in the world; and CIMB Group, the fifth largest financial services provider in Southeast Asia. Our presence in key international markets, most for more than 10 years, gives us an advantage over competitors to capitalize on the rapidly growing middle class and privatization of pension systems. Moving to the risk businesses, in light of our decision to exit insured medical and administrative services only businesses, we renamed the Life and Health Insurance U.S. Insurance Solutions which now comprises the Individual Life and Specialty Benefits division. With year-to-date operating earnings of $141 million, the segment contributes solid earnings and a return on equity of 11.5%. Importantly, this business provides product depth and breadth for the broader financial security needs of small to medium-sized businesses and individuals, and keeps us connected to thousands of advisors that are active in these businesses. Let me comment quickly on our investment portfolio performance this quarter. Once again, credit losses trended down. The portfolio continues to perform better than our beginning of the year expectations thanks to a strong recovery in both corporate credit and commercial real estate. Our portfolio is built for the long-term and the portfolio construction is the right fit to support our liabilities. Purpose of diversification continues to benefit our financial results during this challenging time, whether it be the strength of our international operations, offsetting a slowdown in the U.S. retirement market during the economic crisis or our mix of fee-based and risk-based products. Today, approximately 65% of our company earnings are tied to fee-based products, which are not directly impacted by a low interest rate environment. Less than 10% of Principal lies general and guaranteed separate accounts our credit interest of the minimum guaranteed levels, which means our earnings are much less impacted than our peers in this low interest rate environment.
Signs in the third quarter indicate that the risk of a double-dip recession is fading. However, we expect the U.S. economic recovery to continue to be choppy. The September U.S. Small Business Optimism Index remains unchanged since June and the job market recovery is still sluggish. Despite this, as I mentioned at the outset of the call, our businesses are seeing increased signs of growth and we believe we are at or near an inflection point. Most notably, recurring deposits in full-service accumulation relative to third quarter 2009 increased for the second straight quarter, which we see as a sign of future growth. We're seeing increased interest in Employee Stock Ownership Plans or ESOPs. And thus far in 2010, we've been selected to assist in more than 70 ESOP consulting opportunities, up from 14 in 2009.
ESOP engagements are a window into what is happening in the small and medium-size business market. Our ESOP expertise provides a unique opportunity to cross-sell other retirement products and further capture the assets as the relationship grows over time. A return to positive long-term fund flows in the mutual fund industry and record net cash flow for Principal Funds. Continued strong net cash flow and record assets under management for Principal International. An increase in global institutional search activity driving positive unaffiliated net cash flow for Principal Global Investors. An increase in Specialty Benefits premiums for the second quarter in a row, after 5 quarters of decline, as well as the stabilization of membership levels and a recovery in Individual Life sales both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Overall, the result continue to demonstrate that Principal has the right mix of products and services that advisors, businesses and individuals are looking for as the U.S. economy continues to rebuild.
Now I want to touch on capital management. First of all, as we announced yesterday, we are pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% common stock dividend increase, which is a sign of our confidence in our businesses as well as our commitment to deliver shareholder value. We will continue to weigh all of the options to deploy capital and made decisions that are in the long-term interests of our shareholders. We see increased merger and acquisition opportunities in the international areas and Global Asset Management, which would fit nicely within our business model. In addition, we view share repurchase as an attractive option. With all options, we will be very disciplined as we look to put excess capital to work and we look forward to providing more details on our capital strategy at our Investor Day on December 9.
My third and final topic is to discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy. Our focus remains the same. To help growing businesses, individuals and Institutional clients achieve financial security and success, we have continued to work on the implementation of our strategy even during the financial crisis, with important steps like renewing our Brasilprev joint venture for 23 years, entering attractive new emerging markets like Indonesia and Thailand, and adding new U.S. distribution relationships like Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We are excited about the long-term growth opportunities for all our businesses. We have the expertise and the right business mix to work with advisors to help the large underserved and underpenetrated market of small-to-medium-sized businesses meet their business owner and employee benefits needs. In the U.S., helped 78 million Baby Boomers, 80 million Echo Boomers and everyone in between with their savings protection retirement income needs. To continue to export and grow our Retirement and Asset Management expertise in select international markets, where we already have an established footprint and strong local distribution partners. And to grow our proven global multi-boutique Asset Management model. Obviously, the biggest strategic decision for the quarter was to wind down the health business, which demonstrates our discipline to focus on our opportunities for growth while maintaining a diversified business portfolio. The investment needed to achieve scale to stay competitive in the rapidly changing healthcare industry did not make sense for us as we focus on overall value for our shareholders. We do not expect the wind down to have any meaningful impact on our Specialty Benefits business. Over the past few years, we have deliberately built specialty benefits as a standalone business with a dedicated sales team and focused employees and infrastructure. Less than 5% of the specialty benefits premiums are tied to medical. Overall, our hybrid business model of Asset Management and risk-based products is poised for superior growth as we look out over the next 10 to 15 years and beyond. We export our U.S. leadership and expertise in Retirement, asset accumulation and Asset Management to select emerging markets. We are in markets with fast growing middle income populations. We're optimistic about the positive momentum we are seeing in all of our lines of business. All opportunities, both domestically and abroad, will deliver long-term results and shareholder value. Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out some recent recognition that we received across our businesses. CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management was recently named Best Asset Management House at the International Takaful Awards in London 2010. While currently a small portion of our Global Asset Management business, there is little doubt that Sharia Compliant Funds have great growth potential. We are pleased to get in the ground floor and win awards as we go. Additionally, The Principal was named InformationWeek 500 for the 13th straight year and made our ninth appearance on the Working Mother 100 Best Companies list. We believe this third-party recognition and demonstrates the true character of the organization and that the Principal remains a company, advisors and customers want to do business with and investors can trust. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus on operating earnings including continued strong Expense Management, details on the accounting indications of our exit from the health business, net income including continued solid performance of the investment portfolio, and finally an update on our improving capital position and strong balance sheet. Again, we view third quarter as solid and have seen several inflection points for many of our lines of business. As Larry highlighted, we are seeing many positive trends and are excited about our growth opportunities going forward. Starting with total company results, third quarter 2010 operating earnings were $219 million or $0.68 per share, flat compared to third quarter last year. However, there were a number of items influencing comparability between periods. These include opportunistic early redemption of medium-term notes in third quarter 2009, the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture and the impact of equity markets, model enhancements and assumption changes on DAC amortization. Excluding these items, total company earnings improved 15% over third quarter 2009 on 10% higher average assets under management, a very solid result reflecting our operational leverage. Let me quickly quantify the larger items influencing third quarter 2010 reported earnings per share of $0.68. DAC amortization true-ups for equity market performance and modeling assumptions benefited full-service accumulation, individual annuities and Principal International by $0.04 and negatively impacted individual life by $0.02. Adjusting for significant impacts to DAC amortization, both positive and negative, is consistent with prior periods. As a result, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.66 per share. Now let me discuss the business unit results. Starting with U.S. Asset Accumulation earnings, normalized for strong fee income from early redemption of medium-term notes and third quarter 2009 and DAC amortization true-ups due to equity markets, current quarter earnings are in line with the increase in average account values compared to a prior-year period. Reflecting a continued expense management, full-service accumulation's third quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 14% on a 9% increase in average account values compared to the prior-year quarter. To enforce Larry's earlier comments, our strong October sales further reinforces our confidence that we expect full-service accumulation sales to be up 15% to 20% over last year. We expect to end the year with a positive net cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion against the projected industry outflows in 2010, according to the independent research firm, Cerulli. In the third quarter, Principal Funds had $2.5 billion in sales, record net cash flow of $790 million and continued success from our extensive retail distribution network. The drop in individual annuity earnings from a year ago primarily reflects a $6 million after-tax increase in DAC amortization expense due to equity markets, compared to third quarter 2009 and reduced interest margins in our fixed deferred annuity business. Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 43% from a year ago. The improvement reflects a 5% growth in average assets under management, strong expense management and a significant increase in transaction fees, which are trending up more to normal levels. Additionally, unaffiliated net cash flow was a positive $800 million. We are cautiously optimistic about future flows as we're starting to see mandate funds in specialized investment options where we have expertise in, such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. We are pleased with the third quarter funding of our China Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor or QDII, which is a fund issued by CCB Principal Asset Management that invest in international securities for Chinese investors. The majority of these assets will be managed by PGI. We are one of a select group that has been authorized by the Chinese government to offer this product and although a small step, this is a great opportunity going forward. 
Moving to Principal International where operating earnings were $33 million, third quarter 2010 benefited from a $3 million of DAC amortization's due to favorable market conditions. Principal International has added $8 billion of assets under management year-to-date. $3 billion of that is positive net cash flow resulting in a record $42 billion of assets under management. Earnings were strong despite the lower economic interest in our joint venture business, Brasilprev, which was offset by solid investment performance. When you adjust for foreign exchange inflation in Latin America and the new ownership percentage in Brasilprev, Principal International operating earnings grew at 20% year-over-year. U.S. Insurance Solutions had operating earnings of $47 million for the third quarter compared to $56 million in the prior-year quarter. Individual Life with operating earnings of $23 million compared to $30 million in the year-ago quarter, accounted for the majority of this difference. Operating earnings were negatively impacted by updates due to DAC model and assumptions. Mortality was in line for the quarter despite GAAP reinsurance accounting that required us to defer recognition partially offset by DAC amortization expense. The current quarterly run rate for life operating earnings remains about $30 million. Individual life sales are up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings were $25 million for the third quarter 2010, compared to $26 million to the prior-year quarter, largely due to the decline in members from a year ago. However, we are pleased that membership is stabilizing and premiums grew again for the second straight quarter after 5 quarters of premium declines. Overall, sales were very strong in the quarter, up 16% over the year-ago quarter because of strong individual disability sales and an increase focus and our core markets for our group lines of business.
Next I'd like to review the accounting treatment impact from the health exit. Earnings from health, which are premiums, fees and claims paid are now excluded from operating earnings and show up in the corporate segment below the line as an other after-tax adjustment. The corporate overhead that was allocated to health, approximately $8 billion after-tax per quarter, is now being included in the corporate segments operating earnings. These changes are retroactive and we will reduced full year 2010 operating earnings per share results $0.18 to $0.20. Therefore, the short-term quarterly run rate for the corporate operating segment will be a negative $25 million to $30 million. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will diligently manage expenses against revenue to offset these additional overhead. And overtime, we expect the corporate operating earnings run rate to return to current quarterly run rate of a negative $20 million to $25 million. Corporate operating earnings for the third quarter 2010 was a negative $24 million. This includes the allocation of overhead expenses from the health exit which was offset by higher interest on excess capital. Additionally, third quarter 2010 corporate segment net income includes a $49 million of one-time after-tax expenses related to plans severance and goodwill write-down as a result of our exit from the health business. The net capital we expect to free up as a result of this transaction is between $100 million and $120 million and will become available as the liabilities roll off our balance sheet. In addition, we anticipate receiving compensation from United Healthcare as the membership transitions, which will be reflected in the other after-tax adjustments in the corporate segment. We will earn  a portion of this starting in fourth quarter 2010 and the rest of this will spread throughout the transition period. Moving to total company net income, we view our $142 million result in the third quarter as solid once you reconcile the accounting treatment for the health business exit. After-tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $31 million in third quarter, compared to $53 million in the year-ago quarter as we continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit-related losses over the past several quarters. We also continue to see sequential improvement in CMBS and commercial mortgage whole loans. Commercial mortgages at $7 million after-tax had its lowest quarter of losses since year-end 2008. Corporate credit losses also remain very low. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification and strong asset liability management. Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share excluding AOCI, ended the quarter at a record $27.71 up 5% from a year-ago quarter. We finished the quarter at a $1.5 billion net unrealized capital gain position, up $1.2 billion from last quarter. This is the primary reason that book value per share, including AOCI, was $29.90, also on all-time record. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio is 15%. The increase in these financial metrics reflect the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. As Larry indicated, our hybrid business model business is less capital intensive and will help us weather the current low interest rate environment. Of our nearly $60 billion of principal life's general and guaranteed separate accounts, roughly 1/3 includes a minimum interest rate guarantee. And less than 10% is currently at those minimums. Of the remaining portion not yet at minimums, we have average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. Given our ability to reduce crediting rates, coupled with active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to a low interest rate environment. Interest rates in the international markets we're in are currently increasing, providing a natural hedge to our U.S. business. If the current interest rate environment persists for the foreseeable future, we would expect 2011 earnings to be reduced by 1% to 2%.
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be around 450%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.2 billion of total excess capital, split evenly between the life company and the holding company. Even with our commitment to hold the higher component of excess capital as cushion, currently around $1 billion , we clearly have substantial financial flexibility. As you know, 3 of the 4 rating agencies have the life insurance industry on stable outlook. This, along with improving market fundamentals and our businesses' ongoing ability to generate free cash flow, gives us the ability to increase shareholder value over time through strategic capital redeployment. Once again, we are pleased with our solid results. More importantly we are excited about the developing positive trends in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

So again these are the kinds of things that from quarter-to-quarter, we'll go back and forth but when you string the quarters together, I think you get a better picture of how the DAC amortization is going.

I hear you and others speculate on that over time and I think the reality is this none of us know the answer to that, which is partly why I think we'll continue to be a little bit cautious. Having said that, we're obviously at the strongest point in our history. Another point I guess I would make is that I think that the insurance industry, just like the banking industry undergoing Basel III, we're going to see new prudential standards. We're going to see Solvency II, we're going to see Principal Base reserves coming to the insurance industry sometime in 2013. I think the good news for us is that with a lesser percentage of our businesses tied to insurance, that will have a less dramatic impact but having said that, there is still some uncertainty. But realistically, I would say that deployable capital today is probably somewhere in that maybe $500 million to $750 million range. I think that the action of the Board took yesterday in terms of 110% increase in dividend should tell you a lot about both of the board things that our businesses are operating as well as how the board kind of sees our excess capital position."

Its been around the range of $75 million. I suppose one could speculate that maybe corparations sitting with a trillion dollar of cash on their collective balance sheet might be paying out more dividend but we haven't seen sort of clear trends in that. We are seeing on the international side anything there is going to be some increase in tax rate.

We're starting to see deferrals come up a little bit, so we're starting to see matches come back a little bit. So those things is what's driving the increase in recurring deposits and we're now seeing that 2 quarters in a row and we expect that to continue based on everything we see every day."

All of that's possible but we've be up by all of kind of normal experience we look at all of the measures that we get from our sales offices. We do expect to have that kind of fourth quarter in the range that you indicated by there is always 1 or 2 plans that could fall one way or the other that might influence what we feel very good about what we're going for the reasons than mentioned, closer ranged are up investment performance as advisors are coming back so I think we are going into a period where are going to win at our back."

I'm not sure why he your cautious about that maybe you could help us by that? Second I think the big question here on capital management Larry, I remember an analysis meeting couple of years ago where you're out there talking about in ROE projection million of the 16%, 17%, 18%. Here we're stuck at under 10% and if I take your number, of what the true if we like excess is a 500 to 750 and we take that out maybe we can stretch in ROE for the bombardier this quarter to 11%. But doesn't seem to be addressed to me is why are you running 45,600 points below what you said before was your goal when the protection businesses and even going to be smaller now? And then finally, Terry, can you just clarify what the DAC adjustments were on the lifeline was that related to secondary guarantee and what did you change?"

I think that is one the probably is going to happen sooner and may well if that involve us as compared to some of the other life peers so that something we need to think about. In terms of ROE, again, the issues, if you look at the fundamental businesses that we're running, I would still argue much as I did a 3 or 4 years ago that we have the ability to build ROE to a higher level than to many of our life peers. Now on the current time, again we're in a period where there doesn't seem to be that much value from a standpoint of investors in terms of wanting to see that ROE improvement. I think that'll change over time and I think we will be more confident in rationalizing our capital base to grow our ROE overtime. But I am every bit as confident of our ability over the long-term to get a 15% ROE today as I was back in 2004 and 2005. And in fact, we do have projections every year with a very detailed productions, and as you know we remain committed to that one rule of thumb that indicates we're planning to grow ROE 50 basis points a year, because as we begun to shift towards international and Asset Management and asset accumulation, our ROE is potential is probably higher today than it was in 2005. So again it's as a matter of time that rationalization of capital and I'll let Terry cover the DAC amortization."

I will focus my comments on 3 areas this morning.

I will focus my comments on 3 areas this morning. First, results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2010; second, thoughts on capital management; and third, progress on implementation of our strategy during these challenging times. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments. 
Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses in third quarter and see increasing signs of growth across the businesses. We saw a sequential improvement in operating earnings, assets under management, book value per share and net income. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $219 million, up 15% from last quarter and up 15% from the year-ago quarter on a normalized basis. Year-to-date earnings increased 19% over last year, primarily due to higher assets under management and our ongoing expense discipline.
During the quarter, we saw assets under management grow by over 7% and had $2.3 billion of positive net cash flow from our growth engines. To remind you, we defined the accumulation businesses within U.S. Asset Accumulation, Principal Global Investors and Principal International as our higher-growth engines. 
As we look deeper at the business segments, U.S. Asset Accumulation financial results were solid, and the sales picture continues to improve. We view Full Service Accumulation year-to-date sales of $3.5 billion as positive in an environment that remains challenging. As a reminder, we said Full Service Accumulation sales will be higher in the second half of this year, and we remain confident that we will finish 2010 with full-year sales 15% to 20% above 2009 full year results of $5 billion. 
Total Retirement Suite continues to set us apart from competitors, contributing 60% of total full service accumulation sales for 2010. Principal Funds continues to see very strong growth, as a result of having some new and innovative products that appeal to investors. Principal Funds generated a record $790 million of net cash flow for the quarter. An example of these innovative products is our Global Diversified Income Fund. Still in its infancy at less than 2 years old, the fund reached $1 billion in assets under management this quarter. Fewer than 3% of all funds registered at the same time have reached the $1 billion milestone. The market continues to search for yield, putting our high-yield and preferred security strategies in high demand, and showcasing our retirement asset allocation expertise, all 11 of our target-date fund options have top quartile Morningstar peer group performance for the 1-year period.
Principal Global Investors saw a return to a somewhat more normal quarter. Positive unaffiliated net cash flow of $800 million highlights our success in attracting money to specialized investment options, such as real estate and currency, as well as in high-yield and international equities. While the number of institutional clients seeking mandates is still depressed, we are seeing activity build each quarter.
Shifting our focus to international markets, Principal International had an outstanding third quarter, with strong net cash flow and investment performance leading to a record $42 billion in assets under management. Despite a lower economic interest in Brasilprev, Principal International remains a strong growth driver, as we continue to deliver our retirement and asset management expertise in key emerging markets. Our reach in these markets is extensive. 
In Brazil, China and Malaysia alone, we have access to more than 200 million individual customers and more than 5 million business customers through our partnerships with Banco Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America; China Construction Bank, the second-largest commercial back in the world; and CIMB Group, the fifth largest financial services provider in Southeast Asia. Our presence in key international markets, most for more than 10 years, gives us an advantage over competitors to capitalize on the rapidly growing middle class and privatization of pension systems. 
Moving to the risk businesses, in light of our decision to exit insured medical and administrative services only businesses, we renamed the Life and Health segment U.S. Insurance Solutions, which now comprises the Individual Life and Specialty Benefits divisions. With year-to-date operating earnings of $141 million, the segment contributes solid earnings and a return on equity of 11.5%. Importantly, this business provides product depth and breadth for the broader financial security needs of small to medium-sized businesses and individuals, and keeps us connected to thousands of advisors that are active in these businesses. 
Let me comment quickly on our investment portfolio performance this quarter. Once again, credit losses trended down. The portfolio continues to perform better than our beginning-of-the-year expectations thanks to a strong recovery in both corporate credit and commercial real estate. Our portfolio is built for the long-term, and the portfolio construction is the right fit to support our liabilities. Purposeful diversification continues to benefit our financial results during this challenging time, whether it be the strength of our international operations, offsetting a slowdown in the U.S. retirement market during the economic crisis, or our mix of fee-based and risk-based products. Today, approximately 65% of our company earnings are tied to fee-based products, which are not directly impacted by a low interest rate environment. Less than 10% of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate accounts are crediting interest at the minimum guaranteed levels, which means our earnings are much less impacted than our peers in this low-interest rate environment.
Signs in the third quarter indicate that the risk of a double-dip recession is fading. However, we expect the U.S. economic recovery to continue to be choppy. The September U.S. Small-Business Optimism Index remains unchanged since June, and the job market recovery is still sluggish. Despite this, as I mentioned at the outset of the call, our businesses are seeing increased signs of growth, and we believe we are at or near an inflection point. Most notably, recurring deposits in Full Service Accumulation relative to third quarter 2009 increased for the second straight quarter, which we see as a sign of future growth. We're seeing increased interest in Employee Stock Ownership plans or ESOPs. Thus far, in 2010, we've been selected to assist in more than 70 ESOP consulting opportunities, up from 14 in 2009.
ESOP engagements are a window into what is happening in the small and medium-size business market. Our ESOP expertise provides a unique opportunity to cross-sell other retirement products and further capture the assets as the relationship grows over time; a return to positive long-term fund flows in the mutual fund industry and record net cash flow for Principal funds; continued strong net cash flow and record assets under management for Principal International; an increase in global institutional search activity, driving positive unaffiliated net cash flow for Principal Global Investors; an increase in Specialty Benefits premiums for the second quarter in a row, after 5 quarters of decline, as well as the stabilization of membership levels and a recovery in Individual Life sales, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
Overall, the result continue to demonstrate that Principal has the right mix of products and services that advisors, businesses and individuals are looking for as the U.S. economy continues to rebuild.
Now I want to touch on capital management. First of all, as we announced yesterday, we are pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% common stock dividend increase, which is a sign of our confidence in our businesses, as well as our commitment to deliver shareholder value. We will continue to weigh all of the options to deploy capital and make decisions that are in the long-term interests of our shareholders. We see increased merger and acquisition opportunities in the international areas and global asset management, which would fit nicely within our business model. 
In addition, we view share repurchase as an attractive option. With all options, we will be very disciplined as we look to put excess capital to work, and we look forward to providing more details on our capital strategy at our Investor Day on December 9.
My third and final topic is to discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy. Our focus remains the same, to help growing businesses, individuals and institutional clients achieve financial security and success. We have continued to work on the implementation of our strategy even during the financial crisis, with important steps like renewing our Brasilprev joint venture for 23 years, entering attractive new emerging markets like Indonesia and Thailand, and adding new U.S. distribution relationships like Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
We are excited about the long-term growth opportunities for all our businesses. We have the expertise and the right business mix to work with advisors to help the large underserved and underpenetrated market of small- to-medium-sized businesses meet their business owner and employee benefits needs. In the U.S., it helped 78 million baby boomers, 80 million echo boomers and everyone in between with their savings, protection and retirement income needs, to continue to export and grow our retirement and asset management expertise in select international markets, where we already have an established footprint and strong local distribution partners, and to grow our proven global multi-boutique asset management model. 
Obviously, the biggest strategic decision for the quarter was to wind down the Health business, which demonstrates our discipline to focus on our opportunities for growth, while maintaining a diversified business portfolio. The investment needed to achieve scale to stay competitive in a rapidly changing healthcare industry did not make sense for us, as we focus on overall value for our shareholders. We do not expect the wind-down to have any meaningful impact on our Specialty Benefits business. Over the past few years, we have deliberately built Specialty Benefits as a standalone business with a dedicated sales team and focused employees and infrastructure. 
Less than 5% of the Specialty Benefits premiums are tied to medical. Overall, our hybrid business model of asset management and risk-based products is poised for superior growth, as we look out over the next 10 to 15 years and beyond. We export our U.S. leadership and expertise in retirement, asset accumulation and asset management to select emerging markets. We are in markets with fast-growing middle income populations. We're optimistic about the positive momentum we are seeing in all our lines of business. All opportunities, both domestically and abroad, will deliver long-term results and shareholder value. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out some recent recognition that we received across our businesses. CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management was recently named Best Asset Management House at the International Takaful Awards in London 2010. While currently, a small portion of our Global Asset Management business, there is little doubt that Shariah-compliant funds have great growth potential. We are pleased to get in on the ground floor and win awards as we go. Additionally, The Principal was named InformationWeek 500 for the 13th straight year and made our ninth appearance on the Working Mother 100 Best Companies list. We believe this third-party recognition demonstrates the true character of the organization and that the Principal remains a company advisors and customers want to do business with and investors can trust.

Again, we view the third quarter as solid and have seen several inflection points for many of our lines of business. As Larry highlighted, we are seeing many positive trends and are excited about our growth opportunities going forward. Starting with total company results, third quarter 2010 operating earnings were $219 million or $0.68 per share, flat compared to the third quarter last year. However, there were a number of items influencing comparability between periods. These include opportunistic early redemption of medium-term notes in the third quarter 2009; the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture; and the impact of equity markets, model enhancements and assumption changes on DAC amortization. 
Excluding these items, total company earnings improved 15% over third quarter 2009 on 10% higher average assets under management, a very solid result reflecting our operational leverage. Let me quickly quantify the larger items influencing third quarter 2010 reported earnings per share of $0.68. DAC amortization true-ups for equity market performance and modeling assumptions benefited Full Service Accumulation, individual annuities and Principal International by $0.04, and negatively impacted Individual Life by $0.02. Adjusting for significant impacts to DAC amortization, both positive and negative, it's consistent with prior periods. As a result, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.66 per share. 
Now let me discuss the business unit results. Starting with the U.S. Asset Accumulation earnings, normalized for a strong fee income from early redemption of medium-term notes in the third quarter of 2009 and DAC amortization true-ups due to the equity markets, current quarter earnings are in line with the increase in average account values compared to our prior year period. 
Reflecting continued expense management, Full Service Accumulation's third quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 14% on a 9% increase in average account values compared to the prior year quarter. To enforce Larry's earlier comments, our strong October sales further reinforces our confidence that we expect Full Service Accumulation sales to be up 15% to 20% over last year. We expect to end the year with a positive net cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion against the projected industry outflows in 2010, according to the independent research firm, Cerulli. 
In the third quarter, Principal Funds had $2.5 billion in sales, a record net cash flow of $790 million and continued success from our extensive retail distribution network. The drop in individual annuity earnings from a year ago primarily reflects a $6 million after-tax increase in DAC amortization expense due to equity markets, compared to third quarter 2009 and reduced interest margins in our fixed deferred annuity business. Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 43% from a year ago. The improvement reflects a 5% growth in average assets under management, strong expense management and a significant increase in transaction fees, which are trending up more to normal levels. Additionally, unaffiliated net cash flow was a positive $800 million. We are cautiously optimistic about future flows, as we're starting to see mandates fund in specialized investment options where we have expertise, such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
We are pleased with the third quarter funding of our China Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor or QDII, which is a fund issued by CCB Principal Asset Management that invests in international securities for Chinese investors. The majority of these assets will be managed by PGI. We are one of a select group that has been authorized by the Chinese government to offer this product. And although a small step, this is a great opportunity going forward.
Moving to Principal International, where operating earnings were at $33 million, third quarter 2010 benefited from a $3 million of DAC amortizations due to favorable market conditions. Principal International has added $8 billion of assets under management year-to-date. $3 billion of that is positive net cash flow resulting in a record $42 billion of assets under management. Earnings were strong, despite the lower economic interest in our joint venture business, Brasilprev, which was offset by solid investment performance. When we adjust for foreign exchange inflation in Latin America and the new ownership percentage in Brasilprev, Principal International operating earnings grew at 20% year-over-year. 
U.S. Insurance Solutions had operating earnings of $47 million for the third quarter compared to $56 million in the prior-year quarter. Individual Life with operating earnings of $23 million compared to $30 million in the year-ago quarter accounted for the majority of this difference. 
Operating earnings were negatively impacted by updates due to DAC model and assumptions. Mortality was in line for the quarter despite GAAP reinsurance accounting that required us to defer recognition partially offset by DAC amortization expense. The current quarterly run rate for Life's operating earnings remains about $30 million. Individual Life sales are up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings were $25 million for the third quarter 2010, compared to $26 million to the prior-year quarter, largely due to the decline in members from a year ago. However, we are pleased that membership is stabilizing and premiums grew again for the second straight quarter after 5 quarters of premium declines. Overall, sales were very strong in the quarter, up 16% over the year-ago quarter because of strong individual disability sales and an increased focus and our core markets for our group lines of business.
Next, I'd like to review the accounting treatment impact from the Health exit. Earnings from Health, which are premiums, fees and claims paid are now excluded from operating earnings and show up in the Corporate segment below the line as an other after-tax adjustment. The corporate overhead that was allocated to Health, approximately $8 billion after-tax per quarter, is now being included in the Corporate segment's operating earnings. 
These changes are retroactive, and we estimate they will reduce full year 2010 operating earnings per share results $0.18 to $0.20. Therefore, the short-term quarterly run rate for the corporate operating segment will be a negative $25 million to $30 million. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will diligently manage expenses against revenue to offset this additional overhead. And overtime, we expect the corporate operating earnings run rate to return to current quarterly run rate of a negative $20 million to $25 million. 
Corporate operating earnings for the third quarter 2010 was a negative $24 million. This includes the allocation of overhead expenses from the Health exit, which was offset by higher interest on excess capital. Additionally, third quarter 2010 corporate segment net income includes a $49 million of onetime after-tax expenses related to planned severance and goodwill write-down as a result of our exit from the Health business. 
The net capital we expect to free up as a result of this transaction is between $100 million and $120 million and will become available as the liabilities roll off our balance sheet. In addition, we anticipate receiving compensation from United Healthcare as the membership transitions, which will be reflected in the other after-tax adjustments in the Corporate segment. We will earn  a portion of this starting in fourth quarter 2010, and the rest will be spread throughout the transition period. 
Moving to total company net income, we view our $142 million result in the third quarter as solid once you reconcile the accounting treatment for the Health business exit. After-tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $31 million in third quarter, compared to $53 million in the year-ago quarter, as we continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit-related losses over the past several quarters. 
We also continue to see sequential improvement in CMBS and commercial mortgage whole loans. Commercial mortgages, at $7 million after-tax, had its lowest quarter of losses since year-end 2008. Corporate credit losses also remained very low. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of a broad asset diversification and strong asset liability management. 
Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share, excluding AOCI ended the quarter at a record $27.71, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. We finished the quarter at a $1.5 billion net unrealized capital gain position, up $1.2 billion from last quarter. This is the primary reason that book value per share, including AOCI, was $29.20, also on all-time record. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio is 15%. The increase in these financial metrics reflect the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. 
As Larry indicated, our hybrid business model business is less capital-intensive and will help us weather the current low interest rate environment. Of our nearly $60 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate accounts, roughly 1/3 includes a minimum interest rate guarantee, and less than 10% is currently at those minimums. Of the remaining portion not yet at the minimums, we have an average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. 
Given our ability to reduce crediting rates, coupled with active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to a low interest rate environment. Interest rates in the international markets we're in are currently increasing, providing a natural hedge to our U.S. business. If the current interest rate environment persists for the foreseeable future, we would expect 2011 earnings to be reduced by 1% to 2%.
Moving to capital adequacy, as of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be around 450%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.2 billion of total excess capital, split evenly between the Life company and the holding company. Even with our commitment to hold a higher component of excess capital as cushion currently around $1 billion, we clearly have substantial financial flexibility. 
As you know, 3 of the 4 rating agencies have the life insurance industry on stable outlook. This, along with improving market fundamentals and our businesses' ongoing ability to generate free cash flow, gives us the ability to increase shareholder value over time through a strategic capital redeployment. Once again, we are pleased with our solid results. More importantly, we are excited about the developing positive trends in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call to questions."

So again, these are the kinds of things that from quarter-to-quarter, we'll go back and forth.

So maybe if I can ask this question this way, can we expect you to manage back down to a 350% risk-based capital ratio? I mean, in other words, should we really be viewing excess capital as the full $2.2 billion that you guys highlight relative to a 350%, or is the deployable amount -- let's say, in the relatively near term, next 1 to 2 years, is the deployable amount really something lower than that?"

What I'd say to be really candid with you and others that are listening is nobody knows. Nobody knows whether, over time, 350% is going to become the standard or is the new standard going to be something closer to 400%. I hear you and others speculate on that over time, and I think the reality is that none of us know the answer to that, which is partly why I think we'll continue to be a little bit cautious. Having said that, we're obviously at the strongest point in our history. Another point, I guess, I would make is that I think that the insurance industry, just like the banking industry undergoing Basel III, we're going to see new prudential standards. We're going to see Solvency II. We're going to see principles-based reserves coming to the insurance industry sometime in 2013, 2014. I think the good news for us is that with a lesser percentage of our businesses tied to insurance, that will have a less dramatic impact, but having said that, there is still some uncertainty. But realistically, I would say that deployable capital today is probably somewhere in that maybe $500 million to $750 million range. I think that the action the board took yesterday in terms of a 10% increase in dividends should tell you a lot about both how the board thinks that our businesses are operating as well as how the board kind of sees our excess capital position."

And obviously, given where the stock is trading today, a share repurchase is a very, very attractive option, as I said in my comments.

We've commented on that as primarily consulting fees. In terms of corporate tax rate, DRD is running about the same level as it has run in years past. It's been around the range of $75 million. I suppose one could speculate that maybe corporations sitting with a trillion dollars of cash on their collective balance sheets might be paying out more dividend, but we haven't seen sort of clear trends in that.

The number for the third quarter was $220 million versus the prior quarter at $129 million. So you can see it's not a hugely disproportionate percentage of our sales. And again, we write very few stand-alone ESOP. Most of these come along with a significant 401(k) set of assets as well. Just a couple of quick measures that give us confidence around Q4. One would be around the sheer number of advisors requesting a proposal are likely to be on track this year to hit a record high, which tells us that our efforts in building our alliance partnerships are good. We've got about a 5% increase on a year-to-date basis of our pipeline. Our close rates have ticked up nicely. We also had, if you look at the number of plans sold, roughly up 21%, and we're showing a good track record there. And the other closing comment I would make is that TPA initiative is well underway. We're seeing very good traction working with those advisors that prefer a local TPA. We've dedicated a lot of time and resources this past year, and we feel like there's good demand in Q4 moving forward. Hopefully that helps."

First, you talked about Solvency III and principles-based reserving, but it would seem to me that certainly relative to the life peer group, the protection businesses are a much smarter part of your story. All of the focus, whether it's Solvency, whether it's IFRS, are really driven on the liability side, which, again, is where you haven't taken the risk unlike, perhaps, a variable annuity writer. So I'm not sure why you're as cautious about that. Maybe you could help us with that. Secondly, and I think the big question here, on capital management, Larry, is I remember an analyst meeting a couple of years ago where you were up there and talking about an ROE projection getting up to 16%, 17%, 18%. Here, we're stuck at under 10%, and if I take your number, okay, of what the true, if we like, excess is of 500 to 750 and we take that out, maybe we can stretch the ROE for the company this quarter to 11%. But what doesn't seem to be addressed to me is, why are you running 400 to 500, 600 points and below what you said before was your goal, when the projection business is even going to be smaller now? And then finally, Terry, could you just clarify what the DAC adjustments were on the lifeline? Was that related to secondary guarantee UL, and what did you change?"

But as it relates to Solvency II, I think I indicated in my response, Colin, on one of the earlier questions that, again, we agree that while -- that we will be impacted less by whatever Solvency II new capital requirements are. This company will be impacted by them to a lesser degree, but having said that, it is one important thing that we're looking at along with, as I said before, the whole question from the Financial Stability Oversight Council as to what is going to be a systemically significant institution. I think that is one that, probably is going to happen sooner and may well, in fact, involve us as compared to some of the other life peers. So that's something we need to think about. In terms of ROE, again, the issues, if you look at the fundamental businesses that we're running, I would still argue much as I did 3 or 4 years ago that we have the ability to build ROE to a higher level than to many of our life peers. Now at the current time, again, we're in a period where there doesn't seem to be that much value from the standpoint of investors in terms of wanting to see that ROE improvement. I think that will change over time, and I think we will be more confident in rationalizing our capital base to grow our ROE overtime. But I am every bit as confident of our ability over the long term to hit a 15% ROE today as I was back in 2004 and 2005. And in fact, we do projections every year. We do very detailed projections, and as you know, we remain committed to that one rule of thumb that indicates we plan to grow ROE 50 basis points a year because as we've begun to shift towards international and asset management and asset accumulation, our ROE's potential is probably higher today than it was in 2005. So again, it's just a matter of time. It's a rationalization of the capital. And I'll let Terry cover the DAC amortization."

But I just don't understand what's the shortfall because of -- and until you can identify that, I don't know how you can expect us to have comfort that Principal can get back to 15% because you haven't addressed why it's below that now."

I will focus my comments on 3 areas this morning. First, results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2010; second, thoughts on capital management; and third, progress on implementation of our strategy during these challenging times. Terry will then cover financial results in more detail following my comments. 
Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses in third quarter and see increasing signs of growth across the businesses. We saw a sequential improvement in operating earnings, assets under management, book value per share and net income. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $219 million, up 15% from last quarter and up 15% from the year-ago quarter on a normalized basis. Year-to-date earnings increased 19% over last year, primarily due to higher assets under management and our ongoing expense discipline.
During the quarter, we saw assets under management grow by over 7% and had $2.3 billion of positive net cash flow from our growth engines. To remind you, we defined the accumulation businesses within U.S. Asset Accumulation, Principal Global Investors and Principal International as our higher-growth engines. 
As we look deeper at the business segments, U.S. Asset Accumulation financial results were solid, and the sales picture continues to improve. We view Full Service Accumulation year-to-date sales of $3.5 billion as positive in an environment that remains challenging. As a reminder, we said Full Service Accumulation sales will be higher in the second half of this year, and we remain confident that we will finish 2010 with full-year sales 15% to 20% above 2009 full year results of $5 billion. 
Total Retirement Suite continues to set us apart from competitors, contributing 60% of total full service accumulation sales for 2010. Principal Funds continues to see very strong growth, as a result of having some new and innovative products that appeal to investors. Principal Funds generated a record $790 million of net cash flow for the quarter. An example of these innovative products is our Global Diversified Income Fund. Still in its infancy at less than 2 years old, the fund reached $1 billion in assets under management this quarter. Fewer than 3% of all funds registered at the same time have reached the $1 billion milestone. The market continues to search for yield, putting our high-yield and preferred security strategies in high demand, and showcasing our retirement asset allocation expertise, all 11 of our target-date fund options have top quartile Morningstar peer group performance for the 1-year period.
Principal Global Investors saw a return to a somewhat more normal quarter. Positive unaffiliated net cash flow of $800 million highlights our success in attracting money to specialized investment options, such as real estate and currency, as well as in high-yield and international equities. While the number of institutional clients seeking mandates is still depressed, we are seeing activity build each quarter.
Shifting our focus to international markets, Principal International had an outstanding third quarter, with strong net cash flow and investment performance leading to a record $42 billion in assets under management. Despite a lower economic interest in Brasilprev, Principal International remains a strong growth driver, as we continue to deliver our retirement and asset management expertise in key emerging markets. Our reach in these markets is extensive. 
In Brazil, China and Malaysia alone, we have access to more than 200 million individual customers and more than 5 million business customers through our partnerships with Banco Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America; China Construction Bank, the second-largest commercial back in the world; and CIMB Group, the fifth largest financial services provider in Southeast Asia. Our presence in key international markets, most for more than 10 years, gives us an advantage over competitors to capitalize on the rapidly growing middle class and privatization of pension systems. 
Moving to the risk businesses, in light of our decision to exit insured medical and the administrative services-only businesses, we renamed the Life and Health segment U.S. Insurance Solutions, which now comprises the Individual Life and Specialty Benefits divisions. With year-to-date operating earnings of $141 million, the segment contributes solid earnings and a return on equity of 11.5%. Importantly, this business provides product depth and breadth for the broader financial security needs of small to medium-sized businesses and individuals, and keeps us connected to thousands of advisors that are active in these businesses. 
Let me comment quickly on our investment portfolio performance this quarter. Once again, credit losses trended down. The portfolio continues to perform better than our beginning-of-the-year expectations thanks to a strong recovery in both corporate credit and commercial real estate. Our portfolio is built for the long-term, and the portfolio construction is the right fit to support our liabilities. Purposeful diversification continues to benefit our financial results during this challenging time, whether it be the strength of our international operations, offsetting a slowdown in the U.S. retirement market during the economic crisis, or our mix of fee-based and risk-based products. Today, approximately 65% of our company earnings are tied to fee-based products, which are not directly impacted by a low interest rate environment. Less than 10% of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate accounts are crediting interest at the minimum guaranteed levels, which means our earnings are much less impacted than our peers in this low-interest rate environment.
Signs in the third quarter indicate that the risk of a double-dip recession is fading. However, we expect the U.S. economic recovery to continue to be choppy. The September U.S. Small-Business Optimism Index remains unchanged since June, and the job market recovery is still sluggish. Despite this, as I mentioned at the outset of the call, our businesses are seeing increased signs of growth, and we believe we are at or near an inflection point. Most notably, recurring deposits in Full Service Accumulation relative to third quarter 2009 increased for the second straight quarter, which we see as a sign of future growth. We're seeing increased interest in Employee Stock Ownership plans or ESOPs. Thus far, in 2010, we've been selected to assist in more than 70 ESOP consulting opportunities, up from 14 in 2009.
ESOP engagements are a window into what is happening in the small and medium-size business market. Our ESOP expertise provides a unique opportunity to cross-sell other retirement products and further capture the assets as the relationship grows over time; a return to positive long-term fund flows in the mutual fund industry and record net cash flow for Principal funds; continued strong net cash flow and record assets under management for Principal International; an increase in global institutional search activity, driving positive unaffiliated net cash flow for Principal Global Investors; an increase in Specialty Benefits premiums for the second quarter in a row, after 5 quarters of decline, as well as the stabilization of membership levels and a recovery in Individual Life sales, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
Overall, the results continue to demonstrate that Principal has the right mix of products and services that advisors, businesses and individuals are looking for as the U.S. economy continues to rebuild.
Now I want to touch on capital management. First of all, as we announced yesterday, we are pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% common stock dividend increase, which is a sign of our confidence in our businesses, as well as our commitment to deliver shareholder value. We will continue to weigh all of the options to deploy capital and make decisions that are in the long-term interest of our shareholders. We see increased merger and acquisition opportunities in the international areas and global asset management, which would fit nicely within our business model. 
In addition, we view share repurchase as an attractive option. With all options, we will be very disciplined as we look to put excess capital to work, and we look forward to providing more details on our capital strategy at our Investor Day on December 9.
My third and final topic is to discuss the ongoing implementation of our strategy. Our focus remains the same, to help growing businesses, individuals and institutional clients achieve financial security and success. We have continued to work on the implementation of our strategy even during the financial crisis, with important steps like renewing our Brasilprev joint venture for 23 years, entering attractive new emerging markets like Indonesia and Thailand, and adding new U.S. distribution relationships like Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
We are excited about the long-term growth opportunities for all our businesses. We have the expertise and the right business mix to work with advisors to help the large underserved and underpenetrated market of small to medium-sized businesses meet their business owner and employee benefits needs. In the U.S., it helped 78 million baby boomers, 80 million echo boomers and everyone in between with their savings, protection and retirement income needs, to continue to export and grow our retirement and asset management expertise in select international markets, where we already have an established footprint and strong local distribution partners, and to grow our proven global multi-boutique asset management model. 
Obviously, the biggest strategic decision for the quarter was to wind down the Health business, which demonstrates our discipline to focus on our opportunities for growth, while maintaining a diversified business portfolio. The investment needed to achieve scale to stay competitive in a rapidly changing healthcare industry did not make sense for us, as we focus on overall value for our shareholders. We do not expect the wind-down to have any meaningful impact on our Specialty Benefits business. Over the past few years, we have deliberately built Specialty Benefits as a standalone business with a dedicated sales team and focused employees and infrastructure. 
Less than 5% of Specialty Benefits premiums are tied to medical. Overall, our hybrid business model of asset management and risk-based products is poised for superior growth, as we look out over the next 10 to 15 years and beyond. We export our U.S. leadership and expertise in retirement, asset accumulation and asset management to select emerging markets. We are in markets with fast-growing middle income populations. We're optimistic about the positive momentum we are seeing in all our lines of business. All opportunities, both domestically and abroad, will deliver long-term results and shareholder value. 
Before I turn the call over to Terry, I want to point out some recent recognition that we received across our businesses. CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management was recently named Best Asset Management House at the International Takaful Awards in London 2010. While currently, a small portion of our Global Asset Management business, there is little doubt that Shariah-compliant funds have great growth potential. We are pleased to get in on the ground floor and win awards as we go. Additionally, The Principal was named InformationWeek 500 for the 13th straight year and made our ninth appearance on the Working Mother 100 Best Companies list. We believe this third-party recognition demonstrates the true character of the organization and that the Principal remains a company advisors and customers want to do business with and investors can trust. Terry?"
201105,98726596,163490,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

This morning I'll focus on operating earnings, including continued strong expense management, details on the accounting implications of our exit from the Health business, net income including continued solid performance of the investment portfolio, and finally an update on our improving capital position and strong balance sheet. 
Again, we view third quarter as solid and have seen several inflection points for many of our lines of business. As Larry highlighted, we are seeing many positive trends and are excited about our growth opportunities going forward. Starting with total company results, third quarter 2010 operating earnings were $219 million or $0.68 per share, flat compared to third quarter last year. However, there were a number of items influencing comparability between periods. These include opportunistic early redemption of medium-term notes in third quarter 2009; the reduced economic interest in our Brasilprev joint venture; and the impact of equity markets, model enhancements and assumption changes on DAC amortization. 
Excluding these items, total company earnings improved 15% over third quarter 2009 on 10% higher average assets under management, a very solid result reflecting our operational leverage. Let me quickly quantify the larger items influencing third quarter 2010 reported earnings per share of $0.68. DAC amortization true-ups for equity market performance and modeling assumptions benefited Full Service Accumulation, individual annuities and Principal International by $0.04, and negatively impacted Individual Life by $0.02. Adjusting for significant impacts to DAC amortization, both positive and negative, it's consistent with prior periods. As a result, the run rate of earnings for the quarter is $0.66 per share. 
Now let me discuss the business unit results. Starting with the U.S. Asset Accumulation earnings, normalized for a strong fee income from early redemption of medium-term notes in the third quarter 2009 and DAC amortization true-ups due to the equity markets, current quarter earnings are in line with the increase in average account values compared to our prior year period. 
Reflecting continued expense management, Full Service Accumulation's third quarter 2010 operating earnings are up 14% on a 9% increase in average account values compared to the prior year quarter. To enforce Larry's earlier comments, our strong October sales further reinforces our confidence that we expect Full Service Accumulation sales to be up 15% to 20% over last year. We expect to end the year with a positive net cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion against the projected industry outflows in 2010, according to the independent research firm, Cerulli. 
In the third quarter, Principal Funds had $2.5 billion in sales, a record net cash flow of $790 million and continued success from our extensive retail distribution network. The drop in individual annuity earnings from a year ago primarily reflects a $6 million after-tax increase in DAC amortization expense due to equity markets compared to third quarter 2009 and reduced interest margins in our fixed deferred annuity business. Earnings from Principal Global Investors improved 43% from a year ago. The improvement reflects a 5% growth in average assets under management, strong expense management and a significant increase in transaction fees, which are trending up more to normal levels. Additionally, unaffiliated net cash flow was a positive $800 million. We are cautiously optimistic about future flows, as we're starting to see mandates fund in specialized investment options where we have expertise, such as real estate, currency, high yield and international equities. 
We are pleased with the third quarter funding of our China Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor or QDII, which is a fund issued by CCB Principal Asset Management that invests in international securities for Chinese investors. The majority of these assets will be managed by PGI. We are one of a select group that has been authorized by the Chinese government to offer this product. And although a small step, this is a great opportunity going forward.
Moving to Principal International, where operating earnings were $33 million, third quarter 2010 benefited from a $3 million of DAC amortizations due to favorable market conditions. Principal International has added $8 billion of assets under management year-to-date. $3 billion of that is positive net cash flow resulting in a record $42 billion of assets under management. Earnings were strong, despite the lower economic interest in our joint venture business, Brasilprev, which was offset by solid investment performance. When you adjust for foreign exchange, inflation in Latin America and the new ownership percentage in Brasilprev, Principal International operating earnings grew at 20% year-over-year. 
U.S. Insurance Solutions had operating earnings of $47 million for the third quarter compared to $56 million in the prior-year quarter. Individual Life with operating earnings of $23 million compared to $30 million in the year-ago quarter accounted for the majority of this difference. 
Operating earnings were negatively impacted by updates due to DAC model and assumptions. Mortality was in line for the quarter despite GAAP reinsurance accounting that required us to defer recognition partially offset by DAC amortization expense. The current quarterly run rate for Life's operating earnings remains about $30 million. Individual Life sales are up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year. 
Turning to Specialty Benefits, operating earnings were $25 million for the third quarter 2010, compared to $26 million to the prior-year quarter, largely due to the decline in members from a year ago. However, we are pleased that membership is stabilizing and premiums grew again for the second straight quarter after 5 quarters of premium declines. Overall, sales were very strong in the quarter, up 16% over the year-ago quarter because of strong individual disability sales and an increased focus on our core markets for our grouped lines of business.
Next, I'd like to review the accounting treatment impact from the Health exit. Earnings from Health, which are premiums, fees and claims paid are now excluded from operating earnings and show up in the Corporate segment below the line as an other after-tax adjustment. The corporate overhead that was allocated to Health, approximately $8 billion after-tax per quarter, is now being included in the Corporate segment's operating earnings. 
These changes are retroactive, and we estimate they will reduce full year 2010 operating earnings per share results $0.18 to $0.20. Therefore, the short-term quarterly run rate for the corporate operating segment will be a negative $25 million to $30 million. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will diligently manage expenses against revenue to offset this additional overhead. And overtime, we expect the corporate operating earnings run rate to return to the current quarterly run rate of negative $20 million to $25 million. 
Corporate operating earnings for the third quarter 2010 was a negative $24 million. This includes the allocation of overhead expenses from the Health exit, which was offset by higher interest on excess capital. Additionally, third quarter 2010 corporate segment net income includes $49 million of onetime after-tax expenses related to planned severance and goodwill write-down as a result of our exit from the Health business. 
The net capital we expect to free up as a result of this transaction is between $100 million and $120 million and will become available as the liabilities roll off our balance sheet. In addition, we anticipate receiving compensation from United Healthcare as the membership transitions, which will be reflected in the other after-tax adjustments in the Corporate segment. We will earn a portion of this starting in fourth quarter 2010, and the rest will be spread throughout the transition period. 
Moving to total company net income, we view our $142 million result in the third quarter as solid once you reconcile the accounting treatment for the Health business exit. After-tax net realized capital losses continue to trend lower at $31 million in third quarter, compared to $53 million in the year-ago quarter, as we continue to see a pattern of improvement in credit-related losses over the past several quarters. 
We also continue to see sequential improvement in CMBS and commercial mortgage whole loans. Commercial mortgages, at $7 million after-tax, had its lowest quarter of losses since year-end 2008. Corporate credit losses also remained very low. Our investment portfolio performance continues to reflect the benefit of broad asset diversification and strong asset liability management. 
Quickly looking at other financial metrics, book value per share, excluding AOCI ended the quarter at a record $27.71, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. We finished the quarter at a $1.5 billion net unrealized capital gain position, up $1.2 billion from last quarter. This is the primary reason that book value per share, including AOCI, was $29.20, also an all-time record. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio is 15%. The increase in these financial metrics reflect the ongoing improvement in credit markets as the U.S. economy rebuilds. 
As Larry indicated, our hybrid business model business is less capital-intensive and will help us weather the current low interest rate environment. Of our nearly $60 billion of Principal Life's general and guaranteed separate accounts, roughly 1/3 includes a minimum interest rate guarantee, and less than 10% is currently at those minimums. Of the remaining portion not yet at the minimums, we have an average of 75 basis points of cushion above the guaranteed minimum rate. 
Given our ability to reduce crediting rates, coupled with our active interest rate risk management, we estimate a very modest earnings impact due to a low interest rate environment. Interest rates in the international markets we're in are currently increasing, providing a natural hedge to our U.S. business. If the current interest rate environment persists for the foreseeable future, we would expect 2011 earnings to be reduced by 1% to 2%.
Moving to capital adequacy. As of quarter end, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio to be around 450%. Relative to a 350% RBC ratio, we have approximately $2.2 billion of total excess capital, split evenly between the Life company and the holding company. Even with our commitment to hold a higher component of excess capital as cushion currently around $1 billion, we clearly have substantial financial flexibility. 
As you know, 3 of the 4 rating agencies have the life insurance industry on stable outlook. This, along with improving market fundamentals and our businesses' ongoing ability to generate free cash flow, gives us the ability to increase shareholder value over time through a strategic capital redeployment. Once again, we are pleased with our solid results. More importantly, we are excited about the developing positive trends in our businesses. This concludes our prepared remarks.

But one point I would make before I turn it over to Terry is that I would tell you, if you actually looked year-to-date for FSA, you'll see that the account value is up about 16%, but the DAC amortizations for year-to-date are up about 44% over the comparable quarters for '09. So again, these are the kinds of things that, from quarter-to-quarter, will go back and forth. But when you string the quarters together, I think you get a better picture of how the DAC amortizations are going. So I kind of encourage you to look at that on a year-to-date basis, but I'll have Terry give you the expected quarterly rates."

So maybe if I can ask this question this way, can we expect you to manage back down to a 350% risk-based capital ratio? I mean, in other words, should we really be viewing excess capital as the full $2.2 billion that you guys highlight relative to a 350%, or is the deployable amount -- let's say, in the relatively near term, next 1 to 2 years, is the deployable amount really something lower than that?"

What I'd say to be really candid with you and others that are listening is nobody knows. Nobody knows whether, over time, 350% is going to become the standard or is the new standard going to be something closer to 400%. I hear you and others speculate on that over time, and I think the reality is that none of us know the answer to that, which is partly why I think we'll continue to be a little bit cautious. Having said that, we're obviously at the strongest point in our history. Another point, I guess, I would make is that I think that the insurance industry, just like the banking industry undergoing Basel III, we're going to see new prudential standards. We're going to see Solvency II. We're going to see principles-based reserves coming to the insurance industry sometime in 2013, 2014. I think the good news for us is that with a lesser percentage of our businesses tied to insurance, that will have a less dramatic impact, but having said that, there is still some uncertainty. But realistically, I would say that deployable capital today is probably somewhere in that maybe $500 million to $750 million range. I think that the action the board took yesterday in terms of a 10% increase in dividends should tell you a lot about both how the board thinks that our businesses are operating as well as how the board kind of sees our excess capital position."

Having said that, again, I think there remains reason for caution, as I was describing earlier. And I guess the way I would think about that is that I think as we continue to get into each quarter of 2011, I think the likelihood increases around the opportunity to potentially have some budget, if you will, for M&A as well as some budget for return of capital to shareholder in some fashion. And obviously, given where the stock is trading today, a share repurchase is a very, very attractive option, as I said in my comments.

But again, what we're trying to give you is a leading indicator of where that particular part of the business is going, which is a very positive one. They do have, as you said, lesser margins. We've commented on that as primarily consulting fees. In terms of corporate tax rate, DRD is running about the same level as it has run in years past. It's been around the range of $75 million. I suppose one could speculate that maybe corporations sitting with a trillion dollars of cash on their collective balance sheets might be paying out more dividend, but we haven't seen sort of clear trends in that. We are seeing on the international side, I think there is going to be some increase in tax rates. We've sort of burned through.

One would be around the sheer number of advisors requesting a proposal are likely to be on track this year to hit a record high, which tells us that our efforts in building our alliance partnerships are good. We've got about a 5% increase on a year-to-date basis of our pipeline. Our close rates have ticked up nicely. We also had, if you look at the number of plans sold, roughly up 21%, and we're showing a good track record there. And the other closing comment I would make is that TPA initiative is well underway.

They're not nearly as -- to be honest, they're not, of course, nearly as large and sort of headline-grabbing as something like an Alico might be, but I will also tell you that I think over the long term, they may actually be more a value creation because I think we have demonstrated very clearly over the time we've been a public company that one of our greatest capabilities is to take some sort of competency and attach that to our distribution engine, whether that's here in the U.S. or our global distribution platform, and really maximize the value coming out of that. So as we look forward, for example, we see a lot of opportunities. The need around emerging market asset management is going to be huge, and we are extremely well positioned to do that. So we see -- and it's not an either/or question here, Ed. What I'm trying to communicate here is we see the possibility to do some very attractive, over the longer term, M&A. It may not be quite as accretive in the near term. It'll be very attractive in the long term, and that still wouldn't necessarily keep us from doing some level of share repurchase as we get into the middle part, later part of 2011. So it's not either/or. It's both/and. And I think you'll see us take actions as we get into 2011."

Still, the biggest deficiency we have is around transfer deposits. It's up over 300 basis points compared to that same period of time. If you look closely and talk to the advisors, what they would tell you is it seems like we've reached kind of the bottom year relative to the economic recovery, and it's a slow build-out from here.

That's not necessarily because employment is growing, but at least the employment shrinkage has stopped. We're starting to see deferrals come up a little bit, so we're starting to see matches come back a little bit. So those things is what's driving the increase in recurring deposits.

First, you talked about Solvency III and principles-based reserving, but it would seem to me that certainly relative to the life peer group, the protection businesses are a much smarter part of your story. All of the focus is -- whether it's Solvency, whether it's IFRS, are really driven on the liability side, which, again, is where you haven't taken the risk unlike, perhaps, a variable annuity writer. So I'm not sure why you're as cautious about that. Maybe you could help us with that. Secondly, and I think the big question here, on capital management, Larry, is I remember an analysts' meeting a couple of years ago where you were up there and talking about an ROE projection getting up to 16%, 17%, 18%. Here, we're stuck at under 10%, and if I take your number, okay, of what the true, if we like, excess is of 500 to 750 and we take that out, maybe we can stretch the ROE for the company this quarter to 11%. But what doesn't seem to be addressed to me is, why are you running 400 to 500, 600 points and below what you said before was your goal, when the projection business is even going to be smaller now? And then finally, Terry, could you just clarify what the DAC adjustments were on the lifeline? Was that related to secondary guarantee UL, and what did you change?"

But as it relates to Solvency II, I think I indicated in my response, Colin, on one of the earlier questions that, again, we agree that while -- that we will be impacted less by whatever Solvency II new capital requirements are. This company will be impacted by them to a lesser degree, but having said that, it is one of the important things that we're looking at along with, as I said before, the whole question from the Financial Stability Oversight Council as to what is going to be a systemically significant institution. I think that is one that probably is going to happen sooner and may well, in fact, involve us as compared to some of the other life peers. So that's something we would need to think about. In terms of ROE, again, the issues, if you look at the fundamental businesses that we're running, I would still argue much as I did 3 or 4 years ago that we have the ability to build ROE to a higher level than to many of our life peers. Now at the current time, again, we're in a period where there doesn't seem to be that much value from the standpoint of investors in terms of wanting to see that ROE improvement. I think that will change over time, and I think we will be more confident in rationalizing our capital base to grow our ROE overtime. But I am every bit as confident of our ability over the long term to hit a 15% ROE today as I was back in 2004 and 2005. And in fact, we do projections every year. We do very detailed projections, and as you know, we remain committed to that one rule of thumb that indicates we plan to grow ROE 50 basis points a year because, as we've begun to shift towards international and asset management and asset accumulation, our ROE's potential is probably higher today than it was in 2005. So again, it's just a matter of time. It's a rationalization of the capital. And I'll let Terry cover the DAC amortization."
