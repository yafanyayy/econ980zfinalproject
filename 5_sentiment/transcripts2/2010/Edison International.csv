We started the year with some significant uncertainties including the major one with the IRS. We were successful in reaching a global tax settlement with the IRS covering over 100 disputed items, including Edison Capital's cross-border leases which were terminated. The global settlement generated significant cash benefits of $400 million over time. It did however, produced net non-core charges totaling $0.78 per share resulting in a recorded earnings of $2.59 per share for the year, $1.10 below 2008 results.Core earnings which exclude these tax-related charges and other non-core items were $3.25 per share exceeding the high end of our 2009 guidance range. This morning, we also introduced guidance for our 2010 core earnings of $3.15 to $3.45 per share for Edison International. Our 2010 outlook for Southern California Edison is for modest growth over our stronger-than-expected 2009 core earnings. We expect Edison Mission Group to be flat to slightly down from last year's core earnings. The reason for the $0.30 range is mostly due to the unpredictability of commodity prices and their effect on our competitive generation.Jim Scilacci will review our financial results and 2010 guidance in detail in his remarks. The rest of my comments focus on a few highlights of the past year and our major areas of focus in 2010. In addition to the global tax settlement already mentioned, another area of significant progress in 2009 was on the regulatory front for Southern California Edison. Key rate case decisions from the California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as well as the approval of our 250-megawatt rooftop solar program, provide meaningful uncertainty about our growth prospects. Moreover, regulatory decisions in the fourth quarter set the stage for additional growth. These included CPUC approval of both the remaining segments of the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project, segments 4-11 and the Devers-Colorado River Transmission Project. These and the other elements of our investment program will be implemented under a CPUC approved extension through 2012 of the cost of capital mechanism. Lastly, the CPUC decision on our energy efficiency program yielded earnings of $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter and an additional $0.05 per share in the 2010 subject to the CPUC final audit.SCE's 2009 capital spending was a record $2.9 billion. Once the rate case was finalized last March, we ramped up spending to improve the reliability of the distribution system. By year end, SCE had completed the first three segments of the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project and had installed the first 150,000 of over 5 million advanced SmartConnect meters.Our investment efforts will accelerate in 2010 as we move more transmission projects into construction, accelerate the pace of SmartConnect installations, move the rooftop solar program into full gear and undertake the many reliability enhancing investments in the distribution system. The 2010 capital program as well as the SCE's five-year $21 plus billion investment program will require superior execution to manage this unprecedented growth. Equally, our basic daily operations require superior execution. We have several goals for the year to accomplish this, including focusing on improving our operations at the San Onofre nuclear station, strengthening the company's disaster recovery preparedness and the overall industrial safety.2010 will be an important year on the regulatory front. We look for clarification from the CPUC on the longer-term earnings opportunity in energy efficiency as well as filing in the net in the fall, our next three year general rate case covering years 2012 through 2014. We will be actively engaged in California's rule-making efforts involving a 33% renewable energy requirement by 2020. Our service territory includes areas rich with wind and solar energy potential. Significant new transmission investment will be required to access increased levels of renewables, and integrating such substantial levels of intermittent resources requires additional capital investment. All of this comes at a cost to ratepayers. We remain committed to finding the right balance that helps achieve the states public policy objectives with the ratepayer's needs for reliable, affordable electric power.At our competitive generation subsidiary, Edison Mission Group, our strategy involves balancing twin objectives. First, to grow and expand our Renewables platform and second, to meet our coal fleet environmental requirements in a way that is financially sound and durable. We are making progress on both fronts.In the past two months, EMG has placed a 130-megawatt project into construction backed by a long-term contract with Oklahoma Gas and Electric. It also recently signed a contract for an 80-megawatt project with the Nebraska Power Authority and anticipates construction to begin on this project in the second quarter. EMG started last year with commitments to purchase 948 megawatts of wind turbines. To date, it has reduced its turbine commitments by more than 2/3, mostly by placing amended projects under construction. EMG has good visibility on the placement of most of its remaining 302 megawatts of wind turbine commitments into contracted or advanced development projects. Over the course of last year, we were encouraged to see the financial markets reopen, allowing us to obtain project financing. Equally, we saw utilities reenter the market and commit to long-term contracts for renewable power. EMG continues to manage its Renewables development pipeline with a near-term focus on the best projects using current turbine commitments, while managing its overall development spending as it moves forward with environmental control plans at Midwest Generation.We've also made important progress evaluating our compliance options for NOx and SO2 emissions controls. We have finalized our plans now for NOx compliance. We've decided on a $158 million investment program for NOx controls using selective non-catalytic reduction technology or SNCRs, at Midwest Generation plants. We will be retrofitting roughly 80% of our capacity which will allow Midwest Gen to meet its compliance requirements beginning in 2012. Importantly on February 8, the Illinois EPA issued our first SNCR construction permit for one of our Joliet units. Construction will commence this spring.For SO2 compliance, EMG's focus remains on trona dry sorbent technology. Testing completed last year at several of our stations demonstrated this technology was capable of producing enough SO2 emissions reductions to meet EMG's obligations under Illinois' SO2 emission requirements. However, the decision to install trona technology has not yet been made. We are still conducting technological, financial, regulatory and legal reviews of several unit compliance and shutdown combinations, including interim and ultimate alternative compliance solutions. Our final decisions may take some time and our subject to a variety of factors.Last year, our leadership team and employees showed they know how to adapt to an uncertain environment and challenging circumstances. Our future success will be determined by our ability to grow and adapt, and to consistently deliver results from our dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses. Building long-term value for our shareholders will continue to be driven by the three fundamentals I highlighted at this time last year, superior execution, financial discipline, and innovative solutions. In fact, they're likely to become only more important.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."

Today I will discuss the following items for: first, the financial and operating review; second, our updated capital spending forecast; third, some specifics on the EMG win program, that Ted just discussed; and lastly, our 2010 earnings guidance.Before I get into the details, the appendix [indiscernible] includes a detailed full year review for your reference. In addition, this morning we filed our 10-K and all five are available on our website. I would like to draw your attention to a change in the presentation of SCE's results of operation in the MD&A. The 10-K now provides a breakout of SCE's income statement between those activities that affects utility earnings and those cost recovery activities that don't impact profits, primarily fuel and purchase power costs. Because of the large number of regulatory balancing accounts, this change was made to improve the presentation of SCE's operating results and the key factors that impact earnings.Going to earnings, please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. Our earnings story remains one of solid SCE earnings growth consistent with its 2009 CPUC and FERC rate cases, and continued impact of lower wholesale power prices on EMG's financial performance. Edison International reported fourth quarter core earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.66 per share last year. The fourth quarter basic earnings were $0.65 for the quarter, $0.06 higher than the core. The difference is entirely due to revised interest estimate based on an updated information provided by the IRS in connection with the global tax settlement. In the appendix you will find an updated chart showing the impact of the global tax settlement on earnings and cash.Beginning with SCE on Page 3, fourth quarter core earnings were $0.51 per share, $0.08 above last year. Higher operating income from the 2009 CPUC and FERC rate cases were the principal drivers of the increase. The key elements of SCE's operating income is the growth in rate base. During 2009, SCE's cash position benefited from a global tax settlement and lower tax payments from the 2009 stimulus bill, providing bonus depreciation, and now in the fourth quarter of 2009, from the change in tax accounting over. These cash benefits allowed SCE to defer planned financing. As a result, actual interest costs for less than authorized in rates. In the fourth quarter, the interest benefit was offset by higher operating and maintenance costs, including higher cost of our San Onofre Nuclear Station.In the fourth quarter, SCE was authorized to recover costs incurred in early 2009 for the utility's participation in the Hydrogen Energy California project. This and the generator refund incentives provided $0.04 of positive benefit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Lastly, higher income taxes which included additional provisions for property related items, were a principal offset to earnings.Turning to Page 4, EMG's fourth quarter core earnings were $0.13 per share, down $0.12 from the prior year. The lower earnings arise from three primary areas. Lower realized power prices for our merchant coal sales, lower proprietary trading results, primarily because of less transmission congestion and lower earnings from our Edison capital resulting from the roll off of its investment portfolio. EMG's comparative results also benefit from $0.04 charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 from writing of gas turbine deposit for development projects. Included in the coal fleet results are FAS 133 unrealized gains of $0.03 in the fourth quarter compared to unrealized gains of $0.04 per share last year. So a net $0.01 negative quarter-over-quarter.Turning to Page 5, summarizes our full year results of $3.25 per share as Ted has already mentioned. As Ted mentioned, the primary difference between the core and basic earnings are the impacts of our global tax settlement and cross border lease terminations, and the transfer of Mountainview Power Plant to cost of service ratemaking. Now moving to Page 6, provides SCE's full year highlights. SCE's 2009 earnings of $2.68 per share reflects the higher operating income and rate base growth resulting from the 2009 CPUC and FERC rate cases. Additionally, as I just explained, lower financing costs provided $0.14 for the full year. Also during 2008, SCE had a depreciation adjustment and incurred costs related to a ballot initiative that did not occur in 2009. Finally, on a comparative basis, income taxes were higher in 2009 mainly from property related items including additional tax provisions; tax return true ups, back in 2008 the true up was positive while the true up was negative in 2009; and higher software deductions last year from implementation of SAP.EMG's 2009 core earnings were $0.16 per share, $1.04 per share below 2008's results. The majority of the variance was attributable to a $0.68 year-over-year decrease for the merchant coal earnings. Lower wholesale power prices were a major factor with year-over-year average 24 hour PJM energy prices decreasing 41% at NiHub and 44% at PJM West. Midwest Gen units were also impacted by higher tier annual NOx requirements which began in 2009 and the cost of operating new mercury controls. Embedded in the merchant coal results are FAS 133 gains for the year totaling $0.11 per share compared to $0.03 in 2008. These 2009 gains will likely turnaround in 2010 as losses and are reflected in earnings guidance that I will discuss later.Expected lower contract pricing impacted the gas fleet portfolio earnings resulting in a $0.06 per share decline. For the same reasons noted for the quarterly results, trading income was down $0.19 for the full year. Renewables were flat as a new project contributions were offset by mild wind conditions. Edison Capital's core earnings reflect its much reduced scope of operations following the cross-border lease terminations with core earnings of $0.11 per share lower than 2008.Moving onto Page 7, summarizes the key operating statistics for Midwest Gen and Homer City. Midwest Gen's reliability improvement efforts primarily a focus on Boiler II failure reductions, yielded positive results with 2009 forced outage rates decreasing to 5.8%. The improvement in equivalent availability helped maintain generation volumes at levels similar to 2008 despite lower load factors resulting from low price environment. At Homer City, reliability improvements efforts also reduced Boiler II leaks but forced outages and opacity deratings prevented, improving the plants annual forced outage rate. Pennsylvania imposed more stringent opacity regulations in 2009 and this resulted in more opacity deratings. Homer City was able to reduce opacity deratings by reducing ramp rates.Please turn to Page 8. During the fourth quarter, Midwest Gen added to its hedge position. And at December 31, our overall merchant coal fleet hedge position was generally in line with our targeted hedging, approximately 50% of our gross margin at risk for 2010. Midwest Gen also made nominal additions to it's 2011 hedge position. We did very little in the way of coal purchases in the fourth quarter, but in January and February, both Midwest Generation and Homer City added to their positions. This information is provided in the footnote on this chart.Turning now to SCE's capital spending and rate case growth. Beginning with SCE on Page 9, SCE's updated five-year capital spending forecast now for the periods 2010 through 2014 totaled $21.5 billion in the base case and $18 billion in the low case. As with last year's forecast, our low case primarily reflects the potential for delays relative to our forecasts schedules, especially for transmission projects. In 2009, SCE's capital spending was $2.9 billion or 15% below our original forecast. The delays in receiving Solar Rooftop decision and the transmission project approvals for the principal contributors to the difference. We have established a 16.5% difference between the base and low cases for the 2010 through 2014 forecast. This was determined by averaging the actual underspends for 2008 and 2009.From our last public forecast, SCE's five-year capital spending plan has increased from $19.8 billion to $21.5 billion. The increased spending largely reflects the drop of 2009 and the addition of 2014, which has higher spending profile. As we have previously mentioned, SCE continues it's strategic focus on transmission and distribution investments and innovative technology investments such as the 250-megawatt Solar Rooftop and Edison SmartConnect programs. Other than the Solar Rooftop program and capital spending for the existing fleet, SCE has not included any new generation investments in it's capital forecast. A key sign flows for SCE's capital spending is the 2012 CPUC rate case. Prior to year-end, we will file our application with the CPUC. With the heightened level of transmission capital spending, it is likely that SCE will file annual transmission rate cases, with 2010 rate cases pending before the FERC now. This capital forecast then is the basis for our updated rate base forecast shown on Page 10. Authorized rate base for 2009 was $14.8 billion. SCE's rate base came in $300 million higher than our original forecast, due primarily to slightly higher investment balances for transmission and SmartConnect. Off this larger base, we now see a five-year compounded annual growth rates of 11% in our base case and 8% in our low case. SCE will continue to fund it's capital spending program through periodic issuances of long-term debt and preferred stock consistent with its authorized capital structure, together with operating cash flow and retained earnings.Turning to EME's capital outlook on Page 11, the majority EME's three year capital spending plan is for construction of wind projects and payment for existing wind turbine commitments. The majority of this buildout will occur during 2010. The capital plan also includes as Ted said, $158 million for NOx compliance for Midwest Gen in 2010 and 2011 to address emission levels embodied in the agreement with the Illinois EPA. EME has not yet included expenditures for SO2 controls because its plan is still under development. On Page 11, we provide additional detail on wind project development. As of December 31, we had 390 megawatts of wind projects under construction and 512 megawatts of wind turbine commitments available for projects. Subsequent to year end, we began construction on the 130-megawatt Tolaga project and designated turbines to the 80-megawatt Laredo Ridge project. The capital and construction expenditures for the 2010 have been updated for the balance of plant and turbine payments for the Tolaga and the Laredo Ridge projects. This leaves 302 megawatts of remaining turbines that have not been designated for projects. The dollars owed for these turbines are reflected in the turbine commitment line.To pay for its capital program, EME sources include turbine and project level financings, U.S. Treasury grants for investment tax credits for completed wind projects, cash on hand, cash flow from operations and potentially, wind turbine payment deferrals. The project finance market is an important source of low-cost capital for EME. This market continues to improve and recently, we've seen longer tethers, improving terms and more participants entering the market. Given the placement of the turbines under construction and cost containment efforts with our joint development agreement partners, the wind development pipeline stands at approximately 4,000 megawatts down from the approximately 5,000 megawatts reported last year. Moving to guidance, please turn to Page 13. I would like to provide all bit more color on some of the key assumptions around are 2010 earnings guidance. As with our practice last year, we introduced a range for EIX overall and provided midpoint estimates for SCE, EMG and the holding company. For SCE assumed an average 2010 rate base of $16.2 billion. With this average rate base, SCE's authorized capital structure and return on common equity of 11.5% and a constant share count generating earnings of $2.75 per share. Energy efficiency is expected to provide an additional $0.05. However, the payment is under CPUC final review. A decision is expected during the third quarter of 2010.For EMG, we have used forward prices as of January 31 of this year. Last year we deferred some Midwest Generation maintenance outages into 2010, so we expect an increase in maintenance costs this year. We have assumed a range of EMMT pre-tax earnings of $60 million to $110 million with a midpoint of $85 million, and that's pre-tax too. In the first quarter of 2010, we received $80 million cash contribution or $0.03 per share from our March Point gas project, which would be included in first quarter earnings. Subsequent to the distribution, we sold our interest to our partner. Finally we continue to assume no significant earnings from the Edison Capital remaining investment portfolio. As with our normal practice, we assume normal operating conditions and no changes in GAAP accounting. We have not included any non-core items or discontinued operation in our guidance. For both basic and core EPS guidance are the same, about $3.15 to $3.45 per share.Turning to Page 14, I'll walk over 2009 actual core earnings to 2010 guidance. For SCE, expected rate base growth provides primary driver for utilities earnings growth. Some of the 2009 cash flow benefits that we discussed earlier are not expected to occur in 2010, and as such, this partially offsets the earnings increased from rate-base growth. For EMG, we anticipate lower results from the merchant coal generation fleet largely due to higher maintenance costs, higher priced hedges rolling off and FAS 133 losses. We do expect the Renewables portfolio to deliver high results for the new projects that were placed in service last year. The increase expected in EMMT and the decrease at Edison Capital are consistent with my earlier comments. We expect favorable comparisons in corporate expenses due to further reductions in EMG's A&G [ph]. That concludes my comments. Operator, we'll turn it over for Q&A."

I will just tick off a few of these. First one was energy efficiency. We have been carrying $0.03 for some period of time. And it came in at $0.05 for the full year, so plus $0.02. Additionally, I mentioned that during the call, in my prepared remarks, we were anticipating cost recovery for the HECA, that's the Hydrogen Energy Project, in the first quarter of 2010. And it actually occurred in December of 2009, and that was worth $0.03. On O&M spending, the thing at the end of the year, you anticipate that potential storm-related spending in-surge in the fourth quarter. Sometimes it's in the first quarter, depending upon what actually occurs, and we actually had fairly light storm activity in the November-December time frame. It seemed that it saved up and now it's moved into January and February, with the El Niño storms and the rains that's hitting us. So there was a benefit in O&M. And a related point, more in the weeds [ph], is our capital spending trend. And first, all of these that I'm going through are at utility. Our capital spending trends, we're ramping up during the course of the year, and they ramped up substantially in November and December. And so we had some higher AFUDC earnings that we weren't anticipating overall. And so those are the bigger drivers at the utility. At EMG, those are hard to predict at times, typically have to do with commodity prices, a little better activity at the Big 4 that wasn't anticipated. We made some further A&G [ph] reductions, and we made some cuts in our solar area. And at the holding company, it was just $0.01. So all in all, it's hard to predict these things as they occur, the timing of regulatory decisions. But I think that's the gist."

First quarter earnings reported on a GAAP basis were $0.72 per share. Core earnings, which are what we focused on were $0.82 per share, an increase of 4% over the first quarter of last year. Core earnings at Southern California Edison were $0.62 per share this quarter, $0.02 lower than in the first quarter of last year. Core earnings at Edison Mission Group were $0.22 per share, up $0.05 year-over-year. These results are consistent with our objectives of superior execution and financial discipline. We are also reaffirming today our core earnings guidance for 2010. Jim Scilacci is going to provide additional detail on our financial results in his remarks.
I'd like to highlight some of the more important challenges and opportunities we are working on across the company. The key to our growth is the ability to execute the five-year capital spending plan at Southern California Edison. This plan entails spending in the range of $18 billion to $21.5 billion, and would in turn generate an 8% to 11% average annual growth in rate base. This represents one of the highest growth rates in our industry.
SCE's capital program is heavily weighted to the wires side of the business. Transmission, distribution and installation of our Edison SmartConnect meters represents 82% of our investment program. We continue to advance our $5.5 billion transmission spending program, led by $3.7 billion in various projects that will access renewable energy resources. Most recent milestone came this past Tuesday, when we commemorated completion of the first leg of our Tehachapi renewable transmission project, northeast of Los Angeles.
Installation of our SmartConnect meters are running at 7,500 meters per day. And we are on schedule to complete over 5 million Smart meter connections in 2012. Another major capital investment program that is progressing is 250 megawatts of solar panels on the roofs of commercial and industrial buildings. In the last quarter, we made our primarily solar panel technology selection. And we are now working with a number of warehouse and distribution center owners to finalize our next installation sites.
We also completed the steam generator replacement project at unit 2 of our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and have the unit back producing electricity. Much of SCE's growth is supported by aggressive yet constructive public policy. For example, the Tehachapi transmission project I mentioned, was granted upfront funding by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rather than the more traditional approach of requiring developers of individual renewable projects to sponsor the funding. This approach, which was actively supported by the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent system operator, significantly reduces the uncertainty for developers, and will thereby facilitate the development of 4,500 megawatts of wind and solar projects in the Tehachapi mountains.
Let me now turn to Edison Mission Group, which in addition to improved earnings from last year's first quarter made some good progress on several of its initiatives. In meetings with investors over the last couple of months, I've been asked about the various policy issues that might impact the coal fleet. Our environmental compliance approach for the Illinois fleet, ETA rules on air emissions, greenhouse gas legislation or regulation, the EPA's New Source Review litigation and so on. We've been clear that we are considering all of these issues in formulating our compliance approach. The issues are complex and we intend to be deliberate in reaching our decisions.
During the first quarter, Midwest Generation continued its permitting and planning activities for installation of SNCR technology on multiple units to meet the NOx  portion of the Illinois Combined Pollutant Standard.  In addition, work continues on analysis and evaluation of FGD technology using dry scrubbing with sodium-based solvents, as a less capital intensive method to comply with the SO2 portion of the CPS [Combined Pollutant Standard]  Given our use of low sulfur coal.
EMG has continued its financial discipline in managing its wind turbine commitments. During the first quarter, EMG placed 211 megawatts of its remaining committed wind turbines into projects that met our investment and financing criteria. And we have contract negotiations underway that will place most of the remaining turbines. The most significant open position remains with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries or MHI . We have had and continue to have disputes with MHI. And in March, we initiated litigation to  void the contract among other revenues and get back our deposits. Jim will discuss the near-term implications for EME's  financing plans in his comments.
At both SCE and EMG, we've been able to take advantage of improved capital markets conditions. SCE successfully extended a $500 million credit facility for an additional three years, and raised $500 million in fixed rate 30-year debt at an attractive rate of 5.5% or 90 basis points over treasuries. We're also seeing increased debt in the nonrecourse project Finance lending market, which represents an important tool for EMG's growth platforms. Our most recent success was $160 million construction and term financing for our Cedro Hill project in Texas.
Finally, liquidity remains strong. SCE has over $2.7 billion in liquidity and EME and its subsidiaries have close to $2 billion, while the holding company has over $1.3 billion in liquidity. This is even a stronger position than where we were a year ago and reflects, I think, our focus on execution and financial discipline. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."
301891,100536173,60334,"Edison International, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 07, 2010",2010-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our financial and operating reviews, update EMG's wind construction program and funding plans for this program and review our reaffirmed 2010 core earnings guidance.On Page 2 of this presentati",1304,"Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our financial and operating reviews, update EMG's wind construction program and funding plans for this program and review our reaffirmed 2010 core earnings guidance.
On Page 2 of this presentation, we have summarized quarterly GAAP and core earnings. Ted already gave you the highlights for EIX. Before I talk about SCE and imaging core earnings, there are few non-core items in both the first quarter of 2009 and 2010 to discuss.
First, during the first quarter of 2010, SCE reported a charge of $39 million after tax or $0.12 per share due to the changes in the 2010 healthcare reform bill. Also during the first quarter of 2010, EMG had a $0.02 per share benefit from discontinued operations related to exploration of a contract indemnity in foreign exchange gains on our remaining international asset sale obligations. The  EMG's first quarter 2009 results included a net $0.03 per share charge, primarily related to terminating two of Edison Capital's cross-border leases.
Turning to Page 3, from a big picture perspective, our 2010 guidance for SCE reflects higher earnings primarily from expected rate base growth. However, SCE's first quarter 2010 core earnings decreased $0.02 to $0.62 per share. You will recall that the utility received its 2009 General Rate Case in March of last year, and had curtailed O&M spending during the first quarter of 2009 until the decision was received. However, when we received the GRC decision, it authorized revenues retroactive to January of 2009.
Starting at the end of 2009, we've provided a breakdown of activities that we earn a return on, which we refer to as utility earnings activities. For activities that do not earn a return, which we refer to as cost recovery activities. We have provided a summary table of these activities, as part of the backup information in the slides. The items I will cover here relate to utility earning activities.
For 2010, SCE had higher operating revenue of $61 million or $0.11 per share from regulatory decisions authorizing higher rate base of $0.06 and escalation and other of $0.05 per share. SCE had higher O&M of $78 million or $0.14 per share, which includes the impact of curtail spending in the first quarter of 2009, as I previously mentioned. The increase in O&M was primarily due to $30 million of higher transmission and distribution expenses and $20 million of higher expenses, primarily at San Onofre and at Four Corners.
SCE also had $27 million of higher depreciation expense or $0.05 per share, primarily from increased capital investments. And $10 million of lower net interest expense and other primarily due to an increase in AFUDC from an increase in the capitalization rate in 2010 relative to 2009 and higher levels of construction in progress.
Now turning to Page 4, we'll go through EMG's earnings. From a big picture perspective again, our guidance for EMG's 2010 core earnings is slightly lower than last year's. However, EMG core earnings in the first quarter of 2010 were $0.05 higher than last year. This increase is primarily due to the following.
In the natural gas projects category, we realized $33 million in income from the March Point and Doga projects during the first quarter of 2010 without comparable amounts during the first quarter of 2009. And a $37 million increase in energy trading  income during the first quarter of 2010 from improved congestion and bases  trading. These increases were partially offset by the following three items: $27 million decrease in adjusted operating income from Midwest Gen due to lower average realized energy prices. This decrease was partially offset by lower emissions cost and higher capacity revenues. In addition, Midwest Gen recorded unrealized gains of $15 million during the first quarter of 2009 compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Next, $70 million decrease in adjusted operating income from renewable projects due to poor  wind conditions. Overall, availability increased as a result of completing the Suzlon blade remediation program but was partially offset by outages caused by severe winter weather. In addition, EMG received liquidated damages totaling $11 million related to the Suzlon blade issues during the first quarter of 2009.
Lastly, a $10 million decrease in adjusted operating income from leveraged leases, which is reported in the corporate and other category, following the termination of the cross-border leases during 2009, which occurs as part of the global settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. 
On Page 5 or the operating statistics for our merchant  coal fleet. During the first quarter of 2010, generation at both Midwest Gen and Homer City increased relative to the first quarter of last year.  Fleet forced  outage rates continue to improve leading to higher availability factors. This increase in generation partially offsets the lower average realized prices.
Turning to Page 6, EMG added to its 2011 and '12 forward power sales positions. For 2011, EMG added 10.5-kilowatt hours and for 2012, it added 2.8-kilowatt hours. The majority of these additional hedges were at Midwest Gen and the change in average price reflects current market conditions. We also added to our coal position, primarily in 2011 with 1.9 million tons at Midwest Gen and 1.6 million tons at Homer City.
As shown on Page 7, wind projects under construction or pending constructions stands at 601 megawatts. We have removed 199 megawatts or $289 million of MHI turbine commitments because of EMG has proceeded the litigation and has asked the court to void the contracts. As of March 31, there was 102 megawatts in uncommitted turbines with remaining payments of $86 million.
Turning to Page 8, we have added this slide to better explain how EMG intends to fund remaining wind-related CapEx. The left side of the chart begins with wind capital commitments as of December 31, 2009. We had adjusted wind commitments for the disputed MHI wind payments and for actual first quarter 2010 capital expenditures. As indicated in the right side of the chart, as of March 31, there were $765 million of funding sources to cover the remaining $732 million of projects under construction and payments for uncommitted wind turbines. EMG has existing financings to fund $294 million of capital expenditures and expects to obtain approximately $470 million in U.S. Treasury grants under the existing Federal stimulus program. The majority of the cash grants is anticipated in 2011, following completion of projects under construction.
Page 9 shows EMG's updated capital spending forecast. EMG continues to work on its plan for controlling SO2 emissions from their Midwest Generation plants. EMG will update the capital expenditure forecast for the decision on the compliance plan it's made.
Turning to Page 10, we have summarized the principal financial covenants for the EME and Midwest Gen credit agreements and for the Homer City lease. We also have made several additional financing documents available on our website based on requests from our fixed income investors. They can be found at www.edisoninvestor.com.
Please turn to Slide 11. We have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at $3.15 to $3.45 per share or the midpoint of $3.30 per share. We have updated our GAAP earnings guidance to reflect non-core items recorded in the first quarter. Our reaffirmed guidance range reflects gas and forest [ph] as of March 31 otherwise there are no other major assumption changes. Before I move to Q&A, I want to point out one change to our financial reporting in the Edison International 10-Q.
Effective this quarter, we have combined the segment reporting for Edison Mission Group. This change eliminates the separate financial information for Edison Capital. This change has no impact on the separate recording for Edison Mission Energy or subsidiary and has no impact on earnings or cash flow. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Today, Edison International reported second quarter earnings of $1.05 per share, with core earnings of $0.62 per share, primarily some timing related events depressed earnings in the first half, and particular",1376,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Today, Edison International reported second quarter earnings of $1.05 per share, with core earnings of $0.62 per share, primarily some timing related events depressed earnings in the first half, and particularly the second quarter at Edison Mission Group.
We moved around several planned outages in the coal fleet, concentrating them into the second quarter of this year, which meant the plants weren’t producing or selling electricity, and had higher than normal maintenance expenses. Normalizing for these timing related items, our companies are performing well. In fact, they are performing in line or better than we anticipated.
We are reaffirming our core earnings guidance for the year at $3.15 per share to $3.45 per share. And at this point, it looks more likely that we will be toward the higher end of our range. As we explained in the past, the summer is very important for our commodity sensitive businesses. So, we’ll reassess our earnings guidance range next quarter after the summer months are completed.
I want to highlight several developments that should be important to our investors. An important milestone in the second quarter was the California State Franchise Tax Board’s acceptance of the tax positions from last year’s global tax settlement with the IRS.
Jim Scilacci will cover this more thoroughly in his remarks, but earnings, cash and equity are positively affected by this development which helps us more comfortably meet the capital requirements of our infrastructure investment program.
Last month, Southern California Edison installed its one millionth smart meter, a key milestone in our Edison SmartConnect program. By the end of 2012, we will have installed five million smart meters.
We spent years researching technologies, systems and devices to ensure the smart meters would provide a whole range of customer benefits before making our final investment decision.
We look forward to providing all of our customers the valuable features smart meters provide, enabling customers to closely monitor and manage their electricity usage. $1.6 billion program is just one component in our focused strategy to expand and renew essential distribution and transmission grids throughout the Southern California Edison service territory.
On July 19th, Southern California Edison submitted a notice of intent to file the utility’s 2012 to 2014 general rate case application. The notice is essentially a draft of the general rate case application and supporting testimony, expected to be filed in November of this year and enables the Commission staff to review the content in advance.
In the general rate case proceeding, SCE seeks authorization to collect revenues for operations and maintenance expenses as well as capital expenditures, representing approximately 40% of the total revenues it will need to serve its customers. The remaining 60% covers the cost of power plant fuel and purchased power, and is handled in other regulatory proceedings.
The GRC regulatory process will likely conclude in late 2011, with a decision by the California Public Utilities Commission that would be implemented in customer rates January 1, 2012. We have summarized the key elements of the notice of intent and the expected timeline in the appendix through our presentation.
As you know, we have been engaged in an extensive analysis of the environmental retrofit decisions before us at Edison Mission Group. The challenge has been to find a path that meets emissions compliance policies and provides enough flexibility to be commercially successful. We have been evaluating several technologies and approaches while anticipating future regulatory scenarios.
The three objectives that we’ve had in this work are; number one, meet the environmental requirements with the least amount of capital expenditure; two, don’t expend capital for environmental retrofits, unless we’re comfortable that we can recover the cost and have the liquidity to fund the expenditures. Three, ensure our compliance approach is regulatorily and legally durable.
As a reminder, we’ve already installed the activated carbon injection systems on all of our Illinois coal units to achieve significant mercury reductions.
On NOX reduction requirements we have now received all required permits from the Illinois EPA to construct selected non-catalytic reduction equipment and are on track to complete this 158 million program next year.
During this quarter work also continued on the possible use of flue gas desulphurization technology using dry scrubbing with sodium-based sorbents as a method to comply with the SO2 portion of our Illinois combined bulletin standard agreement. Using this approach would also likely involve Midwest generation spending money to upgrade particular removal systems as well.
We haven’t made any final decisions about which specific units may or may not be retrofitted, and we may not finalize those decisions for some time. However, we estimate that if we were to use this method of SO2 removal and we were to retrofit all of our Illinois units then the cost in 2010 dollars would be approximately $1.2 billion.
Some minor portion of these expenditures would start to be incurred late this year for preliminary engineering and permitting. The total expenditure would be spread out through 2018, although we don’t need to make final decisions at this time we do plan to seek some initial construction permits later this year.
We have also compared the emission rates, we agreed with the Illinois EPA in our 2006 agreement with the Clean Air Transport rule that the U.S. EPA recently proposed. Of course, all of this is in the very early stages, but if the EPA preferred option is adopted, we believe it provides adequate allowance allocations based on projected emissions using the emissions rate required under our Illinois agreement. I must repeat this is preliminary work.
EMG has worked on its environmental compliance methodology for some time, and we believe it will provide us with a path forward subject to permit review and approval by the Illinois EPA, our final retrofits decisions on individual units in applicable market and other conditions.
Turning to Homer City, the timing for additional SO2 environmental controls has been uncertain for some time. The EPA Transport Rule may provide clarity if the allowance allocations are reduced for the proposed rule. As these requirements are clarified EMG will assess possible future environmental capital spending projects.
Our renewable program remains part of our long-term strategic focus to diversify EMG’s generation portfolio. We remain focused on developing wind projects to utilize remaining turbine commitments.
We’ve narrowed the development pipeline this quarter from around 4,000 megawatts to around 3,400 megawatts. This is because several projects have moved from the pipeline into construction or into operation. Some others have been determined to no longer be sufficiently probable to count them (inaudible) pipeline and no new potential projects have been added to the pipeline.
There is significant value to be realized in further developing our wind portfolio. To realize that value we will continue to balance the need for capital and our development activity with the need for capital in our environmental compliance program and EMG’s overall liquidity picture.
In the near-term, as we implement our environmental compliance program, we expect to see third-party project level debt and equity financing for our renewables program.
Edison International has as its primary responsibility to provide safe, reliable and affordable electric service to our customers. The better we do that, the more value we create for our shareholders. We think we have significant visible growth in our utility Southern California Edison. Long-term success in this business has always been determined by our ability to serve the public needs in a balanced way.
Currently, public policy desires as well as reliability requirements are driving our growth rate as we are called upon to introduce more technology into the system and add a high level of renewable resources. We will continue to strive to meet those needs, balance with the pace that allows us to successfully and safely execute the work and maintain acceptable, affordable customer rates.
We have challenges at Edison Mission Group. We are working our way through them. We are prepared to commit the effort because from what we see there are some significant opportunities to unlock the equity value from EMG that is not currently reflected in our Edison International stock. Indeed, it looks to us like a strong upside option.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.

Please turn to page two of the presentation. As Ted already said, EIX’s second quarter coal earnings were $0.62 per share compared to $0.78 last year. As you can see on page two SCE’s earnings are up consistent with our annual guidance. EMG’s earnings are down driven by increased planned maintenance activities at our merchant coal fleet. There are significant non-core activities in both the second quarter of this year and last.
Last year we recorded the global tax settlement, as Ted has already mentioned, which included certain assumptions regarding the state tax impacts, this quarter we now have reflected the impact of the global settlement with the Franchise Tax Board, more on this later.
On page three of the presentation, you’ll see that SCE’s core earnings increased by $0.14 per share. There are two principal factors, first, lower income taxes; and second, higher authorized revenues to support rate base growth. The lower income taxes largely reflect a $0.12 per share timing benefit to both earnings and cash from an IRS approved method change for removal cost associated with the SCE’s infrastructure replacement program.
Comparisons with last year’s second quarter are also impacted by the timing of our General Rate Case decision in March of last year. As we saw in the first quarter of 2010 results our operating costs this year are in line with our General Rate Case plan, while last year we were still ramping up our spending following the March 2009 Rate Case decision. We indicated in last year’s call that this was a second quarter timing benefit of $0.06 per share which would not be repeated this year.
Turning to page four, the principal driver of the second quarter core loss of $0.10 per share at EMG is the $0.29 decline in coal fleet results. As Ted mentioned, our coal fleet performance was impacted by substantially completing all scheduled planned maintenance during the second quarter. EMG also shifted four plant overhauls costing approximately $50 million or $0.10 per share from 2009 into 2010. With the significant planned maintenance, as one would expect, operating costs were up and generation revenues were down relative to last year.
During the second quarter, Midwest Gen’s results were also adversely impacted by the loss of the transmission lines that served Powerton Station. The lines were knocked out for three weeks after a tornado destroyed numerous towers. We estimate the lost earnings opportunity from the tornado damage was about $0.02 per share. Also included in the coal fleet results is a net $0.07 per share impact from derivative unrealized gains and losses compared to last year’s second quarter.
Earnings from the renewable portfolio increased $0.02 per share, generation increased 38%, and capacity factors averaged 38.5%. Last year’s capacity factors were impacted by the Suzlon turbines being offline depending on blade remediation. As previously reported, the remediation program was completed in the third quarter of 2009. We also added 100 megawatt High Lonesome project placed in the service in July of 2009.
EMMT’s or trading operation revenues increased $0.03 compared to last year. EMMT continues to focus on congestion and basis trading in our key operating regions. The balance of EMG’s earnings components did as follows; earnings from the natural gas projects fell by $0.01 largely due to last year’s $0.02 per share benefit from the Doga project distribution. This year we received the annual Doga distribution in the first quarter.
Edison Capital core earnings decreased by $0.05 per share as last year’s second quarter included a $0.06 per share gain on the sale of a lease interest in the Midland Cogeneration Venture, and corporate expenses fell by $0.01, largely from lower renewable development costs. As I mentioned earlier, the primary non-core earnings driver was the global tax settlement. Page 5 provides updated information.
In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded the global tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we terminated Edison Capital cross-border leases, receiving cash, and recording a loss on termination of the leases.
In addition, SCE recognized gains from settlement of affirmative claims. Net-net-net, EIX recognized a consolidated loss of $254 million from the settlement in 2009 with a projected cash benefit over time of $400 million.
Since last year, we’ve worked with the California Franchise Tax Board to address the same issues for years, 1986 through 2002. In June, the Franchise Tax Board accepted our tax positions consistent with the Federal global tax settlement. As a result, EIX recorded a $0.43 per share non-core benefit in the second quarter. This includes $0.17 at SCE, $0.18 at EMG and $0.08 at the holding company. We do anticipate a final interest adjustment to occur in the third quarter of this year.
Page 6 summarizes year-to-date results. GAAP earnings were $1.77 per share compared to $0.72 last year. On a core basis, excluding non-core items and discontinued operations, core earnings were $1.44 per share, down $0.14.
Page 7 provides key operating data on the EMG coal fleet. The higher plant maintenance activity is evident with total generation 20% in Midwest Gen and 24% at Homer City. Homer City continues to take B ratings to meet opacity limits. This directly affects it forced outage rates. Midwest generation availability was also impacted by the loss of power while the transmission lines were being repaired from tornado damage.
Turning now to page 8, during the quarter we added 4.4 terawatt hours at Midwest Generation for 2011 and 0.4 terawatt hours in 2012. We added modestly at Homer City, increasing our 2011 forward sale position by 0.2 terawatt hours. We also made some modest coal purchases at Homer City for 2011.
During the quarter in July, we contracted for 3.9 million tons for Midwest Generation for 2011 delivery. We continue to follow our underlying hedging strategy that targets hedging approximately half of our gross margin at risk on a rolling 12 month basis.
On page 9, we have updated our EMG capacity sales to reflect the higher prices in the most recent RPM auction based on the $28 per megawatt day rest of market pricing for Midwest Gen, and the weighted average price of $221 per megawatt day for Homer City.
Last quarter, we explained the financing strategy for our wind turbine commitments. As you can see on page 10, in April, we received the first $92 million in U.S. Treasury grants. In July, we closed an $87 million construction and term loan financing for our Laredo Project, and a $53 million bridge loan supported by the expected recovery of the U.S. Treasury grant for that project.
We have included and updated a summary of EMG’s debt covenants in the appendix to this presentation. On page 11, there’s EMG’s updated capital spending outlook. We have included $156 million for the capital cost for the Midwest Generation’s SO2 compliance program through 2012. These include $8 million this year, $70 million in 2011, and $78 million in 2012.
These costs reflect proceeding with retrofits on early units dictated by the emission rates and equipment requirements as Ted mentioned. But, final decisions have not yet been made and seeking permits does not represent a final decision. SCE’s five-year capital spending and rate base forecast is unchanged as included in the appendix of the presentation.
As Ted already mentioned, our reaffirmed core earnings guidance is shown on page 12. Our reaffirmed earnings guidance reflects EMG’s forward hedge position and power and fuel prices as of June 30th. Other guidance elements are unchanged from the first quarter.
That concludes my comments, and operator, I will turn it back to you for Q&A.

We’re not only meeting all of the environmental requirements, but also continuing to develop our renewables portfolio and make sure that we can meet all of our continuing debt obligations which start to mature in 2013 on out.
So, when we put all of that together and we look at what the probable outcomes are in terms of cash, in terms of margin, we see potential value there and we’ve concluded that there is enough opportunity for potential value there that we’re going to continue to commit the resources and that’s what really what we’re describing today.
We’re trying to give more insights to investors as to the approach we would take. Even though a key part of providing the equity value that we think is there is in the optionality of being able to go different paths and make different decisions over the course of the next several years.
So, we’re trying to provide that information such as the $1.2 billion cost for the SO2 removal systems that we were to put it on all of the Illinois units. We haven’t made a firm decision regarding to put it on all units, but if we were that would be the costs. So, those are the types of things that we see fair amount of optimality, a fair amount of flexibility. We see we can meet all of those obligations as well as continue to develop our renewables platform, hence we see value in the entity.

I think what investors pay us to do is to sort through the business, really look at it in a fairly cold hearted manner, looking for where the best opportunities and the best value is.
The market has presented us a situation, where there is assigning that appears little to no value for EMG, just depending on how you deal with some other parts, some might argue they were assigning a negative value, which can’t compute, how people get to that depending on how others might do to some of the parts, they may see some modest value whatever.
It basically looks to us as though the fair value for the SCE portion pretty much represents all of the current price of EIX stock. That means EMG is sitting there producing today around 20% of our earnings and not receiving any value. So, that’s the starting position.
What do we do from here? As we look at it, we see opportunities with some pretty hard work on the part of the folks at EMG. They come up with methods for meeting all of the environmental requirements that we must and doing it in a capital efficient manner.
We also see continuing opportunities in renewables side. Very importantly, we have to be able to see how we can do all of those things. And they will make sure that it all solves from liquidity standpoint that we can meet our upcoming maturities, which as I said, start pretty much in 2013 on the bonds.
So, when we put all that together and we look at the various scenarios that we see. Of course, a lot of projections in there, you have to figure through, what you think prices or commodities are going to be which has a lot of variability around it, but when we look at that it looks to us like there is a potential for some significant upside optionality and that’s the way we’ve been pursuing it. If we didn’t think that was there, then frankly we wouldn’t be wasting our resources.

Today Edison International reported third quarter earnings of $1.56 per share, up 27%, while core earnings 34% to $1.46 per share. Both of our businesses delivered solid earnings growth in the quarter and have performed well throughout 2010. We also increased our 2010 core earnings guidance this morning to a range of $3.45 to $3.60 per share.
Our focus on our three primary operating principles of superior execution, financial discipline and innovative solutions contributed significantly to this strong performance, and to making important progress on a number of strategic business fronts.
I would like to highlight a few key milestones reached over the last quarter that will create value for our customers, the economies of our communities and our shareholders. A major event for our Company is the upcoming general rate case at Southern California Edison. We are on schedule to file SCE’s 2012 general rate case or GRC as we call it by the end of November.
Consistent with normal practices, we are updating our application from our notice of intent filing to take account of current market conditions and recent developments such as the additional euro bonus depreciation recently signed into law. Jim Scilacci will cover the bonus depreciation subject more in his remarks.
We continue to target a CPSC decision on our GRC late in 2011 to be implemented effective January 1, 2012. Next, we reached a significant permitting milestone on October 4, when the U.S Forest Service issued their final record of decision to allow Southern California Edison’s to hedge the renewable transmission project that reversed miles of National Forest System land.
This is the last key policy decision needed from the federal government to allow the final permits to be issued in the remaining stages of this project to proceed into construction.
Building the remaining sections of this project will require a $1.7 billion investment and will generate over 9000 jobs directly. Additionally, independent developers of renewable energy projects will be investing billions more and creating more jobs to connect thousands of megawatts of renewables to this transmission line.
Our other major SCE construction programs remain on schedule. We have installed over 1.6 million Edison SmartConnect advanced meters and the two replacement steam generators for Unit 3 are now onsite at our San Onofre nuclear plant and ready for installation.
The Unit 2 steam generator replacements were completed earlier this year. This work will add 1,000 temporary jobs to the region during this three month to four month outage.
Two weeks ago, SCE began construction of the state’s largest investor-owned utility photovoltaic power plant in Central California as part of its 250 megawatt solar rooftop program. This $6.7 megawatt ground-mounted project will create about 125 jobs in our service territory. These construction projects have the full support of California regulators and demonstrate both the environmental and economic benefits of constructive regulation.
Let me turn to Edison Mission Group now. In addition to posting good earnings this quarter, EMG made progress on some other important milestones. EMG settled its Mitsubishi Heavy Industries turbine litigation on terms that allow EMG to continue to evolve this wind generation business.
This quarter, EMG placed a new 30 megawatt project in Minnesota called Community Wind North into construction. Also, they recently executed a long-term contract for the 55 megawatt Pinnacle project in West Virginia. This will become EMG’s 30th renewal energy project and will bring their total renewal energy projects to 1,870 megawatts. We also retained a pipeline of 3,700 megawatts.
Of course, EMG’s main challenge is its merchant coal fleet, particular how it manages its environmental retrofit requirements during a prolonged down cycle in commodity markets.
EMG continues to implement the 2006 Illinois environmental compliance agreement for Midwest Generation, which has already yielded significant mercury emissions reductions and will meet stringent limits for NOX and SO2 in the coming years.
Consistent with what we told you in our earnings call last quarter, we have now applied to the Illinois EPA for our first Trona SO2 permit. We continue to believe our four-pronged technology approach for Midwest Generation consisting activated carbon injection for mercury, selective non-catalytic reduction for NOX, dry scrubbing with Trona for SO2 and acid gases and in particular, removal upgrades is an innovative lower cost solution to meeting environmental requirements.
For Homer City, our working assumption is that once the U.S. EPA Transport Rule is finalized, flue gas desulphurization equipment will be required when the rule becomes effective.
EMG and other major competitive power generators in the PJM market face a difficult set of market conditions as hedges roll off and capacity prices decline into 2011 and 2012. We and others are facing the downside of the business cycle coupled with an abundance of domestic natural gas supplies. These conditions will negatively affect EMG earnings until the next recovery begins and demand shifts.
We will continue to work through the coal fleet challenges seeking creative and lower cost solutions and working with system operators to assure grid reliability. One thing we know is that our coal fleet plays an important role in grid reliability in the PJM market.
EMG can generate positive cash flow even during commodity price and earnings down cycles which is why we are prepared to work the EMG issues hard to unlock value from a business that the market gives us no value for today.
Strength of our Southern California Edison electric utility franchise provides the foundation for our current value. We see continued support in California for growth at SCE, including in our core transmission and distribution business, other smart grid investments and preparing for electric vehicle adoption in one of the auto industries’ most important markets. We are proud of and excited by our leading position in many of these important growth areas.
Thank you and I’d now like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.

In my opening remarks I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date financial results, Midwest Generation and Homer City’s operating performance, Edison Mission Group’s wind development program and EIX’s increase",1262,"Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everyone. In my opening remarks I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date financial results, Midwest Generation and Homer City’s operating performance, Edison Mission Group’s wind development program and EIX’s increased 2010 earnings guidance.
I will start with third quarter results on page two of the presentation. Third quarter GAAP and core earning show improvement over the last year. Core earnings are $1.46 per share, $0.37 per share higher than a year ago.
Core earnings improved at both of our businesses in addition to a $0.03 at the holding company cost due to consolidated income tax benefits related to state income tax items. Before I cover core earnings at each of the companies, I’m going to cover two other related tax items for the quarter.
First, we now have completed the global tax settlement for both federal and state tax authorities. This quarter we resolved the determination of an interest associated with the California portion of the tax settlement.
As a result, EIX recorded $0.11 non-core benefit which is comprised of $0.13 benefit at SCE and a $0.02 loss at EMG. An updated summary of the global tax settlement is provided on page 16 of the presentation.
The second item is the expected cash flow benefits from the extension of the 50% bonus depreciation provision for 2010. This is expected to increase SCE’s cash flow between $250 million to $300 million and will defer a portion of the utilities planned financings. SCE’s cash flow benefits will occur largely in 2010.
EME will also see cash flow benefits between $70 million to $100 million. Because of EIS consolidated tax position, monetization of the tax benefits for EME is not expected to occur until 2011.
As many of you are aware, SCE is finalizing its 2012 general rate case application. The utility expects to file its application around Thanksgiving. For our year end 2010 disclosures, we will update the rate base forecast for any differences that are incorporated in the GRC application, including the impact of 2010 bonus depreciation extension, I just discussed.
Now, getting into the details of core earnings improvement of each of these businesses starting with Southern California Edison on page 3. SCE earned $1.21 per on a GAAP basis, and $1.08 per share on a core basis.
SCE’s core earnings reflect higher authorized revenues to support rate base growth and higher allowance for funds used during construction or AFUDC. The increase in AFDDC is both is both our higher put balance and higher capitalization rate compared to last year.
Looking at EMG’s financial results on page four, GAAP earnings were $0.34 per share during the quarter of 2010 compared to $0.19 per share last year. As I previously mentioned, the final determination of interest associated with the California tax settlement this quarter negatively impacted EMG’S results by $0.02 per share, and there is $0.01 related to discontinued operations.
Core earnings for the third quarter are $0.37 per share compared to $0.19 last year. Core earnings benefited from the improved merchant coal performance at Midwest Gen, higher trading income and higher earnings for the EMG’s renewable generation portfolio. Including in the coal fleet results is a $0.04 per share gain from the sale of an EMG bankruptcy claim against Lehman Brothers.
You may recall that in the third quarter of 2008, EMG wrote off $0.05 per share associated with a power sale agreement with Lehman. This write-off was included in core earnings results at the time, so the recovery is also reflected in core earnings.
EMG’s results also have a $0.03 per share adverse swing in unrealized gains and losses relating to hedging activities compared to the last year’s third quarter with a $0.02 per share of losses this year compared to a pending gain last year.
I won’t spend much time on year-to-date earnings on page five. EIX’s core earnings are $2.90 per share or $0.24 above the same period of last year. GAAP earnings are $3.33 per share or $1.39 more than 2009. The results in both years include the impacts recorded in the global tax settlement and other non-core adjustments.
On page six, you can see Midwest Generation’s operating metrics for the quarter and year-to-date and are generally consistent with last year.
Turning to the next page, forced outage rates at Homer City are elevated relative to last year primarily due to opacity related ratings. In September, modifications were made to units 1 and 2 and now have significantly reduced opacity’s B ratings of those units.
Focusing on average realized prices, gross margin fuel emission costs for the quarter Midwest Generation shows a substantial improvement over the last year. This improvement is from a number of factors including higher realized energy prices particularly in the off peak hours relative to 2009 higher capacity revenues, lower fuel emissions costs.
Generation volumes also increased as load factors improved with higher pricing. These items were partially offset by unrealized hedge related losses in 2010 compared to 2009.
Homer City has a higher average realized price but a lower gross margin during the quarter due to primarily higher coal costs. Homer City’s generation volumes remained flat as forced outage rates offset higher load factors.
Page eight in the deck shows EMG’s hedge program status as of September 30. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, EMG made a decision to reduce its 2011 energy hedge position by 2.4 terawatts hours at Midwest Gen and 2.2 terawatt hours at Homer City. This view is that current market prices are close to their lows and we prefer a more open position to capture potential upside. We do not expect any gains or losses from removing these hedges.
On the fuel side, we continue to add to our purchase position including 3.9 million tons at Midwest Gen for 2011 and 400,000 tons at Homer City split evenly between 2011 and 2012. Pages 9 and 10 provide information on EMG’s ongoing wind development program.
Since the second quarter, there are a number of positive developments, including the closing of Laredo Ridge project financing, the beginning of construction of the Community Wind North project in Minnesota, the advancement of the Pinnacle project in West Virginia into preconstruction and the settlement of the wind turbine dispute with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Page 10 is the source of news picture for EMG’s wind investments. After adjusting for the Mitsubishi settlement, incorporating the Community Wind North and Pinnacle projects and year-to-date expenditures on other committed projects, EMG has $511 million of construction expenditures and turbine commitments remaining.
To pay for these expenditures, EMG expects to receive $340 million of treasury grants and $250 million from projects and vendor financings. EMG also continues to explore financing some of its existing projects.
I’ll finish up with some detail on the increased earnings guidance. Our increased guidance reflects an improved earnings outlook at SCE and lower holding company cost based on year-to-date performance.
We continue to include $0.05 per share in SCE’s earnings guidance for energy efficiency earnings. This increase in SCE’s outlook is driven by higher AFUDC earnings and lower net interest cost and taxes.
We have left EMG’s guidance unchanged at $0.62 per share, although we have increased EMMT’s trading income outlook from $60 million to $110 million to $110 million to $130 million.
EMG’s outlook has incorporated a September 30 forward curve. We have lowered EIX holding company from a negative $0.12 to a negative $0.09, consistent with the tax benefits that were recognized in the third quarter.
Thank you and we will move on to Q&A now.

The difficult thing for us to do and plan for is what the actual level of capital expenditures are going to be and then it affects the amount of dividend coming up from the utility to the holding company.
So we have a large line of credit at the holding company to take care of the difference should there be any and we’re anticipating given the growth at utility, we may have to issue some additional short-term debt at the holding company to cover expected shortfalls, but we’ll see. When you see the bonus depreciation come through that offsets what we expect would be a need going forward.
At the Mission side, right now they are virtually I think un-borrowed on their lines. They have some letters of credits that are outstanding but there is not much of the way of need. We’ve got cash sitting there and it’s being applied to cover our construction expenditure for our wind projects and we’ll draw down our cash and then we’ll have to see what the needs are going forward based on our construction activities in 2011 and the environmental costs as they ramp up over time.

So EMG is self contained and the dividend really is based on the earnings power of Southern California Edison.
The other thing that’s important to note and this has been operable for the last couple of years here, given the size of the capital investment program that we have at Southern California Edison with all of the significant rate base growth that we also consider the capital expenditure and the financing requirements associated with that when we set our dividend policy.

When you break it down, we have higher earnings from rate base growth and higher operating revenues that come through the attrition mechanism where our revenue requirement is escalated it’s typical around 4%. So what that equates to is about year-over-year about $0.38, and that money then is used to cover higher O&M and higher depreciation in the combination of those two higher O&M is about $0.23, deprecation is about $0.14.
So when you add all that up its $0.37 and you have higher revenues of about $0.38. So, that nets out to $0.01. When you back out all that, it looked at what’s really driving the change in earnings is two principle issues and there is a lot of puts and takes, but the things that stand out to you are higher AFUDC and then the change in the accounting method for cost of removal that we talked about in the prior quarter. Those are the other two big large items that amount to over $0.20 alone for the two of them and that’s what we are calling now.

Basic approach is that we have taken here, we’ve looked at a number of different alternatives, that’s something we always do. As we have gone through what I would call the strategic options that you have for trying to bring the value forward and have it recognized.
What we have concluded is, given that right now the market is assigning basically no value to these activities, that our best course is to continue to work the issues hard, continue to work them aggressively. I don’t think I’d like to quite characterize it as hunkering down as a huge amount of effort on the part of Ron Litzinger and his team to get a number of things accomplished. We’ve made commitments to improve the environmental footprint of the plants. That takes a lot of skilled work and the folks are doing that. We have to do a lot of things to try to conserve cash as I mentioned in my response to one of the earlier questions. So that activity requires a lot of tough decisions.
But fundamentally, what we believe is, by working this problem we are able to keep the plants in good operating condition. Keep the plants providing their lower cost power and also providing great stability and as we go through that period of time, eventually we will see some recovery in the commodity cycle and that will be eventually recognized by the market.

We focused a lot on the area that really was growing on the generation side of the business which was renewables and the renewable projects provided contract opportunities, they provided stability in cash flows, they had a short development cycle. So you can start getting cash return from those projects quickly and they had good tax incentives associated which also accelerated the return of cash.
So really for some number of years we’ve been looking at reducing the risk of the total competitive generation subsidiary by building out the renewable, providing greater stability to cash flows and also looking for opportunities on the merchant side to stabilize some of the revenues. At this point, the way the markets are set up, there really isn’t much of an opportunity on the contracting side for merchant coals, I wouldn’t expect that that will change or that we would be interested in trying to lock in revenues at these price levels. So I think that part of the business will remain merchant for some period of time.

I’ll take a stab at (inaudible) and CFO of the Utility can fill in. When we give you guidance, we typically use the rate based forecast method that gives you a simplified approach and obviously there’s a whole bunch of other stuff that we don’t get into a lot of details and whereas we are setting the expectations, because we think this simplified approach covers the majority of what you need to have.
Of course, there is a whole bunch of other stuff that can cause earnings to go up or down. It can be AFUDC that we were talking about earlier. We’ve also got in some additional earnings in both 2009 and 2010 from embedded cost of debt, where with these tax benefits that it flows through its pushed off financing and that’s incorporated in our revenues in our embedded cost. So there are some benefits that have flowed through you don’t see it on a year-over-year basis because we had benefits last year that are not transparent to this year but those exist now.
As you get into the third year, the other important thing is that third year of the rate case cycle, because you’re escalating our revenues based on typically a 4% escalation factor, it typically is not fully commensurate with the cost of what you’re doing. So as you get further from the test here, you’re not doing as well but you offset it by AFUDC or embedded cost of the other tax items that flow through. So I think the best thing is the long answer, into the simplified method it’s the easiest way that we could communicate it and then we’ll guide you accordingly once we see it going different.

Today, Edison International reported third quarter earnings of $1.56 per share, up 27%, while core earnings increased 34% to $1.46 per share. Both of our businesses delivered solid earnings growth in the quarter and have performed well throughout 2010. We also increased our 2010 core earnings guidance this morning to a range of $3.45 to $3.60 per share.
Our focus on our three primary operating principles of superior execution, financial discipline and innovative solutions contributed significantly to this strong performance and to making important progress on a number of strategic business fronts. I'd like to highlight a few key milestones reached over the last quarter that will create value for our customers, the economies of our communities and our shareholders.
A major event for our company is the upcoming General Rate Case at Southern California Edison. We are on schedule to file SCE's 2010 General Rate Case, or GRC as we call it, by the end of November. Consistent with normal practices, we are updating our application from our Notice of Intent filing to take account of current market conditions and recent developments, such as the additional year of bonus depreciation recently signed into law. Jim Scilacci will cover the bonus depreciation subject more in his remarks. We continue to target a CPUC decision on our GRC late in 2011 to be implemented effective January 1, 2012. 
Next, we reached a significant permitting milestone on October 4 when the U.S. Forest Service issued their final record of decision to allow Southern California Edison's Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project to traverse 42 miles of National Forest System land. This is the last key policy decision needed from the federal government to allow the final permits to be issued and the remaining stages of this project to proceed into construction.
Building the remaining sections of this project will require a $1.7 billion investment and will generate over 900 jobs directly. Additionally, independent developers of renewable energy projects will be investing billions more and creating more jobs to connect thousands of megawatts of renewables to this transmission lines.
Our other major SCE construction programs remain on schedule. We have installed over 1.6 million Edison SmartConnect advanced meters, and the two replacement steam generators for Unit 3 are now on site at our San Onofre Nuclear Plant and ready for installation. The Unit 2 steam generator replacements were completed earlier this year. This work will add 1,000 temporary jobs to the region during this three- to four-month outage.
Two weeks ago, SCE began construction of the state's largest investor-owned utility photovoltaic power plant in Central California as part of its 250-megawatt Solar Roof Program. This 6.7-megawatt ground mounted project will create about 125 jobs in our service territory. These construction projects have the full support of California regulators and demonstrate both the environmental and the economic benefits of constructive regulation.
Let me turn to Edison Mission Group now. In addition to posting good earnings this quarter, EMG made progress on some other important milestones. EMG settled its Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' turbine litigation on terms that allow EMG to continue to evolve its wind generation business. 
This quarter, EMG placed a new 30-megawatt project in Minnesota called Community Wind North into construction. Also, they recently executed a long-term contract for the 55-megawatt Pinnacle project in West Virginia. This will become EMG's 30th renewable energy project and will bring their total renewable energy projects to 1,870 megawatts. We also retain a pipeline of 3,700 megawatts. 
Of course, EMG's main challenge is its merchant coal fleet, particularly how it manages its environmental retrofit requirements during a prolonged downcycle in commodity markets. EMG continues to implement the 2006 Illinois Environmental Compliance agreement for Midwest Generation, which has already yielded significant mercury emissions reductions and will meet stringent limits for NOx and SO2 in the coming years. Consistent with what we told you in our earnings call last quarter, we have now applied to the Illinois EPA for our first Trona SO2 permit. 
We continue to believe our four-pronged technology approach for Midwest Generation, consisting of activated carbon injection for mercury, selective non-catalytic reduction for NOx, dry scrubbing with Trona for SO2 and acid gases and particulate removal upgrades is an innovative, lower-cost solution to meeting environmental requirements. For Homer City, our working assumption is that once the U.S. EPA transport rule is finalized, flue gas desulfurization equipment will be required when the rule becomes effective.
EMG and other major competitive power generators in the PJM market face a difficult set of market conditions as hedges roll off and capacity prices decline into 2011 and 2012. We and others are facing the downside of the business cycle, coupled with an abundance of domestic natural gas supplies. These conditions will negatively affect EMG earnings until the next recovery begins and demand shifts. 
We will continue to work through the coal fleet challenges, seeking creative and lower-cost solutions and working with system operators to assure grid reliability. One thing we know is that our coal fleet plays an important role in grid reliability in the PJM market. 
EMG can generate positive cash flow even during commodity price and earnings down cycle, which is why we are prepared to work the EMG issues hard to unlock value from a business that the market gives us no value for today. 
The strength of our Southern California Edison electric utility franchise provides the foundation for our current value. We see continued support in California for growth at SCE, including in our core Transmission and Distribution business, other smart grid investments and preparing for electric vehicle adoption in one of the auto industry's most important markets. We are proud of and excited by our leading position in many of these important growth areas. 
Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."
301891,114143312,83494,"Edison International, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In my opening remarks, I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date financial results, Midwest Generation and Homer City's operating performance, Edison Mission Group's wind development program and EIX's increased",1267,"Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In my opening remarks, I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date financial results, Midwest Generation and Homer City's operating performance, Edison Mission Group's wind development program and EIX's increased 2010 earnings guidance. I will start with third quarter results on Page 2 of the presentation.
Third quarter GAAP and core earnings show improvement over last year. Core earnings are $1.46 per share, $0.37 per share higher than a year ago. Core earnings improved at both of our businesses in addition to a $0.03 improvement at the holding company cost due to consolidated income tax benefits related to state income tax items. Before I cover core earnings at each of the companies, I'm going to cover two other related tax items for the quarter. 
First, we now have completed the global tax settlement for both federal and state tax authorities. This quarter, we resolved the determination of the interest associated with the California portion of the tax settlement. As a result, EIX per quarter is an $0.11 non-core benefit, which is comprised of $0.13 benefit at SCE and a $0.02 loss at EMG. An updated summary of the global tax settlement is provided on Page 16 of the presentation.
The second item is the expected cash flow benefits from the extension of the 50% bonus depreciation provision for 2010. This is expected to increase SCE's cash flows between $250 million to $300 million and will defer a portion of the utility's planned financings. SCE's cash flow benefits will occur largely in 2010.
EME will also see cash flow benefits between $70 million to $100 million. Because of EIX consolidated tax position, monetization of the tax benefits for EME is not expected to occur until 2011.
As many of you are aware, SCE is finalizing its 2012 General Rate Case application. The utility expects to file its application around Thanksgiving. For our year end 2010 disclosures, we will update the rate base forecast for any differences that are incorporated in the GRC application, including the impact of the 2010 bonus depreciation extension I just discussed.
Now getting into the details of core earnings improvement for each of these businesses starting with Southern California Edison on Page 3. SCE earned $1.21 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.08 per share on a core basis. SCE's core earnings reflect higher authorized revenue for its support rate to support rate base growth and higher Allowance for Funds Used During Construction or AFUDC. The increase in AFUDC is both our higher CWIP balance and higher capitalization rate compared to last year.
Looking at EMG's financial results on Page 4, GAAP earnings were $0.34 per share during the quarter of 2010 compared to $0.19 per share last year. As I previously mentioned, the final determination of interest associated with the California tax settlement this quarter negatively impacted EMG's results by $0.02 per share, and there is a $0.01 related to discontinued operations.
Core earnings for the third quarter are $0.37 per share compared to $0.19 last year. Core earnings benefited from the improved merchant coal performance at Midwest Gen [Generation], higher trading income and higher earnings for the EMG's renewable generation portfolio.
Included in the coal fleet results is a $0.04 per share gain from the sale of an EMG bankruptcy claim against Lehman Brothers. You may recall that in the third quarter of 2008, EMG wrote off $0.05 per share associated with the power sale agreement with Lehman. This write-off was included in core earnings results at the time, so the recovery is also reflected in core earnings. EMG's results also have a $0.03 per share adverse swing in unrealized gains and losses relating to hedging activities compared to last year's third quarter, with a $0.02 per share losses this year compared to $0.01 gained last year.
I won't spend much time on year-to-date earnings on Page 5. EIX's core earnings are $2.90 per share or $0.24 above the same period last year. GAAP earnings are $3.33 per share or $1.39 more than 2009. The results in both years include the impacts of recording the global tax settlement and other non-core adjustments.
On Page 6, you can see Midwest Generation's operating metrics for the quarter and year-to-date and are generally consistent with last year. 
Turning to the next page. Forced outage rates at Homer City are elevated relative to last year, primarily due to opacity related to ratings. In September, modifications were made to Units 1 and 2 and now have significantly reduced opacity deratings at those units.
Focusing on average realized prices, gross margin, fuel emission costs for the quarter, Midwest Generation show some substantial improvement over last year. This improvement is from a number of factors, including higher realized energy prices, particularly in the off-peak hours, relative to 2009; higher capacity revenues; lower fuel emissions cost. Generation volumes also increased as load factors improved with higher pricing. These items were partially offset by unrealized hedge-related losses in 2010 compared to 2009.
Homer City has a higher average realized price but a lower gross margin during the quarter due to primarily higher coal costs. Homer City's generation volumes remained flat as forced outage rates offset higher load factors.
Page 8 in the deck shows EMG's hedged program status as of September 30. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, EMG made the decision to reduce its 2011 energy hedged position by 2.4 terawatt hours at Midwest Gen and 2.2 terawatt hours at Homer City. This view is that current market prices are close to their lows, and we prefer a most open position to capture potential upside. We do not expect any gains or losses from removing these hedges.
On the fuel side, we continue to add to our purchase position, including 3.9 million tons at Midwest Gen for 2011 and 400,000 tons at Homer City split evenly between 2011 and 2012.
Pages 9 and 10 provide information on EMG's ongoing wind development program. Since the second quarter, there are a number of positive developments during the -- including the closing of Laredo Ridge project financing, the beginning of construction of the Community Wind North project in Minnesota, the advancement of the Pinnacle project in West Virginia into pre-construction and the settlement of the wind turbine dispute with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Page 10 is a source of news picture for EMG's wind investments. After adjusting for the Mitsubishi settlement, incorporating the Community Wind North and Pinnacle projects and year-to-date expenditures on other committed projects, EMG has $511 million of construction expenditures and turbine commitments remaining. To pay for these expenditures, EMG expects to receive $340 million of treasury grants and $250 million from project and vendor financings. EMG also continues to explore financing some of its existing projects.
I'll finish up with some detail on the increased earnings guidance. Our increased guidance reflects an improved earnings outlook at SCE and lower holding company cost based on year-to-date performance. We continue to include $0.05 per share in SCE's earnings guidance for energy efficiency earnings. The increase in SCE's outlook is driven by higher AFUDC earnings and lower net interest costs and taxes. We have left EMG's guidance unchanged at $0.62 per share, although we have increased EMMT's trading income outlook from $60 million to $110 million to $110 million to $130 million.
EMG's outlook has incorporated a September 30th forward curve. We have lowered EIX holding company from a negative $0.12 to a negative $0.09, consistent with the tax benefits that were recognized in the third quarter. 
Thank you, and we'll move on to Q&A now."

The difficult thing for us to do and plan for is what the actual level of capital expenditures are going to be, and that affects the amount of dividends coming out from the utility to the holding company. So we have a large line of credit at the holding company to take care of the difference, should there be any. And we're anticipating given the growth of utility that we may have to issue some additional short-term debt at the holding company that cover expected shortfalls. But we'll see. When you see the bonus depreciation come through, that offsets what we expect would be a need going forward. At the Mission side, right now, they're virtually, I think, unborrowed on their lines. They have some letters of credits that are outstanding, but there's not much in the way of need. We've got cash sitting there, and it's being applied to cover our construction expenditures for our wind projects, and we'll draw down our cash.

So we tie the Edison International dividend to really the cash flow and the earnings of Southern California Edison.

When you break it down, we have higher earnings from rate base growth and higher operating revenues that come through the attrition mechanism where our revenue requirement is escalated. It's typically around 4%. So what that equates to is about year-over-year about $0.38. And that money then is used to cover higher O&M and higher depreciation and the combination of those two. Higher O&M is about $0.23, depreciation is about $0.14. So we add all that up, it's $0.37, and you have higher revenues of about $0.38. So that nets out to $0.01. When you back out all of that and look at what's really driving the change in earnings overall is two principal issues is -- and there's a lot of puts and takes but the things that stand out, Hugh, are higher AFUDC and then the change in the accounting method for cost removal that we've talked about in the prior quarter.

We focused a lot on the area that really was growing in the generation side of the business, which is renewables. And the renewable projects provided contract opportunities. They provided stability and cash flows. They had a short development cycle, so you can start getting cash returned from those projects quickly. And they had good tax incentives associated with them, which also accelerated the return of cash. So really, for some number of years, we've been looking at reducing the risk of the total competitive generation subsidiary by building out the renewables, providing greater stability to cash flows and also looking for opportunities on the merchant side to stabilize some of the revenues. At this point, the way the markets are set up, there really isn't much of an opportunity on the contracting side for merchant coal, so I wouldn't expect that, that would change or that we would be interested in trying to lock in revenues at these levels, at these price levels.

And when we give you guidance, we typically use the rate base forecast method. That gives you a simplified approach. And obviously, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that we don't get into a lot of details and we're setting the expectations because we think the simplified approach covers the majority of what you need to have. Of course, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that can cause earnings to go up or down. It can be AFUDC that we're talking about earlier. We've also gotten some additional earnings in both 2009 and 2010 from embedded cost of debt, where with these tax benefits that have flowed through, it's pushed off financing, and that's incorporated in our revenues in our embedded cost. So there's some benefits that have flowed through there. You don't see it on a year-over-year basis because we had benefits last year that are not transparent to this year, but those exist now. So as you get into the third year, the other important thing is the third year of the rate case cycle because they're escalating our revenues based on typically a 4% escalation factor. It typically is not fully commensurate with the cost of what you're doing. So as you get further from the test year, you're not doing as well. But you offset it by AFUDC or embedded costs or the other tax items that flow through. So I think the best thing is the long answer into the simplified method.

Today, Edison International reported third quarter earnings of $1.56 per share, up 27%, while core earnings increased 34% to $1.46 per share. Both of our businesses delivered solid earnings growth in the quarter and have performed well throughout 2010. We also increased our 2010 core earnings guidance this morning to a range of $3.45 to $3.60 per share.
Our focus on our three primary operating principles of superior execution, financial discipline and innovative solutions contributed significantly to this strong performance and to making important progress on a number of strategic business fronts. I'd like to highlight a few key milestones reached over the last quarter that will create value for our customers, the economies of our communities and our shareholders.
A major event for our company is the upcoming General Rate Case at Southern California Edison. We are on schedule to file SCE's 2010 General Rate Case, or GRC as we call it, by the end of November. Consistent with normal practices, we are updating our application from our Notice of Intent filing to take account of current market conditions and recent developments, such as the additional year of bonus depreciation recently signed into law. Jim Scilacci will cover the bonus depreciation subject more in his remarks. We continue to target a CPUC decision on our GRC late in 2011 to be implemented effective January 1, 2012. 
Next, we reached a significant permitting milestone on October 4 when the U.S. Forest Service issued their final record of decision to allow Southern California Edison's Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project to traverse 42 miles of National Forest System land. This is the last key policy decision needed from the federal government to allow the final permits to be issued and the remaining stages of this project to proceed into construction.
Building the remaining sections of this project will require a $1.7 billion investment and will generate over 900 jobs directly. Additionally, independent developers of renewable energy projects will be investing billions more and creating more jobs to connect thousands of megawatts of renewables to this transmission line.
Our other major SCE construction programs remain on schedule. We have installed over 1.6 million Edison SmartConnect advanced meters, and the two replacement steam generators for Unit 3 are now on site at our San Onofre Nuclear Plant and ready for installation. The Unit 2 steam generator replacements were completed earlier this year. This work will add 1,000 temporary jobs to the region during this three- to four-month outage.
Two weeks ago, SCE began construction of the state's largest investor-owned utility photovoltaic power plant in Central California as part of its 250-megawatt Solar Rooftop Program. This 6.7-megawatt ground mounted project will create about 125 jobs in our service territory. These construction projects have the full support of California regulators and demonstrate both the environmental and the economic benefits of constructive regulation.
Let me turn to Edison Mission Group now. In addition to posting good earnings this quarter, EMG made progress on some other important milestones. EMG settled its Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' turbine litigation on terms that allow EMG to continue to evolve its wind generation business. 
This quarter, EMG placed a new 30-megawatt project in Minnesota called Community Wind North into construction. Also, they recently executed a long-term contract for the 55-megawatt Pinnacle project in West Virginia. This will become EMG's 30th renewable energy project and will bring their total renewable energy projects to 1,870 megawatts. We also retain a pipeline of 3,700 megawatts. 
Of course, EMG's main challenge is its merchant coal fleet, particularly how it manages its environmental retrofit requirements during a prolonged downcycle in commodity markets. EMG continues to implement the 2006 Illinois Environmental Compliance agreement for Midwest Generation, which has already yielded significant mercury emissions reductions and will meet stringent limits for NOx and SO2 in the coming years. Consistent with what we told you in our earnings call last quarter, we have now applied to the Illinois EPA for our first Trona SO2 permit. 
We continue to believe our four-pronged technology approach for Midwest Generation, consisting of activated carbon injection for mercury, selective non-catalytic reduction for NOx, dry scrubbing with Trona for SO2 and acid gases and particulate removal upgrades is an innovative, lower-cost solution to meeting environmental requirements. For Homer City, our working assumption is that once the U.S. EPA transport rule is finalized, flue gas desulfurization equipment will be required when the rule becomes effective.
EMG and other major competitive power generators in the PJM market face a difficult set of market conditions as hedges roll off and capacity prices decline into 2011 and 2012. We and others are facing the downside of the business cycle, coupled with an abundance of domestic natural gas supplies. These conditions will negatively affect EMG earnings until the next recovery begins and demand shifts. 
We will continue to work through the coal fleet challenges, seeking creative and lower-cost solutions and working with system operators to assure grid reliability. One thing we know is that our coal fleet plays an important role in grid reliability in the PJM market. 
EMG can generate positive cash flow even during commodity price and earnings down cycle, which is why we are prepared to work the EMG issues hard to unlock value from a business that the market gives us no value for today. 
The strength of our Southern California Edison electric utility franchise provides the foundation for our current value. We see continued support in California for growth at SCE, including in our core Transmission and Distribution business, other smart grid investments and preparing for electric vehicle adoption in one of the auto industry's most important markets. We are proud of and excited by our leading position in many of these important growth areas. 
Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."
301891,114143312,83512,"Edison International, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In my opening remarks, I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date financial results, Midwest Generation and Homer City's operating performance, Edison Mission Group's wind development program and EIX's increased",1266,"Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In my opening remarks, I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date financial results, Midwest Generation and Homer City's operating performance, Edison Mission Group's wind development program and EIX's increased 2010 earnings guidance. I will start with third quarter results on Page 2 of the presentation.
Third quarter GAAP and core earnings show improvement over last year. Core earnings are $1.46 per share, $0.37 per share higher than a year ago. Core earnings improved at both of our businesses in addition to a $0.03 improvement at the holding company cost due to consolidated income tax benefits related to state income tax items. Before I cover core earnings at each of the companies, I'm going to cover two other related tax items for the quarter. 
First, we now have completed the global tax settlement for both federal and state tax authorities. This quarter, we resolved the determination of the interest associated with the California portion of the tax settlement. As a result, EIX per quarter is an $0.11 non-core benefit, which is comprised of $0.13 benefit at SCE and a $0.02 loss at EMG. An updated summary of the global tax settlement is provided on Page 16 of the presentation.
The second item is the expected cash flow benefits from the extension of the 50% bonus depreciation provision for 2010. This is expected to increase SCE's cash flows between $250 million to $300 million and will defer a portion of the utility's planned financings. SCE's cash flow benefits will occur largely in 2010.
EME will also see cash flow benefits between $70 million to $100 million. Because of EIX consolidated tax position, monetization of the tax benefits for EME is not expected to occur until 2011.
As many of you are aware, SCE is finalizing its 2012 General Rate Case application. The utility expects to file its application around Thanksgiving. For our year end 2010 disclosures, we will update the rate base forecast for any differences that are incorporated in the GRC application, including the impact of the 2010 bonus depreciation extension I just discussed.
Now getting into the details of core earnings improvement for each of these businesses starting with Southern California Edison on Page 3. SCE earned $1.21 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.08 per share on a core basis. SCE's core earnings reflect higher authorized revenue for its support rate to support rate base growth and higher Allowance for Funds Used During Construction or AFUDC. The increase in AFUDC is both our higher CWIP balance and higher capitalization rate compared to last year.
Looking at EMG's financial results on Page 4, GAAP earnings were $0.34 per share during the quarter of 2010 compared to $0.19 per share last year. As I previously mentioned, the final determination of interest associated with the California tax settlement this quarter negatively impacted EMG's results by $0.02 per share, and there is a $0.01 related to discontinued operations.
Core earnings for the third quarter are $0.37 per share compared to $0.19 last year. Core earnings benefited from the improved merchant coal performance at Midwest Gen [Generation], higher trading income and higher earnings for the EMG's renewable generation portfolio.
Included in the coal fleet results is a $0.04 per share gain from the sale of an EMG bankruptcy claim against Lehman Brothers. You may recall that in the third quarter of 2008, EMG wrote off $0.05 per share associated with the power sale agreement with Lehman. This write-off was included in core earnings results at the time, so the recovery is also reflected in core earnings. EMG's results also have a $0.03 per share adverse swing in unrealized gains and losses relating to hedging activities compared to last year's third quarter, with a $0.02 per share losses this year compared to $0.01 gained last year.
I won't spend much time on year-to-date earnings on Page 5. EIX's core earnings are $2.90 per share or $0.24 above the same period last year. GAAP earnings are $3.33 per share or $1.39 more than 2009. The results in both years include the impacts of recording the global tax settlement and other non-core adjustments.
On Page 6, you can see Midwest Generation's operating metrics for the quarter and year-to-date and are generally consistent with last year. 
Turning to the next page. Forced outage rates at Homer City are elevated relative to last year, primarily due to opacity related deratings. In September, modifications were made to Units 1 and 2 and now have significantly reduced opacity deratings at those units.
Focusing on average realized prices, gross margin, fuel emission costs for the quarter, Midwest Generation show some substantial improvement over last year. This improvement is from a number of factors, including higher realized energy prices, particularly in the off-peak hours, relative to 2009; higher capacity revenues; lower fuel emissions cost. Generation volumes also increased as load factors improved with higher pricing. These items were partially offset by unrealized hedge-related losses in 2010 compared to 2009.
Homer City has a higher average realized price but a lower gross margin during the quarter due to primarily higher coal costs. Homer City's generation volumes remained flat as forced outage rates offset higher load factors.
Page 8 in the deck shows EMG's hedged program status as of September 30. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, EMG made the decision to reduce its 2011 energy hedged position by 2.4 terawatt hours at Midwest Gen and 2.2 terawatt hours at Homer City. This view is that current market prices are close to their lows, and we prefer a more open position to capture potential upside. We do not expect any gains or losses from removing these hedges.
On the fuel side, we continue to add to our purchase position, including 3.9 million tons at Midwest Gen for 2011 and 400,000 tons at Homer City split evenly between 2011 and 2012.
Pages 9 and 10 provide information on EMG's ongoing wind development program. Since the second quarter, there are a number of positive developments during the -- including the closing of Laredo Ridge project financing, the beginning of construction of the Community Wind North project in Minnesota, the advancement of the Pinnacle project in West Virginia into pre-construction and the settlement of the wind turbine dispute with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Page 10 is a source of news picture for EMG's wind investments. After adjusting for the Mitsubishi settlement, incorporating the Community Wind North and Pinnacle projects and year-to-date expenditures on other committed projects, EMG has $511 million of construction expenditures and turbine commitments remaining. To pay for these expenditures, EMG expects to receive $340 million of treasury grants and $250 million from project and vendor financings. EMG also continues to explore financing some of its existing projects.
I'll finish up with some detail on the increased earnings guidance. Our increased guidance reflects an improved earnings outlook at SCE and lower holding company cost based on year-to-date performance. We continue to include $0.05 per share in SCE's earnings guidance for energy efficiency earnings. The increase in SCE's outlook is driven by higher AFUDC earnings and lower net interest costs and taxes. We have left EMG's guidance unchanged at $0.62 per share, although we have increased EMMT's trading income outlook from $60 million to $110 million to $110 million to $130 million.
EMG's outlook has incorporated a September 30th forward curve. We have lowered EIX holding company from a negative $0.12 to a negative $0.09, consistent with the tax benefits that were recognized in the third quarter. 
Thank you, and we'll move on to Q&A now."

At the holding company, we issued the $400 million of notes during the quarter, and we used that to repay short-term debt. And then we'll have potential needs depending upon what the actual capital expenditures and cash flow requirements are at the utility. The difficult thing for us to do and plan for is what the actual level of capital expenditures are going to be, and that affects the amount of dividends coming out from the utility to the holding company. So we have a large line of credit at the holding company to take care of the difference, should there be any. And we're anticipating given the growth of utility that we may have to issue some additional short-term debt at the holding company that cover expected shortfalls. But we'll see. When you see the bonus depreciation come through, that offsets what we expect would be a need going forward. At the Mission side, right now, they're virtually, I think, unborrowed on their lines. They have some letters of credits that are outstanding, but there's not much in the way of need. We've got cash sitting there, and it's being applied to cover our construction expenditures for our wind projects, and we'll draw down our cash. And then we'll have to see what the needs are going forward based on our construction activities in 2011 and the environmental costs as they ramp up over time."

So we tie the Edison International dividend to really the cash flow and the earnings of Southern California Edison. We've been targeting historically 45% to 55% payout ratio of the utility, not of the total EIX. So EMG really doesn't provide dividends to the holding company. And as we've said several times here before, we don't expect to put any cash into EMG either. So EMG is self-contained, and the dividend really is based on the earnings power of Southern California Edison. The other thing that's important to note, and this has been operable for the last couple of years here, given the size of the capital investment program that we have at Southern California Edison, with all of the significant rate base growth, that we also consider the capital expenditure and the financing requirements associated with that when we've set our dividend policy."

When you break it down, we have higher earnings from rate base growth and higher operating revenues that come through the attrition mechanism where our revenue requirement is escalated. It's typically around 4%. So what that equates to is about year-over-year about $0.38. And that money then is used to cover higher O&M and higher depreciation and the combination of those two. Higher O&M is about $0.23, depreciation is about $0.14. So we add all that up, it's $0.37, and you have higher revenues of about $0.38. So that nets out to $0.01. When you back out all of that and look at what's really driving the change in earnings overall is two principal issues is -- and there's a lot of puts and takes but the things that stand out, Hugh, are higher AFUDC and then the change in the accounting method for cost removal that we've talked about in the prior quarter.

What we've concluded is given that right now the market is assigning basically no value to these activities, that our best course is to continue to work the issues hard, continue to work them aggressively. I don't think I'd like to quite characterize it as hunkering down. There's a huge amount of effort on the part of Ron Litzinger and his team to get a number of things accomplished. We've made commitments to improve the environmental footprint of the plants. That takes a lot of skilled work, and the folks are doing that. We have to do a lot of things to try to conserve cash, as I mentioned, in my response to one of the earlier questions. And so that activity requires a lot of tough decisions. But fundamentally, what we believe is by working this problem, we are able to keep the plants in good operating condition, keep the plants providing their lower cost of power and also providing grid stability.

We focused a lot on the area that really was growing in the generation side of the business, which is renewables. And the renewable projects provided contract opportunities. They provided stability and cash flows. They had a short development cycle, so you can start getting cash returned from those projects quickly. And they had good tax incentives associated with them, which also accelerated the return of cash. So really, for some number of years, we've been looking at reducing the risk of the total competitive generation subsidiary by building out the renewables, providing greater stability to cash flows and also looking for opportunities on the merchant side to stabilize some of the revenues. At this point, the way the markets are set up, there really isn't much of an opportunity on the contracting side for merchant coal, so I wouldn't expect that, that would change or that we would be interested in trying to lock in revenues at these levels, at these price levels.

And when we give you guidance, we typically use the rate base forecast method. That gives you a simplified approach. And obviously, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that we don't get into a lot of details and we're setting the expectations because we think the simplified approach covers the majority of what you need to have. Of course, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that can cause earnings to go up or down. It can be AFUDC that we're talking about earlier. We've also gotten some additional earnings in both 2009 and 2010 from embedded cost of debt, where with these tax benefits that have flowed through, it's pushed off financing, and that's incorporated in our revenues in our embedded cost. So there's some benefits that have flowed through there. You don't see it on a year-over-year basis because we had benefits last year that are not transparent to this year, but those exist now. So as you get into the third year, the other important thing is the third year of the rate case cycle because they're escalating our revenues based on typically a 4% escalation factor. It typically is not fully commensurate with the cost of what you're doing. So as you get further from the test year, you're not doing as well. But you offset it by AFUDC or embedded costs or the other tax items that flow through. So I think the best thing is the long answer keep to the simplified method.
