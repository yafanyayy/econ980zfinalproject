With me this morning is Greg Frost, our Chief Financial Officer; Gibson Smith, our Co-Chief Investment Officer; and the newly-appointed CEO, Dick Weil, who joins us this morning. He does not start",1082,"Thank you very much. Good morning, thanks for joining us. With me this morning is Greg Frost, our Chief Financial Officer; Gibson Smith, our Co-Chief Investment Officer; and the newly-appointed CEO, Dick Weil, who joins us this morning. He does not start officially until next Monday, February 1, but in a couple of slides from now, I will allow Dick an opportunity to introduce himself and talk a little bit about his background, why he wanted to come to Janus. Dick is not here to take operating questions about the business, but he's very willing to discuss what attracted him to come to Janus to begin with. So with that, let me start on the first slide and we'll go through about 15 slides, and then we will open it up to questions.The first slide is Slide #2 where we cover fourth quarter 2009 and the full year results. Sort of a headline to this, fourth quarter of 2009 reflects continued recovery for Janus Capital, with earnings from continuing operations, earnings per share of $0.20, that's up from $0.05 last quarter and $0.05 a year ago and resulted in a full year earnings per share from continuing operations of negative $4.55, down from $0.86 in 2008. Now recall that in third quarter, our 2009 earnings per share were affected by the $0.10 per share charge, and on the year, we had a $5.03 per share charge driven primarily by first quarter goodwill and intangible impairments. If you step out those one-time events and sort of take a look at the quarterly flows for Janus, we made pretty steady progress throughout the year. The first quarter was $0.02, second quarter was $0.10, third quarter was $0.15 and this quarter, fourth quarter, is $0.20. So we're showing steady continued recovery in Janus. In terms of long-term net flows, we achieved break-even levels in the fourth quarter versus negative $600 million last quarter. And if you look at it on the total year, we're actually up $900 million versus negative $600 million in 2008. And that reflects sort of some cross currents in our three different franchises. The good news is, for Janus, we had $1.5 billion of net inflows, $2.4 billion negative on INTECH and I'll talk about that a bit later, and then $900 million for Perkins. And if you just sort of stand and look at where we ended the year with assets under management of $159.7 billion, that's up 5% versus the previous quarter and up 29% versus the end of last year. And if you look at sort of the dark days in March where we reached our low point in AUM, we're up 66% versus the low point. So I think sort of the theme of continued recovery is pretty evident and what's going on with assets under management.On a complex-wide basis, if you take a look at our performance, on a Lipper basis, we look at the top two quartiles we'd like to on a sustained basis being the top two quartiles, 75%,  88% and 86% on a one-, three- and five-year basis. We're above medium performance across all of the funds that we offer. If you'll turn the page, I have a brief summary here of some of the 2009 key accomplishments. Despite the near-term underperformance for INTECH across all three franchises, we have delivered strong long-term relative investment performance. If you look in terms of market share, in a market that continued to favor fixed income, and that's not the dominant part of our offerings, we were very encouraged that in 2009, our Janus equity and Perkins value funds were able to, in fact, to gain market share. The combination of those two businesses had organic growth of 5% for the year compared to 2% across the equity mutual fund marketplace.And on the bond side, we have some really tremendous news and Gibson will share some of the details of that in a moment. But Janus fixed income posted an organic growth rate of 88% in 2009, more than three times higher than the 25% organic growth in the fixed income industry. So we're really starting to reach our stride on the fixed income side of the business. We also completed the JIF-JAD merger that we talked about. This was a major effort. It's a transaction that increases the availability of our products to a much broader group of intermediary investors, and actually simplifies our product platform. It sort of streamlines our business. And I think, underneath it, it reflects our strong commitment to the advisory channel, which was one of the engines of growth in 2009 and we look forward to continue.We also executed the successful capital restructuring in July. Recall that we strengthened our balance sheet that resulted in total debt being reduced by $316 million, and interest expense on the year, down by $16 million. So we're in a much better place in terms of our balance sheet.We also achieved full year fixed and discretionary cost savings. With the downdraft we went through at the end of 2008, the uncertainty in the marketplace, we committed to take $45 million of expense out of the business throughout inning by 2009, and we have, in fact, achieved that goal. We still remain mindful and are very attentive to sort of managing our cost in the business, given all the uncertainty we face in the marketplace. So we feel good about that.And then finally, in the last call we had, I mentioned that I felt pretty confident that we would have a new CEO to introduce to the Street when we have this call, and here is Dick Weil, here in front of us. We feel very lucky to have him. He brings a wealth of global experience to the role, he's demonstrated, he has the vision the leadership to build a world-class investment management organization. I can say as one of five Board members that were part of the committee, the Search Committee, we saw in excess of 200 candidates. We really went deeply with 30 of them, we got it down to five lead candidates that we liked. Independently, all five members on that committee ranked each of the candidates and all five ranked Dick Weil as our top candidate. We made one offer and we're very happy that he accepted our offer, and he is here to join us. So Dick, if you would like to say a few words, we'd welcome that."

And as I said before, our plan is, Dick will not be fielding questions today specifically about the business, but we did want to take the opportunity to introduce him to you.If you turn to the next slide, Slide #4, it sort of captures what happened in long-term flows with the total company in each of the three franchises. With 2009, we had positive total company long-term net flows, but they were driven by Janus and Perkins. And if you see in the upper left-hand graph, positive $900 million versus negative $600 million a year ago. We continue to make progress and it really points out the benefits of diversification in having Janus, INTECH and Perkins franchises. And Janus and Perkins helped offset some of the outflows in INTECH. We have $1.5 billion increase in long-term net flows year-over-year and that was driven importantly by reduced redemptions at Janus. You see the number there are positive $3.9 billion. The year-over-year improvement was also driven importantly by a contribution from the fixed income side. Of that $3.9 billion, 72% of the net flows came from the fixed income side of the house. In a market where fixed income was really the engine. If you just stand back and look at the total mutual fund marketplace, equities grew by about 2% and fixed income grew by 25%. So the irony is, we had great performance across fixed income and in equities, but it was only on the fixed income side that we really saw the traction and the growth. With an improving market next year, our hope is we'll get a more broadly-distributed growth across all the line.I will also say that 39% of our mutual funds in Janus posted positive net flows. We had Janus Overseas, Balanced, Short-Term bonds, Forty and Flexible Bonds, all had net flows in excess of $1 billion or more for the year, which is just tremendous. Organic growth for Janus was 6% compared to industry organic growth when you blend the bond and the equity side of the business of 8%.For INTECH, year-over-year declines in net flows were driven primarily by decreased gross sales. While we did have outflows in the business, actually the outflows were modestly lower than year ago, while they did pick up a bit at the end of the year, the real issue for INTECH was the lack of flows. And while underperformance is certainly contributing to this, we've seen an institutional market that really presented some strong headwinds. Overall, search activity in the U.S. was down dramatically from 2007 and 2008 and there was very little search activity in large-cap equity.Plan sponsors have been slow to make rebalancing decisions which usually we're the beneficiary of and given the volatility they have experienced and liquidity has continued to be an issue. There hasn't been new money flowing in on the Institutional side, specially in the large-cap equity side. However, internationally, search activity is increasing and INTECH continue to win business, and I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment when we get to Slide 8.For Perkins, as you see down there, there are very steady improvement. By the time we get to 2009, we see $2.6 billion to the good. Net flows were positive for every quarter over the course of the year, it marks the eighth consecutive quarter with positive long-term net flows, so a terrific sustained performance by Perkins. Organic growth was 29% compared to the equity mutual fund market of 2% during the year.So to turn to the next page, I'll sort of decompose a little bit the split of sort of the contribution from the Retail Intermediary channel versus Institutional versus International. And the headline is really that Retail Intermediary posted a $6 billion of positive long-term net flows in 2009. That was really, as you can see in the chart on the left-hand side, significantly reduced redemption rate and a net of $6 billion to the good. That was driven by sort of across-the-board performance. If you look for the year, which this chart shows, the broker-dealers subchannel had $3.3 billion of net flows, and that compares to $2.4 billion a year ago. The investment-only retirement, which is a really important channel to us, we're a leader in that category and these are high-quality, very persistent assets, had $1.3 billion in net flows, and that compares to $500 million a year ago. Financial institutions posted pretty much a break even compared to the $900 million of a year ago. And the story for the quarter was a continuation of strong growth flows really across all channels and we had no significant mandate losses for the quarter. The Retail Intermediary channel just has been an engine for us for the quarter. We had net flows of $2.1 billion, which equate to an annualized organic growth rate of 9%. So we're very happy with the performance in that channel.I would also point out the Supermarket Retail channel, and with our largest contributors being Shwab and Fidelity continues to be an important channel for us. And if you know that channel, you know that one of the secrets to getting good flows out of the Supermarket Retail channel is to have performance that's good enough to warrant your being on their select or guidance list. Last year, at the end of 2008, we had 16 of our funds in the select or guidance list for Schwab and Fidelity. This year, we had 21 funds currently on that list. That's a real good engine of potential growth.The Institutional side of the business, if you look at sort of the middle graph, really tells a story. While redemptions abated a little bit, it's the outflows going from $8.8 billion to $3.7 billion, that really tells a story of a market that's pretty much frozen in uncertainty and continued lack of mandates and lack of searches. If you look at this across-the-board, the Janus Managed business was up slightly, but it's quite small. For INTECH, net flows for the quarter remind us $2 billion as a result of continued underperformance and continued weakness in gross sales. And as a said, I'll talk about that in just a moment.For fixed income, the Institutional side of the business has always been sort of a hope for us, and we finally cracked that. We got our first fixed income mandates. And I think as you know, once somebody's the first one in the pool, more will follow. And we feel pretty encouraged by the level of interest we're getting in the institutional market, in our strategies and capabilities and fixed income. The one not funded pipeline continues to be soft and finals activity is also weak. And we're hoping as we get in out of the doldrums of 2009, the 2010 will pickup a bit.On the International side, if you look on the right-hand side, it shows the net line is zero. Actually, it's just marginally above year ago levels, and it represents the eleventh consecutive year of positive long-term net flows for the channel. The story in the fourth quarter was -- while we have some mandate wins for INTECH. And again, I mentioned before, INTECH is seeing some strength in the non-U.S. part of the business. That strength was more than offset by one redemption that reallocated away from U.S. equity, so that's a real issue. In the non-U.S. market, U.S. equities are just not an attractive investment strategy right now, and net flows for the fourth quarter were off by $100 million. And despite the underperformance from the large-cap growth products, INTECH's global and international products continue to do well, and Janus and Perkins have positive flows while INTECH had net outflows.So if you turn to the Sixth Page, and I'll just talk a little bit about the long-term relative investment performance. The headline in the first bullet says it's 51% of our complex-wide mutual funds had a 4- or 5-star rating. This is down somewhat from the number I shared with you for the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline is not a result of sub-par performance, but rather a function of the way Morningstar calculates a rating and how they factor in the strength of a ten-year performance. In 1999, Janus funds experienced really significant, relative outperformance versus their category. Then when the technology market cracked its performance really waned. And so we're rolling out that really strong 10-year period that year in 1999, and we're picking up a weaker year. And so on a 10-year basis, Morningstar weights the 10-year results 50% of the weight. So we see the decline in fourth quarter. However, recall that it's a forced distribution curve for Morningstar, only 32.5% can get a 4- or 5-star rating, and we have 51% that have a 4- and 5-star rating Morningstar and we feel pretty good about that. For Perkins, you can see that 75%, 100%, 100% on the Lipper basis have one- and three, five-year total returns above median. It was a great year for them. On a one-year basis, so mid-cap value did experience a decline in relative performance. The fund was ranked in the 76 percentile relative to peers as of December 31. As of the year ending December 31, that 76 compares to just the previous quarter, it was in the 19 percentile. So you see a dramatic change in sort of the one-year rating, and that reflects quarter-over-quarter decline that was driven by really significant outperformance of many of the deep-value peers as stocks that underperformed in the first half outperformed in the second half, and those are not names that Perkins would necessarily invest in. And the key is that on a relative basis, the underperformance is over a very short term and Perkins long-term performance remains extremely strong.And then with INTECH, we're not happy about the recent underperformance with INTECH. We continue to believe in the investment process and I'll share with you, I think, it's Slide 8 some of the details. We don't want to minimize what the client's have experienced, the relative underperformance over the intermediate term. It's primary focused in our growth products and it's somewhat been muted by the risk-managed approach, but it's still an unexpected and undesired underperformance. I'll share a little bit about where we are on that on the slides that follow.On Page 7, this takes a look at both the complex-wide and Janus equity mutual funds performance through a Lipper lens. And if you look at the top half, which is complex-wide, it shows you in a one-, three- and five-year basis, we really have stellar longer-term performance. If you look over on the right-hand side, on the five-year basis, 61%, 78%, 81%, 83% and 86% on a Lipper basis have been in top half. So on a sustained basis, it's getting better and better. Even on a one-year basis, in 2009, we had 75%, still above medium performance. If you look down in the bottom half, which really just isolates the Janus equity mutual funds, we tend to have relatively higher tracking here in a way that we pick stocks and assemble portfolios, and that was evident when we hit a downdraft in 2008. If you look at that 41% in the left-hand column on a one-year basis, only 41% were in the top half. You can see the resurgence in how we really came back strong by sticking to our research and investment process, we now have 89% that are in the top half. So a terrific recovery and it's showing in the long-term numbers where we have a five-year, 88%; and on the three-year, we're 94% above medium, so we feel great about that.Let me, if I can, turn to Page 8 and I'll a little bit about sort of the INTECH story. And I think the headline is that INTECH continues to face challenges in the U.S. large-cap equity space. But in fact, there's some cross currents that are sort of encouraging, but it's winning business with the global and international strategies. Obviously, the recent underperformance is disappointing, but I will say, as Bob Garvey said in this call last quarter, it is within the range of expected outcomes and it's not unprecedented. We've been through this before. While 2009 was a year in which INTECH strategies underperformed, longer-term performance has largely been concentrated in large-cap growth strategies, and they represent probably about 40% of the asset base. And we also, as I mentioned, the risk controls we employ had somewhat moderated the underperformance. So we haven't truly blown up a client's portfolio, we've underperformed the benchmark.By any measure, 2009 was a difficult year for INTECH, with search activity largely frozen for most of the year. Inflows were well below year ago levels, though outflows I said were on a par with 2008, but I will say, it's picking up as we go through the end of 2009.We saw an upturn in relative performance at the end of the year in 2009. The fourth quarter broadly most strategies outperformed their benchmark, but I don't want to put that in the bank and say the war is over. We still have work to do, and it's going to be a long-term process. Anyone who's managed money for clients has had the experience of sustained periods of below expectation performance. And for INTECH, sudden and dramatic decline in relative stock price volatility, like we experienced in 2008 and 2009, those are not ideal equity markets for INTECH, for its process to deliver above benchmark performance. The expectation is that's the kind of market where we've kind of expect that we're not going to outperform it. We're not happy with it, and our hope is that in 2010, we will experience a return to more normal relative volatility levels in a more stable environment.If I were to highlight, as you go down this page, a little bit sort of some of the stories behind INTECH, obviously U.S. plan sponsors have been slow to make rebalancing decisions and it's hurting our gross sales domestically. Despite the outflows we had, if we had had the inflows in sort of more normal levels, this would not have been the terrible year on a net flow basis. Large-cap equity search activity has significantly slowed among U.S. plan sponsors. That's obviously in response to the global financial crisis. Sponsors  are slow to make rebalancing decisions. And given the volatility they've experienced over the last two years, it's continued. That market is still a bit frozen. Conversely, as I mentioned before, search activity in the international market's increasing and INTECH's continuing to win business in that space. So examples are it's like our global core which accounted for $2 billion in AUM in the fourth quarter in 2009, it reached it's five-year track record, which is an important milestone in the institutional marketplace. It's outperformed its benchmark by 166 basis points over that period. And then European market, we're getting involved in searches and we're winning searches. The international equity reached its three-year track record in December, and it's outperformed its benchmark by 164 basis points over that period.So during the fourth quarter, INTECH has continued to commit significant resources to clients and consultants. And for consultants, we really have a strong institutional relationship with the consultant community. We're going to continue to be proactive in this effort. I think the team has done a terrific job in telling the story that these are disappointing underperformance, but not unprecedented, not unexpected. And we've been able to be very successful in a number of clients holding on to business and letting them sort of weather the storm with us. The risk management investment process in INTECH has helped mitigate this. And while the underperformance is disappointing, it's not substantial in magnitude.So despite the underperformance, INTECH's firm-wide batting average, if you look kind of month-to-month how INTECH has done beating its benchmark on a gross basis, on a one-, three- and five-year basis and you look at the 10 primary strategies, 71%, 83%, 92% of the months in a one-, three- and five-year period, INTECH has outperformed its benchmark. And those are terrific long-term numbers. And it's the basis in the institutional market for sustaining their business with INTECH and for building on our future. I'd emphasize that we're very confident in INTECH's mathematical investment process. It's well-positioned for the long-term growth despite the disappointing current underperformance in the near term. We've been in this position before. We have turned it around and served our clients quite well, and we have confidence this will continue. So with that I'm going to turn over it over to Gibson Smith and shift the focus more to the Janus brand side of the house and ask him to go through an investment overview. Gibson?"

I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning focusing on the Janus investment team. As leaders of the investment team, my partner and co-CIO, Jonathan Coleman; our Director of Research, Jim Goff; and I are very proud of the accomplishments of this team. It is undoubtedly been one of the most challenging times to be an investor. Navigating the difficult markets, both our equity and fixed income teams have shown an unwavering commitment to our investment process and continued to generate competitive returns for our clients. Our bottom-up, in-depth, primary research is focused on developing independent and differentiated views, which in turn allows us to concentrate our investments in the areas in which we have the greatest amount of conviction. This is what we believed drives strong competitive results over the long term.  In addition, the evolution of our investment process over the years, as well as enhancements to the investor team have also contributed to our success. I like to discuss a few of these with you today.   Now we're on Slide 10. First, we recognize that our strength is our people and that people are the most important ingredient in our process. We've assembled an incredibly strong group of tenured and experienced investors in our fixed income and equity teams. The collective team of equity and fixed income analyst averaged nearly a decade in the industry and more than five years at Janus. Many of our analysts have been at Janus for over 10 years. We also have a very tenured team of portfolio managers with many of our team serving at Janus for over 13 years with extensive industry experience. An additional point around the Janus investment team and I think is important is that all but one of our portfolio managers started at Janus as an analyst and work their way into a portfolio manager role. We believe that this evolutionary process of our portfolio manager strengthens the culture, as well as enforces the importance of our research process.Moving to the enhancements we've made that have strengthened the investment team. First, Barney Wilson, Portfolio Manager of our Global Technology Product was named Assistant Director of Research earlier this year, helping Jim Goff to drive a research effort that's best in class. We launched a junior analyst program two years ago. The investment in this program have come to fruition with three individuals promoted to equity analyst in 2009. We've added seven junior analysts and 17 research associates to help in the research process that many at upper [ph] management firms will be referred to as analysts. In addition to training and development, we recognized that strong investment talent is key to the long-term success. We've made significant investments in our research efforts over the last decade. We've grown the equity and fixed income analyst team to 53 people, representing 38 equity analysts and 15 fixed income analysts. The expansion of the team has facilitated greater breadth and depth of coverage. Today, we cover nearly three times the number of companies we did beginning of the decade. For those who have been able to improve the depth of coverage, digging into the capital structures of the companies we're analyzing, looking at both the debt and equity of the company. To this point, the equity and fixed income teams function within an integrated business model and collaborate within the seven global sector teams. We believe this integrated business model and collaborative process between equity and fixed income markets makes us better investors in this volatile and often correlated markets. We also believe that collaboration between the teams helped us to better navigate the financial crisis.Another major enhancement relates to our increased focus on risk management within both fixed income and equity. Dan Sherman, in the Head of Risk Management role, and Mayur Saigal, in fixed income have made Risk Management an integral component of our process. Portfolio sensitivities and scenario analysis continue to be a key focus, as well as specific attention paid to the downside. We value the role of Risk Management has played in helping with performance and risk-adjusted returns.Ultimately, the investments enhancements we have made have resulted in strong competitive performance. As you can see on the Slide, 89%, 94% and 88% of the Janus equity mutual funds are in the top two quartiles on the one, three and five year total return basis as of December 31, 2009. Over that same period, 25%, 100% and 100% of the Janus fixed income funds are in the top two quartiles on that same one, three and five-year basis over the same period. We remain committed to investing in our research team to ensure that our business is best-positioned for the future.Turning to Slide 11, we highlight the strong long-term performance across our offerings. As you can see, we have numerous funds in the top decile on funds conception [ph] (34:45) basis. Either diversified across small cap growth, international, value, our friends over at Perkins and fixed income. This slide also highlights many of our funds with solid long-term track records versus our Lipper competitive universe. We feel we have delivered for our investors the need to keep working hard and stay focused.When Tom Bailey founded Janus 40 years ago, he built an investment-centric firm that have added value to clients by doing its own in-depth fundamental research. We're very excited to celebrate our 40-year anniversary of Janus this February, as well as the 40 year anniversary of the Janus fund managed by Jonathan Coleman and Dan Riff. I believe that today, Janus has one of the best investment teams in the business. We're all committed to ensuring that the tradition of research excellence started by Tom and carried out by so many over the years continues for at least another 40 years.In closing, speaking for the investment team, we're pleased to have someone of Dick Weil's caliber joining the firm.

416514,84102925,47861,"Janus Capital Group Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Janus Capital Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gibs and good morning. As Tim mentioned, we recorded fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.20 and margins just over 30%. As Tim mentioned, do recall that the third quarter had certain charges for litigation and severance of around $.010 or rough",982,"Thanks, Gibs and good morning. As Tim mentioned, we recorded fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.20 and margins just over 30%. As Tim mentioned, do recall that the third quarter had certain charges for litigation and severance of around $.010 or roughly 14% of revenue in there. So as I kind of think about third quarter of 15 going into fourth quarter earnings of $0.20 and margins in the 26%, 27% range in Q3 going to 30% in Q4.Average assets and revenue up roughly 10% in Q4 compared to the previous quarter. And obviously, up significantly from fourth quarter of 2008. One note on the revenue line, we did see a little spike up in performance piece. Do recall that we have performance fees both on our mutual funds, as well as separate accounts. The mutual funds tends to be a little smoother. That is accrued for and paid monthly, while separate accounts could be a little lumpier. They tend to come in on a quarterly basis or in certain cases, on an annual basis. In this particular quarter, we had one of our large Janus separate accounts reached it's one year anniversary. And we recorded the full year's performance fees in the fourth quarter. So going forward, I would think you would still see a little lumpiness on the performance fee side on the separate accounts. And again, we do have an appendix page that details out the mutual-fund performance fees.On operating expense side, if you strip out the Q3 charges again, expenses were up roughly 6%, again on revenue growth of 10. The higher expenses were largely due to the variable expense side, as well as slightly higher marketing costs, as we start to get out and tell the wonderful performance story that Tim and Gibson have highlighted this morning.Turning to Page 14, the last page for me, like every other Asset Manager out there, the rebounding market certainly provided a lift for us throughout the year. The improving margins and earnings quarter-to-quarter throughout 2009 was really obviously due to higher revenues, as well as Tim mentioned our achievement of our fixed and discretionary cost saves that we put in place while the market was going through it's very volatile period at the end of 2008 and early 2009. As a reminder, the full-year results do include the first quarter goodwill and intangible non-cash impairment charge.Looking ahead in 2010, we do feel that with our performance, with the heli market that we do feel it's important to begin investing in our business again. We will be targeted imprudence with our investments. But we do plan to increase our sales presence both domestically and abroad. We still plan to invest in investment talent, both at the Janus side, as well as Perkins. We want to increase our overall marketing spend. We want to get out until wonderful performance story. And we also, as everybody knows, you cannot lag technology too far. We did not invest hardly at all in technology in 2009, and we do need to get back ahead of the curve there or risk being well behind the curve as we look out to future years.There's a couple of things I also want to point out for 2010 that we know are coming. As an outcome of the market timing situation a number of years ago, we are required to submit a proxy for trustee election every five years. We do expect this to cost between $7 million to $10 million, and it will hit -- the majority that will hit in the first half of 2010.  So do be aware of that. And also, I do want to remind people that when we announced the Perkins acquisition of the incremental 50% in the second quarter of 2008, which we closed on at the end of '08, we did, at that point mentioned that we put in some compensation schemes that really were designed to incentivize the Perkins folks to grow their business and to deliver top performance for their investors. This expense will run through the long-term of incentive line on our P&L. And they were delivered in the form of senior profits interest and given the revenue growth of 2009 and their performance, I would expect to see something in the ballpark of $5 million to $10 million annually over the next say, three to four years and that would be spread evenly across the years. So again, $5 million to $10 million of incremental expense in 2010 for the Perkins senior profits interests.So all in all, all that being said, given where we are, given the momentum we have in 2009 and the  positive operating leverage, we clearly took cost out of the business. We're ready to reinvest back in this business. But given the one-time cost that we talked about on proxy given some incremental cost that Perkins that I've mentioned, we still target long-term margins of 30%, although given the market environment and some of these costs, we may be slightly below that in 2009, but again in a revenue growth mode with higher markets, we should be able to achieve a 30% margin. And lastly, on the balance sheet side, as Tim mentioned, we clearly are in a better place than we were a year ago. We continue to build what we consider to be a much stronger balance sheet. Our cash on hand today is clearly can cover the 2011 and 2012 debt maturities with some leftover and our leverage ratio, which was much higher a year ago is roughly kind of 3.3x debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2009 and trending down as EBITDA continues to grow. So as Tim mentioned, we feel like we're in a good spot here. And we'll continue to focus on our strong balance sheet. With that, I will turn over to Tim to wrap up."

So, I'm on Page 15, which is the last slide we'll cover. And I hope from the speakers this morning, you kind of get clearly the theme and the reality of the recovery of Janus capital's continuing, We have strong fundamentals that position Janus for success [ph] (41:45) going forward. Our long-term relative performance continues to be strong across Janus, INTECH and Perkins. On a three-year basis, 88% of our funds are in the top half. If you look across the landscape in a very difficult market, there are a very few firms that have that kind of powerful, sustained, constant, above par performance. I mentioned before, we continue to be confident in INTECH's mathematical investment process. It's well-positioned for long-term success. It's going through a near-term patch. And our encouragement is we think in 2010, there's a good opportunity as the market improves, so will INTECH. We're very excited to have Dick with us. He brings global perspective, proven leadership. And I think he will be a constant at Janus. He was born and raised in Colorado. He knows Denver. He's happy to be here. He's moving his family here. And we just think this is going to be a good long-term hire. Greg mentioned the strength in balance sheet. It  improves our position. We're going to continue to manage the expenses. We're looking for a long-term sustained financial improvement. And then management -- it plans to invest in the business in order to facilitate long-term growth, but prudently, on a very smart pay sequence basis, remained focus on profitability.So as we enter 2010, we got strong brands. We have consistent long-term performance above the market. We have demonstrated an investment and research skill on a sustained basis. We do have the ability to attract and hold world-class investment talent. One of the terrific things since I've been in this chair for seven months, I've gotten to know the investment team a lot better on a personal basis. And I'm just stunned by the level of quality and sort of the commitment and passion people have for investing here. It's part of the engine. And it's part of what makes Janus wonderful.I think we have upside opportunities for growth. We have capacity on our equity side. The bonds are showing great signs of strength, and I think we have room to grow. Internationally, institutionally, our Retirement business, our Advisory business, we're well-positioned for growth in all of those categories. And we've had above par performance in a very weak equity market. And I think all of us are sort of looking forward to 2010. I would say even when the risk appetite comes back again and people decide to rebuild their portfolios that have been hurt by sort of the downdraft in the market, I think high-relative performance of 88% of our funds on a three-year basis, we're best-positioned to generate high mutual fund organic growth in the future. And I think that just says that we're well-positioned for the potential of the market come backs. We feel very good about the fundamentals and the prospects for Janus going forward. And with that, I will stop and operator, we welcome opening this up to questions."

The one thing I maybe would rear back a little bit is calling it low-hanging fruit, because I just don't think it exists. I do think to the point a precondition for us to sort of penetrate any of those distribution channels is the sort of this gating item where the equity market grew 2% last year. It's just there's still this the hold back and the unwillingness to jump back into the market, and Gibson just described there is still a focus on keeping short-term rates where they are, and I just think our hope is that if you feel -- accept the precondition that maybe the market improves and people willingness to sort of take a little bit more risk, then I think the strong performance we've had in the intermediary market and the advisory market will work for advantage. One of the things that we're looking at is as these distribution platforms consolidate and more power is concentrated in more people. I just think the indicated action is, ""Oh you better deliver consistent performance, because if you don't you're going to just be toast."" And I think, we're rising to that challenge at Janus and, especially at Perkins in the near term here where they have had tremendous growth in that channel.One area I do think where there's opportunity and we got to figure it out is in the Investment-Only channel, 401(k). And in that channel, over 50% of the flows are going into the sort of packaged-embedded device products delivered by the likes of Vanguard and T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, and we're sort of prevented from entering that poker game as sort of an Investment-Only player, and yet the participants really want sort of a quality of sort of a brand like Janus or Perkins or INTECH in their portfolios. And so that's a challenge to us, if we can figure out how to do this, I think we will get two things. One is, we will get flows and two, I think we'll force the big vertically integrated players to open up their platforms to the likes of Janus. So I see that as a real opportunity. And then finally, in the non-U.S. part of the market, I think that's the big opportunity in order for us, especially on the Janus side because INTECH has been very successful there. In order for us on the Janus side to make headway there, we have to have more success on our domestic institutional marketplace.And we're getting cooperation from the portfolio managers to sort of participate in those searches. We are focused on the strategies that make a lot of sense in the institutional market and I think going forward, you're going to see with Dick's help some progress in the institutional market and renewed commitment. So, that's the best answer I would give you."

With me this morning is Greg Frost, our Chief Financial Officer; Gibson Smith, our Co-Chief Investment Officer; and the newly-appointed CEO, Dick Weil, who joins us this morning. He does not start officially until next Monday, February 1, but in a couple of slides from now, I will allow Dick an opportunity to introduce himself and talk a little bit about his background, why he wanted to come to Janus. Dick is not here to take operating questions about the business, but he's very willing to discuss what attracted him to come to Janus to begin with. So with that, let me start on the first slide and we'll go through about 15 slides, and then we will open it up to questions.The first slide is Slide #2 where we cover fourth quarter 2009 and the full year results. Sort of a headline to this, fourth quarter of 2009 reflects continued recovery for Janus Capital, with earnings from continuing operations, earnings per share of $0.20, that's up from $0.05 last quarter and $0.05 a year ago and resulted in a full year earnings per share from continuing operations of negative $4.55, down from $0.86 in 2008. Now recall that in third quarter, our 2009 earnings per share were affected by the $0.10 per share charge, and on the year, we had a $5.03 per share charge driven primarily by first quarter goodwill and intangible impairments. If you step out those one-time events and sort of take a look at the quarterly flows for Janus, we made pretty steady progress throughout the year. The first quarter was $0.02, second quarter was $0.10, third quarter was $0.15 and this quarter, fourth quarter, is $0.20. So we're showing steady continued recovery in Janus. In terms of long-term net flows, we achieved break-even levels in the fourth quarter versus negative $600 million last quarter. And if you look at it on the total year, we're actually up $900 million versus negative $600 million in 2008. And that reflects sort of some cross currents in our three different franchises. The good news is, for Janus, we had $1.5 billion of net inflows, $2.4 billion negative on INTECH and I'll talk about that a bit later, and then $900 million for Perkins. And if you just sort of stand and look at where we ended the year with assets under management of $159.7 billion, that's up 5% versus the previous quarter and up 29% versus the end of last year. And if you look at sort of the dark days in March where we reached our low point in AUM, we're up 66% versus the low point. So I think sort of the theme of continued recovery is pretty evident and what's going on with assets under management.On a complex-wide basis, if you take a look at our performance, on a Lipper basis, we look at the top two quartiles we'd like to on a sustained basis being the top two quartiles, 75%,  88% and 86% on a one-, three- and five-year basis. We're above medium performance across all of the funds that we offer. If you'll turn the page, I have a brief summary here of some of the 2009 key accomplishments. Despite the near-term underperformance for INTECH across all three franchises, we have delivered strong long-term relative investment performance. If you look in terms of market share, in a market that continued to favor fixed income, and that's not the dominant part of our offerings, we were very encouraged that in 2009, our Janus equity and Perkins value funds were able to, in fact, to gain market share. The combination of those two businesses had organic growth of 5% for the year compared to 2% across the equity mutual fund marketplace.And on the bond side, we have some really tremendous news and Gibson will share some of the details of that in a moment. But Janus fixed income posted an organic growth rate of 88% in 2009, more than three times higher than the 25% organic growth in the fixed income industry. So we're really starting to reach our stride on the fixed income side of the business. We also completed the JIF-JAD merger that we talked about. This was a major effort. It's a transaction that increases the availability of our products to a much broader group of intermediary investors, and actually simplifies our product platform. It sort of streamlines our business. And I think, underneath it, it reflects our strong commitment to the advisory channel, which was one of the engines of growth in 2009 and we look forward to continue.We also executed the successful capital restructuring in July. Recall that we strengthened our balance sheet that resulted in total debt being reduced by $316 million, and interest expense on the year, down by $16 million. So we're in a much better place in terms of our balance sheet.We also achieved full year fixed and discretionary cost savings. With the downdraft we went through at the end of 2008, the uncertainty in the marketplace, we committed to take $45 million of expense out of the business throughout inning by 2009, and we have, in fact, achieved that goal. We still remain mindful and are very attentive to sort of managing our cost in the business, given all the uncertainty we face in the marketplace. So we feel good about that.And then finally, in the last call we had, I mentioned that I felt pretty confident that we would have a new CEO to introduce to the Street when we have this call, and here is Dick Weil, here in front of us. We feel very lucky to have him. He brings a wealth of global experience to the role, he's demonstrated, he has the vision the leadership to build a world-class investment management organization. I can say as one of five Board members that were part of the committee, the Search Committee, we saw in excess of 200 candidates. We really went deeply with 30 of them, we got it down to five lead candidates that we liked. Independently, all five members on that committee ranked each of the candidates and all five ranked Dick Weil as our top candidate. We made one offer and we're very happy that he accepted our offer, and he is here to join us. So Dick, if you would like to say a few words, we'd welcome that."

And as I said before, our plan is, Dick will not be fielding questions today specifically about the business, but we did want to take the opportunity to introduce him to you.If you turn to the next slide, Slide #4, it sort of captures what happened in long-term flows with the total company in each of the three franchises. With 2009, we had positive total company long-term net flows, but they were driven by Janus and Perkins. And if you see in the upper left-hand graph, positive $900 million versus negative $600 million a year ago. We continue to make progress and it really points out the benefits of diversification in having Janus, INTECH and Perkins franchises. And Janus and Perkins helped offset some of the outflows in INTECH. We have $1.5 billion increase in long-term net flows year-over-year and that was driven importantly by reduced redemptions at Janus. You see the number there are positive $3.9 billion. The year-over-year improvement was also driven importantly by a contribution from the fixed income side. Of that $3.9 billion, 72% of the net flows came from the fixed income side of the house. In a market where fixed income was really the engine. If you just stand back and look at the total mutual fund marketplace, equities grew by about 2% and fixed income grew by 25%. So the irony is, we had great performance across fixed income and in equities, but it was only on the fixed income side that we really saw the traction and the growth. With an improving market next year, our hope is we'll get a more broadly-distributed growth across all the line.I will also say that 39% of our mutual funds in Janus posted positive net flows. We had Janus Overseas, Balanced, Short-Term bonds, Forty and Flexible Bonds, all had net flows in excess of $1 billion or more for the year, which is just tremendous. Organic growth for Janus was 6% compared to industry organic growth when you blend the bond and the equity side of the business of 8%.For INTECH, year-over-year declines in net flows were driven primarily by decreased gross sales. While we did have outflows in the business, actually the outflows were modestly lower than year ago, while they did pick up a bit at the end of the year, the real issue for INTECH was the lack of flows. And while underperformance is certainly contributing to this, we've seen an institutional market that really presented some strong headwinds. Overall, search activity in the U.S. was down dramatically from 2007 and 2008 and there was very little search activity in large-cap equity.Plan sponsors have been slow to make rebalancing decisions which usually we're the beneficiary of and given the volatility they have experienced and liquidity has continued to be an issue. There hasn't been new money flowing in on the Institutional side, specially in the large-cap equity side. However, internationally, search activity is increasing and INTECH continue to win business, and I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment when we get to Slide 8.For Perkins, as you see down there, there are very steady improvement. By the time we get to 2009, we see $2.6 billion to the good. Net flows were positive for every quarter over the course of the year, it marks the eighth consecutive quarter with positive long-term net flows, so a terrific sustained performance by Perkins. Organic growth was 29% compared to the equity mutual fund market of 2% during the year.So to turn to the next page, I'll sort of decompose a little bit the split of sort of the contribution from the Retail Intermediary channel versus Institutional versus International. And the headline is really that Retail Intermediary posted a $6 billion of positive long-term net flows in 2009. That was really, as you can see in the chart on the left-hand side, significantly reduced redemption rate and a net of $6 billion to the good. That was driven by sort of across-the-board performance. If you look for the year, which this chart shows, the broker-dealers subchannel had $3.3 billion of net flows, and that compares to $2.4 billion a year ago. The investment-only retirement, which is a really important channel to us, we're a leader in that category and these are high-quality, very persistent assets, had $1.3 billion in net flows, and that compares to $500 million a year ago. Financial institutions posted pretty much a break even compared to the $900 million of a year ago. And the story for the quarter was a continuation of strong growth flows really across all channels and we had no significant mandate losses for the quarter. The Retail Intermediary channel just has been an engine for us for the quarter. We had net flows of $2.1 billion, which equate to an annualized organic growth rate of 9%. So we're very happy with the performance in that channel.I would also point out the Supermarket Retail channel, and with our largest contributors being Shwab and Fidelity continues to be an important channel for us. And if you know that channel, you know that one of the secrets to getting good flows out of the Supermarket Retail channel is to have performance that's good enough to warrant your being on their select or guidance list. Last year, at the end of 2008, we had 16 of our funds in the select or guidance list for Schwab and Fidelity. This year, we had 21 funds currently on that list. That's a real good engine of potential growth.The Institutional side of the business, if you look at sort of the middle graph, really tells a story. While redemptions abated a little bit, it's the outflows going from $8.8 billion to $3.7 billion, that really tells a story of a market that's pretty much frozen in uncertainty and continued lack of mandates and lack of searches. If you look at this across-the-board, the Janus Managed business was up slightly, but it's quite small. For INTECH, net flows for the quarter remind us $2 billion as a result of continued underperformance and continued weakness in gross sales. And as a said, I'll talk about that in just a moment.For fixed income, the Institutional side of the business has always been sort of a hope for us, and we finally cracked that. We got our first fixed income mandates. And I think as you know, once somebody's the first one in the pool, more will follow. And we feel pretty encouraged by the level of interest we're getting in the institutional market, in our strategies and capabilities and fixed income. The one not funded pipeline continues to be soft and finals activity is also weak. And we're hoping as we get in out of the doldrums of 2009, the 2010 will pickup a bit.On the International side, if you look on the right-hand side, it shows the net line is zero. Actually, it's just marginally above year ago levels, and it represents the eleventh consecutive year of positive long-term net flows for the channel. The story in the fourth quarter was -- while we have some mandate wins for INTECH. And again, I mentioned before, INTECH is seeing some strength in the non-U.S. part of the business. That strength was more than offset by one redemption that reallocated away from U.S. equity, so that's a real issue. In the non-U.S. market, U.S. equities are just not an attractive investment strategy right now, and net flows for the fourth quarter were off by $100 million. And despite the underperformance from the large-cap growth products, INTECH's global and international products continue to do well, and Janus and Perkins have positive flows while INTECH had net outflows.So if you turn to the Sixth Page, and I'll just talk a little bit about the long-term relative investment performance. The headline in the first bullet says it's 51% of our complex-wide mutual funds had a 4- or 5-star rating. This is down somewhat from the number I shared with you for the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline is not a result of sub-par performance, but rather a function of the way Morningstar calculates a rating and how they factor in the strength of a ten-year performance. In 1999, Janus funds experienced really significant, relative outperformance versus their category. Then when the technology market cracked its performance really waned. And so we're rolling out that really strong 10-year period that year in 1999, and we're picking up a weaker year. And so on a 10-year basis, Morningstar weights the 10-year results 50% of the weight. So we see the decline in fourth quarter. However, recall that it's a forced distribution curve for Morningstar, only 32.5% can get a 4- or 5-star rating, and we have 51% that have a 4- and 5-star rating Morningstar and we feel pretty good about that. For Perkins, you can see that 75%, 100%, 100% on the Lipper basis have one- and three, five-year total returns above median. It was a great year for them. On a one-year basis, so mid-cap value did experience a decline in relative performance. The fund was ranked in the 76 percentile relative to peers as of December 31. As of the year ending December 31, that 76 compares to just the previous quarter, it was in the 19 percentile. So you see a dramatic change in sort of the one-year rating, and that reflects quarter-over-quarter decline that was driven by really significant outperformance of many of the deep-value peers as stocks that underperformed in the first half outperformed in the second half, and those are not names that Perkins would necessarily invest in. And the key is that on a relative basis, the underperformance is over a very short term and Perkins long-term performance remains extremely strong.And then with INTECH, we're not happy about the recent underperformance with INTECH. We continue to believe in the investment process and I'll share with you, I think, it's Slide 8 some of the details. We don't want to minimize what the client's have experienced, the relative underperformance over the intermediate term. It's primary focused in our growth products and it's somewhat been muted by the risk-managed approach, but it's still an unexpected and undesired underperformance. I'll share a little bit about where we are on that on the slides that follow.On Page 7, this takes a look at both the complex-wide and Janus equity mutual funds performance through a Lipper lens. And if you look at the top half, which is complex-wide, it shows you in a one-, three- and five-year basis, we really have stellar longer-term performance. If you look over on the right-hand side, on the five-year basis, 61%, 78%, 81%, 83% and 86% on a Lipper basis have been in top half. So on a sustained basis, it's getting better and better. Even on a one-year basis, in 2009, we had 75%, still above medium performance. If you look down in the bottom half, which really just isolates the Janus equity mutual funds, we tend to have relatively higher tracking here in a way that we pick stocks and assemble portfolios, and that was evident when we hit a downdraft in 2008. If you look at that 41% in the left-hand column on a one-year basis, only 41% were in the top half. You can see the resurgence in how we really came back strong by sticking to our research and investment process, we now have 89% that are in the top half. So a terrific recovery and it's showing in the long-term numbers where we have a five-year, 88%; and on the three-year, we're 94% above medium, so we feel great about that.Let me, if I can, turn to Page 8 and I'll a little bit about sort of the INTECH story. And I think the headline is that INTECH continues to face challenges in the U.S. large-cap equity space. But in fact, there's some cross currents that are sort of encouraging, but it's winning business with the global and international strategies. Obviously, the recent underperformance is disappointing, but I will say, as Bob Garvey said in this call last quarter, it is within the range of expected outcomes and it's not unprecedented. We've been through this before. While 2009 was a year in which INTECH strategies underperformed, longer-term performance has largely been concentrated in large-cap growth strategies, and they represent probably about 40% of the asset base. And we also, as I mentioned, the risk controls we employ had somewhat moderated the underperformance. So we haven't truly blown up a client's portfolio, we've underperformed the benchmark.By any measure, 2009 was a difficult year for INTECH, with search activity largely frozen for most of the year. Inflows were well below year ago levels, though outflows I said were on a par with 2008, but I will say, it's picking up as we go through the end of 2009.We saw an upturn in relative performance at the end of the year in 2009. The fourth quarter broadly most strategies outperformed their benchmark, but I don't want to put that in the bank and say the war is over. We still have work to do, and it's going to be a long-term process. Anyone who's managed money for clients has had the experience of sustained periods of below expectation performance. And for INTECH, sudden and dramatic decline in relative stock price volatility, like we experienced in 2008 and 2009, those are not ideal equity markets for INTECH, for its process to deliver above benchmark performance. The expectation is that's the kind of market where we've kind of expect that we're not going to outperform it. We're not happy with it, and our hope is that in 2010, we will experience a return to more normal relative volatility levels in a more stable environment.If I were to highlight, as you go down this page, a little bit sort of some of the stories behind INTECH, obviously U.S. plan sponsors have been slow to make rebalancing decisions and it's hurting our gross sales domestically. Despite the outflows we had, if we had had the inflows in sort of more normal levels, this would not have been the terrible year on a net flow basis. Large-cap equity search activity has significantly slowed among U.S. plan sponsors. That's obviously in response to the global financial crisis. Sponsors  are slow to make rebalancing decisions. And given the volatility they've experienced over the last two years, it's continued. That market is still a bit frozen. Conversely, as I mentioned before, search activity in the international market's increasing and INTECH's continuing to win business in that space. So examples are it's like our global core which accounted for $2 billion in AUM in the fourth quarter in 2009, it reached it's five-year track record, which is an important milestone in the institutional marketplace. It's outperformed its benchmark by 166 basis points over that period. And then European market, we're getting involved in searches and we're winning searches. The international equity reached its three-year track record in December, and it's outperformed its benchmark by 164 basis points over that period.So during the fourth quarter, INTECH has continued to commit significant resources to clients and consultants. And for consultants, we really have a strong institutional relationship with the consultant community. We're going to continue to be proactive in this effort. I think the team has done a terrific job in telling the story that these are disappointing underperformance, but not unprecedented, not unexpected. And we've been able to be very successful in a number of clients holding on to business and letting them sort of weather the storm with us. The risk management investment process in INTECH has helped mitigate this. And while the underperformance is disappointing, it's not substantial in magnitude.So despite the underperformance, INTECH's firm-wide batting average, if you look kind of month-to-month how INTECH has done beating its benchmark on a gross basis, on a one-, three- and five-year basis and you look at the 10 primary strategies, 71%, 83%, 92% of the months in a one-, three- and five-year period, INTECH has outperformed its benchmark. And those are terrific long-term numbers. And it's the basis in the institutional market for sustaining their business with INTECH and for building on our future. I'd emphasize that we're very confident in INTECH's mathematical investment process. It's well-positioned for the long-term growth despite the disappointing current underperformance in the near term. We've been in this position before. We have turned it around and served our clients quite well, and we have confidence this will continue. So with that I'm going to turn over it over to Gibson Smith and shift the focus more to the Janus brand side of the house and ask him to go through an investment overview. Gibson?"

I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning focusing on the Janus investment team. As leaders of the investment team, my partner and co-CIO, Jonathan Coleman; our Director of Research, Jim Goff; and I are very proud of the accomplishments of",1031,"Thanks, Tim. I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning focusing on the Janus investment team. As leaders of the investment team, my partner and co-CIO, Jonathan Coleman; our Director of Research, Jim Goff; and I are very proud of the accomplishments of this team. It is undoubtedly been one of the most challenging times to be an investor. Navigating the difficult markets, both our equity and fixed income teams have shown an unwavering commitment to our investment process and continued to generate competitive returns for our clients. Our bottom-up, in-depth, primary research is focused on developing independent and differentiated views, which in turn allows us to concentrate our investments in the areas in which we have the greatest amount of conviction. This is what we believed drives strong competitive results over the long term.  In addition, the evolution of our investment process over the years, as well as enhancements to the investor team have also contributed to our success. I like to discuss a few of these with you today.   Now we're on Slide 10. First, we recognize that our strength is our people and that people are the most important ingredient in our process. We've assembled an incredibly strong group of tenured and experienced investors in our fixed income and equity teams. The collective team of equity and fixed income analyst averaged nearly a decade in the industry and more than five years at Janus. Many of our analysts have been at Janus for over 10 years. We also have a very tenured team of portfolio managers with many of our team serving at Janus for over 13 years with extensive industry experience. An additional point around the Janus investment team and I think is important is that all but one of our portfolio managers started at Janus as an analyst and work their way into a portfolio manager role. We believe that this evolutionary process of our portfolio manager strengthens the culture, as well as enforces the importance of our research process.Moving to the enhancements we've made that have strengthened the investment team. First, Barney Wilson, Portfolio Manager of our Global Technology Product was named Assistant Director of Research earlier this year, helping Jim Goff to drive a research effort that's best in class. We launched a junior analyst program two years ago. The investment in this program have come to fruition with three individuals promoted to equity analyst in 2009. We've added seven junior analysts and 17 research associates to help in the research process that many at upper [ph] management firms will be referred to as analysts. In addition to training and development, we recognized that strong investment talent is key to the long-term success. We've made significant investments in our research efforts over the last decade. We've grown the equity and fixed income analyst team to 53 people, representing 38 equity analysts and 15 fixed income analysts. The expansion of the team has facilitated greater breadth and depth of coverage. Today, we cover nearly three times the number of companies we did beginning of the decade. For those who have been able to improve the depth of coverage, digging into the capital structures of the companies we're analyzing, looking at both the debt and equity of the company. To this point, the equity and fixed income teams function within an integrated business model and collaborate within the seven global sector teams. We believe this integrated business model and collaborative process between equity and fixed income markets makes us better investors in this volatile and often correlated markets. We also believe that collaboration between the teams helped us to better navigate the financial crisis.Another major enhancement relates to our increased focus on risk management within both fixed income and equity. Dan Sherman, in the Head of Risk Management role, and Mayur Saigal, in fixed income have made Risk Management an integral component of our process. Portfolio sensitivities and scenario analysis continue to be a key focus, as well as specific attention paid to the downside. We value the role of Risk Management has played in helping with performance and risk-adjusted returns.Ultimately, the investments enhancements we have made have resulted in strong competitive performance. As you can see on the Slide, 89%, 94% and 88% of the Janus equity mutual funds are in the top two quartiles on the one, three and five year total return basis as of December 31, 2009. Over that same period, 25%, 100% and 100% of the Janus fixed income funds are in the top two quartiles on that same one, three and five-year basis over the same period. We remain committed to investing in our research team to ensure that our business is best-positioned for the future.Turning to Slide 11, we highlight the strong long-term performance across our offerings. As you can see, we have numerous funds in the top decile on funds conception [ph] (34:45) basis. Either diversified across small cap growth, international, value, our friends over at Perkins and fixed income. This slide also highlights many of our funds with solid long-term track records versus our Lipper competitive universe. We feel we have delivered for our investors the need to keep working hard and stay focused.When Tom Bailey founded Janus 40 years ago, he built an investment-centric firm that have added value to clients by doing its own in-depth fundamental research. We're very excited to celebrate our 40-year anniversary of Janus this February, as well as the 40 year anniversary of the Janus fund managed by Jonathan Coleman and Dan Riff. I believe that today, Janus has one of the best investment teams in the business. We're all committed to ensuring that the tradition of research excellence started by Tom and carried out by so many over the years continues for at least another 40 years.In closing, speaking for the investment team, we're pleased to have someone of Dick Weil's caliber joining the firm. He comes from what is undoubtedly one the world's most successful investment organizations. We look forward to working with Dick and leveraging his experience and capitalizing on our strength. I want to turn it over to Greg Frost to cover the financial for us."

As Tim mentioned, we recorded fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.20 and margins just over 30%. As Tim mentioned, do recall that the third quarter had certain charges for litigation and severance of around $.010 or roughly 14% of revenue in there. So as I kind of think about third quarter of 15 going into fourth quarter earnings of $0.20 and margins in the 26%, 27% range in Q3 going to 30% in Q4.Average assets and revenue up roughly 10% in Q4 compared to the previous quarter. And obviously, up significantly from fourth quarter of 2008. One note on the revenue line, we did see a little spike up in performance piece. Do recall that we have performance fees both on our mutual funds, as well as separate accounts. The mutual funds tends to be a little smoother. That is accrued for and paid monthly, while separate accounts could be a little lumpier. They tend to come in on a quarterly basis or in certain cases, on an annual basis. In this particular quarter, we had one of our large Janus separate accounts reached it's one year anniversary. And we recorded the full year's performance fees in the fourth quarter. So going forward, I would think you would still see a little lumpiness on the performance fee side on the separate accounts. And again, we do have an appendix page that details out the mutual-fund performance fees.On operating expense side, if you strip out the Q3 charges again, expenses were up roughly 6%, again on revenue growth of 10. The higher expenses were largely due to the variable expense side, as well as slightly higher marketing costs, as we start to get out and tell the wonderful performance story that Tim and Gibson have highlighted this morning.Turning to Page 14, the last page for me, like every other Asset Manager out there, the rebounding market certainly provided a lift for us throughout the year. The improving margins and earnings quarter-to-quarter throughout 2009 was really obviously due to higher revenues, as well as Tim mentioned our achievement of our fixed and discretionary cost saves that we put in place while the market was going through it's very volatile period at the end of 2008 and early 2009. As a reminder, the full-year results do include the first quarter goodwill and intangible non-cash impairment charge.Looking ahead in 2010, we do feel that with our performance, with the heli market that we do feel it's important to begin investing in our business again. We will be targeted imprudence with our investments. But we do plan to increase our sales presence both domestically and abroad. We still plan to invest in investment talent, both at the Janus side, as well as Perkins. We want to increase our overall marketing spend. We want to get out until wonderful performance story. And we also, as everybody knows, you cannot lag technology too far. We did not invest hardly at all in technology in 2009, and we do need to get back ahead of the curve there or risk being well behind the curve as we look out to future years.There's a couple of things I also want to point out for 2010 that we know are coming. As an outcome of the market timing situation a number of years ago, we are required to submit a proxy for trustee election every five years. We do expect this to cost between $7 million to $10 million, and it will hit -- the majority that will hit in the first half of 2010.  So do be aware of that. And also, I do want to remind people that when we announced the Perkins acquisition of the incremental 50% in the second quarter of 2008, which we closed on at the end of '08, we did, at that point mentioned that we put in some compensation schemes that really were designed to incentivize the Perkins folks to grow their business and to deliver top performance for their investors. This expense will run through the long-term of incentive line on our P&L. And they were delivered in the form of senior profits interest and given the revenue growth of 2009 and their performance, I would expect to see something in the ballpark of $5 million to $10 million annually over the next say, three to four years and that would be spread evenly across the years. So again, $5 million to $10 million of incremental expense in 2010 for the Perkins senior profits interests.So all in all, all that being said, given where we are, given the momentum we have in 2009 and the  positive operating leverage, we clearly took cost out of the business. We're ready to reinvest back in this business. But given the one-time cost that we talked about on proxy given some incremental cost that Perkins that I've mentioned, we still target long-term margins of 30%, although given the market environment and some of these costs, we may be slightly below that in 2009, but again in a revenue growth mode with higher markets, we should be able to achieve a 30% margin. And lastly, on the balance sheet side, as Tim mentioned, we clearly are in a better place than we were a year ago. We continue to build what we consider to be a much stronger balance sheet. Our cash on hand today is clearly can cover the 2011 and 2012 debt maturities with some leftover and our leverage ratio, which was much higher a year ago is roughly kind of 3.3x debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2009 and trending down as EBITDA continues to grow. So as Tim mentioned, we feel like we're in a good spot here. And we'll continue to focus on our strong balance sheet. With that, I will turn over to Tim to wrap up."

And I hope from the speakers this morning, you kind of get clearly the theme and the reality of the recovery of Janus capital's continuing, We have strong fundamentals that position Janus for success [ph] (41:45) going forward. Our long-term relative performance continues to be strong across Janus, INTECH and Perkins. On a three-year basis, 88% of our funds are in the top half. If you look across the landscape in a very difficult market, there are a very few firms that have that kind of powerful, sustained, constant, above par performance. I mentioned before, we continue to be confident in INTECH's mathematical investment process. It's well-positioned for long-term success. It's going through a near-term patch. And our encouragement is we think in 2010, there's a good opportunity as the market improves, so will INTECH. We're very excited to have Dick with us. He brings global perspective, proven leadership. And I think he will be a constant at Janus. He was born and raised in Colorado. He knows Denver. He's happy to be here. He's moving his family here. And we just think this is going to be a good long-term hire. Greg mentioned the strength in balance sheet. It  improves our position. We're going to continue to manage the expenses. We're looking for a long-term sustained financial improvement. And then management -- it plans to invest in the business in order to facilitate long-term growth, but prudently, on a very smart pay sequence basis, remained focus on profitability.So as we enter 2010, we got strong brands. We have consistent long-term performance above the market. We have demonstrated an investment and research skill on a sustained basis. We do have the ability to attract and hold world-class investment talent. One of the terrific things since I've been in this chair for seven months, I've gotten to know the investment team a lot better on a personal basis. And I'm just stunned by the level of quality and sort of the commitment and passion people have for investing here. It's part of the engine. And it's part of what makes Janus wonderful.I think we have upside opportunities for growth. We have capacity on our equity side. The bonds are showing great signs of strength, and I think we have room to grow. Internationally, institutionally, our Retirement business, our Advisory business, we're well-positioned for growth in all of those categories. And we've had above par performance in a very weak equity market. And I think all of us are sort of looking forward to 2010. I would say even when the risk appetite comes back again and people decide to rebuild their portfolios that have been hurt by sort of the downdraft in the market, I think high-relative performance of 88% of our funds on a three-year basis, we're best-positioned to generate high mutual fund organic growth in the future. And I think that just says that we're well-positioned for the potential of the market come backs. We feel very good about the fundamentals and the prospects for Janus going forward. And with that, I will stop and operator, we welcome opening this up to questions."

And our plan is sort of a conservative plan looking for a sustained level of outflows because these things don't turn around quickly, but we see evidence that we're planning on a higher level of inflows than we had last year. And I think that's realistic. We're seeing it in the marketplace. And as I mentioned before, that's strongly driven by what we see in the international markets where search activity is increasing and INTECH is continuing to build and win business in that space."

The one thing I maybe would rear back a little bit is calling it low-hanging fruit, because I just don't think it exists. I do think to the point a precondition for us to sort of penetrate any of those distribution channels is the sort of this gating item where the equity market grew 2% last year. It's just there's still this the hold back and the unwillingness to jump back into the market, and Gibson just described there is still a focus on keeping short-term rates where they are, and I just think our hope is that if you feel -- accept the precondition that maybe the market improves and people willingness to sort of take a little bit more risk, then I think the strong performance we've had in the intermediary market and the advisory market will work for advantage. One of the things that we're looking at is as these distribution platforms consolidate and more power is concentrated in more people. I just think the indicated action is, ""Oh you better deliver consistent performance, because if you don't you're going to just be toast."" And I think, we're rising to that challenge at Janus and, especially at Perkins in the near term here where they have had tremendous growth in that channel.One area I do think where there's opportunity and we got to figure it out is in the Investment-Only channel, 401(k). And in that channel, over 50% of the flows are going into the sort of packaged-embedded device products delivered by the likes of Vanguard and T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, and we're sort of prevented from entering that poker game as sort of an Investment-Only player, and yet the participants really want sort of a quality of sort of a brand like Janus or Perkins or INTECH in their portfolios. And so that's a challenge to us, if we can figure out how to do this, I think we will get two things. One is, we will get flows and two, I think we'll force the big vertically integrated players to open up their platforms to the likes of Janus. So I see that as a real opportunity. And then finally, in the non-U.S. part of the market, I think that's the big opportunity in order for us, especially on the Janus side because INTECH has been very successful there. In order for us on the Janus side to make headway there, we have to have more success on our domestic institutional marketplace.And we're getting cooperation from the portfolio managers to sort of participate in those searches. We are focused on the strategies that make a lot of sense in the institutional market and I think going forward, you're going to see with Dick's help some progress in the institutional market and renewed commitment. So, that's the best answer I would give you."

Welcome to the Janus Capital Group first quarter 2010 Earnings Call. As the operator said, I am Rick Weil, CEO of Janus Capital Group; and I have with me Greg Frost, our CFO for this call. 
Our agenda today will be to follow the quarterly earnings presentation book that you all have. I will first provide a summary of earnings investment performance inflows. I will drill down a bit into some of those elements, and then Greg Frost will present our financial results in some more detail; and finally I will cover a bit about our vision and priorities. Last we will take some questions.
Okay, quarter one 2010 EPS was $0.17 a share versus $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2009. As I said Greg will cover the financial results in more detail in a minute. First quarter net flows for the company were a negative $1.9 billion. $4.3 billion of net outflows at INTECH more than offset positive $1.4 billion for Janus, and positive $1 billion for Perkins. Overall AUM at March 31 was up to $165.5 billion, a 4% increase over December 31, 2009. 
Long-term performance remains strong across out mutual fund complex, with 84% of our funds in the top two lipper quartiles on a three and a five year basis as of March 31. Additionally, we were very pleased to win Lipper 9 awards for best funds based on risk-adjusted returns. 49% of our funds have a four or five overall morning star rating at March 31, 2010. 
Flipping to page 3 of the book. In the lower left corner you can see the flows for INTECH. I would like you to focus a moment on INTECH. INTECH suffered $4.8 billion of gross outflows in Q1; consistent with the $4.6 billion of gross outflows last quarter. Outflows are very hard to predict. INTECH has been successful at building large relationships, which means individual decisions can drive large blocks of assets. 
Outflows are very importantly affected by investment performance to state the obvious, and there is a lagged basis for that, and they are also subject to broader industry flows. Relevant to continuing rate of outflows we note, and now I am listing from a bullet on page four, that short term performance at INTECH has been improving with 75% of their strategies, which is actually 96% of their assets on an asset waited basis. Outperforming respective bench marks for the six months ended March 31; that’s clearly a good start, but just as clearly consistent out performance in future quarters is needed to address this situation. 
Gross inflows were $500 million in the first quarter for INTECH. This was down from prior periods. While we do not give guidance on flows, I can tell you that funded gross inflows at INTECH in April are already materially higher than the $500 million of gross inflows in the first quarter. Through the recent crisis, INTECH, as well as many other mathematical or quantitative managers, have faced particularly challenging, disrupted and chaotic market conditions. 
I believe the current stabilizing market condition should offer better opportunities for INTECH’s process, to generate historic levels of return going forward. But it is very clear that INTECH’s future depends on continuing positive investment performance to drive an improved picture in close. 
Turning away from INTECH, on page three of the presentation we also detail flows of Janus and Perkins. The market was definitely more favorable for fixed income and value equities, and was a tougher environment for growth equities in terms of flows. At Janus we had net flows $1.4 billion which were consistent with prior quarters. This represents an approximately 6% annual gross rate. 
Fixed income contributed approximately two-thirds of this flow. Janus growth strategies which are about 25% of our Janus AUM experience 2% annualized organic growth in the quarter, compared to what we believe was about a minus 2% for the overall industry. Furthermore, I think the Russell value index is outperforming the Russell growth index by more than 500 basis points year-to-date at March 31, which creates a though environment for growth strategies in the first quarter. 
In spite of these headwins, Janus is gaining market share and seeing increasing opportunities. We saw a 26% organic growth rate in the broker dealer channel and good growth in retail intermediary overall; about $2 billion on the quarter on the base of end of period assets of $110 billion. 
At Perkins exceptional long-term performance drove net inflows of $1 billion. This level of inflows represents very strong organic growth rate of over 25%. Perkins has just announced though that they are closing the small cap value fund to new investors as of May 25. 
On pages four and five of our book, we present some more detailed information about investment performance at each of our brands. I will just quickly highlight that 81%, 88% and 86% of Janus equity mutual funds are in the top two lipper quartiles, on a one, three and five year basis at March 31. At INTECH those same numbers are 0%, 42% and 56%, outperforming their relative benchmarks over one, three and five years at March 31. 
As noted earlier, 75% of the strategies, which is about 96% of the assets on asset rated basis have outperformed over the most recent six months ended March 31. At Perkins, the same numbers are 50%, 100% and 100%of their mutual funds are in the top two lipper quartiles in a one, three, five year basis at March 31. 
At this point, I will ask Greg Frost to give you some more information about our financial results.

I’m on page seven of the presentation. As Rick mentioned, EPS in the first quarter was $0.17 compared to $0.20 in Q4, and obviously a significant loss a year ago, driven by the goodwill charge that we recorded in much different market conditions than we are experiencing today. 
The quarter was marked by higher average assets, yet revenues were slightly lower and expenses were up slightly, which caused margins to decline by roughly 300 basis points; and let me provide a little more color on this point. The driver of revenue was frankly lower performance fees. I recall that last quarter we discussed a large Janus separate account, for which we recorded a full years worth of performance fees in the fourth quarter, totaling roughly $5 million. If you factor this into the current quarter, revenue looks a lot more in-line with the increase in average assets. 
On the expense side, the 3% increase from the fourth quarter can largely be explained by higher variable expenses, which we would expect to a slightly higher revenue; again, adjusting for the performance fees, and the effect of the Perkins compensation plans on our long term incentive line that we talked about last quarter. 
Digging a little deeper into expenses; on the comp side historically we have seen spikes in the first quarter from base salary increases and payroll taxes etc. We don’t necessarily see that this quarter, but the normal increase is that we did see we more than offset by the timing of compensation accruals in 2009. As the markets improved and assets and revenues increased throughout the year, frankly the majority of the compensation line was booked for Janus in the second half of 2009 versus the first half. So we have a little bit of a timing impact going on there, between the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2010. 
On the long term incentive line, we obviously saw significant increase from the senior profits interests at Perkins. Recall that these were designed to incent revenue growth and long term performance for the team in Chicago. They are probably hitting -- the expense is hitting 2010, a little more than we originally planned, but the good news is that Perkins assets have increased, almost doubled, they have increased 85% since we closed the transaction for the additional 50% at the end of 2008, and their performance over the three and five year period continues to be top docile. It is not unexpected to see more expense flow through. At current AUM levels of Perkins and performance levels, I would assume to see another $8 million to $10 million of expense being booked in the reminder of 2010. 
On the fund proxy point, which we also discussed last quarter, we said that we expected to see a total of $7 million to $10 million to hit in the first half of the year. We are still on track on that number. We recorded $1 million of this expense in the first quarter, therefore it is likely that we would see between $6 million to $9 million of additional expenses in the second quarter. I expect to see very little expense in the second half of the year related to the proxy; however, we could see a modest increase in marketing expense, as sponsorships and channel level advertising picks up a little bit throughout the year. 
We talked quite a bit in the fourth quarter call about reinvesting back in our business. A little color there; we didn’t see a lot of impact on that in the compensation line, as our hiring still remains fairly slow. Although we did see a pick up in the G&A line from technology, which we talked about, and some employee related expenses. 
Lastly on the capital side, it always comes up; I thought I’d address it here. We have adequate cash on the balance sheet today to satisfy our near term debt maturities in 2011 and 2012, and we obviously continue to focus on building a stronger balance sheet as we move forward. We are committed to have a balance sheet that allows us the flexibility to reinvest in our business for the long-term growth, and adequately withstanding market shocks. 
With that I will turn back over to Rick.

Before we take questions, I would like to take just a few more minutes of your time to describe what I see here at Janus after my first almost three months. During the last just short of 90 days, I’ve done a deep dive into the Janus Capital Group, working closely with executives and investment leadership. We have tried to assess our strengths and opportunities, so we can develop a sustained and increasing value for our clients and our shareholders. 
In addition to spending a lot of time in Denver, I have spent time with INTECH in Florida and Princeton; with Perkins in Chicago; and with our teams both in Europe and in Asia. I have talked with our clients, with consultants, as well as to many employees all over the world. My first conclusion is clear; I think we have a very healthy culture, and excellent people, and I am proud to be associated with this company. 
What we need to do and you hear this in a resounding way, both internally and externally, to deliver a period of stable excellent execution and we have an increasing set of opportunities to capture. Our investment teams can go head-to-head with anyone out there. I believe we can take market share from our competitors in multiple channels. If there is an under performing equity manager out there we want to replace them, and our bottoms up fundamental bond strategies are a very good complement to many of the macro driven industry leaders on the fixed income side. 
Our deep expertise in the United States as well as in global markets will continue to provide us with ample opportunities to increase our footprint in US retail and us institutional, in fixed income, and in non-US Market places. INTECH is clearly going through a very challenging period, but they represent a high quality source of risk controlled liquid non-core related alpha, which can and should have a sustained and important role in many clients asset allocation. 
So our priorities fall naturally out of that vision. First we are an investment company, that’s what we are. Our most important job is to deliver superior long-term investment performance. We will continue to enable our investment teams at Janus, INTECH and Perkins as our highest priority. 
Second, we have to increase our distribution, and we have opportunities to do so. In retail and intermediary our overall foot print is still modest, and there is a lot of room for us to grow. We are particularly focused on new opportunities in the RA channel and it’s regional broker dealers. We are investing in infrastructure to support future growth, also taking a number of concrete steps to strengthen our brand. 
In the institutional space, the obvious and most crucial step is to work with INTECH to make sure they are delivering the best client service and communication that they can during this difficult period. We need to protect that base and grow it. At Janus and Perkins, we start with a very small base in institutional assets, and there are very significant opportunities to generate new traction. In particular, recently our fixed income products have been achieving success with some of the major consultants. 
Third, we need to strategically develop our product offerings. We can expand and deepen what we offer in fixed income, in global equities, and also in some other asset classes and product types. 
Fourth, we need to couple of success in these developments efforts with very strong business discipline. Over the next few years that should enable us to deliver sustained and consistent profit growth with the leaders of our industry, and that’s our goal. 
Thank you very much for your time and attention, and operator we will now take questions.

As you know, well the institutional business in many markets around the world, the flow is dominated by consultants in the United States that really is true. There are major global consultants and then there are lots of local and regional consultants both in the US and outside. Those institutional buyers if you will, focus on the quality of your process, probably much more distinctly than simply your results. 
In traditional sort of old time retail channels, it was very results focused, and you could watch flows follow our recent results in a very direct correlation. In institutional, the question is ‘show us the results, but also show us the process, that demonstrates that you can continue to deliver positive results going forward.’ 
So that process orientation and a heightened focus on risk management is I think a hallmark of the institutional process, and what we do is visit with all the key consultants. We have obvious folks who are dedicated to that channel here in our company, and we try and explain the various processes at INTECH, at Janus, and at Perkins, in a way that not only relates what our recent performance experience has been, but in a way that in detail describes how we generate that performance to provide them with the necessary confidence to put their trust in us on a going forward basis. 
It’s a slightly different sale than traditional retail, but the trend that you see now as sort of modern retail focuses on asset allocation products, back programs and central buying centers, modern retail is actually looking much more like institutional on a go forward basis.

Part and parcel of that strategy I think you would expect, and certainly we do, that in a ragging bull market they would tend to under perform, and I think that pattern is consistent. 
So we don’t see the recent underperformance in the face off, for instance in the midcap market more than a 60% trailing 12 months index performance. We don’t see some underperformance by the Perkins folks against that benchmark as surprising or standing on its own of great concern. That said, if you look at our performance on a constant basis, and we are always asking hard questions about whether we are making mistakes that we should fix, and Perkins is doing that everyday. 
So I don’t want to act too cavalierly about short-term performance, you need to focus on it and address it in a serious way. But the pattern is not surprising to us and we don’t have a tremendous amount of concern and their long-term number remain so strong that we see them as continuing to be very successful.

Welcome to the Janus Capital Group First Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. As the operator said, I'm Dick Weil, CEO of Janus Capital Group; and I have with me Greg Frost, our CFO, for this call. 
Our agenda today will be to follow the quarterly earnings presentation book that you all have. I'll first provide a summary of earnings investment performance inflows. I'll drill down a bit into some of those elements and then Greg Frost will present our financial results in some more detail. And finally, I will cover a bit about our vision and priorities. Last we'll take some questions.
Okay. Quarter one 2010 EPS was $0.17 a share versus $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2009. As I said, Greg will cover the financial results in more detail in a minute. First quarter net flows for the company were negative $1.9 billion, $4.3 billion of net outflows at INTECH more than offset positive $1.4 billion for Janus and positive $1.0 billion for Perkins. Overall AUM at March 31, was up to $165.5 billion, a 4% increase over December 31, 2009.
Long-term performance remains strong across our mutual fund complex with 84% of our funds in the top two Lipper quartiles on a three and a five-year basis as of March 31. Additionally, we were very pleased to win 9 Lipper awards for Best Funds based on risk adjusted returns. 49% of our funds have a four or five Overall Morningstar Rating at March 31, 2010.
Flipping to Page 3 of the book. In the lower left corner, you can see the flows for INTECH. I would like you to focus a moment on INTECH. INTECH suffered $4.8 billion of gross outflows in Q1 consistent with the $4.6 billion of gross outflows last quarter. Outflows are very hard to predict. INTECH has been successful at building large relationships, which means individual decisions can drive large blocks of assets. Outflows are very importantly affected by investment performance, to state the obvious, and there is a lag basis for that and they are also subject to broader industry flows. Relevant to continuing rate of outflows, we note and now I am lifting from a bullet on Page 4, that short-term performance at INTECH has been improving with 75% of their strategies, which is actually 96% of their assets on an asset weighted basis, outperforming respective benchmarks for the six months ended March 31. That's clearly a good start. But just as clearly, consistent outperformance in future quarters is needed to address this situation.
Gross inflows were $500 million in the first quarter for INTECH. This was down from prior periods. While we do not give guidance on flows, I can tell you that funded gross inflows at INTECH in April are already materially higher than the $500 million of gross inflows in the first quarter. Through the recent crisis, INTECH as well as many other mathematical or quantitative managers, have faced particularly challenging, disrupted and chaotic market conditions. I believe the current stabilizing market conditions should offer better opportunities for INTECH's process to generate historic levels of return going forward. But it's very clear that INTECH's future depends on continuing positive investment performance to drive an improved picture inflows.
Turning away from INTECH. On Page 3 of the presentation, we also detail flows of Janus and Perkins. The market was definitely more favorable for fixed income and value equities and was a tougher environment for growth equities in terms of flows. At Janus, we had net flows of $1.4 billion which were consistent with prior quarters. This represents an approximately 6% annual growth rate. Fixed income contributed approximately 2/3 of this flow. Janus growth strategies, which are about 25% of our Janus AUM, experienced 2% annualized organic growth in the quarter compared to what we believe was about a minus 2% for the overall industry. Furthermore, I think the Russell Value Index is outperforming the Russell Growth Index by more than 500 basis points year to date at March 31, which creates a tough environment for growth strategies in the first quarter.
In spite of these headwinds, Janus is gaining market share and seeing increasing opportunities. We saw a 26% organic growth rate in the broker dealer channel and good growth in retail intermediary overall, about $2 billion on the quarter on the base of end of period assets of a $110 billion. At Perkins, exceptional long-term performance drove net inflows of $1 billion. This level of inflows represents very strong organic growth rate of over 25%. Perkins has just announced, though, that they are closing the small cap value fund to new investors as of May 25.
On Pages 4 and 5 of our book, we present some more detailed information about investment performance at each of our brands. I'll just quickly highlight that 81%, 88% and 86% of Janus equity mutual funds are in the top two Lipper quartiles on a one-, three- and five-year basis at March 31. At INTECH, those same numbers are zero, 42% and 56%, outperforming their relative benchmarks over one, three and five years at March 31. As noted earlier, 75% of the strategies, which is about 96% of the assets on an asset weighted basis, have outperformed over the most recent six months ended March 31. At Perkins, the same numbers are 50%, 100% and 100% of their mutual funds are in the top two Lipper quartiles in a one-, three-, five-year basis at March 31. 
At this point, I'll ask, Greg Frost, to give you some more information about our financial results."

I'm on Page 7 of the presentation. As Dick mentioned, the EPS in the first quarter was $0.17 compared to $0.20 in Q4 and obviously, a significant loss a year ago driven by goodwill charge that we recorded in much different market conditions than we're experiencing today.
The quarter was marked by higher average assets yet revenues were slightly lower and expenses were up slightly, which caused margins to decline by roughly 300 basis points. And let me provide a little more color on this point. The driver of revenue was frankly lower performance fees. Recall that last quarter we discussed a large Janus separate account for which we recorded a full year's worth of performance fees in the fourth quarter totaling roughly $5 million. If you factor this in to the current quarter, revenue looked a lot more in line with the increase in average assets. On the expense side, the 3% increase from the fourth quarter can largely be explained by higher variable expenses, which we would expect with slightly higher revenue, again, adjusting for the performance fees, and the effect of the Perkins compensation plan on our long-term incentive line that we talked about last quarter. 
Digging a little deeper into expenses. On the comp side, historically, we've seen spikes in the first quarter from base salary increases and payroll taxes, et cetera. We don't necessarily see that this quarter, but that's the normal increases that we did see were more than offset by the timing of compensation accruals in 2009. As the markets improved and assets and revenues increased throughout the year, frankly, the majority of the compensation line was booked for Janus in the second half of 2009 versus the first half. So you have a little bit of a timing impact going on there between the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2010.
On the long-term incentive line, we obviously saw significant increase from the senior profits interests at Perkins. Recall that these were designed to incent revenue growth and long-term performance for the team in Chicago. They're probably hitting the expenses hitting 2010 a little more than we originally planned, but the good news is that given that Perkins assets have increased, almost doubled, they've increased 85% since we closed the transaction for the additional 50% at the end of 2008 and their performance over a three- and five-year period continues to be top decile. It is not unexpected to see more expense flow-through. At current AUM levels at Perkins and performance levels, I would assume to see another $8 million to $10 million of expense being booked in the remainder of 2010.
On the fund proxy point, which we also discussed last quarter, we said that we expected to see a total of $7 million to $10 million to hit in the first half of the year. We are still on track on that number. We recorded a $1 million of this expense in the first quarter, therefore, is likely that we would see between $6 million to $9 million of additional expenses in the second quarter. I expect to see very little expense in the second half of the year related to the proxy. However, we could see a modest increase in marketing expense as sponsorships and channel level advertising picks up a little bit throughout the year.
We talked quite a bit in the fourth quarter call about reinvesting back in our business. A little color there; we didn't see a lot of impact on that in the compensation line as our hiring still remains fairly slow. Although we did see a pickup in the G&A line from technology, which we talked about and some employee-related expenses. And lastly on the capital side, it always comes up. I thought I'd addressed here. We have adequate cash on the balance sheet today to satisfy our near-term debt maturities in 2011 and 2012. And we obviously continue to focus on building a stronger balance sheet as we move forward. We are committed to have a balance sheet that allows us the flexibility to reinvest in our business for the long-term growth and adequately withstand market shocks. And with that I will turn it back over to Dick."

During the last -- just short of 90 days, I've done a deep dive into the Janus Capital Group, working closely with executives and investment leadership. We have tried to assess our strengths and opportunities so we can develop a sustained and increasing value for our clients and our shareholders.
In addition to spending a lot of time in Denver, I've spent time with INTECH in Florida and Princeton, with Perkins in Chicago and with our teams both in Europe and in Asia. I've talked with our clients, with consultants, as well as to many employees all over the world. My first conclusion is clear. I think we have a very healthy culture and excellent people and I'm proud to be associated with this company. What we need to do, and you'll hear this in a resounding way, both internally and externally is deliver a period of stable, excellent execution and we have an increasing set of opportunities to capture. Our investment teams can go head-to-head with anyone out there. I believe we can take market share from our competitors in multiple channels. If there is an underperforming equity manager out there, we want to replace them. And our bottoms-up fundamental bonds strategies are very good complement to many of the macro-driven industry leaders on the fixed income side.
Our deep expertise in the United States as well as in the global markets will continue to provide us with ample opportunities to increase our footprint in U.S. retail, in U.S. institutional, in fixed income and non-US marketplaces. INTECH is clearly going through a very challenging period, but they represent a high-quality source of risk-controlled, liquid, non-correlated alpha which can and should have a sustained and important role in many client asset allocation.
So our priorities fall naturally out of that vision. First, we're an investment company, that's what we are. Our most important job is to deliver superior long-term investment performance. We will continue to enable our investment teams at Janus, INTECH and Perkins as our highest priority. Second, we have to increase our distribution and we have opportunities to do so. In retail intermediary, our overall footprint is still modest and there is a lot of room for us to grow. We're particularly focused on new opportunities in the RIA channel and its regional broker-dealers. We're investing in infrastructure to support future growth. We are also taking a number of concrete steps to strengthen our brand. 
In the institutional space, the obvious and most crucial step is to work with INTECH to make sure they're delivering the best client service and communication that they can during this difficult period. We need to protect that base and grow it. At Janus and Perkins, we start with a very small base in institutional assets and there are very significant opportunities to generate new traction. In particular recently, our fixed income products have been achieving success with some of the major consultants.
Third, we need to strategically develop our product offerings. We can expand and deepen what we offer in fixed income, in global equities and also in some other asset classes and product types. Fourth, we need to couple success in these development efforts with very strong business discipline. Over the next few years, that should enable us to deliver sustained and consistent profit growth with the leaders of our industry and that's our goal. 
Thank you, very much for your time and attention. And operator, we'll now take questions."

There are major global consultants and then are lots of local and regional consultants both in the U.S. and outside. Those institutional buyers, if you will, focus on the quality of your process probably much more distinctly than simply your results. In traditional, sort of old-time retail channels, it was very results focused and you could watch flows follow recent results in a very direct correlation. In institutional, the question is show us the results, but also show us the process that demonstrates that you can continue to deliver positive results going forward. And so that process orientation and a heightened focus on risk management is I think a hallmark of the institutional process. And what we do is visit with all the key consultants. We have obviously folks who are dedicated to that channel here in our company. And we try and explain the various processes at INTECH, at Janus and at Perkins in a way that not only relates what our recent performance experience has been, but in a way, in detail, describes how we generate that performance to provide them with the necessary confidence to put their trust in us in a going forward basis. It's a slightly different sale than traditional retail, but the trend that you see now as sort of modern retail focuses on asset allocation products, back programs and central buying centers, modern retail is actually looking much more like institutional on a go forward basis."

We don't see some underperformance by the Perkins folks against that benchmark as surprising, or standing on its own, of great concern. That said, we look at our performance on a constant basis and we're always asking hard questions about whether we're making mistakes that we should fix and Perkins is doing that everyday. So I don't want to act too cavalierly about short-term performance. You need to focus on it and address it in a serious way.

Thank you everyone for your time today, and welcome to our second quarter 2010 conference call. Before we get started I would just like to call your attention to two changes in how we are making our presentation this quarter in order",1015,"Thank you, Operator. Thank you everyone for your time today, and welcome to our second quarter 2010 conference call. Before we get started I would just like to call your attention to two changes in how we are making our presentation this quarter in order to help you better understand the company and align your understanding better with my own. We are focusing on investments styles in our presentation rather than legal distinctions.
We’ve combined flow and performance metrics for Janus Equity and for Perkins into a new classification called fundamental equity. And additionally, we’ve broken out fixed income separately as this is an area of particular focus for us going forward. INTECH disclosure remains the same, but tied with mathematical reflecting their investment strategy. We’ve included all the data provided in the past in the appendix for your convenience. So with that preamble, let's get going.
Janus Capital Group earned $0.17 in the second quarter 2010, flat versus the first quarter and up from $0.10 one year ago. Assets under management, as you saw in our release earlier this morning, ended the quarter at $147.2 billion, down 11% versus the end of the first quarter, largely in line with the US equity markets; US S&P was down almost 12% for the quarter. Net outflows for our Group in the quarter were $1.3 billion.
I would like to give you some context for these results. During the second quarter and really for a substantially longer period than that our equity investors have been fighting a really terrible market. As you all know, beginning in May, volatility shot up and equities fell sharply. The S&P fell, as I said earlier, approximately 12% on the quarter.
Active equity flows were suffering in comparison to both passive and fixed income. In the US mutual fund industry, for example, active equities saw $11 billion in outflows, while fixed income saw $62 billion in inflows and passive equity saw $32 billion inflows in the quarter.
Lastly in context, research activity remains down particularly for mathematical and quantitative strategies. Despite these challenges, I'm encouraged that we've made the important progress across a wide range of our initiatives. First and most importantly, mathematical equity strategies at our INTECH subsidiaries saw a much improved net outflow of $1.5 billion in Q2 compared to $4.3 billion in the first quarter.
INTECH’s mathematical approach is very much better than many of its quantitative peers with $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter driven largely by existing clients. We are encouraged by their inflows in the second quarter, but we also recognize that one quarter does not make a trend; they continue to face some very challenging industry circumstances.
I was also very pleased with our accelerating fixed income business. Second quarter net inflows of $1.2 billion brought our year-to-date flows to over $2 billion. We are seeing increasing interest and acceptance of Janus as a fixed income provider. We think we have lot to offer as a compliment to some of the larger BMS in that space.
Fundamental equity, including Janus and Perkins products, saw net outflows of $1 billion in the second quarter. This was disappointing given the substantial progress we're making in our advisory channel, and I’ll cover that a little bit more, later. It was driven largely by two significantly reallocations away from us in a single strategy. In particular, as part of the larger, we lost $1.8 billion to a single reallocation decision in the insurance channel where the client assured us it was not performance related.
In our first quarter call, I laid out some priorities for you that we were working on at our company. First and most importantly was the improving performance in our mathematical strategies at INTECH. And then I mentioned three areas where we are investing, growing our strong US retail franchise, aggressively growing our fixed income business and strengthening our institutional efforts for Janus and Perkins. Candidly, this last one is going to take some significant time.
First and foremost, I'm encouraged that our mathematical equity performance has improved dramatically at June 30; 83% of the mathematical strategies are outperforming their benchmark over three-year period at June 30. Well over 90% of the assets are outperforming for three years ended June 30. The two largest strategies in INTECH comprising approximately one-third of their total assets are ahead of benchmark gross of fees for 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 years.
Looking at the areas where I mentioned we were investing. We continue to improve our position in the advisory channel, the positive net flows of $1.4 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 14%, which has been driven by particularly strong success in both Janus and Perkins products.
Our fixed income business is developing quickly at an annual growth rate of 63%, admittedly off a small base. And we've seen institutional net inflows of $600 million in the first half of the year in our fundamental equity strategies.
So before I turn it over to Greg, let me try and summarize our quarter. We made strong progress in our key objectives, which will serve to strengthen and diversify our company in the future. Investment performance remained strong, and particularly the improvement in our mathematical strategies is encouraging. Investment performance is the heart of what we do. It's the most important part of our company.
However, we continue to face some challenging environment. Going forward, we are going to continue to focus on good execution of our plan. We believe that we are seeing increasing interest in US assets with US equities outperforming developed equities by 980 basis points over the last 12 months. At this point, we think US equities in corporates represent substantially better value than government bonds and that should be encouraging for our business.
Our active managers have good opportunities to outperform passive strategies, elevated volatility create opportunistic entry and exit points for us. And the market environment should continue to provide an excellent tailwind for our rapidly growing fixed income business.
With that, I will turn it over to Greg.

I'm going to cover in a little more detail flows, performance, the financials of the company for the quarter, as well as a little bit more color on the investments that we are making in the business during this year.So tu",874,"Thanks, Dick, and good morning. I'm going to cover in a little more detail flows, performance, the financials of the company for the quarter, as well as a little bit more color on the investments that we are making in the business during this year.
So turning to page 5, as Dick mentioned, firmwide flows were certainly affected by the one large reallocation out of Janus managed equity strategy, and although firmwide net flows remain negative, there are a number of bright spots to consider. Despite industry headwinds, firmwide gross sales increased 26% from the first quarter and almost 40% from one year ago.
Fundamental equity sales continue to be driven by our retail intermediary distribution teams across a wide variety of products. INTECH flows improved meaningfully in Q2 from higher sales driven by the $1 billion mandate funding from an existing public funds client, which we talked about a little bit last quarter and lower overall redemptions.
INTECH’s improving performance should help the flow picture we have seen over the last several quarters, but we also understand that inflows and outflows are lumpy in the institutional channel where INTECH plays and flows generally lag performance.
Lastly, our fixed income business continues to show solid growth. In addition to robust sales through intermediary channels, we are also seeing traction in the institutional channel as evidenced by a $600 million mandate win during the quarter, our largest funding to date.
Turning to page 6, I’ll highlight three main themes on the performance side. First long-term performance continues to lead the industry with 82% of fundamental equity funds and 100% of fixed income funds beating peers over a three-year basis. On a five-year basis, the numbers are stronger, fixed income remains at 100%, while 89% of fundamental equity funds are beating peers. When compared to the largest 20 mutual fund firms, Janus ranks number one on a three-year basis and at number two on a five-year basis for those funds beating peers.
As Dick mentioned earlier, INTECH performance over the short and intermediate term periods improved significantly in Q2 from 0% of strategies being the respective benchmarks on a one-year basis last quarter to 42% at the end of Q2. And over a three-year period, the rise is even more significant from 42% of strategies being benchmarked to 83%. And lastly, on a one-year basis, and although the Lipper numbers are down slightly from the longer-term numbers, still almost two-thirds of our fundamental equity products and half of our fixed income products are beating peers.
Our CIOs watch performance very closely and see no reason for concern with the numbers. In fact on a year-to-date basis, almost 70% of our complex-wide funds are beating peers.
Turning to the financials on page 7, as Dick mentioned, EPS totaled $0.17 in the quarter, consistent with the first quarter and obviously up sharply from a year ago. Overall, the quarter was very straightforward. We saw slightly higher revenue from Q1 from one additional day of accrued fees in the quarter. We had a $0.01 nonoperating gain on the sale of some unconsolidated fee capital during the quarter, and we had a $0.03 charge for the recently completed fund proxy that we have been talking about the last several quarters.
The proxy charge in the quarter was just over $8 million. It represents 3.2% of revenue, and clearly impacted our margins. In addition to reelecting the fund trustees, fund holders also approved the addition of performance fees to the Janus fund, the Janus 20-40 funds, the overseas fund and Perkins global value fund. This represents approximately 37% of assets under management today.
The additional fees will begin hitting the P&L in the third quarter of 2011 and will phase in over the subsequent two quarters. We have more information in the appendix on pages 13 and 14 for your benefit.
And lastly on page 8, we discussed broadly our reinvestments in the business in 2010. We’ve done this in the last couple calls and we felt like this call with some additional detail is warranted this call. As of right now, we expect to spend between $15 million and $20 million on a cash basis. This excludes the amount of money we spent on the fund proxy. We expect to spend that during this year. Over half of the spent will be in the form of additional resources and brand spend with the remainder being capital in nature, the primary driver being technology. We can certainly adjust this spend going forward should market conditions prove challenging.
We are investing in our fixed income business as Dick mentioned, including trading and investment talent and the launch of two new global strategies later this year. We are investing in our growing advisor channels by enhancing our internal sales desk to maximize our sales opportunities and significantly enhance our technology infrastructure and data transparency capabilities.
And lastly, we are focused on the Janus brand and have stepped up our advertising efforts, both print and in the digital space. As Dick mentioned, we have made good progress in our 2010 objectives and our investment dollars are directly aligned with these objectives.
With that, I will turn it back over to Dick to wrap up.

In this difficult environment, clearly we need to be very careful and conservative about how we are investing. Yet, we must continue to invest properly to assure the medium and long-term future of our business. Our frame work is that investments need to be modest and they need to meet a disciplined test.
Senior executives need to be accountable for promises regarding generating results, which are better than our cost of capital over 3 to 5 years. That’s the framework we are putting all the investments that Greg described through, and I will hold people accountable internally for those standards. Over the medium term, we remain committed to delivering margins above 30%.
I think that's it from our side. We will take questions now. Operator?

The most important thing in an investment management firm in the culture. And the problem with inorganic growth is it’s very hard to attain a single healthy culture and therefore I think people often underestimate how difficult it is to achieve success in acquisitions and the asset management space.
So our main focus right now is growing our business organically. That said, if there were terrific opportunities that allowed us to more rapidly develop and in that context I had confidence that we could maintain the right culture, we would take a hard look at those opportunities. But in the center of our vision right now is growing our business organically. I think it’s happening with great success. We have a lot of confidence in the team that we currently have and we are looking forward to the future in that respect.

This relates to the mandate loss that you referred to earlier, which I guess you mentioned was from a reallocation from the insurance company. There's been some trends where yourself and others have lost some mandates not just performance but partially because it’s very difficult for some life insurance companies to hedge given their own guaranties out there, the exposure on funds that have - particularly on funds that may have high tracking error, which I believe is something you guys kind of pride yourselves on to some degree.
Does that mean it's going to be - you see that being a challenge for growing - for reentering or growing that part of your business over time that historically has been a pretty good market segment for you guys, and do you see that as being a challenge going forward?

And the insurance companies that are driving that business have discovered that they weren’t satisfied with the amount of hedging that they had in place through that volatility and a number of them made a decision after reflecting on the cost of a better hedging strategy or a more complete hedging strategy, they made a decision to step away from the business.
So I think the variable annuity business is in transition and that certainly affects the scope of opportunity for us and for all managers who have been serving that industry. And you are right, the more volatile the funds in many ways the greater the challenge on hedging side. So we offer a range of funds with different volatility characteristics, but we are not crossing indexers, this is a true investment shop. So I think you fairly put your finger on a challenge going forward in that market segment.

And that’s an opportunity for us. It take time to win over the consultant community which drives so much of the institutional business in consultant-driven countries around the world, US, UK, to a certain extent Tokyo and others. And so it's a long battle you fight. And you try and sell them on three levels. You try and help them understand that your products are the best and you try and help them understand that your process is robust and focuses not only on return but risk control. And then you have to try and persuade them that the company itself is strong and stable.
And we haven’t necessarily had success at all those levels in the past with the institutional consultants. So that’s a key focus for us going forward. That's true domestically and internationally. And candidly that’s just a process that takes time. That’s sort of three-year battle.

Welcome to everyone to the Janus Capital Group third quarter 2010 conference call. In the third quarter, Janus earned $0.18 a share. This amount was earned net of two offsetting items.
During the quarter, we experienced $0.05 of gain from tax reversals, and we also experienced $0.05 of expense from two administrative errors. Net of our action, no clients have been negatively affected. 
Let me step out our normal process here for a moment to address these errors. Errors of this order of magnitude are completely unacceptable to me. They're unacceptable to our management and to every person in our firm. We don’t expect them to be acceptable to our equity owners either.
At this point, the errors look idiosyncratic and have not revealed any deeper systemic problem, but we’re taking nothing for granted. We simply must have processes and controls that catch the inevitable human errors and avoid outcomes like this.
We've just hired a new head of technology and operation, George Batejan, who started on Monday. George will be working with our head of risk management and our entire management team to look at our processes and controls across the firm to ensure that we've taken every possible step to avoid a repeat of this sort of unacceptable outcome.
I’ll turn it back to our more normal process here. Turning to flows, Janus third quarter total company long-term net flows were $2.9 billion outflows. As a fundamental in mathematical strategy, outflows more than offset fixed income inflows.
Fundamental equity had net outflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter, reflecting very slow sales over the summer and one significant client reallocation.
Candidly, the summer was a terrible environment for the equity markets inflows and we’re seeing some stronger equity returns here in the fall and we’re looking forward to operating under improved conditions.
While mathematical equity performance continued to improve for us, it’s not shown up yet in our mathematical equity flows. Third quarter net flows were $2.1 billion out compared to $1.5 billion out in the second quarter. The major difference quarter-on-quarter was we had some lumpy inflows in the second quarter that did not repeat in the third.
Our fixed income business continued to gain traction with $1 billion in net inflows, more than doubling the industry growth rate.
We’re making progress in our global, our institutional and our fixed income efforts, but we continue to face some strong industry headwinds particularly in large cap U.S. fundamental equities.
Generally, our long-term performance remains strong across the firm. However, a few key fundamental equity strategies are experiencing shorter-term challenging performance.
Performance in our mathematical equity strategies continued to improve with outperformance in the third quarter, driving 100% of mathematical strategies above benchmark on a one year basis at September 30, which is up from 42% at June 30, and up from 0% a year ago. We continue to develop our fixed income franchise. We're launching two key global credit strategies in the fourth quarter.
Despite slowing sales in the third quarter we continue to be well positioned in the advisory channel with gross sales up 27% year-to-date over the same period in 2009. We're gaining momentum in the institutional channel thanks in large part to our fixed income business and also related to global equities. In short, we are making progress with our strategic focus on more global and more income.
Now let me turn it over to Janus Capital Group, CFO, Greg Frost for some more detail.

Turning to page 5, the charts on this page really depict what Dick mentioned in his opening remarks that gross sales across the firm slowed during the third quarter decreasing 34% from where we found ourselves in Q2.Redemp",825,"Thank you, Dick. Good morning. Turning to page 5, the charts on this page really depict what Dick mentioned in his opening remarks that gross sales across the firm slowed during the third quarter decreasing 34% from where we found ourselves in Q2.
Redemptions improved from the second quarter, but remember that last quarter included a $1.8 million Janus managed equity mandate loss that we discussed on this call. Annualized organic loss totaled approximately 8% during the quarter. Of all the disciplines, fundamental equities was hit hardest reflecting lower sales and sustained redemptions, and looking at industry data it appears that we were not alone in this summer slowdown of sales.
The positive news that the redemptions were concentrated with only a handful of clients, and that we did see positive net inflows across the range of actively managed products. Perkins Value products which are included in the fundamental equity continued to have positive net flows posting an organic growth rate of roughly 5% in the quarter compared to minus 6% for the Value category.
INTECH net flows declined slightly from the second quarter primarily caused by lower sales, but do recall that in the second quarter, we had a $1 billion enhanced index mandate that funded from an existing client. The improvement in performance that Dick talked about has not yet translated into flows as domestic search activity continues to be very, very slow for quantitative managers. 
Fixed income continues to post solid organic growth with a $1 billion of net flows in the quarter. We certainly are encouraged by the progress the team has made and look forward to continued momentum as we look ahead into 2011. 
On slide six, on the performance side quickly, we are obviously pleased that long-term performance for our fundamental equity and fixed income products continues to be strong across the firm, with well over 85% of mutual fund assets beating peers across the three and five year time period.
Note here that we have transitioned our disclosures from a percent of funds beating peers to an asset weighted calculations, which we believe is a more meaningful representation of performance across the firm. The percent of funds (calc) that we have historically presented is included in the appendix for those that want to see those numbers.
As Dick talked about, underperformance from some key fundamental equity strategies certainly has influenced the decline in the one-year numbers from where they were a year ago.
INTECH performance in the quarter continued to improve, leading to a very strong performance across one, three and five year periods, and importantly, performance has significantly improved our assets where most concentrated.
Over the one year period, growth strategies are more than 200 basis points ahead of their benchmarks, Enhanced Plus are ahead by more than 100 basis points, and Enhanced Index are ahead by more than 75 basis points. 
Lastly, turning to page seven very quickly on the financial side, as Dick said, earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.18 versus $0.17 last quarter and $0.05 a year ago. A little bit of noise in these three numbers, as most of everyone knows, the current quarter includes $0.05 of operational charges that Dick mentioned related to fund administrative errors and a $0.05 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves. Recall that last quarter, included fund proxy expenses of approximately $0.03 per share. We incurred no further expenses in the third quarter related to the fund proxy. The third quarter of '09 included a net $0.10 charge related to several items that we’ve already discussed.
I won't dwell on the administrative errors, but it is important to point out that the charge totaled $13.6 million. It impacted our earnings per share by $0.05 and our quarterly margins by over 500 basis points. We have filed with our insurance carriers to recover a portion of the charge.
After considering the proxy expenses in the second quarter and the errors in the third quarter, operating expenses really declined primarily due to lower variable expenses in line with lower revenue, and we also saw lower sales commissions in line with the decline in gross sales.
Finally, impacting net income and earnings per share was the reversal of tax reserves. These are related to some legacy tax issues totaling $9 million or $0.05 per share.
On the capital side, our 2010 investment spend is on track with what we discussed last quarter. We are in the middle of planning for 2011, and although no decisions have been made, it is fair to say that 2011 investments would be moderate, and continue to be focused and they will be flexible to adjust to changing market conditions.
Our cash position continues to grow. We closed on a new $100 million unsecured credit facility during the quarter all of which I believe are good steps toward regaining our investment grade rating with S&P.
With that, I will turn it back to Dick.

We're making progress in our fixed income business and developing our global businesses. As we look ahead, we see today's equity markets are creating great opportunities for active management. We currently see stocks moving with a high correlation as a group, driven heavily by macro themes and by index investing rather than by individual company fundamentals.
As this process goes on, it creates opportunities for our active equity strategies to prosper as they take advantage of the inherent mispricing created by this trading as a group, and we see that as creating very good opportunities for our active management going forward.
With that comment, I will stop here and take questions.

I think the structural - there are cyclical forces and structural longer term forces driving the focus on fixed income. And some of the cyclical forces will start to reverse, but the structural forces are going to be sustained, and in particular I think on the institutional side globally, a lot of institutions are reconceiving what their mission is and staying closer to benchmarks and closer to liability driven formulas, and that necessarily increases focus on fixed income and decreases equity risk factor allocations. So I think that's a sustained trend. Similarly, a structural force that's working is the rise of ETFs and increased focus on passive investing is I think a sustained challenge for the active equity business. So I think for a while the focus is going to remain on fixed income. I guess that also reflects our thinking that rates are going to stay low for a while yet also. Longer term, the fixed income market can't print returns like it has over the last decade, that’s not mathematically - it's almost not possible, but certainly not likely. As a consequence I think the equity markets are in a position to deliver substantially better returns, and I think, you'll see over time an increasing return of interest as fear declines and risk appetites return. You'll see a return towards equities in a lot of places. It won't go back to where it was because of the structural forces I mentioned. But I think over time, you'll see returning interest into equity. I think, the conditions now are creating the opportunities for strong overall equity performance and particularly strong active management performance as I mentioned earlier.

I’m not aware of any linkage between the flash crash issues and the outflows. I think the linkage that I see is the one I mentioned earlier, which is, I think the trends towards focusing on macro and sort of creating binary risk-on risk-off approaches to the equity market, and the trend to using index investing, both meaning that the correlations in the equity markets between stocks has been very high and creates a lot of trading as a group outcomes. I think as that happens and it ignores individual company fundamentals, you get an increasing disjoint which creates opportunities for active managers. That’s what I see. The flash crash issues and the issues around the sustainability of the liquidity created by the rapid traders, I think those are real market dynamics that affect all participants in the equity markets, not necessarily just quantitative managers. I think we all face the market dynamics created by this liquidity; it’s here and now it’s gone in this algorithmic trading that's become so much of the volume. I think it’s a challenge for regulators and market participants both. I think it’s true that a lot of the liquidity that’s there on a regular basis can dry up very quickly and that creates trading dynamics that can be a challenge for all of us.

We have taken a careful look at where we are underperforming and we have not found systemic problems or major issues or discontinuity of style or other things that would be risk management or supervisory kind of flags.
