Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. I'll begin today's call with some opening comments about our second quarter results, then I'll turn the call over to Chris Reidy, our CFO, to take you through the detailed results. Afterwards, I'll return to provide you with our updated forecast for fiscal 2010. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.Let me begin. ADP's results for the quarter were pretty much in line with our expectations. The cumulative impact from the difficult economic environment that we've seen over the last 15 months continued to negatively impact our results.  Revenues for the second fiscal quarter of 2010 were flat to a year ago but included a benefit of nearly two percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rates as the dollar weakened during the quarter. However, I am pleased that pretax and net earnings both grew 1%, and earnings per share from continuing operations grew 2%, excluding the favorable tax item that we had in the quarter. I'm also encouraged by our key business metrics. Employer Services new business sales, client retention, client funds balances and the number of pay were all somewhat lower compared with a year ago. The pace of the decline has certainly slowed and in some cases, our key metrics in the quarter were actually better than we expected. We continued to see some indications of stabilization in terms of employment levels in the U.S. And client retention, while still under pressure, leveled off in the quarter. However, as you are aware, the key retention period is third quarter, and until we see those results, we are holding our estimates for the full year of up to a full one point decline.Moving on to sales, although new business sales declined 3% in the second quarter, our salesforce is seeing market receptivity from companies once again willing to invest again in their business. However, the selling environment continues to be somewhat mixed across the business units within Employer Services. Similar to what we told you three months ago, sales cycles for larger companies, particularly in the U.S., remain challenged, and as a result, new business sales in our National Accounts business units were behind our expectations and declined year-over-year. That being said, new business sales to mid-sized companies in our Major Accounts division were flat to a year ago, but continued to be ahead of our expectation. And sales in Europe, our largest international market, were down year-over-year but also ahead of our expectations.New business sales and/ small business services grew year-over-year, which I'm quite pleased with given the sales headcount reductions that were made in last year's fourth quarter. Total store sales, which includes the PEO, were also strong in the quarter with good growth year-over-year. As a result of this positive sales momentum in most of our markets, we are now investing for future growth and have begun the acceleration of next year's salesforce hiring. I believe this will position ADP for stronger sales growth over the next 12 to 18 months. However, we expect this necessary investment will also be a drag on earnings through the same 12 to 18 months period. And let me emphasize this is well worth of investment to increase revenues and in turn, profitability over the longer term. Everything considered, we are also more confident in our ability to achieve the same dollar amount of new business sales as last year or perhaps come in slightly higher than last year.Moving on to Dealer Services. The automotive marketplace is still quite challenged, but on a positive note, December was the second consecutive month of year-to-year increases and U.S. car sales volume. We're not calling it a trend, but it certainly feels a heck of a lot better than the declines over the last couple of years. The industry is certainly not out of the woods as dealership closings continued, but Dealer Services win-loss rates in the marketplace continue to be strong and resulted in increased North American market share for ADP year-over-year. We continue to estimate that dealership closings will be completed over the next 12 months with about $50 million in total of annualized loss revenues in Dealer Services. To date, closed ADP sites represent about 10 million of the 50 million in annualized revenues. By the end of fiscal '10, we expect additional dealership closings representing another $20 million of annualized loss revenues. As these closings will occur throughout this fiscal year, we estimate that the fiscal '10 impact will be about approximately $15 million of loss revenue. Additionally, the larger enterprise accounts have witnessed an increase in activity and are exploring options to expand their market share. We've also seen an increase in the volume of activity when layered applications from the large auto consolidators as they sharpened their operating strategy by improving process and technology. We believe these indicators are all positive signs regarding the future health of the automotive marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide the details of our results."

We're on Slide 4. Total revenues of $2.2 billion in the quarter were flat to a year ago and continue to be negatively impacted by the cumulative impact from the difficult economy that began towards the end of Sept",1356,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're on Slide 4. Total revenues of $2.2 billion in the quarter were flat to a year ago and continue to be negatively impacted by the cumulative impact from the difficult economy that began towards the end of September 2008. As Gary mentioned, the quarter was positively impacted, two percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rate comparisons.Pretax earnings were up 1%, and net earnings and diluted earnings per share were both up 5%. As you read in our press release this morning, the current quarter benefited from the favorable tax item. Excluding this tax item, net earnings grew 1% and diluted earnings per share increased 2%. Fiscal year-to-date, we have spent about $152 million to purchase over 3.5 million ADP shares in our commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders. We are on track to return at least 300 million to 400 million of excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases -- Now let's turn to Slide 5. In Employer Services, total revenues declined 2% for the quarter. This was still a tough comparison versus a year ago when ES [Employer Services] grew revenue of 6%. Revenue in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States declined 7% in the quarter from lower new business sales during fiscal 2009 compared with the year earlier, lower client fund balances from slower sales, lower wage growth, fewer employees on our clients' payrolls and lower client retention. But beyond Payroll, revenues in the U.S. continue to grow, with 3% growth in the quarter coming from our ASO program benefit solution and 401(k), which benefited from an increase in assets from the list in the Dow.ES' pretax margin declined 10 basis points. The impact from lower revenues more than offset the benefits from last year's fourth quarter restructuring and continued expense control. These lower revenues included a decline in high margin interest passed [ph] back revenues as a result of the decline in client fund average balances.Pays per control, our same-store sales employment metric was down 5% year-over-year, which is better than we anticipated. The pace of decline lessened in our client revenue retention metric, which declined 0.1% compared to last year. But keep in mind that the key retention period is the third fiscal quarter. Gary took you through the sales results a moment ago, so let's move on to the quarter's results for PEO and turn to Slide 6.The PEO reported 9% revenue growth for the quarter, and this growth was due to increased benefits pass-through revenues that resulted from increases in both benefit rates and the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined slightly as the benefits from last year's restructuring and continued expense control were offset by higher pass-through revenues. Year-over-year for the second quarter, average worksite employees paid increased 4% to early 200,000. Now let's turn to Slide 7. In Dealer Services, revenues declined as anticipated, 5% for the quarter, 8% organic and continue to be negatively impacted by the cumulative effect of dealership closings and lower transactional revenues year-over-year. It has also declined in our software license fee revenues, which is recognized upon installation on our International business due to several new businesses installations in last year's second quarter.  Dealer's pretax margin improved 60 basis points due to lower headcount from the expense actions taken in last year's fourth fiscal quarter, as well as the cost control measures that we have put in place. Dealer Services competed very well in the markets it serves and continue to increase its share of consolidating market.Now let's turn to Slide 8. The schedule shows the overall impact of the client funds portfolio extended investment strategy. At the top of the slide, you see the breakdown of both the average balances and the average interest yields in orange for the short extended and long portfolio component, which corresponds to the pretax P&L impact on the bottom of the slide, with the total representing the interest on funds held for client P&L revenue line item. Before I take you through the quarter's results of the strategy, I'd like to remind everyone that the decline in market interest rates accelerated back in October 2008. As a result, the year-over-year decline in the P&L from lower rate will increase as the fiscal year progress. With that in mind, I'll take you through the quarterly results and then I'll take you through the full-year forecast on the next slide.Near the top right of the slide, you can see that the average client fund balances were down $0.7 billion compared with the year-ago period. The cumulative impact of fewer pays, client losses and slower sales compared with the year ago all contributed to the decline in average client fund balances and more than offset the positive impact of Canadian foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Staying in the orange section, in addition to the decline in average client fund balances, the average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 40 basis points or 3.8% this quarter, resulting in an overall decline of $20 million in interest on funds for client on the P&L. The impact from lower new purchase rates was most pronounced in the client short portfolio, where the average yield earned was 170 basis points lower than last year due to the decline in short-term interest rates.Looking at the blue section on the slide, average borrowings were down this quarter and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings dropped about 60 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. The result was a $5 million reduction in interest expense. So when you take into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results was a $21 million pretax decrease or a decline of about 12%.Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I will take you through the extended investment strategy forecast for fiscal '10. We anticipate a decline in average client fund balances of 4% to 5% resulting from pressures on the level of new business sales, continued pressures on wage growth, as well as the cumulative impact of the decline in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls and client losses. We are seeing lift in balances from SUI [State Unemployment Insurance] tax rate. However, the level of bonus payments are still unclear and we won't see these results until they are paced out over our third quarter, which is the first calendar quarter. We are anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of about 3.7%, down 30 to 40 basis points from fiscal 2009 compared with our prior forecast of down approximately 30 basis points due to a decline in markets interest rates across the yield curve.It's important to keep mind about 20% of the extended and long investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year, which is expected to contribute to a decline of about $75 million from client funds interest revenues, which is in line with our previous forecast. We are anticipating that average corporate extended balances will decline about $200 million. The average yield on the corporate extended investments is expected to be down 10 basis points. We anticipate average borrowings will decline about 200 million as the average interest rate paid on those borrowings is expected to be down about 90 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. Taking into consideration the overall extended investment strategy, including lower borrowing costs, we anticipate a $65 million to $70 million decline in pretax earnings in fiscal 2010.Before I turn it back to Gary, I want to point out the reserve fund update from this morning's release. Last week, ADP received $14.8 million pretax or $0.02 per share, which will be recorded in the third fiscal quarter. Including this distribution, ADP has received about 99% of its original investment in the reserve fund, which leaves approximately $3 million of the original investment unrecovered. As a reminder, last year, we recorded an $18 million loss on our investment in the reserve fund. Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2010."

We are still a little cautious about the remainder of fiscal 2010. But with more visibility on our key metrics and easing comparisons expected over the next two quarters, we are slightly improving our fiscal 2010 outlook. So for fiscal '10, we now anticipate total ADP revenues will be flat to slightly down, and we anticipate achieving the high end of our diluted EPS from continuing operations forecast of $2.34 to $2.39. This compares with the $2.39 in fiscal '09, and both years exclude favorable income tax item.The fiscal '10 forecast also includes $14.8 million pretax or about $0.02 per share from the sixth distribution of the primary fund of the reserve fund, and Chris mentioned earlier, we received on January 29, 2010. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are reflected in the forecast, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, again, depending upon market conditions. For our reportable segments, we anticipate that ES, Employer Services, revenues to decline about 1%, which reflects a decline in pays per control of about 4% on average for the year and flat to down one percentage point in client revenue retention.We continue to anticipate that the year-over-year comparison for pays per control will ease during the second half of fiscal 2010 compared to the second half of fiscal 2009 when this very important metric declined significantly. We anticipate high single-digit revenue growth in the PEO, and we continue to expect a decline in Dealer Services revenues of roughly minus 3% to 6%. As you heard me say earlier, we now anticipate slight to slightly higher ES and PEO worldwide new business sales growth compared with our previous forecast for sales dollars to be flat with fiscal 2009. And we continue to anticipate no improvement in our segment pretax margins.If you turn with me now to Slide 11, I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up to your questions. While most economists believe that the U.S. economy has bottomed, we remain cautious. I believe appropriately so about the near-term outlook. The remaining six months of '10 will be challenging. The economy is recovering. It is a matter of timing and we are focused on the right things for the long term, including, most importantly, accelerating new business sales growth by investing now in our sales team and in the solutions that our clients want and need to be successful in their businesses. We are continuing to incrementally invest in Client Services, which is critical to our continued success and to maintaining our market leadership position. Our business model remain solidly intact with highly recurring revenues, client life cycles of just under 10 years and very strong cash flows. I remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders, including ongoing share repurchases, again, depending on market conditions. You've heard me say previously and it's worth repeating now, ADP is focused on the future and as a result, is well positioned to leverage the inevitable recovery in the economy. Now I'll turn it back to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

But based on what we've seen in the first half, that was better than what we expected. But I think as Gary went into in his remarks, the sales was a little bit better, particularly in certain parts of our business. We mentioned the small business area where we had headcount reductions last year and still grew in sales. So that was a little bit better and is reflected on the springing up of the guidance to flat to slightly up compared to our previous guidance."

But in generally, the environment on the small end has been, both anecdotally as well as data-wise, then much more positive for us over the last number of months. And in fact, in terms of sales results, they are the most favorable of all of the results we have. So again, it feels pretty good. And we're starting to see an abatement in terms of price concessions and out of businesses on the loss business side, which also feels pretty good.

As sales improve, you've got the commissions on the sales. So clearly, those are the two pressures that we would expect to see for the next period of time, which is a good pressure to have, as Gary mentioned. When we -- a lot of the actions that you take have been taken already. With the restructuring that we took last year, it was in anticipation of the kind of pressure that we would expect to see. When you think about retention down 100 basis points, we've given that metric before that that's $50 million of revenue or if it's a 100 basis points. And for every percentage of pays, it's $20 million, and we're talking about down 4% for the year. So $50 million on the revenue retention, $80 million on the pays, that's a lot of rich revenue that puts pressure on your bottom. So that's why we took the restructuring charges that we took last year and took the reductions that we did. We tried to do that in areas that didn't -- weren't client basing in the sales areas and in service, we're continuing to invest. So when you think about the investments for the second half of this year, it's the ramping of sales headcount, it's hopefully improvement in sales and the impact that has on the sales incentives, as well as continued investments in service and implementation as you get ready for those new sales. So we continue to have very tight expense controls throughout, we've taken the actions and when you put all together, that's what we come up with no improvement in margins. And you can see the margin performance to date has been okay, not to our normal 50 basis points up year-after-year, but it's all of those things that we're trying to balance while still invest in the future and be ready for the growth when the economy does turn around."

We're obviously trying to push growth in the mid and high-end as well, not just adding feet on the street to small business because that's where the bigger productivity gains that we have, and we have longer client life cycles in the mid to high end of the market. Surely, the pays per control is the highest margin we have, that balances sort of to the extent balance improved and pays per control go down less because we did budget for pays per control to shrink in the area of 5% to 6%, so to the extent that it's 4%, that's certainly a positive benefit, and certainly high margin. And we would love to see -- it's too early to tell because we don't know about bonuses and we don't know about exactly what the SUI impact state unemployment rates, but certainly with unemployment levels at the level they are, it's going to drive all the states to ratchet up the state unemployment rate in order to keep people on unemployment both in higher numbers and for longer period.

So they would include stand-alone tax, wage garnishment, sales tax and accounts payable. And we were missing the accounts payable. If you go back two years ago, we had an arrangement with a company called Harbor Payments, which was acquired by another entity which changed their strategic direction, and we had to basically retrench. We still think it's a big category potentially for us. And so we bought a company that we've been in discussions with for about six to nine months, and we're in the process of expanding out the sales force. And so we'll go to market after the CFO, controllers and tax people in larger organizations to try to sell those core products into the mix. So accounts payables are a good extension of what we already do, it involves money movement, it enjoys check printing, it enjoys control and that kinds of things that we do well from a transaction processing standpoint. And typically, as the decision maker, we already have very strong relationship with it. So we think it's the natural extension, it's not huge at this juncture, but we do think longer term, it's got pretty good potential. The experience we did have with Harbor, that Gary mentioned, that showed us that we can sell it, and our clients are interested in that suite. And so the key going forward is to ramp that up and match it with tax credit services, and tax where we intend to address that part of the market. But the good news is we did have the experience where we know that our clients were interested in that product, and we saw that we can sell it."

Let me begin today's call with some opening comments about our third quarter results. Then I'll turn the call over to Chris Reidy as normal to take you through the detailed results. After which, I'll return to provide you with our updated forecast for fiscal 2010. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.
ADP's results for the quarter were pretty much in line with our expectations. You have already read in our press release this morning that year-over-year comparisons in our key metrics did begin to ease in the second half of this fiscal year, as we had anticipated. Having said that, our results continue to be below ADP historical standard and still being negatively impacted, but to a lesser degree by the cumulative impact of the difficult economic environment over the last year and a half.
Let me now point out to you what I believe are the noteworthy items in the quarter. In Employer Services, we did continue to see increased market receptivity from companies willing to invest again in their business infrastructure. New business sales growth flattened in the quarter after six consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline. Having said that, sales were again mixed across the business units within Employer Services. Sales to larger companies in the U.S. are still lagging somewhat from a year ago, but sales to small and midsize companies are increasing and new business sales in both Europe and GlobalView are also increasing. I am becoming more encouraged. However, I'd like to remind everyone that there is a lag in the high end of the market between reported new sales and when those bookings actually turn into revenues due to the implementation periods required as you move up market to larger more complex clients. 
Additionally, as you may recall, last quarter, we did begin accelerating next year's sales force hiring to better position ADP for stronger sales growth, but this is also expected to be somewhat of a drag on earnings over the near term. So directionally, we'll take a period of time for revenues and in turn, profits to increase. But I am pleased that new business sales are moving in the right direction and that the growth of our sales team is meeting the increasing demands in the marketplace.
Let me move on to retention. You have heard from us about declining client retention levels dating back to the last quarter of fiscal '08 and continuing throughout the full year fiscal 2009. So I'm especially pleased that during this year's critical calendar year-end period, client retention levels improved 1.4 percentage points. 
ADP's revenues are still being negatively impacted by the losses of the last several quarters prior to this quarter, and we are still not yet quite back to the retention levels from several years ago. But again, the current quarter's increased retention is directionally a very positive sign. 
Our pays per control metric did decline 2.5% during the quarter, but the pace of the decline has certainly slowed. We continue to see some indications of stabilization in terms of employment levels across the U.S., and believe that the HIRE Act recently passed by Congress may provide a needed catalyst to employers that are on the cusp of making hiring decisions. And of course, ADP will assist its clients to enable them to realize the benefits from the provisions of the HIRE Act.
We also reported growth of nearly 5% in client fund balances during the quarter after reporting declines in the last five consecutive quarters. This group growth is primarily the result of higher bonus payments than we anticipated, an increase in state employment insurance rate and we also got a small lift from favorable Canadian foreign exchange rates.
Let me move on now to Dealer Services. The automotive market is obviously still under pressure, but continues its comeback with increases in U.S. car sales volume. Consumers have responded well to recent manufacture incentives, which also believe is a positive indicator that the outlook is strengthening. Dealer Services continue to improve its North American share, with increased new business sales and strong competitive win-loss rate. 
As you may already know, GM and Chrysler have previously announced plans to reinstate a portion of the announced closed dealerships. And of course, some of those are ADP clients. We remain very comfortable that our earlier estimate of the revenue impact from these closings that we had previously shared with you will be no more than the $50 million of annualized loss revenues to Dealer Services, and will most likely be less than our estimate.
Additionally, increased consumer credit availability and pent-up demand appears to be positively impacting this marketplace. As a result, we are encouraged by the upswing in market indicators, which I believe bodes well for the future growth of the automotive marketplace. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our results."
126269,99166658,57829,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're on Slide 4. Revenue growth turned positive in the quarter, increasing 3% including a benefit of nearly two percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rates. Increased PEO pass-through revenues also co",1445,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're on Slide 4. Revenue growth turned positive in the quarter, increasing 3% including a benefit of nearly two percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rates. Increased PEO pass-through revenues also contributed two percentage points of growth, but lower client fund interest reduced growth by nearly one percentage point. Pretax earnings grew 1%, also assisted nearly two percentage points by favorable FX rates. There were a lot of swings in the quarter and I'd like to take you through the larger, more impactful items. 
As you can see the detail of other income net in the press release, we received the distribution from the reserve funds compared with the charge we recorded in last year's third quarter. The current quarter comparison also benefited from lower severance costs and favorable foreign exchange rates. Negatively impacting the year-over-year comparisons was lower interest on client funds and increased investments in service and technology platforms.
Net earnings declined slightly as a result of a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter due to a favorable IRS audit adjustment in last year's third quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations declined 1% in the quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have spent nearly $280 million to purchase over 6.5 million shares of ADP stock.
You saw in our press release this morning that our cash balance was $2.1 billion at March 31, and I want to assure you that we are committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. We are on track to return at least $400 million of excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases for the full fiscal year. And this amount may be higher depending on market conditions, as well as M&A activity. I don't want you to interpret that to mean we are changing our M&A strategy because we're not. We continue to look for small, close-to-the-core acquisitions, not large acquisitions that will be dilutive over multiple years. Before I leave this slide, I'd like to review some of the expense categories with you.
You saw in this morning's release that operating expenses increased about $100 million during the quarter. More than half of this increase is from higher PEO pass-throughs and increased expense from the FX impact that I already mentioned. Additionally, bonus payouts are expected to be higher this year. We also spent more in systems development and programming during the quarter, primarily from the investments we'd spoken with you about in our newest solutions, RUN and Workforce Now. Increased expenses from FX rates had an impact here as well.
Now let's turn to Slide 5. In Employer Services, total revenues grew 1% for the quarter, all organic. Revenue in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States declined 3% in the quarter and our beyond favorable revenues in the U.S. continue to grow with 8% growth in the quarter. ES' pretax margin was flat with a year ago. We're seeing the benefits from last year's fourth quarter restructuring and continued expense control, and the quarter also benefited from higher client fund balances. However, the continued investments in newest solutions and the recent acquisitions that we shared with you on February at our Annual Analyst Conference pressured the pretax margin. Additionally, fewer W-2s were processed.
Decline in pays per control on a same-store sales employment metric lessened this quarter at down 2.5% year-over-year. Losses also eased as evidenced by an increase of 1.4 percentage points in our client revenue retention metric. Gary spoke with you about the sales results a moment ago, so let's move on to the quarter's results for PEO and turn to Slide 6.
The PEO reported 15% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic. This growth was due to increase pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined as the benefits from last year's restructuring and continued expense control, offset by the year-over-year impact of one-time items in both the current and last year's third quarter and higher pass-throughs. Year-over-year for the third quarter, average worksite employees paid increased 5% to nearly $206,000.
Now let's turn to Slide 7. Dealer Services revenues declined as anticipated 3% for the quarter, 4% organic and continue to be negatively impacted by the cumulative effect of dealership closings, lower transactional revenues year-over-year and a decline in our software license fee revenue, which is recognized upon installation on our international business. U.S. pretax margin improved to 140 basis points due to lower headcount from the expense actions taken in last year's fourth fiscal quarter, as well as the excellent cost-control measures that we have put in place. Dealer Services continued to increase its share of the consolidating market.
Now let's turn to Slide 8. This schedule shows the overall impact of the client funds portfolio extended investment strategy. At the top of the slide, in orange, you see the breakdown of both the average balances and the average interest yields for the short, extended and loan portfolio components, which corresponds to the orange portion of the pretax P&L impact on the bottom of the slide. The total pretax P&L impact for this section represents the P&L revenue line item interest on funds held for clients.
Now let's take a look at the quarterly results. Near the top right of the slide, you can see that average client fund balances were up $0.8 billion compared with a year ago period. The cumulative impact of fewer pays, client losses and slower sales was more than offset by a combination of wage growth, particularly bonuses, increased data on employment insurance rates and the positive impact of Canadian foreign exchange rates during the quarter. 
Staying in this orange section, the average yield on a client funds portfolio declined 50 basis points to 3.2% this quarter due to the seasonally high level of client funds that were invested overnight at about 15 basis points. The decrease in the average yield more than offset the growth in client balances, resulting in a decline of $16 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L that you see near the bottom right of the slide. The impact from lower new purchase rates was most pronounced in the client short portfolio, due to the seasonally high level of client funds invested overnight at rates, which was 70 basis points lower than last year, as the decline in market interest rates has continued since last year's third quarter.
Moving on to the blue section of the slide. Average borrowings were down this quarter and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings dropped about 10 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. Our third quarter is seasonally our highest client fund balance quarter, which makes it our lowest borrowing quarter. As a result, the impact in interest expense seen that you see near the bottom right of the slide was negligible. When you take into consideration the entire extended strategy, which also includes the corporate extended interest income shown in purple on the slide, the result was a $20 million pretax decrease or a decline of about 12%.
Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy forecast for fiscal 2010. We anticipated a decline in average client fund balances of 1% to 2%, which is an improvement from our previous forecast of a decline of 4% to 5%, as a result of increased balances related to wage growth and state unemployment tax rates. We are anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of about 3.6%, down about 40 basis points from fiscal 2009 and down slightly from our prior forecast.
Client fund interest revenues are expected to decline about $70 million, which is an improvement of about $5 million compared with our previous forecast. We continue to anticipate that average corporate extended balances will decline about $200 million. The average yield on the corporate extended investments is expected to be down 20 basis points, a slight decrease in yields from our prior forecast, which partially offset the benefit of the client fund interest revenue line. 
We continue to anticipate average borrowings will decline about $200 million and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings to be down about 90 basis points, so blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. Taking into consideration the pretax earnings impact of the overall extended investment strategy, including lower borrowing cost, we anticipate a decline of about $65 million in fiscal 2010 as you see at the bottom right of the slide.
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2010."

We're now on Slide 10. For fiscal 2010, we do anticipate total ADP revenues will be about flat with last year.

For fiscal 2010, we do anticipate total ADP revenues will be about flat with last year. And we anticipate achieving diluted EPS from continuing operations from around $2.36 to $2.38 compared with $2.38 in fiscal '09, excluding favorable income tax item and the divested Commercial business for both fiscal year. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are reflected in the forecast, though it remains clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending upon market condition.
For our reportable segments, we anticipate Employer Services revenues declining up to 1%, which reflects a decline in pays per control of about 4% on average for the full year and about flat client revenue retention. We anticipate 8% to 10% revenue growth in the PEO Services, driven by higher pass-through revenues. And we do anticipate slightly higher combined Employer Services and PEO sales worldwide for new business. We expect a decline in Dealer Services revenues of minus 3% to 4%, and we continue to anticipate no improvement in our segment pretax margin.
Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions. We have seen certainly some easing in the U.S. economic landscape, and the economy appears to be on its way to recovery. Our key business metrics are improving and we are focused on the right things for the long term. We continue to invest in our direct sales team, fundamentally adding new hires to accelerate new business sales growth. As we spoke with you at our annual analyst event back in February, we are also investing in newer technology platforms and solutions, such as RUN, for our low-end market, Workforce Now, our ASO offering, GlobalView and Streamline for our international and global clients. These are all designed to meet the needs of our clients and prospects. And we are continuing to invest incrementally in client service, which is critical for our continued success and to maintaining our market leadership position. These investments will, to some degree, pressure ADP's near-term outlook but are necessary for growth over the long term. Our business model remains solidly intact with highly recurring revenues, client life cycles of just under 10 years and excellent cash flow. Our cash position, as Chris mentioned earlier, is strong at $2.1 billion and our capital requirement are very low. 
I remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders, including ongoing share repurchases, obviously depending upon market conditions. ADP is a great company, and we continue to execute successfully against our five-point strategic growth program that we reviewed again with you back in February at our Analyst Conference. I said previously, that ADP is well positioned to leverage the inevitable recovery in the economy and it feels like the recovery is upon us. I remain optimistic about ADP's long-term opportunities for growth.
Let me now turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

In fact, we're involved in some of the discussion in Washington today, in terms of trying to figure out exactly how the compliance and the regulation works for the new healthcare reform. Obviously, as the biggest mover of funds to the IRS and the biggest person in the client business across the U.S., ADP will certainly play a significant role there. It's still not 100% clear on healthcare reform. But clearly, payroll and HR systems have to be the system of record for all healthcare reform. And any kind of compliance, money movement, penalties and enforcement is going to have to be administered by companies like ADP and some of the reforms will clearly require regulatory compliance and reporting, both to employees and employers and to the IRS and in some cases, even on W-2. We're also selling healthcare, as you know, and particularly in the PEO, where we're qualified to sell healthcare in multiple states and could be properly positioned as a insurance pool because we provide healthcare to multiple companies in multiple states. I think it generally will be a positive for us, but I think it's going to take a period of, really, 12 months to have that kind of come to fruition and the regulation gets published, et cetera. On top of that, I think the HIRE Act is helping us across the board, probably more upmarket and then the mid-market, the down market. But in general, regulation compliance, penalties and higher taxes, although we may not like them personally, generally help ADP as a company."

Secondly, we are investing in the business and particularly in sales and new technology and for the future of the business, I want to continue to do that because it's the right thing to do long term. And even as we recover in the new sales category, it does take some period of time for sales to turn to revenue. And ultimately, that's what drives organic growth and scale margin contribution. And so it's a little about timing. And I think what you've seen in previous down cycles like we saw in '02 and '03, it probably won't be all that different this time as we come out of the valley and start going back up the mountain on the other side."

You're seeing that now in the form of bonuses, and I think even though we don't see the data, what's happening in the general economy would indicate that people working more hours, people are starting to be hired. So we are seeing wage growth as well as internal employee growth in certain companies. On top of that, unemployment taxes are going to be up for a while because they typically lag a year on the way down, and they will continue to lag a year beyond on the way up because the states have to fill their coffers to pay for all this 10% on employment tax. And then on top of that, you're going to see higher taxes that will come out beyond that. So again, the one thing that we can control as a company is selling more payroll accounts as well as making sure that most of them use our tax filing and direct deposit services.

But you have to remember that even though we're down 2 1/2% pays per control this quarter, that's on top, I think, than the same quarter last year of around down 3 1/2% or 4%. So we're still down on a two-year basis, almost 6% in pays per control. And so that's starting to flatten. It will still take another, call it, two, three maybe even four quarters before we get through that and get to a real flat to positive growth kind of area. Another statistic is not something that we really published is, we have a Screening and Selection business which has, I think, around 10,000, 15,000 clients, mostly in the mid and up market. And we're seeing the selection, the screening process is up in recent months 20% to 30% over prior periods. So that's a pretty good indication within our base, although not statistically fully accurate, it's more anecdotal. But clearly, people are starting to hire again. I think you see the balance increases that are indicative around increased hiring and bonuses. And certainly, the National Employment Report is getting closed to push in terms paid growth with positives in the service sector and the low end of the market. So again, I think all of the signs are good but it's pretty easy to be good compared to how bad it's been for a period of time. So I think this thing is through the bottom and going to start to ease up, but I think we have to be cautious, do not get ramp in enthusiasm as we go through this cycle because it's going to be a gradual upswing and it passed its prologue, it will take some period of time before we really start to see the benefit."

So there's a lot of focus on that metric. But the reality going forward is, it's driving sales in excess of the losses from retention. And if we get flat employment levels for a while, you're basically forgoing a traditional 1% to 2% or $20 million to $40 million. It's not that big a deal now that the bulk of the decline in pays is behind us. And I think that's sometimes misunderstood.

Secondly, the PEO is already a qualified health provider as a co-employer in 30 states or whatever the number is, something like that. So we think we're going to be well-positioned in terms of leads to the PEO for people who now want to offer healthcare. And in terms of reporting, a lot of it in the early reviews are going to have to be done either through employer reporting or W2 reporting in terms of the individual compliance and what happens to be there. We've also seen this respond very aggressively on the opportunity on the HIRE Act in the media as well as in some of our advertising. And I certainly think that's helping us in the marketplace.

We're not in that business, but the laddering strategy we have kind of mitigates the downside of that rate volatility and we'll participate on the upside. The good news is, the bulk of the portfolio is still earning 3.6% of thereabouts and they extended in the long are up in the force and that's real return on equity.

One is, in terms of the economic impact, the high end of the U.S. market was the one that was affected the most. And most people, either Chris's chair or my chair, have been very reticent on any kind of capital spending or outlays of cash or internal effort until there's more Christmas and clarity around is the recession really behind us and is it back to business as usual. So I think it's not surprising that the U.S. up market would be the slowest to recover. That being said, we also had some additional drag because over the last few quarters, we've had some previously booked business in our backlog that has either been deferred or canceled outright that we'd taken down. So you've got a slowing of new sale and a little bit accelerated rate of unwind in the previous backlog, because a lot of these accounts take a year to implement. So now as you -- as gross sales start to increase and the backlog become, I don't want to use the term clean, but more current than I think it will go back to the normal pattern, which should occur in the next quarter or two."

Let me begin today’s call with some opening comments about our third quarter results. Then I will then turn the call over to Chris Reidy as normal to take you through the detailed results, after which I will return to provide you with our updated forecast for fiscal 2010. Before we take your questions I will provide some concluding remarks.
ADP’s results for the quarter were pretty much in line with our expectations.  You have already read in our press release this morning that year-over-year comparisons in our key metrics did begin to ease in the second half of this fiscal year as we had anticipated.  Having said that, our results continue to be below ADP historical standards and still being negatively impacted but to a lesser degree by the cumulative impact of the difficult economic environment over the last year and a half.
Let me now point out to you what I believe are the noteworthy items in the quarter.  In employer services we did continue to see increased market receptivity from companies willing to invest again in their business infrastructure.  New business sales growth flattened in the quarter after six consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline.
Having said that, sales were again mixed across the business units within employer services.  Sales to larger companies in the US are still lagging somewhat from a year ago but sales to small and midsized companies are increasing.  New business sales in both Europe and global view are also increasing.
I am becoming more encouraged; however I’d like to remind everyone that there is a lag in the high end of the market between reported new sales and when those bookings actually turn into revenues due to the implementation periods required as you move up market to larger, more complex clients.  
Additionally, as you may recall, last quarter we did begin accelerating next year’s sales force hiring to better position ADP for stronger sales growth but this is also expected to be somewhat of a drag on earnings over the near term.  
Directionally it will take a period of time for revenues and in turn profits to increase but I am pleased that new business sales are moving in the right direction and that the growth of our sales team is meeting the increasing demands in the marketplace.
Let me move on to retention.  You have heard from us about declining client retention levels dating back to the last quarter of fiscal ’08 and continuing throughout the full year of fiscal 2009.  I am especially pleased that during this year’s critical calendar year end period, client retention levels improved 1.4 percentage points.  
ADP’s revenues are still being negatively impacted by the losses of the last several quarters prior to this quarter and we are still not quite yet back to the retention levels from several years ago.  But again, the current quarter’s increased retention is directionally a very positive sign.
Our pays per control metric did decline 2.5% during the quarter but the pace of the decline has certainly slowed.  We continue to see some indications of stabilization in terms of employment levels across the US and believe that the Hire Act recently passed by Congress may provide a needed catalyst to employers who are on the cusp of making hiring decisions, and of course ADP will assist its clients to enable them to realize the benefits from the provisions of the Hire Act.  
We also reported growth of nearly 5% in client fund balances during the quarter after reporting declines for the last 5 consecutive quarters. This growth is primarily the result of higher bonus payments than we anticipated and an increase in state and employment insurance rates and we also got a small lift from favorable Canadian foreign exchange rates.
Let me over on now to Dealer Services.  The automotive market is obviously still under pressure but continues its comeback with increases in US car sales volume.  Consumers have responded well to recent manufacturer incentives which I also believe is a positive indicator that the outlook is strengthening.  Dealers Services continue to improve its North American chair, with increased new business sales and strong competitive win/loss rate.  As you may already know, GM and Chrysler have previously announced plans to reinstate a portion of the announced closed dealerships.  And of course, some of those are ADP clients.  
We remain very comfortable that our earlier estimate of the revenue impact on these closings that we had previously shared with you will be no more than the $50 million of annualized lost revenues to Dealer Services, and will most likely be less than our estimate.  
Additionally, increased consumer credit availability and apparent demand appears to be positively impacting this marketplace.  As a result we are encouraged by the upswing in market indicators, which I believe bodes well for the future growth of the automotive marketplace.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our results.

126269,99166658,57893,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Gary, and good morning everyone.  We’re on Slide 4.  Revenue growth turned positive in the quarter, increasing 3% including a benefit of nearly 2 percentage points from foreign favorable exchange rates.

Revenue growth turned positive in the quarter, increasing 3% including a benefit of nearly 2 percentage points from foreign favorable exchange rates.  Increased PDL pass through revenues also contributed 2 percentage points of growth.  
The lower client fund interest reduced growth by nearly 1 percentage point.  Pretax earnings grew 1%, also assisted nearly 2 percentage points by favorable FX rates.  There were a lot of swings in the quarter, and I'd like to take you through the larger more impactable items.  
As you can see in the detail of other income net in the press release, we received the distribution from the reserved fund compared with the charge we recorded in last year's third quarter.  The current quarter comparison also benefited from lower severance costs and favorable foreign exchange rates, negatively impacting the year-over-year comparisons with lower interest on client funds and increased investments in service and technology platforms.  
Net earnings declined slightly as a result of the higher effective tax rate in the current quarter due to a favorable IRS ordered adjustment in last year's third quarter.  Earnings per share from continuing operations declined 1% in the quarter.  Fiscal year-to-date we have spent nearly $280 million to purchase over 6.5 million shares of ADP stock.  
You saw in our press release this morning that our cash balance was $2.1 billion on March 31 and I want to assure you that we are committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.  We are on track to return at least $400 million of excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases for the full fiscal year.  And this amount may be higher, depending on market conditions as well M&A activity.  No one should interpret that to mean we are changing our M&A strategy, because we're not.  
We continue to look for small close-to-the-core acquisitions, not large acquisitions that will be dilutive over multiple years.  Before I leave this slide, I'd like to review some of the expense categories with you.  You saw in this morning's release that operating expenses increased about $100 million during the quarter.  More than half of this increase is from higher PDL pass-throughs and increased expense from the FX impact that I already mentioned.  
Additionally, bonus payouts are expected to be higher this year.  We also spent more on systems development and programming during the quarter, primarily from the investments spoken with you about in our newest solutions Run and Workforce Now.  Increased expenses from FX rates had an impact here as well.  
Now let's turn to Slide 5.  In Employer Services, total revenues grew 1% for the quarter, all organic.  Revenue in our payroll and tax filing business in the United States declined 3% in the quarter.  And our Beyond Payroll revenues in the US continue to grow, with 8% growth in the quarter.  The excess pretax margin was flat a year ago.  
We're seeing the benefits from last year's fourth quarter restructuring and continued expense control, and the quarter also benefited from higher client fund balances.  However, the continued investments in newer solutions and the recent acquisitions that we shared with you in February at our annual analyst conference pressured the pretax margin.  Additionally, fewer W-2s were processed.  
Decline in pays per control, our same-store-sales employment metric, lessened this quarter, at down 2.5% year-over-year.  Losses also eased as evidenced by an increase of 1.4 percentage points in our client revenue retention metric.  
Gary spoke with you about the sales results a moment ago, so let's move on to the quarter's results for PEO and turn to Slide 6.  The PEO reported 15% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic.  This growth was due to increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees.  
Pretax margins declined as the benefits from last year's restructuring and continued expense control were offset by the year-over-year impact of one-time items in both the current and last year's quarters and higher pass-throughs.  Year-over-year for the third quarter, average worksite employees pay increased 5% to nearly 206,000.  Now let's turn to Slide 7.  
Dealer Services revenues declined as anticipated, 3% to the quarter, 4% organic, and continued to be negatively impacted by the cumulative effect of dealership closings, lower transactional revenues year-over-year and a decline in our software license fee revenue, which is recognized upon installation of our international business.  
Dealer's pretax margin improved 140 basis points due to lower head count from the expense actions taken in last year's fourth fiscal quarter, as well as the excellent cost control measures that we have put in place.  Dealer Services continued to increase its share of the consolidating market.  
Now let's turn to Slide 8.  This schedule shows the overall impact in the client funds portfolio extended investment strategy.  At the top of the slide, in orange, you see the breakdown of both the average balances and the average interest yields for the short, extended and long portfolio components, which corresponds to the orange portion of the pretax P&L impact on the bottom of the slide.  
The total pretax P&L impact for this section represents the P&L revenue line item interest on funds held for clients.  Now let's take a look at the quarterly results.  Near the top right of the slide you can see that average client fund balances were up $0.8 billion compared with the year ago period.  
The cumulative impact of few pays, client losses and slower sales was more than offset by a combination of wage growth, particularly bonuses, increased state unemployment and insurance rates and the positive impact of Canadian foreign exchange rates during the quarter.  
Staying in this orange section, the average yield on the client fund portfolio declined 50 basis points, to 3.2% this quarter due to the seasonally high level of client funds that were invested overnight at about 15 basis points.  The decrease from the average yield more than offset the growth in client balances, resulting in a decline of $16 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L that you see near the bottom right of the slide.  
The impact from lower new purchase rates was most pronounced in the client short portfolio due to the seasonally high level of client funds invested overnight at rates which were 70 basis points lower than last year.  This decline in market interest rates have continued since last year's third quarter.  
Moving on to the blue section of the slide, average borrowings were down this quarter and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings dropped about 10 basis points, so a blended average borrowing rate of .2%.  Our third quarter is seasonally our highest client fund balance quarter, which makes it our lowest borrowing quarter.  
As a result, the impact interest expense that you see near the bottom right of the slide is negligible.  When you take into consideration the entire extended strategy, which also includes the corporate extended interest income shown in purple on the slide, the result was a $20 million pretax decrease for a decline of about 12%.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy forecast for fiscal 2010.  We anticipated decline on average client fund balances of 1% to 2%, which is an improvement from our previous forecast of a decline of 4% to 5% as a result of increased balances related to wage growth and state unemployment tax rates.  
We are anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of about 3.6%, down about 40 basis points from fiscal 2009 and down slightly from our prior forecast.  Client fund interest revenues are expected to decline about $70 million, which is an improvement of about $5 million compared with our previous forecast.  
We continue to anticipate that average overextended balances will decline about $200 million.  The average yield on the corporate extended investments is expected to be down 20 basis points, a slight decrease in yield from our prior forecast which partially offsets the benefit of the client fund interest revenue line.  
We continue to anticipate average borrowings will decline about $200 million, and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings to be down about 90 basis points.  So blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%.
Taking into consideration the pretax earnings impact of the overall extended investment strategy, including lower borrowing cost, we anticipate a decline of about $65 million in fiscal 2010, as you see at the bottom right of the slide.  Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2010.

For fiscal 2010 we do anticipate total ADP revenues will be about flat with last year.  And we anticipate achieving diluted EPS from continuing operations from around $2.36 to $2.38, compared with $2.38 in fiscal '09 excluding favorable income tax items and the divested commercial business for both fiscal years.  
As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are reflected in the forecast, though it remains clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending upon market conditions.   Prior to reportable segments, we anticipate employer services revenues declining up to 1% which reflects the client in pay per control of about 4% on average for the full year and about flat client revenue retention.  
We anticipate 8% to 10% revenue growth in the PEO services, driven by higher pass-through revenues.  And we do anticipate slightly higher combined Employer Services and PEO sales worldwide for new business.  We expect a decline in Dealer Services revenues of minus 3% to minus 4%, and we continue to anticipate no improvement in our segment pretax margins.
Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions.  We have seen certainly some easing in the US economic landscape, and the economy appears to be on its way to recovery.  Our key business metrics are improving and we are focused on the right things for the long term.  We continue to invest in our direct sales team, fundamentally adding new hires to accelerate new business sales growth.
As we spoke with you at our annual analyst event back in February, we are also invest ting in newer technology platforms and solutions such Run for our low end market, Workforce Now, our ASO offerings, Global View, and Streamline for our international and global clients.
These are all designed to meet the needs of our clients and prospects and we are continuing to invest incrementally in client service which is critical to our continued success and to maintain our market leadership position.  These investments will to some degree pressure ADP's near term outlook, but are necessary for growth over the long term.  Our business model remains solidly intact with highly recurring revenues, client life cycles of just under 10 years and excellent cash flows.  
Our cash position as Chris mentioned earlier, is strong at $2.1 billion and our capital requirements are very low.  I remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders, including ongoing share repurchases obviously depending upon the market conditions.  
ADP is a great company and we continue to execute successfully against our 5-point strategic growth program that we reviewed again with you back in February at our analysts conference.  I've said previously that ADP is well positioned to leverage the inevitable recovery in the economy, and it feels like the recovery is upon us.  I remain optimistic about ADP's long term opportunities for growth.  Let me now turn it over to the operator to take your questions.

In fact, we're involved in some of the discussions in Washington today in terms of  trying to figure out exactly how the compliance and the regulation works for the new healthcare reform.  Obviously, as the biggest mover of funds to the IRS and the biggest person in the client business across the US, ADP will certainly play a significant role there.  
It's still not 100% clear on healthcare reform, but clearly payroll and HR systems have to be the system of record for all healthcare reforms.  And any kind of compliance, money movement, penalties, enforcement is going to have to be administered by companies like ADP.  And some of the reforms will clearly require regulatory compliance and reporting, both to employees and employers.  And to the IRS and in some cases even on W-2s.  
We're also selling healthcare as you know, and particularly in the PEO where we're qualified to sell healthcare in multiple states and could be properly positioned as an insurance pool because we provide healthcare to multiple companies in multiple states.  
I think it generally will be a positive for us, but I think it's going to take a period of really 12 months to have that kind of come to fruition and the regulations get published, etc.  On top of that, I think the higher act is helping us across the board, probably more up-market, and then the mid-market than down-markets.  But in general regulation, compliance, penalties and higher taxes, although we may not like them personally generally help ADP the company.

The primary thing is adding new clients which we’re highly focused on. Secondly is higher wages to employees.  You’re seeing that now in the form of bonuses and I think even though we don’t see the data, what’s happening in the general economy would indicate that people working more hours, people are starting to be hired, so we are seeing wage growth as well as internal employee growth in certain of our companies.
On top of that, unemployment taxes are going to be up for a while because they typically lag a year on the way down and they will continue to lag a year beyond on the way up because the states have to fill their coffers to pay for all this 10% unemployment tax.
Then on top of that, you’re going to see higher taxes that will come out beyond that.  So again, the one thing that we can control as a company is selling more payroll accounts as well as making sure that most of them use our tax filing and direct deposit services, so we’re highly focused on that but I think the trends are certainly at our back, we would hope, as opposed to in our face at this point in time.

So we’re still down on a 2 year basis almost 6% in pays per control.  
So that’s starting to flatten and will still take another, call it 2, 3, maybe even 4 quarters before we get through that and get to a real flat to positive growth kind of area . Another statistic is not something that we really publish. We have a screening and selection business which has I think around 10,000 or 15,000 clients mostly in the mid and up market, and we’re seeing the selection, the screening processes, up in recent months 20% to 30% over a prior period so that’s a pretty good indication that within our base, although not statistically fully accurate, it’s more anecdotal, but clearly people are starting to hire again.
I think you see the balance increases are indicative around increased hiring and bonuses and certainly the national employment report is getting close to a push in terms of pay growth with positives in the service sector and the low end of the market.  So again, I think all the signs are good but it’s pretty easy to be good compared to how bad it’s been for a period of time.
I think this thing is through the bottom and going to start to ease up, but I think we have to be cautious and not get rampant enthusiasm as we go through this cycle because it’s going to be a gradual upswing and [if passes prolog] it will take some period of time before we really start to see the benefit.

But now that unemployment rates have reached a very high level, any improvement from that 1%, I’ll remind you is only worth about $20 million of revenue to us so there’s a lot of focus on that metric but the reality going forward is it’s driving sales in excess of the losses from retention and if we get flat employment levels for a while, you’re basically forgoing a traditional 1% to 2% or 20 to 40 million.  It’s not that big of a deal now that the bulk of the client in pays is behind us.  
I think that’s sometimes misunderstood, that’s more important going forward and it really isn’t as impactful as the differential in sales and retention.

We’re pretty stringent on our underwriting criteria in the PEO, more towards a white collar/gray collar kind of environment and the ASO clearly opens up the category for people who don’t meet our underwriting requirements in the PEO as a natural candidate for the ASO operation or product set.
So I think we’ve got it pretty much in hand and I don’t expect any significant drag on the PEO, at least near term.

We also sell healthcare and it clearly will drive more employers and employees to healthcare options, so we think it’s clearly going to help us there.  Secondly, the PEO is already a qualified health provider as a co-employer in 30 states or whatever the number is, something like that, so we think we’re going to be well positioned in terms of leads to the PEO for people who know want to offer healthcare, and in terms of reporting, a lot of it in the early reviews are going to have to be done either thorough employer reporting or W2 reporting in terms of the individual compliance and what happens to be there.
You’ve also seen us respond very aggressively on the opportunity on the Hire Act in the media as well in some of our advertising and I certainly think that’s helping us in the marketplace.

I think that’s number one.  Number two is I think we’ve done an excellent job in expanding the breadth of our product offering and keeping it current from a technology standpoint.  A good example of that would be the recent NADA we released all the mobile platforms for all of our applications where service writers can write up service orders and do inquiries straight from a PDA or any of the mobile platforms that we may have and pricing wise, it’s certainly more competitive than it’s been, but the bigger bundle of applications is also helping us from that standpoint and we have seen a lessening of losses of dropped applications in our businesses over the last number of months.
I would expect our market share gains to continue along the same pace as they’ve been for the last year as we look for the year ahead.

The forward yield curves do show some growth but if you notice, that’s been extending out further and further so it’s on the overnight fed funds rate as well as the longer part of the yield curve.  
So it’s anybody’s guess.  It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen to interest rates.  We’re not in that business but the [laddering] strategy we have sort of mitigates the downside of that great volatility and we’ll participate on the upside.  The good news is that the bulk of the portfolio is still earning 3.6% thereabouts and the extended and the long are up in the 4s and that’s real return on equity.  
So we don’t have the volatility but it’s going to take awhile before interest rates to get back to that 3.5 % to 4% level and in the meantime our portfolio is earning those kinds of rates.  So from an ROE standpoint, it’s much better this model.

But really there were two factors.  One is in terms of the economic impact, the high end of the US market was the one that was affected the most.  And most people in either Chris’s chair or my chair have been very reticent on any kind of capital spending or outlays, cash or internal effort until there is more crispness and clarity allowed in the recession really behind us and is it back to business as usual?  
So I think it’s not surprising that the US submarket would be the slowest to recover.  That being said, we also had some additional drag because over the last few quarters we’ve had some previously booked business in our backlog that has either been deferred or cancelled outright and we’ve taken down.  So you’ve got a slowing of new sales and a little bit accelerated rate of unwind in the previous backlog because a lot of these accounts take a year to implement.  
So now as you, as growth sales start to increase and the backlogs become, I don’t want to use the term “clean” but more current then I think it will go back to the normal pattern which should occur in the next quarter.

Let me begin today's call with some opening comments about our third quarter results. Then I'll turn the call over to Chris Reidy as normal to take you through the detailed results. After which, I'll return to provide you with our updated forecast for fiscal 2010. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.
ADP's results for the quarter were pretty much in line with our expectations. You have already read in our press release this morning that year-over-year comparisons in our key metrics did begin to ease in the second half of this fiscal year, as we had anticipated. Having said that, our results continue to be below ADP historical standard and still being negatively impacted, but to a lesser degree by the cumulative impact of the difficult economic environment over the last year and a half.
Let me now point out to you what I believe are the noteworthy items in the quarter. In Employer Services, we did continue to see increased market receptivity from companies willing to invest again in their business infrastructure. New business sales growth flattened in the quarter after six consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline. Having said that, sales were again mixed across the business units within Employer Services. Sales to larger companies in the U.S. are still lagging somewhat from a year ago, but sales to small and midsize companies are increasing and new business sales in both Europe and GlobalView are also increasing. I am becoming more encouraged. However, I'd like to remind everyone that there is a lag in the high end of the market between reported new sales and when those bookings actually turn into revenues due to the implementation periods required as you move up market to larger more complex clients. 
Additionally, as you may recall, last quarter, we did begin accelerating next year's sales force hiring to better position ADP for stronger sales growth, but this is also expected to be somewhat of a drag on earnings over the near term. So directionally, we'll take a period of time for revenues and in turn, profits to increase. But I am pleased that new business sales are moving in the right direction and that the growth of our sales team is meeting the increasing demands in the marketplace.
Let me move on to retention. You have heard from us about declining client retention levels dating back to the last quarter of fiscal '08 and continuing throughout the full year fiscal 2009. So I'm especially pleased that during this year's critical calendar year-end period, client retention levels improved 1.4 percentage points. 
ADP's revenues are still being negatively impacted by the losses of the last several quarters prior to this quarter, and we are still not yet quite back to the retention levels from several years ago. But again, the current quarter's increased retention is directionally a very positive sign. 
Our pays per control metric did decline 2.5% during the quarter, but the pace of the decline has certainly slowed. We continue to see some indications of stabilization in terms of employment levels across the U.S., and believe that the HIRE Act recently passed by Congress may provide a needed catalyst to employers that are on the cusp of making hiring decisions. And of course, ADP will assist its clients to enable them to realize the benefits from the provisions of the HIRE Act.
We also reported growth of nearly 5% in client fund balances during the quarter after reporting declines in the last five consecutive quarters. This group growth is primarily the result of higher bonus payments than we anticipated, an increase in state employment insurance rate and we also got a small lift from favorable Canadian foreign exchange rate.
Let me move on now to Dealer Services. The automotive market is obviously still under pressure, but continues its comeback with increases in U.S. car sales volume. Consumers have responded well to recent manufacture incentives, which I also believe is a positive indicator that the outlook is strengthening. Dealer Services continue to improve its North American share, with increased new business sales and strong competitive win-loss rate. 
As you may already know, GM and Chrysler have previously announced plans to reinstate a portion of the announced closed dealerships. And of course, some of those are ADP clients. We remain very comfortable that our earlier estimate of the revenue impact from these closings that we had previously shared with you will be no more than the $50 million of annualized loss revenues to Dealer Services, and will most likely be less than our estimate.
Additionally, increased consumer credit availability and pent-up demand appears to be positively impacting this marketplace. As a result, we are encouraged by the upswing in market indicators, which I believe bodes well for the future growth of the automotive marketplace. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our results."
126269,99166658,61312,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're on Slide 4. Revenue growth turned positive in the quarter, increasing 3% including a benefit of nearly two percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rates. Increased PEO pass-through revenues also co",1445,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're on Slide 4. Revenue growth turned positive in the quarter, increasing 3% including a benefit of nearly two percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rates. Increased PEO pass-through revenues also contributed two percentage points of growth, but lower client fund interest reduced growth by nearly one percentage point. Pretax earnings grew 1%, also assisted nearly two percentage points by favorable FX rates. There were a lot of swings in the quarter and I'd like to take you through the larger, more impactful items. 
As you can see in the detail of other income net in the press release, we received the distribution from the reserve funds compared with the charge we recorded in last year's third quarter. The current quarter comparison also benefited from lower severance costs and favorable foreign exchange rates. Negatively impacting the year-over-year comparisons was lower interest on client funds and increased investments in service and technology platforms.
Net earnings declined slightly as a result of the higher effective tax rate in the current quarter due to a favorable IRS audit adjustment in last year's third quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations declined 1% in the quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have spent nearly $280 million to purchase over 6.5 million shares of ADP stock.
You saw in our press release this morning that our cash balance was $2.1 billion at March 31, and I want to assure you that we are committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. We are on track to return at least $400 million of excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases for the full fiscal year. And this amount may be higher, depending on market conditions, as well as M&A activity. I don't want you to interpret that to mean we are changing our M&A strategy because we're not. We continue to look for small, close-to-the-core acquisitions, not large acquisitions that'll be dilutive over multiple years. Before I leave this slide, I'd like to review some of the expense categories with you.
You saw in this morning's release that operating expenses increased about $100 million during the quarter. More than half of this increase is from higher PEO pass-throughs and increased expense from the FX impact that I already mentioned. Additionally, bonus payouts are expected to be higher this year. We also spent more in systems development and programming during the quarter, primarily from the investments we've spoken with you about in our newest solutions, RUN and Workforce Now. Increased expenses from FX rates had an impact here as well.
Now let's turn to Slide 5. In Employer Services, total revenues grew 1% for the quarter, all organic. Revenue in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States declined 3% in the quarter and our beyond favorable revenues in the U.S. continue to grow with 8% growth in the quarter. ES' pretax margin was flat with the year ago. We're seeing the benefits from last year's fourth quarter restructuring and continued expense control, and the quarter also benefited from higher client fund balances. However, the continued investments in newest solutions and the recent acquisitions that we shared with you on February at our Annual Analyst Conference pressured the pretax margin. Additionally, fewer W-2s were processed.
Decline in pays per control on a same-store sales employment metric lessened this quarter at down 2.5% year-over-year. Losses also eased as evidenced by an increase of 1.4 percentage points in our client revenue retention metric. Gary spoke with you about the sales results a moment ago, so let's move on to the quarter's results for PEO and turn to Slide 6.
The PEO reported 15% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic. This growth was due to increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined as the benefits from last year's restructuring and continued expense control were offset by the year-over-year impact of onetime items in both the current and last year's third quarter and higher pass-throughs. Year-over-year for the third quarter, average worksite employees paid increased 5% to nearly $206,000.
Now let's turn to Slide 7. Dealer Services revenues declined as anticipated 3% for the quarter, 4% organic and continue to be negatively impacted by the cumulative effect of dealership closings, lower transactional revenues year-over-year and a decline in our software license fee revenue, which is recognized upon installation on our international business. U.S. pretax margin improved to 140 basis points due to lower headcount from the expense actions taken in last year's fourth fiscal quarter, as well as the excellent cost control measures that we have put in place. Dealer Services continued to increase its share of the consolidating market.
Now let's turn to Slide 8. This schedule shows the overall impact of the client funds portfolio extended investment strategy. At the top of the slide, in orange, you see the breakdown of both the average balances and the average interest yields for the short, extended and loan portfolio components, which corresponds to the orange portion of the pretax P&L impact on the bottom of the slide. The total pretax P&L impact for this section represents the P&L revenue line item interest on funds held for clients.
Now let's take a look at the quarterly results. Near the top right of the slide, you can see that average client fund balances were up $0.8 billion compared with the year-ago period. The cumulative impact of fewer pays, client losses and slower sales was more than offset by a combination of wage growth, particularly bonuses, increased data on employment insurance rates and the positive impact of Canadian foreign exchange rates during the quarter. 
Staying in this orange section, the average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 50 basis points to 3.2% this quarter due to the seasonally high level of client funds that were invested overnight at about 15 basis points. The decrease in the average yield more than offset the growth in client balances, resulting in a decline of $16 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L that you see near the bottom right of the slide. The impact from lower new purchase rates was most pronounced in the client short portfolio, due to the seasonally high level of client funds invested overnight at rates which was 70 basis points lower than last year, as the decline in market interest rates has continued since last year's third quarter.
Moving on to the blue section of the slide. Average borrowings were down this quarter and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings dropped about 10 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. Our third quarter is seasonally our highest client fund balance quarter, which makes it our lowest borrowing quarter. As a result, the impact in interest expense that you see near the bottom right of the slide was negligible. When you take into consideration the entire extended strategy, which also includes the corporate extended interest income shown in purple on the slide, the result was a $20 million pretax decrease or a decline of about 12%.
Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy forecast for fiscal 2010. We anticipate a decline in average client fund balances of 1% to 2%, which is an improvement from our previous forecast of a decline of 4% to 5%, as a result of increased balances related to wage growth and state unemployment tax rates. We are anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of about 3.6%, down about 40 basis points from fiscal 2009 and down slightly from our prior forecast.
Client fund interest revenues are expected to decline about $70 million, which is an improvement of about $5 million compared with our previous forecast. We continue to anticipate that average corporate extended balances will decline about $200 million. The average yield on the corporate extended investments is expected to be down 20 basis points, a slight decrease in yields from our prior forecast, which partially offset the benefit of the client fund interest revenue line. 
We continue to anticipate average borrowings will decline about $200 million and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings to be down about 90 basis points, so blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. Taking into consideration the pretax earnings impact of the overall extended investment strategy, including lower borrowing cost, we anticipate a decline of about $65 million in fiscal 2010 as you see at the bottom right of the slide.
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2010."

For fiscal 2010, we do anticipate total ADP revenues will be about flat with last year. And we anticipate achieving diluted EPS from continuing operations from around $2.36 to $2.38 compared with $2.38 in fiscal '09, excluding favorable income tax item and the divested Commercial business for both fiscal year. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are reflected in the forecast, though it remains clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending upon market condition.
For our reportable segments, we anticipate Employer Services revenues declining up to 1%, which reflects a decline in pays per control of about 4% on average for the full year and about flat client revenue retention. We anticipate 8% to 10% revenue growth in the PEO Services, driven by higher pass-through revenues. And we do anticipate slightly higher combined Employer Services and PEO sales worldwide for new business. We expect a decline in Dealer Services revenues of minus 3% to 4%, and we continue to anticipate no improvement in our segment pretax margin.
Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions. We have seen certainly some easing in the U.S. economic landscape, and the economy appears to be on its way to recovery. Our key business metrics are improving and we are focused on the right things for the long term. We continue to invest in our direct sales team, fundamentally adding new hires to accelerate new business sales growth. As we spoke with you at our annual analyst event back in February, we are also investing in newer technology platforms and solutions, such as RUN, for our low-end market, Workforce Now, our ASO offering, GlobalView and Streamline for our international and global clients. These are all designed to meet the needs of our clients and prospects. And we are continuing to invest incrementally in client service, which is critical for our continued success and to maintaining our market leadership position. These investments will, to some degree, pressure ADP's near-term outlook but are necessary for growth over the long term. Our business model remains solidly intact with highly recurring revenues, client life cycles of just under 10 years and excellent cash flow. Our cash position, as Chris mentioned earlier, is strong at $2.1 billion and our capital requirement are very low. 
I remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders, including ongoing share repurchases, obviously depending upon market conditions. ADP is a great company, and we continue to execute successfully against our five-point strategic growth program that we reviewed again with you back in February at our Analyst Conference. I said previously, that ADP is well positioned to leverage the inevitable recovery in the economy and it feels like the recovery is upon us. I remain optimistic about ADP's long-term opportunities for growth.

In fact, we're involved in some of the discussion in Washington today, in terms of trying to figure out exactly how the compliance and the regulation works for the new healthcare reform. Obviously, as the biggest mover of funds to the IRS and the biggest person in the client business across the U.S., ADP will certainly play a significant role there. It's still not 100% clear on healthcare reform. But clearly, payroll and HR systems have to be the system of record for all healthcare reform. And any kind of compliance, money movement, penalties and enforcement is going to have to be administered by companies like ADP and some of the reforms will clearly require regulatory compliance and reporting, both to employees and employers and to the IRS and in some cases, even on W-2. We're also selling healthcare, as you know, and particularly in the PEO, where we're qualified to sell healthcare in multiple states and could be properly positioned as a insurance pool because we provide healthcare to multiple companies in multiple states. I think it generally will be a positive for us, but I think it's going to take a period of, really, 12 months to have that kind of come to fruition and the regulation gets published, et cetera. On top of that, I think the HIRE Act is helping us across the board, probably more upmarket and then the mid-market, the down market. But in general, regulation compliance, penalties and higher taxes, although we may not like them personally, generally help ADP as a company."

Secondly, we are investing in the business, and particularly in sales and new technology and for the future of the business. I want to continue to do that because it's the right thing to do long term. And even as we recover in the new sales category, it does take some period of time for sales to turn to revenue. And ultimately, that's what drives organic growth and scale margin contribution. And so it's a little bit about timing.

You're seeing that now in the form of bonuses, and I think even though we don't see the data, what's happening in the general economy would indicate that people working more hours, people are starting to be hired. So we are seeing wage growth as well as internal employee growth in certain companies. On top of that, unemployment taxes are going to be up for a while because they typically lag a year on the way down, and they will continue to lag a year beyond on the way up because the states have to fill their coffers to pay for all this 10% on employment tax. And then on top of that, you're going to see higher taxes that will come out beyond that. So again, the one thing that we can control as a company is selling more payroll accounts as well as making sure that most of them use our tax filing and direct deposit services.

So we're still down on a two-year basis, almost 6% in pays per control. And so that's starting to flatten. It will still take another, call it, two, three maybe even four quarters before we get through that and get to a real flat to positive growth kind of area. Another statistic is not something that we really published is, we have a Screening and Selection business which has, I think, around 10,000, 15,000 clients, mostly in the mid and up market. And we're seeing the selection, the screening process is up in recent months 20% to 30% over prior periods. So that's a pretty good indication within our base, although not statistically fully accurate, it's more anecdotal. But clearly, people are starting to hire again. I think you see the balance increases that are indicative around increased hiring and bonuses. And certainly, the National Employment Report is getting closed to push in terms paid growth with positives in the service sector and the low end of the market. So again, I think all of the signs are good but it's pretty easy to be good compared to how bad it's been for a period of time. So I think this thing is through the bottom and going to start to ease up, but I think we have to be cautious, do not get ramp in enthusiasm as we go through this cycle because it's going to be a gradual upswing and it passed its prologue, it will take some period of time before we really start to see the benefit."

So there's a lot of focus on that metric. But the reality going forward is, it's driving sales in excess of the losses from retention. And if we get flat employment levels for a while, you're basically forgoing a traditional 1% to 2% or $20 million to $40 million. It's not that big a deal now that the bulk of the decline in pays is behind us. And I think that's sometimes misunderstood.

And so we clearly see the need for the ASO platform, but we're also concerned about left pocket and right pocket in terms of the sale scene. So far, we haven't seen any degradation in PEO sale based upon move to ASO. But we've been kind of careful about how we do that. We are pretty stringent on our underwriting criteria in the PEO more towards a white-collar, grey-collar kind of environment. And the ASO clearly opens up the category for people who don't need our underwriting requirements in the PEO as a natural candidate for the ASO operation or product set. So I think we've got it pretty much in hand, and I don't expect any significant drag on the PEO at least near term."

As I mentioned previously, the system of record for all of these kinds of compliance and money movement and penalties and enforcement has to either the payroll system or the HR benefit system, both of which arguably we are market leaders in both categories. And as the largest mover of funds and compliance to the IRS kind of by default, we think we've got to be one of the go-to-guys here, so to speak, in terms of enforcement. We also sell healthcare, and it clearly will drive more employers and employees to healthcare options. So we think it's clearly going to help us there. Secondly, the PEO is already a qualified health provider as a co-employer in 30 states or whatever the number is, something like that. So we think we're going to be well-positioned in terms of leads to the PEO for people who now want to offer healthcare. And in terms of reporting, a lot of it in the early reviews are going to have to be done either through employer reporting or W2 reporting in terms of the individual compliance and what happens to be there. We've also seen this respond very aggressively on the opportunity on the HIRE Act in the media as well as in some of our advertising. And I certainly think that's helping us in the marketplace. So clearly, we've got more definitive strategies to work on as these legs get finalized. And we'll try to be a little bit clearer on that as we go into fiscal '11 to kind of help you plan for the years ahead."

Number two is, I think we've done an excellent job in expanding the breadth of our product offering and keeping it current from a technology standpoint. A good example of that would be at the recent NADA, we released all the mobile platforms for all of our applications where service writers can write up service orders and do inquiries straight from a PDA or any of the mobile platforms that we may have. And pricing wise, it's certainly more competitive than it's been. But the bigger bundle of applications is also helping us from that standpoint.

So it's anybody's guess, it's hard to predict what's going to happen to interest rates. We're not in that business, but the laddering strategy we have kind of mitigates the downside of that rate volatility and we'll participate on the upside. The good news is, the bulk of the portfolio is still earning 3.6% of thereabouts and they extended in the long are up in the force and that's real return on equity. So we don't have the volatility, but it's going to take a while before interest rates get back to that 3 1/2% to 4% level. And in the meantime, our portfolio is earning those kinds of rate.

One is, in terms of the economic impact, the high end of the U.S. market was the one that was affected the most. And most people, either Chris's chair or my chair, have been very reticent on any kind of capital spending or outlays of cash or internal effort until there's more Christmas and clarity around is the recession really behind us and is it back to business as usual. So I think it's not surprising that the U.S. up market would be the slowest to recover. That being said, we also had some additional drag because over the last few quarters, we've had some previously booked business in our backlog that has either been deferred or canceled outright that we'd taken down. So you've got a slowing of new sale and a little bit accelerated rate of unwind in the previous backlog, because a lot of these accounts take a year to implement. So now as you -- as gross sales start to increase and the backlog become, I don't want to use the term clean, but more current than I think it will go back to the normal pattern, which should occur in the next quarter or two."

Appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about the fourth quarter and our fiscal year results.

I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about the fourth quarter and our fiscal year results. At the conclusion of my opening remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Chris Reidy to take you through the detailed results. When Chris is through, I'll return to provide you with our forecast for fiscal 2011. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.
As I look back over fiscal 2010, I am pleased that ADP's financial results were better than we initially anticipated as we entered the fiscal year. The economy did show some signs of stabilization early on in the fiscal year. Demand for ADP's solutions has clearly increased, and key business metrics began to improve during the second half of the fiscal year and, importantly, reached inflection point during this fourth quarter. Particularly noteworthy was the 25% growth in Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales for the fourth quarter, and I'm very pleased that all major business segments posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
This obviously is compared with a very weak quarter four of last year, but it is significant nonetheless, as we all know that positive growth in new bookings is important to longer-term revenue growth. Later in the presentation, we will review with you our revenue waterfall chart, and you will see the impact of these new bookings on revenue growth. 
For the year, new business sales grew 4%, and we had strong momentum heading into fiscal 2011. Having said that, we are still somewhat cautious about the over 1,000 pays National Accounts market. While we believe we are beyond the bottom, we are still cautious, as this market is typically where sales cycles take longer to rebound coming out of an economic downturn.
Turning to another important metric, I'm especially pleased that client revenue retention and Employer Services improved 160 basis points during the fourth quarter and 40 basis points for the full fiscal year, which was ahead of our expectations. Employment levels in the U.S. continue to stabilize, and our pays per control same-store sales U.S. employment metric turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter. And as a result, the full year decline of 3.4% was also slightly ahead of our expectations.
We also made some positive steps with important acquisitions that support our growth strategy to enter adjacent markets that leverage our core franchise. As you know, we did announce a few weeks ago that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Workscape, a leading provider of integrated benefit and compensation solutions and services. The addition of Workscape will clearly be complementary to our National Account Services benefits offering and will enable us to expand our market presence to compete more successfully for large and more complex benefit deals. Workscape’s average client has over 20,000 employees and, as you know, our current benefit solution is a better fit for companies with under 20,000 employees.
Workscape also offers compensation and performance management solutions. While we remain strongly committed to our partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand to deliver a full suite of integrated performance and learning management solutions, we do believe that the Workscape solution set will be a great complement to our existing talent management offerings and will give us an additional solution in our one-stop shop portfolio.
Let me move on to Dealer Services, where we have good positive momentum here as well. First, let me provide some highlights regarding our North American business. In June, we announced that Asbury, one of the large public dealer groups, has signed a letter of intent for ADP to become their sole dealer management systems solutions provider. Asbury has 80 dealer locations, representing 107 franchises, and plans to begin the transition to ADP's Dealer Management System towards the end of calendar 2010. We are currently in the final steps of negotiating the definitive agreement for that deal. Our position with large dealer groups continues to solidify. In fact, upon the signing of the Asbury contract, we will be the exclusive DMS [Dealer Management System] solutions provider for seven out of the top 10 largest dealer groups in the United States.
On the Dealer M&A front, we announced earlier this month that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Cobalt group, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions to automotive manufacturers and dealers in North America. This acquisition strongly supports Dealer’s long-term growth strategy, one key element being accelerating share of wallet by driving applications growth into our client base. With these new results, which we acquired a few years ago, Dealer Services was already making great strides in the fast-growing $7 billion digital marketing space with our Dealer clients.
Cobalt Solutions and expertise will only accelerate this endeavor, with their multi-tier marketing that simultaneously delivers content across all three marketing tiers; the first tier being the manufacturers’ marketing activities and Web sites; the second tier being regional level programs by large groups by manufacturer and their Web sites; and the dealers’ own advertising and Web sites. And while there are still many opportunities in North America, we plan in the future to utilize our global footprint to bring these solutions to our International markets as well.
Taking a look at Dealer’s International business, we continue to win share as a result of our strategic investments made in key markets such as Russia, China and the Middle East. Plus, as we mentioned at our February Financial Analyst Conference, we have signed an exclusive agreement with Chrysler China, representing nearly 80 dealerships. I'm pleased to announce that implementation has begun and we expect to have all the locations up and running over the next 12 to 18 months.
We continue to build relationships outside of Asia and Europe as well. One recently signed deal I'd like to reference is Unitrans. Unitrans is one of the top five South African-based dealer groups, operating nearly 100 dealerships, and the installations are currently underway. I'm also pleased to announce that, pending Kuwaiti government approval, we have signed an agreement to acquire PACC, a long-time distributor of our International Dealer Management System platform, which we call Autoline. They distribute in the Gulf States region and have been doing so since 1992. PACC is based in Kuwait, has an office in Dubai and currently has customers in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Lebanon and Jordan. PACC’s clients include most of the major OEM franchises represented in the region.
With that note, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our fourth quarter results."

And in the meantime, you can reach out to Debbie Morris with any follow-up questions you may have after the call.
For those of you following along, we're on Slide 4. For the year, total revenues increased 1% to $8.9 billion, including 0.8% from favorable foreign exchange rates. As you saw in our press release this morning, ADP's results for both years included favorable one-time tax items, so on the slide, we’ve shown both the reported results as well as the results excluding the tax item. Excluding these items, net earnings declined 1% compared with a year ago, and earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.01, as anticipated, to $2.37 on fewer [ph] shares outstanding. In our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, we increased our open market share repurchases during the fourth quarter, buying back 11.7 million shares for about $485 million. For the full year, ADP's share repurchases totaled 18.2 million shares for over $765 million. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5, Employer Services. As you'll see when we get to the Q4 discussion, ES’s revenue growth improved during the year and the full year ended flat with last year. As mentioned last quarter, the full year was impacted by fewer W-2s processed this year and pressure on implementation revenues in the high-end U.S. market. Revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States declined 4% for the year. Our beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. grew 6%, led by growth in our time and labor management solutions, COBRA and HR benefits. Revenues in our Retirement Services business also increased from the favorable impact of the increase in the stock market from a year ago, which resulted in higher retirement asset values, on which a portion of our fees are based.
ES's pretax margin declined 60 basis points from a year ago. In addition to the pressure from flat revenues, increased sales and service costs along with higher benefits and compensation expenses offset last year's restructuring benefits. As Gary mentioned earlier in his comments, we are pleased that our pays per control and retention metrics for the year were better than anticipated. Pays per control, our same-store sales employment metric for the U.S., declined 3.4% for the year compared with our expectation of a 4% decline. The number of pays in our International markets across Europe declined 3.2% compared with last year on a same store-sales basis. And the decline in Canada was 3.8%.
We are very pleased with the improvement in client retention of 0.4 percentage points for the year, and we ended the year back up around the 90% retention level which, as you know, is very strong. New business sales for ES and PEO Services combined were up 4% for the year. We were particularly pleased that the dollar value of new business sold returned to just over $1 billion for the year.
Now let's turn to Slide 6. The PEO grew revenues 11% for the year, all organic, primarily from increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined 30 basis points, primarily from higher benefits pass-through costs and the resulting overall price sensitivity. Year-over-year, average worksite employees paid increased 5% to 203,000.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, moving on to Dealer Services. Dealer Services revenues declined 3% for the year, 4% organically. Revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the cumulative effect of dealerships closing. In North America, core DMS and transaction-related revenues declined for the year, while beyond-the-core DMS revenues grew slightly, led by growth in IP telephony and networking, CRM and front office solutions. International revenues were impacted by lower software license fees due to client delays in implementation. Pretax margin declined 60 basis points. The pretax margin was negatively impacted by an intangible asset impairment charge of $7 million recorded in the first quarter relating to General Motors’ announced closure of its Saturn brand. Excluding this Saturn-related charge, Dealer’s full year pretax margin was flat as lower revenues, the impact of acquisition-related costs, increased benefits and compensation costs and higher sales expenses all offset last year's restructuring benefits. 
On the sales front, Dealer Services continue to gain market share and increased penetration of its layered applications compared with a year ago, with strong sales results and fourth quarter momentum.
Now let's turn to review of the fourth quarter results on Slide 8. We are pleased that total revenues increased 4% to $2.2 billion in the quarter, including 0.6% benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates. Similar to the earlier slide for the full year, we've shown both the reported EPS results as well as the corresponding results, excluding last year's fourth quarter tax benefit. Excluding these benefits, net earnings were down 9% and earnings per share from continuing operations declined 7% to $0.42, from $0.45 a share on fewer shares outstanding. As Gary mentioned, we reached an inflection point in most of our key metrics, and as a result, we made the decision to invest in the business. As a result, fourth quarter earnings and margins were impacted by the investments we made to drive the future growth of the company. While these additional expenses cause short-term earnings and margin pressure, they are necessary to support future growth.
Aside from incremental investments, we also incurred higher sales commissions from increased sales during the quarter. And to remind you, last year we told you that we froze [indiscernible] increases and management incentive compensation was also reduced, resulting in year-to-year grow-off [ph] of pressures. Earnings from our client funds portfolio also declined $13 million this quarter due to a decline in market interest rates, which I'll take you through in more detail in a few slides.
Let's turn to Slide 9 and go through the business unit results for the quarter. Employer Services revenues grew 4%, nearly all organic, for the quarter. We were pleased that revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in United States grew slightly in the quarter after five consecutive quarters of decline. Now beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. continue to grow, with 9% growth in the quarter driven by ASL, our BPO offering at the low end of the market, Retirement Services and other beyond payroll solutions such as Tax Credit Services. 
Yes, this fourth quarter pretax margin declined 290 basis points, driving much of the decline in total ADP margins. Higher revenues in the benefit from last year's restructuring were offset by incremental hiring and service, as well as in growth areas like ASO and International. The impact of higher sales commissions on increased sales, increased merit, benefit and compensation, the impact of acquisitions, investments and our products and infrastructure and additional sales headcount in [ph] programs. Pays per control, which is our same-store sales employment metric, increased 0.3% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year. Even though small, this is the first increase in this metric for eight quarters, back to the first quarter of fiscal 2009. 
The number of pays in Europe declined in the quarter compared with a year ago on a same store-sales basis. The decline appears to be stabilizing, but still has declined compared with the positive results we saw in the U.S. metric. I'll talk a little bit about how this difference in the pays trend impacts fiscal year '11 when we get to guidance.
Client revenue retention continued to improve with the notable increase of 1.6 percentage points in the quarter. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased that new business sales increased 25% in the quarter for ES and PEO. I'd also like to point out that this was the first quarter of positive sales growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. To remind you, new business sales represents the expected new annual recurring dollar value of these sales and our incremental recurring revenues to our existing recurring revenue base. [indiscernible] revenue waterfall chart with you in a few moments. 
For now, let's continue with the quarter's results, starting with Slide 10 in the PEO. PEO reported 13% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic, primarily from increased tax revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined 40 basis points, primarily due to higher benefit pass-through costs and the resulting overall price [indiscernible]. Year-over-year for the fourth quarter, average worksite employees increased 8.5% to over 210,000. Also, an important inflection point to call out is this exit rate exceeds the fiscal 2010 average gross rate of 5%.
Moving on to Dealer Services. Dealer Services revenues were flat for the fourth quarter. Dealer's pretax margin declined 310 basis points. Flat revenues, the impact of higher benefit and compensation costs, acquisition-related costs and incremental investments in the business to drive future growth were only partially offset by the benefit of last year's restructuring and additional cost control measures.
Now let's turn to Slide 12. Before we get into the results of our investment strategy for client funds, I want to remind everyone that the safety and liquidity of our client funds continue to be the foremost objectives of our strategy. Client funds are invested primarily in fixed income securities, in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines. To give you a quick understanding of how to read the schedule, as most of you have previously seen it, this schedule shows the overall impact of our client funds portfolio extended investment strategy, with average balances and interest yields shown on the top half of the slide, and the corresponding pretax P&L impact shown on the lower half, all color-coded.
Getting into the details for the year, the results were pretty much in line with our most recent forecast. Near the top right of the slide, you can see that average client fund balances were flat compared with the year ago period, at $15.2 billion. Fewer pays, hence lower Payroll sales, were offset by wage growth, increased state unemployment rate, net pay growth and a positive impact from Canadian foreign exchange rates. While average balances were flat, the average yields on the client funds portfolio declined 45 basis points to 3.6%, resulting in a decline of $67 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. The impact from lower new purchase rates was most pronounced in the client short portfolio, with the average yield earned with 110 basis points lower than last year, as the Fed funds rate declined to its current range of zero to 25 basis points late in our second quarter of fiscal 2009. 
The average corporate extended balances, the purple section on the slide, were down about $300 million compared to last year. The average yield on the corporate extended declined slightly, about 20 basis points. At the bottom of the slide, you see a $16 million negative impact to the P&L as a result of this decreased balance and the lower yield.
Average borrowings were down this year and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings dropped 90 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. The results was a $21 million positive impact to the P&L, offsetting the $21 million negative impact on the client short portfolio. When you take into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results was a $63 million P&L decrease before tax, or a decline of 9%, driven primarily by the year-over-year decline in market interest rates.
The bottom line $622 million of pretax dollars generated by this strategy for the year resulted in an overall yield of 4.1% compared with 4.5% last year; much more than the decline in the market interest rate.
Now let's turn to Slide 13, where I'll take you through the results to the fourth quarter. This schedule for the quarter is presented in the same format. For the quarter, average client fund balances were up $1.4 billion or 9% compared with the year-ago period, and the average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 50 basis points to 3.4%, resulting in a decline of $7 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. You can see the impact from lower new purchase rates were the same throughout the client portfolio, where the average yields earned were 30 basis points lower than last year. Average borrowings were down in the quarter. However, the average interest rate paid on those borrowings remained at a blended average rate of 0.3%. The results was a negligible impact to the P&L.
Now focusing your attention on the net P&L impact on the lower portion of the slide, taking into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results were a $13 million P&L decrease before tax, or a decline of 8% [ph]. The overall yield of the bottom line impact when calculated is 3.8% compared to 4.5% last year.
Now let's turn to Slide 14, where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy forecast for fiscal 2011. Before I get into discussing the detailed forecast, I'd like to update you on the credit quality of the portfolio. As was the case when we last showed you the details at our February Analyst Conference, currently about 85% of the portfolio remains AAA or AA-rated. Net unrealized gains, as of last week, are up another $30 million from the net gain of $711 million as of June 30, reported in this morning's earnings release. While the level of unrealized gains will change as the interest rate environment changes, the way to think about this is that the unrealized gains indicate we are holding security, yielding higher rates than current market rates. As part of our extended investment strategy, our intent is to hold these securities to maturity, and over time, earning is [ph] higher than the current market yield. 
I also would like to point out that this $700 million-plus net unrealized gain includes gross unrealized losses of less than $10 million.
Now for the fiscal 2011 forecast. This slide summarizes the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2011. It's important to keep in mind that 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment each year. We’re anticipating an increase in average client fund balances 2% to 3%, driven by wage growth, increased state unemployment rates and net pay growth. You'll recall that the fourth quarter average client balances grew 9%. I'll spend a quick minute to help you frame why we're not expecting that level of growth and balances to repeat in fiscal 2011.
Wage growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 followed the wage decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and was influenced by over 30% growth in bonuses and a return to merit increases in the current period. Fiscal 2011 wage growth, we are still assuming growth, but at a more modest rate. State unemployment rates also affect the growth rate. Fully effective rates increased dramatically at the onset of calendar 2010 by third fiscal quarter versus calendar '09. As states look to refill their coffers, [indiscernible] rate increases tend to lag in [ph] downturn. While we expect those increased rates to hold true during the beginning of fiscal 2011, we don’t get much average balance benefit as we [indiscernible] seasonally low balance period. When the calendar 2011 fully [ph] effective rate goes into effect, we're expecting another increase in rates, but not to the extents of the large increase we saw in 2010 versus 2009. That's having less of an impact on average balance growth in the back half of fiscal '11 versus what we saw in fiscal '10.
So we’re forecasting pays per control to be flat to up 0.5% for the year, and we're anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of 3.3% to 3.4%, down 20 to 30 basis points from fiscal 2010. We're anticipating a decline of $25 million to $30 million in client funds interest as the lower anticipated interest yield will more than offset the expected growth in balance. Average new purchase rates are expected to be around 275 basis points lower than the embedded rates on maturing investment. We're anticipating that average corporate extended balances will be flat to up to $100 million, and the average yield on the corporate extended will be down 30 to 40 basis points. We're anticipating average borrowings will also be flat to up $100 million, and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings will be up slightly in fiscal 2011 10 to 20 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% to 0.4%. 
Looking now at the lower right of the chart, you see that [indiscernible] anticipated decline in interest rate is expected to outweigh the benefit of growing average balances, resulting in a $35 million to $40 million decline in pretax earnings for fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011, we anticipate a decline of about 30 basis points from fiscal 2010's overall yield; a 4.1% on the net impact of the strategy. 
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2011."
126269,106899076,70386,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 15 for those of you following along. In our fiscal '11 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also not included the impact of the Workscape acquisition and Employer Services, nor",2026,"Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 15 for those of you following along. In our fiscal '11 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also not included the impact of the Workscape acquisition and Employer Services, nor Dealer’s Cobalt acquisition, as these transactions have not yet closed. We will provide an update on our first quarter earnings calls to take place in late October. 
As you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance, but I'd like to provide some thoughts on how we think about fiscal 2011. We do anticipate pressures early in the year, particularly with the first quarter year-over-year comparison. A year ago, we expected the same early pressures, but that was primarily due to comparison to a strong result early in fiscal 2009 before the economic downturn began to affect ADP. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate early pressures from the impact of reinstated merit increases, and the sales force and service hiring that took place over the second half of fiscal 2010. These are all terrific reasons for short-term earnings pressures because they are expected to yield positive long-term results.
Now let me take you through the forecast that you see here on the slide. We do anticipate an increase of 1% to 3% for total revenues and an increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 1% to 3%. This is compared to the $2.37 which excludes favorable tax items in fiscal 2010. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast, albeit it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, obviously depending upon market conditions. 
For our reportable segments, we anticipate an increase in Employer Service revenues of 1% to 3%, which reflects a range of flat to slightly up for both pays per control and client revenue retention.  We do expect more favorable pays per control comparables that are anticipated early in fiscal 2011 due to the significant declines that we saw in this metric early in fiscal 2010. I wanted to point out that while we are forecasting slightly positive pays per control for the clients on our AutoPay platform in the U.S., the pay trends in our International markets are still negative and are expected to offset the anticipated increase in the U.S. pays per control metric we guide to. So we'll have marginal net downward pressure in fiscal 2011 for ES worldwide.
We do anticipate up to 50 basis points of pretax margin improvement for Employer Services. We do anticipate low double-digit revenue growth for the PEO Services, with a decline in pretax margin due to higher benefit pass-through revenues. And we anticipate high single-digit growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the $1 billion sold in fiscal 2010. And for Dealer Services, we anticipate flat to slightly positive revenues and pretax margins.
So let's now move on to Slide 16, where I'll take you through our Employer Services and PEO Services revenue forecast, with a waterfall chart view. At ADP, the term sales and revenue are not synonymous. Sales is the dollar value of the 12 month annualized value of the recurring revenue portion of new bookings, whether it be a new client or an additional offering sold to an existing client. A sale turns into revenue in either the current fiscal year or the following fiscal year, depending on when it is sold and how quickly we get the client implemented. For smaller clients in SBS and the PEO, clients can be implemented in a matter of days or weeks. For larger clients and National Accounts, it can be six to 12 months, and even longer for GlobalView. Major Accounts falls in between SBS and National. 
[indiscernible] P&L revenue generated during the fiscal period, and includes both recurring, what we refer to internally as processing revenue, and nonrecurring, what we refer to internally as set-up or one-time revenue. Sales start to become recurring revenue once the client is installed.
With that as background, the drivers of Employer Services and PEO Services revenue growth are best depicted in a waterfall chart, as shown on this slide. If you start on the left side of the chart, you will see our fiscal '10 revenues, $7.8 billion when you add ES and PEO Services together. The second column represents sales. About 50% to 60% of fiscal '10's annual sales value becomes incremental revenue in fiscal 2011, and about 40% to 50% of fiscal '11 sales will become revenue in the current ‘11 year. These percentages are not digitally accurate, so we use 50% on this slide as a proxy for both years to give you an idea of how sales become incremental revenue over the course of two fiscal years.
As a percent of fiscal 2010 revenue, new sales from both '10 and '11 are expected to equate to roughly 13% new revenue growth. So if we were able to retain all our clients, we would generate recurring revenue from new sales of approximately $1.1 billion during fiscal '11. $1.1 billion on a denominator of $7.8 billion is 13%, being driven by sales and sales alone. We do have excellent retention rates and we’re anticipating an increase in fiscal '11 to about 90% on average. When we quote retention, it is a revenue retention metric. So if we retain 90% of our revenues, that means we lose about 10% a year, as depicted by the red bar on the chart.
Other revenue drivers include our annual price increase, which went into effect July 1, at about 0.6% of revenue. And our client funds balances of other revenues are expected to contribute somewhere between a slight drag of minus 1% to a positive 1% for revenue growth in fiscal 2011. You can see the impact from growth in client balances is expected to be minimal.
Other also includes the impact of pays per control which, while our guidance calls for an increase in fiscal '11, from which we expect to see a minimal revenue impact, don't forget the impact of an expected decline in the International pays, which somewhat offset our U.S. guidance number. We also expect to see a small positive incremental impact from acquisitions that have previously been closed. 
Beyond these items, other includes implementation revenues, frequencies of Payroll processing and other peripheral revenue streams like W-2s and reports, which have all been under pressure. Taking all these items into account, we are looking at 1%, plus or minus revenue growth, from other in fiscal year 2011. When you add it all up, you get 3% to 5% forecasted revenue growth for ES and the PEO combined. This is the sum of guidance of 1% to 3% for ES and low-double digits for the PEO. Remember, ES and the PEO are credited with interest revenue at a standard 4.5% on client balances in this segment view. The offset of approximately $180 million between the 4.5% credit to ES and the PEO and the actual rates, we expect to earn 3.3% and 3.4%, which Chris covered with you, shows up in the total company results.
Also, taking into account Dealer Services' relatively flat revenue guidance and the drag from foreign exchange rates, get you to the 1% to 3% total company forecast. While this chart depicts our fiscal '11 forecast, it's really how we think about our business model by adding to our recurring revenue base by growing sales, reducing losses, modest price increases and the normal intrinsic growth in pays and balances from our base. In more normal times, the sales growth bar, which show around 10% sales growth in both fiscal years, which would drive 16% to 17% revenue growth, and also growth in client balances pays, acquisitions and other driving an additional 3% to 5% revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 17, I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up to your questions. I think you can all tell on Slide 17, and you can tell from our tone on this call, that I'm particularly pleased overall with ADP's results for fiscal '10 and ADP's position in the market. While not up to historical ADP standards, our results were pretty darn good considering what was working against it: Namely, the cumulative impact of lost business and the rising unemployment levels in fiscal '09 and early fiscal '10; a record low interest rate environment; and also the hesitancy of large businesses, especially in the U.S., to invest capital spending for outsourcing decisions. 
What I do want to reiterate is that I believe we have reached an inflection point in most of our key metrics as we conclude 2010. New business sales posted strong growth of 25% in the quarter, ending the year up 4%. We obviously exited the year with excellent fourth quarter momentum, leading to our high single-digit sales growth forecast for fiscal '11.
ES client retention increased for the second consecutive quarter, ending the year up 40 basis points, and we're anticipating retention will be up flat to possibly another 40 basis points in the year ahead. Pays per control in the U.S. turned slightly positive in Q4, and we are expecting flat to half a point of growth in fiscal 2011. Growth in average worksite employees in the PEO accelerated in the fourth quarter and turned positive on a same store-sales basis. Revenue declines in our traditional Payroll and Payroll Tax Filing business has abated as growth, again, turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter, although ending the year down 4%. We continue to be keenly focused on growing our core Payroll and Tax revenues as part of our strategic growth program.
While these trends do show that things that are moving in the right direction, we still have incremental pressures in fiscal '11. Most significant are the $30 million to $40 million that Chris referenced, from the impact of declining market interest rates in [ph] our client funds portfolio. We do have increases and benefits and compensation expenses, and we do have an increase related to our investment in sales and service associates. And we do have expected continued declines in pays and our ES International business, albeit at a lesser rate than the declines we saw this year.
Most importantly, ADP's business model remains solidly intact. Because of ADP's highly recurring revenues, with strong and consistent cash flow generation, we were able to continue investing in our market-leading solutions during the economic downturn through both in-house development and, very importantly, M&A activity. As a result, ADP's value proposition is strong and we are winning in the marketplace. In turn, we have increased our investment in the sales force and in client service, ending fiscal 2010 with positive sales momentum and, importantly, improving service metrics. 
While we expect that pretax margins will be under some pressure near-term from these increased investments, you can see from our fiscal 2011 forecast that we do anticipate pretax margin expansion in our flagship Employer Services segment as the year progresses, which clearly speaks to the strength of the business model.
ADP's return on equity this year is over 22%, and we anticipate another year of comparable ROE in fiscal 2011. ADP's AAA credit rating reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the financial stability of our business model. ADP continues to execute against this five-point strategic growth program and remains focused on this strategy for the foreseeable future. You've also heard me say in previous quarters that it will take several years to reaccelerate the kind of growth we're really looking for coming out of the deep economic downturn we’ve just weathered. You've heard us talk about the investments we made in the business that have caused a short-term drag on earnings and margins, but I want to reiterate that these investments are key to reaccelerating our growth engine and are unquestionably the right things to do for the long-term health of the business.
With that, I'll conclude our opening remarks. And I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

And historically, we’ve tried to do some of both. And so I think to directly answer your question, it should improve margins and it's a question of how much we want to invest versus running to the bottom."

The other subtlety in Dealer that you probably don't realize that our retention rate at Dealer at the site level, the dealership level, is over 90%. But what happened over the last two years is our retention rates on revenue slid down into the low 80s because of all the out-of-business and dropped applications and shrinkage and the other applications that we had. So as that stabilizes and people stop dropping applications, start adding applications and dealership transactions start to increase, then we'll get as much lift in Dealer from higher retention as we will from new sales. So again, that would certainly be our plan that, that's the way it would play out as we get into ’12."

126269,106899076,72468,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Debbie, and good morning to everybody. Appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about the fourth quarter and our fiscal year results. At the conclusion of my opening remarks, I'll turn the call back",1107,"Thanks, Debbie, and good morning to everybody. Appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about the fourth quarter and our fiscal year results. At the conclusion of my opening remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Chris Reidy to take you through the detailed results. When Chris is through, I'll return to provide you with our forecast for fiscal 2011. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.
As I look back over fiscal 2010, I am pleased that ADP's financial results were better than we initially anticipated as we entered the fiscal year. The economy did show some signs of stabilization early on in the fiscal year. Demand for ADP's solutions has clearly increased, and key business metrics began to improve during the second half of the fiscal year and, importantly, reached inflection point during this fourth quarter. Particularly noteworthy was the 25% growth in Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales for the fourth quarter, and I'm very pleased that all major business segments posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
This obviously is compared with a very weak quarter four of last year, but it is significant nonetheless, as we all know that positive growth in new bookings is important to longer-term revenue growth. Later in the presentation, we will review with you our revenue waterfall chart, and you will see the impact of these new bookings on revenue growth. 
For the year, new business sales grew 4%, and we had strong momentum heading into fiscal 2011. Having said that, we are still somewhat cautious about the over 1,000 pays National Accounts market. While we believe we are beyond the bottom, we are still cautious, as this market is typically where sales cycles take longer to rebound coming out of an economic downturn.
Turning to another important metric, I'm especially pleased that client revenue retention and Employer Services improved 160 basis points during the fourth quarter and 40 basis points for the full fiscal year, which was ahead of our expectations. Employment levels in the U.S. continue to stabilize, and our pays per control same-store sales U.S. employment metric turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter. And as a result, the full year decline of 3.4% was also slightly ahead of our expectations.
We also made some positive steps with important acquisitions that support our growth strategy to enter adjacent markets that leverage our core franchise. As you know, we did announce a few weeks ago that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Workscape, a leading provider of integrated benefit and compensation solutions and services. The addition of Workscape will clearly be complementary to our National Account Services benefits offering and will enable us to expand our market presence to compete more successfully for large and more complex benefit deals. Workscape’s average client has over 20,000 employees and, as you know, our current benefit solution is a better fit for companies with under 20,000 employees.
Workscape also offers compensation and performance management solutions. While we remain strongly committed to our partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand to deliver a full suite of integrated performance and learning management solutions, we do believe that the Workscape solution set will be a great complement to our existing talent management offerings and will give us an additional solution in our one-stop shop portfolio.
Let me move on to Dealer Services, where we have good positive momentum here as well. First, let me provide some highlights regarding our North American business. In June, we announced that Asbury, one of the large public dealer groups, has signed a letter of intent for ADP to become their sole dealer management systems solutions provider. Asbury has 80 dealer locations, representing 107 franchises, and plans to begin the transition to ADP's Dealer Management System towards the end of calendar 2010. We are currently in the final steps of negotiating the definitive agreement for that deal. Our position with large dealer groups continues to solidify. In fact, upon the signing of the Asbury contract, we will be the exclusive DMS [Dealer Management System] solutions provider for seven out of the top 10 largest dealer groups in the United States.
On the Dealer M&A front, we announced earlier this month that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Cobalt group, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions to automotive manufacturers and dealers in North America. This acquisition strongly supports Dealer’s long-term growth strategy, one key element being accelerating share of wallet by driving applications growth into our client base. With these new results, which we acquired a few years ago, Dealer Services was already making great strides in the fast-growing $7 billion digital marketing space with our Dealer clients.
Cobalt Solutions and expertise will only accelerate this endeavor, with their multi-tier marketing that simultaneously delivers content across all three marketing tiers; the first tier being the manufacturers’ marketing activities and Web sites; the second tier being regional level programs by large groups by manufacturer and their Web sites; and the dealers’ own advertising and Web sites. And while there are still many opportunities in North America, we plan in the future to utilize our global footprint to bring these solutions to our International markets as well.
Taking a look at Dealer’s International business, we continue to win share as a result of our strategic investments made in key markets such as Russia, China and the Middle East. Plus, as we mentioned at our February Financial Analyst Conference, we have signed an exclusive agreement with Chrysler China, representing nearly 80 dealerships. I'm pleased to announce that implementation has begun and we expect to have all the locations up and running over the next 12 to 18 months.
We continue to build relationships outside of Asia and Europe as well. One recently signed deal I'd like to reference is Unitrans. Unitrans is one of the top five South African-based dealer groups, operating nearly 100 dealerships, and the installations are currently underway. I'm also pleased to announce that, pending Kuwaiti government approval, we have signed an agreement to acquire PACC, a long-time distributor of our International Dealer Management System platform, which we call Autoline. They distribute in the Gulf States region and have been doing so since 1992. PACC is based in Kuwait, has an office in Dubai and currently has customers in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Lebanon and Jordan. PACC’s clients include most of the major OEM franchises represented in the region.
With that note, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our fourth quarter results."

For those of you following along, we're on Slide 4. For the year, total revenues increased 1% to $8.9 billion, including 0.8% from favorable foreign exchange rates. As you saw in our press release this morning, ADP's results for both years included favorable one-time tax items, so on the slide, we’ve shown both the reported results as well as the results excluding the tax item. Excluding these items, net earnings declined 1% compared with a year ago, and earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.01, as anticipated, to $2.37 on fewer [ph] shares outstanding. In our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, we increased our open market share repurchases during the fourth quarter, buying back 11.7 million shares for about $485 million. For the full year, ADP's share repurchases totaled 18.2 million shares for over $765 million. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5, Employer Services. As you'll see when we get to the Q4 discussion, ES’s revenue growth improved during the year and the full year ended flat with last year. As mentioned last quarter, the full year was impacted by fewer W-2s processed this year and pressure on implementation revenues in the high-end U.S. market. Revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States declined 4% for the year. Our beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. grew 6%, led by growth in our time and labor management solutions, COBRA and HR benefits. Revenues in our Retirement Services business also increased from the favorable impact of the increase in the stock market from a year ago, which resulted in higher retirement asset values, on which a portion of our fees are based.
ES's pretax margin declined 60 basis points from a year ago. In addition to the pressure from flat revenues, increased sales and service costs along with higher benefits and compensation expenses offset last year's restructuring benefits. As Gary mentioned earlier in his comments, we are pleased that our pays per control and retention metrics for the year were better than anticipated. Pays per control, our same-store sales employment metric for the U.S., declined 3.4% for the year compared with our expectation of a 4% decline. The number of pays in our International markets across Europe declined 3.2% compared with last year on a same store-sales basis. And the decline in Canada was 3.8%.
We are very pleased with the improvement in client retention of 0.4 percentage points for the year, and we ended the year back up around the 90% retention level which, as you know, is very strong. New business sales for ES and PEO Services combined were up 4% for the year. We were particularly pleased that the dollar value of new business sold returned to just over $1 billion for the year.
Now let's turn to Slide 6. The PEO grew revenues 11% for the year, all organic, primarily from increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined 30 basis points, primarily from higher benefits pass-through costs and the resulting overall price sensitivity. Year-over-year, average worksite employees paid increased 5% to 203,000.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, moving on to Dealer Services. Dealer Services revenues declined 3% for the year, 4% organically. Revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the cumulative effect of dealerships closing. In North America, core DMS and transaction-related revenues declined for the year, while beyond-the-core DMS revenues grew slightly, led by growth in IP telephony and networking, CRM and front office solutions. International revenues were impacted by lower software license fees due to client delays in implementation. Pretax margin declined 60 basis points. The pretax margin was negatively impacted by an intangible asset impairment charge of $7 million recorded in the first quarter relating to General Motors’ announced closure of its Saturn brand. Excluding this Saturn-related charge, Dealer’s full year pretax margin was flat as lower revenues, the impact of acquisition-related costs, increased benefits and compensation costs and higher sales expenses all offset last year's restructuring benefits. 
On the sales front, Dealer Services continue to gain market share and increased penetration of its layered applications compared with a year ago, with strong sales results and fourth quarter momentum.
Now let's turn to review of the fourth quarter results on Slide 8. We are pleased that total revenues increased 4% to $2.2 billion in the quarter, including 0.6% benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates. Similar to the earlier slide for the full year, we've shown both the reported EPS results as well as the corresponding results, excluding last year's fourth quarter tax benefit. Excluding these benefits, net earnings were down 9% and earnings per share from continuing operations declined 7% to $0.42, from $0.45 a share on fewer shares outstanding. As Gary mentioned, we reached an inflection point in most of our key metrics, and as a result, we made the decision to invest in the business. As a result, fourth quarter earnings and margins were impacted by the investments we made to drive the future growth of the company. While these additional expenses cause short-term earnings and margin pressure, they are necessary to support future growth.
Aside from incremental investments, we also incurred higher sales commissions from increased sales during the quarter. And to remind you, last year we told you that we froze merit increases and management incentive compensation was also reduced, resulting in year-to-year grow-off [ph] of pressures. Earnings from our client funds portfolio also declined $13 million this quarter due to a decline in market interest rates, which I'll take you through in more detail in a few slides.
Let's turn to Slide 9 and go through the business unit results for the quarter. Employer Services revenues grew 4%, nearly all organic, for the quarter. We were pleased that revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in United States grew slightly in the quarter after five consecutive quarters of decline. Now beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. continue to grow, with 9% growth in the quarter driven by ASL, our BPO offering at the low end of the market, Retirement Services and other beyond payroll solutions such as Tax Credit Services. 
ES's fourth quarter pretax margin declined 290 basis points, driving much of the decline in total ADP margins. Higher revenues and the benefit from last year's restructuring were offset by incremental hiring and service as well as in growth areas like ASO and International; the impact of higher sales commissions on increased sales; increased merit, benefit and compensation; the impact of acquisitions, investments and our products and infrastructure; and additional sales, headcount and programs. Pays per control, which is our same-store sales employment metric, increased 0.3% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year. Even though small, this is the first increase in this metric for eight quarters, back to the first quarter of fiscal 2009. 
The number of pays in Europe declined in the quarter compared with a year ago on a same store-sales basis. The decline appears to be stabilizing, but still a decline compared with the positive results we saw in the U.S. metric. I'll talk a little bit about how this difference in the pays trend impacts fiscal year '11 when we get to guidance.
Client revenue retention continued to improve with the notable increase of 1.6 percentage points in the quarter. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased that new business sales increased 25% in the quarter for ES and PEO. I'd also like to point out that this was the first quarter of positive sales growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. To remind you, new business sales represents the expected new annual recurring dollar value of these sales and our incremental recurring revenues to our existing recurring revenue base. We’ll revenue waterfall chart with you in a few moments. 
For now, let's continue with the quarter's results, starting with Slide 10 in the PEO. PEO reported 13% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic, primarily from increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees. Pretax margin declined 40 basis points, primarily due to higher benefit pass-through costs and the resulting overall price sensitivity. Year-over-year for the fourth quarter, average worksite employees increased 8.5% to over 210,000. Also, an important inflection point to call out is this exit rate exceeds the fiscal 2010 average growth rate of 5%.
Moving on to Dealer Services. Dealer Services revenues were flat for the fourth quarter. Dealer's pretax margin declined 310 basis points. Flat revenues, the impact of higher benefit and compensation costs, acquisition-related costs and incremental investments in the business to drive future growth were only partially offset by the benefit of last year's restructuring and additional cost control measures.
Now let's turn to Slide 12. Before we get into the results of our investment strategy for client funds, I want to remind everyone that the safety and liquidity of our client funds continue to be the foremost objectives of our strategy. Client funds are invested primarily in fixed income securities in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines. To give you a quick understanding of how to read the schedule, as most of you have previously seen it, this schedule shows the overall impact of our client funds portfolio extended investment strategy, with average balances and interest yields shown on the top half of the slide, and the corresponding pretax P&L impact shown on the lower half, all color-coded.
Getting into the details for the year, the results were pretty much in line with our most recent forecast. Near the top right of the slide, you can see that average client fund balances were flat compared with the year-ago period at $15.2 billion. Fewer pays, hence lower Payroll sales, were offset by wage growth, increased state unemployment rates, net pay growth and a positive impact from Canadian foreign exchange rates. While average balances were flat, the average yields on the client funds portfolio declined 45 basis points to 3.6%, resulting in a decline of $67 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. The impact from lower new purchase rates was most pronounced in the client short portfolio, with the average yield earned with 110 basis points lower than last year, as the Fed funds rate declined to its current range of zero to 25 basis points late in our second quarter of fiscal 2009. 
The average corporate extended balances, the purple section on the slide, were down about $300 million compared to last year. The average yield on the corporate extended declined slightly, about 20 basis points. At the bottom of the slide, you see a $16 million negative impact to the P&L as a result of this decreased balance and the lower yield.
Average borrowings were down this year and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings dropped 90 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.2%. The results was a $21 million positive impact to the P&L, offsetting the $21 million negative impact on the client short portfolio. When you take into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results was a $63 million P&L decrease before tax, or a decline of 9%, driven primarily by the year-over-year decline in market interest rates.
The bottom line $622 million of pretax dollars generated by this strategy for the year resulted in an overall yield of 4.1% compared with 4.5% last year; much more than the decline in the market interest rate.
Now let's turn to Slide 13, where I'll take you through the results to the fourth quarter. This schedule for the quarter is presented in the same format. For the quarter, average client fund balances were up $1.4 billion or 9% compared with the year-ago period, and the average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 50 basis points to 3.4%, resulting in a decline of $7 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. You can see the impact from lower new purchase rates were the same throughout the client portfolio, where the average yields earned were 30 basis points lower than last year. Average borrowings were down in the quarter. However, the average interest rate paid on those borrowings remained at a blended average rate of 0.3%. The results was a negligible impact to the P&L.
Now focusing your attention on the net P&L impact on the lower portion of the slide, taking into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results were a $13 million P&L decrease before tax or a decline of 8%. The overall yield of the bottom line impact when calculated is 3.8% compared to 4.5% last year.
Now let's turn to Slide 14, where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy forecast for fiscal 2011. Before I get into discussing the detailed forecast, I'd like to update you on the credit quality of the portfolio. As was the case when we last showed you the details at our February Analyst Conference, currently about 85% of the portfolio remains AAA or AA-rated. Net unrealized gains, as of last week, are up another $30 million from the net gain of $711 million as of June 30, reported in this morning's earnings release. While the level of unrealized gains will change as the interest rate environment changes, the way to think about this is that the unrealized gains indicate we are holding security, yielding higher rates than current market rates. As part of our extended investment strategy, our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and over time, earn these [ph] higher than the current market yield. 
I also would like to point out that this $700 million-plus net unrealized gain includes gross unrealized losses of less than $10 million.
Now for the fiscal 2011 forecast. This slide summarizes the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2011. It's important to keep in mind that 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment each year. We’re anticipating an increase in average client fund balances of 2% to 3%, driven by wage growth, increased state unemployment rates and net pay growth. You'll recall that the fourth quarter average client balances grew 9%. I'll spend a quick minute to help you frame why we're not expecting that level of growth and balances to repeat in fiscal 2011.
Wage growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 followed the wage decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and was influenced by over 30% growth in bonuses and a return to merit increases in the current period. Fiscal 2011 wage growth, we are still assuming growth, but at a more modest rate. State unemployment rates also affect the growth rate. SUI effective rates increased dramatically at the onset of calendar 2010 by third fiscal quarter versus calendar '09. As states look to refill their coffers, SUI rate increases tend to lag a downturn. While we expect those increased rates to hold true during the beginning of fiscal 2011, we don’t get much average balance benefit as this is our seasonally low balance period. When the calendar 2011 SUI effective rate goes into effect, we're expecting another increase in rates, but not to the extent of the large increase we saw in 2010 versus 2009. That's having less of an impact on average balance growth in the back half of fiscal '11 versus what we saw in fiscal '10.
So we’re forecasting pays per control to be flat to up 0.5% for the year, and we're anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of 3.3% to 3.4%, down 20 to 30 basis points from fiscal 2010. We're anticipating a decline of $25 million to $30 million in client funds interest as the lower anticipated interest yield will more than offset the expected growth in balance. Average new purchase rates are expected to be around 275 basis points lower than the embedded rates on maturing investment. We're anticipating that average corporate extended balances will be flat to up to $100 million, and the average yield on the corporate extended will be down 30 to 40 basis points. We're anticipating average borrowings will also be flat to up $100 million, and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings will be up slightly in fiscal 2011 10 to 20 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% to 0.4%. 
Looking now at the lower right of the chart, you see that the continued anticipated decline in interest rates is expected to outweigh the benefit of growing average balances, resulting in a $35 million to $40 million decline in pretax earnings for fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011, we anticipate a decline of about 30 basis points from fiscal 2010's overall yield of 4.1% from the net impact of the strategy. 
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2011."
126269,106899076,72468,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 15 for those of you following along. In our fiscal '11 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also not included the impact of the Workscape acquisition and Employer Services, nor",2026,"Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 15 for those of you following along. In our fiscal '11 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also not included the impact of the Workscape acquisition and Employer Services, nor Dealer’s Cobalt acquisition, as these transactions have not yet closed. We will provide an update on our first quarter earnings call to take place in late October. 
As you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance, but I'd like to provide some thoughts on how we think about fiscal 2011. We do anticipate pressures early in the year, particularly with the first quarter year-over-year comparison. A year ago, we expected the same early pressures, but that was primarily due to comparison to a strong result early in fiscal 2009 before the economic downturn began to affect ADP. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate early pressures from the impact of reinstated merit increases, and the sales force and service hiring that took place over the second half of fiscal 2010. These are all terrific reasons for short-term earnings pressures because they are expected to yield positive long-term results.
Now let me take you through the forecast that you see here on the slide. We do anticipate an increase of 1% to 3% for total revenues and an increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 1% to 3%. This is compared to the $2.37 which excludes favorable tax items in fiscal 2010. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast, albeit it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, obviously depending upon market conditions. 
For our reportable segments, we anticipate an increase in Employer Service revenues of 1% to 3%, which reflects a range of flat to slightly up for both pays per control and client revenue retention.  We do expect more favorable pays per control comparables that are anticipated early in fiscal 2011 due to the significant declines that we saw in this metric early in fiscal 2010. I wanted to point out that while we are forecasting slightly positive pays per control for the clients on our AutoPay platform in the U.S., the pay trends in our International markets are still negative and are expected to offset the anticipated increase in the U.S. pays per control metric we guide to. So we'll have marginal net downward pressure in fiscal 2011 for ES worldwide.
We do anticipate up to 50 basis points of pretax margin improvement for Employer Services. We do anticipate low double-digit revenue growth for the PEO Services, with a decline in pretax margin due to higher benefit pass-through revenues. And we anticipate high single-digit growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the $1 billion sold in fiscal 2010. And for Dealer Services, we anticipate flat to slightly positive revenues and pretax margins.
So let's now move on to Slide 16, where I'll take you through our Employer Services and PEO Services revenue forecast, with a waterfall chart view. At ADP, the term sales and revenue are not synonymous. Sales is the dollar value of the 12 month annualized value of the recurring revenue portion of new bookings, whether it be a new client or an additional offering sold to an existing client. A sale turns into revenue in either the current fiscal year or the following fiscal year, depending on when it is sold and how quickly we get the client implemented. For smaller clients in SBS and the PEO, clients can be implemented in a matter of days or weeks. For larger clients and National Accounts, it can be six to 12 months, and even longer for GlobalView. Major Accounts falls in between SBS and National. 
[indiscernible] P&L revenue generated during the fiscal period, and includes both recurring, what we refer to internally as processing revenue, and nonrecurring, what we refer to internally as set-up or one-time revenue. Sales start to become recurring revenue once the client is installed.
With that as background, the drivers of Employer Services and PEO Services revenue growth are best depicted in a waterfall chart, as shown on this slide. If you start on the left side of the chart, you will see our fiscal '10 revenues, $7.8 billion when you add ES and PEO Services together. The second column represents sales. About 50% to 60% of fiscal '10's annual sales value becomes incremental revenue in fiscal 2011, and about 40% to 50% of fiscal '11 sales will become revenue in the current ‘11 year. These percentages are not digitally accurate, so we use 50% on this slide as a proxy for both years to give you an idea of how sales become incremental revenue over the course of two fiscal years.
As a percent of fiscal 2010 revenue, new sales from both '10 and '11 are expected to equate to roughly 13% new revenue growth. So if we were able to retain all our clients, we would generate recurring revenue from new sales of approximately $1.1 billion during fiscal '11. $1.1 billion on a denominator of $7.8 billion is 13%, being driven by sales and sales alone. We do have excellent retention rates and we’re anticipating an increase in fiscal '11 to about 90% on average. When we quote retention, it is a revenue retention metric. So if we retain 90% of our revenues, that means we lose about 10% a year, as depicted by the red bar on the chart.
Other revenue drivers include our annual price increase, which went into effect July 1, at about 0.6% of revenue. And our client funds balances of other revenues are expected to contribute somewhere between a slight drag of minus 1% to a positive 1% for revenue growth in fiscal 2011. You can see the impact from growth in client balances is expected to be minimal.
Other also includes the impact of pays per control which, while our guidance calls for an increase in fiscal '11, from which we expect to see a minimal revenue impact, don't forget the impact of an expected decline in the International pays, which somewhat offset our U.S. guidance number. We also expect to see a small positive incremental impact from acquisitions that have previously been closed. 
Beyond these items, other includes implementation revenues, frequencies of Payroll processing and other peripheral revenue streams like W-2s and reports, which have all been under pressure. Taking all these items into account, we are looking at 1%, plus or minus revenue growth, from other in fiscal year 2011. When you add it all up, you get 3% to 5% forecasted revenue growth for ES and the PEO combined. This is the sum of guidance of 1% to 3% for ES and low-double digits for the PEO. Remember, ES and the PEO are credited with interest revenue at a standard 4.5% on client balances in this segment view. The offset of approximately $180 million between the 4.5% credit to ES and the PEO and the actual rates, we expect to earn 3.3% and 3.4%, which Chris covered with you, shows up in the total company results.
Also, taking into account Dealer Services' relatively flat revenue guidance and the drag from foreign exchange rates, get you to the 1% to 3% total company forecast. While this chart depicts our fiscal '11 forecast, it's really how we think about our business model by adding to our recurring revenue base by growing sales, reducing losses, modest price increases and the normal intrinsic growth in pays and balances from our base. In more normal times, the sales growth bar, which show around 10% sales growth in both fiscal years, which would drive 16% to 17% revenue growth, and also growth in client balances pays, acquisitions and other driving an additional 3% to 5% revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 17, I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up to your questions. I think you can all tell on Slide 17, and you can tell from our tone on this call, that I'm particularly pleased overall with ADP's results for fiscal '10 and ADP's position in the market. While not up to historical ADP standards, our results were pretty darn good considering what was working against it: Namely, the cumulative impact of lost business and the rising unemployment levels in fiscal '09 and early fiscal '10; a record low interest rate environment; and also the hesitancy of large businesses, especially in the U.S., to invest capital spending for outsourcing decisions. 
What I do want to reiterate is that I believe we have reached an inflection point in most of our key metrics as we conclude 2010. New business sales posted strong growth of 25% in the quarter, ending the year up 4%. We obviously exited the year with excellent fourth quarter momentum, leading to our high single-digit sales growth forecast for fiscal '11.
ES client retention increased for the second consecutive quarter, ending the year up 40 basis points, and we're anticipating retention will be up flat to possibly another 40 basis points in the year ahead. Pays per control in the U.S. turned slightly positive in Q4, and we are expecting flat to half a point of growth in fiscal 2011. Growth in average worksite employees in the PEO accelerated in the fourth quarter and turned positive on a same store-sales basis. Revenue declines in our traditional Payroll and Payroll Tax Filing business has abated as growth, again, turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter, although ending the year down 4%. We continue to be keenly focused on growing our core Payroll and Tax revenues as part of our strategic growth program.
While these trends do show that things that are moving in the right direction, we still have incremental pressures in fiscal '11. Most significant are the $30 million to $40 million that Chris referenced, from the impact of declining market interest rates in [ph] our client funds portfolio. We do have increases and benefits and compensation expenses, and we do have an increase related to our investment in sales and service associates. And we do have expected continued declines in pays and our ES International business, albeit at a lesser rate than the declines we saw this year.
Most importantly, ADP's business model remains solidly intact. Because of ADP's highly recurring revenues, with strong and consistent cash flow generation, we were able to continue investing in our market-leading solutions during the economic downturn through both in-house development and, very importantly, M&A activity. As a result, ADP's value proposition is strong and we are winning in the marketplace. In turn, we have increased our investment in the sales force and in client service, ending fiscal 2010 with positive sales momentum and, importantly, improving service metrics. 
While we expect that pretax margins will be under some pressure near-term from these increased investments, you can see from our fiscal 2011 forecast that we do anticipate pretax margin expansion in our flagship Employer Services segment as the year progresses, which clearly speaks to the strength of the business model.
ADP's return on equity this year is over 22%, and we anticipate another year of comparable ROE in fiscal 2011. ADP's AAA credit rating reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the financial stability of our business model. ADP continues to execute against this five-point strategic growth program and remains focused on this strategy for the foreseeable future. You've also heard me say in previous quarters that it will take several years to reaccelerate the kind of growth we're really looking for coming out of the deep economic downturn we’ve just weathered. You've heard us talk about the investments we made in the business that have caused a short-term drag on earnings and margins, but I want to reiterate that these investments are key to reaccelerating our growth engine and are unquestionably the right things to do for the long-term health of the business.
With that, I'll conclude our opening remarks. And I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

The other subtlety in Dealer that you probably don't realize that our retention rate at Dealer at the site level, the dealership level, is over 90%.

I'll begin today's call with some opening comments about our first quarter results, then I'll turn the call over to Chris Reidy, our CFO, to take you through the detailed results. After which, I'll return to provide you with an updated forecast for fiscal '11. And before we take your questions, I'll also provide some concluding remarks. 
Overall, I am quite pleased with ADP's first quarter results for fiscal 2011 which, as you can see from the release, were better than anticipated. You recall as we exited last fiscal year, we did reach positive inflection points in our key business metrics. I'm pleased to report for the most part, that those positive trends continued into this first quarter of '11. 
Let's start with new business sales which, as you saw in this morning's release, were flat to last year. However, results were different by market segment. In the Small Business marketplace, including the PEO [Professional Employer Organization], we posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year. I believe our investments in our new RUN products and in our sales force has had a very positive impact in this market. Having said that, we are somewhat cautious as we move up market. The pipeline for new business sales is good, but the sale cycles remain relatively long and new business sales in the medium-large company markets were slightly below last year. New business sales in our international business were up nicely, excluding GlobalView sales, which declined year-over-year. We closed three quite large GlobalView transactions in the first quarter of last year, which impacted the total sales comparison from last year by a couple of points. All in all, we are still comfortable with our full year forecast for high single-digit new business sales growth for the year.
As we look at retention, I believe that the improved economy, coupled with the technology investments we have made in our service solutions and the significant increases in client service associates, helped drive this notable improvement in client revenue retention during the quarter. This increase of 1.7 percentage points clearly exceeded our expectations. And for the record, is the largest quarterly increase we have seen in this metric in about five years. 
Employment levels in the U.S. have stabilized and our pays per control same-store sales employment metric was actually up 1.7% in the quarter and also ahead of our expectations. Average client funds balances increased 9% and were higher than anticipated driven by higher wage growth, growth in pays for control and increased SUI tax. It's also noteworthy that the number of worksite employees paid in our PEO grew 9.5% in the quarter. I am very pleased with the acquisitions we closed in the first quarter and the pipeline of potential transactions is also quite good. To remind you, our M&A strategy is primarily focused on entering adjacent markets that leverage our core franchise as well as competitive roll-ups within our existing product portfolio. We are currently in the process of integrating the two largest transactions we completed this quarter: Workscape and Employer Services and Cobalt and Dealer Services, and continue to be quite pleased as we go deeper with each business. 
Moving onto Dealer Services. The automotive landscape is relatively stable, and dealership closings have greatly subsided. Revenues in Dealer, however, continued to be negatively impacted by the carry-forward effects of dealership closings over the past year, but fewer current closings bodes well for continued improvement in the year ahead. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our results."

We are very pleased as total revenues increased 6% to $2.2 billion in the quarter, including acquisitions. Revenues were negatively impacted nearly 1% from unfavorable foreign exchange rates as the dollar strengthened during the quarter compared with last year. However, our forecast assumes that foreign exchange impacts will turn favorable during the second half of the year and have no impact on the full year as compared to a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Pretax and net earnings were down 2% and as anticipated, first quarter earnings and margins were lower from the investments we made over the second half of fiscal 2010 to drive growth. But I'd also like to remind you that we had frozen merit increases until the fourth quarter of last year, which also resulted in negative year-to-year grow over comparisons.
Earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56 a share were flat with a year ago on fewer shares outstanding. And before we leave this slide, I'll also like to speak briefly about ADP's cash balance. As you know, our intent is to target the cash balance toward the $1 billion level at a minimum. We moved closer to this level during the first quarter by closing three strategic acquisitions for $475 million in net cash, and we bought back 1.2 million shares for about $50 million. As a result, our cash and marketable securities balance was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $1.8 billion at June 30. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and go through the business unit results for the quarter. Employment Services total revenues grew 6% or 5% organically for the quarter. We are pleased that revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States grew 2% during the quarter as we continue to see strong demand for our payroll solutions particularly in the Small Business marketplace. Beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. continued to grow with 9% growth in the quarter, including about 2% growth from the  Workscape acquisition closed early in the quarter. ASO, our BPO offering at the low end of the market, retirement services and other beyond payroll solutions such as Tax Credit Services also grew nicely during the quarter. ES' pretax margin declined 80 basis points as leverage from increased revenues was more than offset by the incremental hiring of sales and service over the second half of fiscal 2010 as well as higher compensation expense. Pays per control, which is our same-store sales employment metric, increased 1.7% in the quarter compared to the first quarter last year, which was higher than we anticipated. The number of pays in Europe declined in the quarter compared with a year ago in the same-store sales basis though the trends improved during the quarter. Client revenue retention continued to improve with a notable increase of 1.7 percentage points in the quarter. 
Gary will take you through the new business sales, so I will just repeat that sales were in line with our expectations for the quarter and also remind you that new business sales represents the expected new annual recurring dollar value of these sales and our incremental recurring revenues through our existing recurring revenue base. 
Let's continue with the quarter's results. Turning to Slide 6 and the PEO. The PEO reported 15% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic, primarily from increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees paid. Pretax margin declined 370 basis points primarily due to a tough compare with last year's first quarter, which included a $9 million favorable settlement on a state unemployment tax matter causing 310 basis points of the degradation. Additionally, compression from price sensitivity related to higher pass-through costs, as well as increased compensation expense, pressured the pretax margin. Excluding last year settlement, pretax earnings grew 8%. Year-over-year for the first quarter, average worksite employees increased 9.5% to nearly 214,000. 
Moving onto Dealer Services on Slide 7. Dealer Services revenues grew 12% for the quarter, including revenues from Cobalt. Organic revenue growth was 1%, including about one point of grow-over challenge from last year's revenue from the Cash for Clunkers program. Dealer's pretax margin improved 25 basis points. The current quarter was negatively impacted about 225 basis points from the Cobalt transaction and was offset by a 225 basis point benefit from the $7 million intangible asset impairment charge in last year's first quarter relating to General Motors' announced closure of its Saturn brand. Dealer Services continued to gain market share with strong competitive win rate.
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Before we get into the results of our investment strategy for client funds, I want to remind everyone that the safety liquidity and diversification of our client funds continue to be the foremost objective of our strategy. Client funds are invested primarily in fixed income securities and in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guideline. To give you a quick understanding of how to read the schedule as most of you have previously seen, the schedule shows the overall impact of our client funds portfolio extended investment strategy with the average balances and interest yield shown in the top half of the slide and the corresponding pretax P&L impact shown in the lower half, all color coded to help you transition from the top half to the bottom half of the slide. 
Getting into the details for the quarter, the results were slightly better than anticipated primarily due to client fund balance growth, offset by lower than anticipated yield. For the quarter, average client fund balances were up $1.1 billion or 9% compared with the year-ago period. The average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 40 basis points to 3.7%, resulting in a slight decline of $1.1 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. You can see that lower new purchase rates impacted the extended and long portfolios where the average yields earned 20 to 40 basis points lower than last year. Average borrowings were down in the quarter and the average interest rate paid on these borrowings increased to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% from 0.2% last year. The result was a negligible impact to the P&L. So focusing your attention on the net P&L impact on the lower portion of the slide, taking into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results was a $7 million P&L decrease before tax or a decline of 4%. The overall yield of the bottom line impact when calculated is 4.4% compared to 5.0% last year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy updated forecast of fiscal 2011. Before I get into discussing the detailed forecast, I'd like to update you on the credit quality of the portfolio and what we are seeing in the marketplace regarding the current fixed income investment landscape. As was the case when we last showed you the details at our February analyst conference, currently of that 85% of the portfolio remains AAA or AA rated. As you have observed in the marketplace, the recent decline in U.S. Treasury yields and the narrow credit spread have led many corporations to issue new debt. Fully consistent with our client funds portfolio objectives of safety, liquidity and diversification, we're able to take advantage of the greater supply of new investment-grade corporate fixed income securities and add more corporate bonds to our portfolio. In addition, the steep yield curve presented greater opportunities at the longer end of the maturity curve in both the extended and long portfolios. And as a result, the duration lengthened slightly to 2.8 years at the end of the first quarter compared to 2.7 years at June 30 and 2.4 years at the end of last year's first quarter. 
I want to be clear that we have not taken more risk in the portfolio by going out further along the yield curve. There has been no change to our board-approved investment guidelines or our intent to hold the securities to maturity. Since we do not believe it's possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new security issuance behavior of corporations, we continue to base our interest assumptions in our forecast on hedged funds, future contracts and the forward yield curves for the three and a half and five-year U.S. government agencies. In the current forecast ranges we have provided, we have also taken into consideration the potential investments we may make in corporate fixed income securities as well as investing further out on the yield curve. 
Net unrealized gains as of last week were about the same as the net gain of $853 million as of September 30 reported in this morning's earnings release. Although level of unrealized gains will change as the interest rate environment changes, the way to think about this is that the unrealized gains indicate we are holding securities yielding higher rates than current market rates. As part of our extended investment strategy, our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and over time earn these higher than current market yields. I'd also like to point out that this $850 million-plus of net unrealized gain includes gross unrealized losses of just $1 million. 
Now for the fiscal 2011 forecast. This slide summarizes the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2011. And it's important to keep in mind that 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year. We have updated our forecast for growth in average client fund balances to 5% to 7% growth, which is up from our prior forecast of 2% to 3% growth. The increase is driven by better than anticipated wage growth and pays per control. You recall that the first quarter average client balances grew 9%. 
I want to provide a few comments to help you frame why we're not expecting that level of growth in balances for the full year. We saw higher wage growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 influenced by over 30% growth in bonuses, a return to merit increases and higher SUI rates. Therefore, we anticipate tougher comparisons in the second half of fiscal 2011. We're anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of 3.2% to 3.3%, down 30 to 40 basis points from fiscal 2010. We are anticipating a decline of $20 million to $25 million in client funds interests as the lower anticipated interest yield offset the expected growth in balances. 
Average new purchase rates are expected to be about 300 basis points lower than the embedded rates on maturing investments. We are anticipating that average corporate extended balances will be flat to up $100 million and the average yield on the corporate extended will be down 30 to 40 basis points. We're anticipating average borrowings will also be flat to up $100 million and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings will be up slightly in fiscal 2011 10 to 20 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% to 0.4%. 
Looking now at the lower right of the chart, you see that the continued anticipated decline in interest rate is expected to outweigh the benefit of growing average balances, resulting in a decline in pretax earnings of $30 million to $35 million for fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, we anticipate a decline of about 40 basis points from fiscal 2010's overall yield of 4.1% from the net impact of this strategy. 
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2011."

In our fiscal 2011 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also updated our forecast for you to include the impact of the acquisitions that closed during the first quarter of fiscal '11. We still anticipate that the Cobalt transaction will be slightly accretive to ADP. However, as I will discuss in a moment, cost relating to the acquisition will be dilutive to Dealer Services pretax margin. We continue to anticipate year-over-year earnings pressures from the impact of merit increases in last year's fourth quarter as well as from the sales force and service hirings that took place over the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Now let me take you through the forecast you see here on this slide.
The total ADP revenues, we anticipate growth of 7% to 8%, which reflects the recent acquisition activity mentioned a few moments ago. Excluding revenues from the acquisitions closed in the first quarter, as they were not contemplated in our prior forecast, we anticipate 3% of 5% revenue growth. This is up from our prior forecast of 1% to 3% growth due to better than anticipated results in the first quarter. We do anticipate 3% to 5% growth in diluted EPS from continuing operations compared to $2.37 from last year, which excluded favorable tax items in fiscal 2010. This compares to our prior forecast of 1% to 3% growth. We anticipate no impact to diluted earnings per share from the acquisitions closed during the first quarter of fiscal '11. As is our normal practice, no further share backs are contemplated in the forecast, although it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders obviously depending upon market conditions. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for the segment update. For our  ES business, excluding revenues from the acquisitions closed in the first quarter, as again they were not contemplated in our prior forecast, we anticipate revenue growth of about 4%, which is up from our prior forecast for 1% to 3% revenue growth. Including acquisitions, we anticipate about 5% growth. We continue to expect, for the full year, to be up some 50 basis points of pretax margin improvement, including the first quarter acquisition activity. Our forecast for both pays per control and client revenue retention had been updated to reflect the better than anticipated results in our first quarter. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of at least 1%, with more favorable pays per control comparables expected early in fiscal 2011 due to the significant declines in this metric that we saw early in fiscal 2010. We do anticipate a slight decline in pays per control in our international market of about 0.005% for the year, and we anticipate client revenue retention will improve about 50 basis points for the year. We anticipate 13% to 15% revenue growth for PEO Services with a decline in pretax margins due to higher benefit pass-through revenues and the grow-over impact of last year's $9 million favorable tax settlement as we had mentioned earlier. We continue to anticipate high single-digit growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the $1 billion in the same metric sold in fiscal 2010. And for Dealer Services, excluding Cobalt, we anticipate up to 2% revenue growth and a slight improvement in pretax margin. Including Cobalt, we anticipate over 20% revenue growth and a decline in pretax margin up to 200 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions.
As you can hopefully summarize from my comments, I am quite pleased with ADP's results for the first quarter of fiscal '11, and I hope they came through to you on this call. The economy is stable, but does remain challenging with interest rates stuck at record lows and millions of people still out of work. However, I believe ADP entered fiscal '11 from a position of considerable strength. The positive inflection points reached most of our key business metrics exiting last fiscal continued into our first quarter of fiscal '11, resulting in ADP achieving better than anticipated results for the first quarter. 
Our updated forecast for the year reflects these positive results as well as the impact from the strategic acquisitions closed during the quarter. I can assure you that ADP's business model remains solidly intact. ADP's highly recurring revenues with strong and consistent cash flow generation enabled us to continue incremental investments in our client-facing associates and in our market-leading solutions during the economic downturn. A good example is the investment we had made to roll out our initial mobile application for RUN payrolls for Small Business, and we are further investing in mobile applications across our entire solution set. 
ADP has been performing exceptionally well on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we spent nearly $500 million on strategic acquisitions that we believe will help fuel ADP's future growth, and there is more to come. We continue to execute against our five-point strategic growth program, and I remain very optimistic about ADP's long-term growth opportunities. 
Now let me turn it back to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

I actually talked to most of my senior sales leaders yesterday in preparation for the call, and they all remain very optimistic about being at or above their plans for the full year. Most of them would say to you that their backlog of prospective clients was actually stronger at this point versus last year, which I think bodes well for the selling season. Our product position, particularly in the low end of the market with our new RUN platform and the new mobile applications that we've launched, our people there are actually quite bullish, and we actually had strong double-digit growth there in the first quarter. Workforce now continues to do well in the mid-market, and we've got a very strong pipeline of GlobalView prospect.

We are seeing increases in net pay because I think the economy is a little better and people are working more hours and they are hiring, to some degree, from that standpoint. The SUI increases were quite significant this past year because they generally follow by year the steepest decline in employment, but they will likely continue at these higher levels for at least this year and next, if not beyond, because the state coffers are basically empty in terms of that regard. So we're also very cautious on this metric because of the income that's earned off that is very high margin.

So I think within the context of what we're talking about here, generally speaking, we're pushing toward 8% to 10% growth in terms of new sales in every one of our businesses in terms of the planning process. So to the extent that a majors or nationals was down mid-single digits, then we're still looking for them to grow 8% to 10% for the year. Majors had a very strong finish last year, so it may be a little bit lower than that number in terms of their full year forecast. But nothing remarkable to note in terms of the composition of that growth."

So I think it's going to be good for the PEO, I think it's going to good for ASO, and good for the general employer services business across the industry. We think our acquisition of employees that we made a few years back, coupled with the acquisition of Workscape and the bundling in of employees into our Workforce Now product, which is at the thousand, to call it 3,000-person level, is going to clearly drive acceleration in our Benefits business. And we clearly see that the Benefits business can be well beyond $0.5 billion business for us in the planning horizon.

But the portfolio, it's a little bit early to tell because how we're impacted next year, and we'll obviously give you some insights on that as we go forward in the year, but a lot of it has to do with the balance growth this year and what you would expect to see balance growth next year. It has a lot to do with the interest rate expectations whether the forward-yield curve plays out or whether those interest rates stay exactly where they are. I think we'll know more about that as we progress through the year. And so it's a little premature to guess that far into the future, and so more to come on that. But as you can see, we've been able to overcome some of that drag this year, and so we'll continue to focus on that. The first question was around the PEO, I guess. And the PEO, obviously, the margins are on the pressure as you grow benefit pass-throughs significantly like we have. And it's also under some pressure from the standpoint that aren't normal increases in that area when benefits are going up significantly, it's kind of a total cost. And so you don't want to hurt your retention by increasing the pricing. So it's not a competitive pricing issue per se, it's just they're experiencing significant increases in the benefits and unemployment and everything else. What is helpful in that business is that our pricing tends to be around the total payroll. So as pays per control come back, as you start adding employees as you start giving merit increases, there's a natural lift in that business that should help margins going forward. I know that I've talked about this in the past, but if you strip out those pass-throughs and look out how much we make on the bottom line versus the pricing revenue excluding those benefit pass-throughs, those margins are very, very healthy margins. And they are certainly under pressure from the standpoint of the increase in benefit pass-throughs."

I'll begin today's call with some opening comments about our first quarter results, then I'll turn the call over to Chris Reidy, our CFO, to take you through the detailed results. After which, I'll return to provide you with an updated forecast for fiscal '11. And before we take your questions, I'll also provide some concluding remarks. 
Overall, I am quite pleased with ADP's first quarter results for fiscal 2011 which, as you can see from the release, were better than anticipated. You recall as we exited last fiscal year, we did reach positive inflection points in our key business metrics. I'm pleased to report for the most part, that those positive trends continued into this first quarter of '11. 
Let's start with new business sales which, as you saw in this morning's release, were flat to last year. However, results were different by market segment. In the Small Business marketplace, including the PEO [Professional Employer Organization], we posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year. I believe our investments in our new RUN products and in our sales force has had a very positive impact in this market. Having said that, we are somewhat cautious as we move up market. The pipeline for new business sales is good, but the sale cycles remain relatively long and new business sales in the medium-large company markets were slightly below last year. New business sales in our international business were up nicely, excluding GlobalView sales, which declined year-over-year. We closed three quite large GlobalView transactions in the first quarter of last year, which impacted the total sales comparison from last year by a couple of points. All in all, we are still comfortable with our full year forecast for high single-digit new business sales growth for the year.
As we look at retention, I believe that the improved economy, coupled with the technology investments we have made in our service solutions and the significant increases in client service associates, helped drive this notable improvement in client revenue retention during the quarter. This increase of 1.7 percentage points clearly exceeded our expectations. And for the record, is the largest quarterly increase we have seen in this metric in about five years. 
Employment levels in the U.S. have stabilized and our pays per control same-store sales employment metric was actually up 1.7% in the quarter and also ahead of our expectations. Average client funds balances increased 9% and were higher than anticipated driven by higher wage growth, growth in pays for control and increased SUI tax. It's also noteworthy that the number of worksite employees paid in our PEO grew 9.5% in the quarter. I am very pleased with the acquisitions we closed in the first quarter and the pipeline of potential transactions is also quite good. To remind you, our M&A strategy is primarily focused on entering adjacent markets that leverage our core franchise as well as competitive roll-ups within our existing product portfolio. We are currently in the process of integrating the two largest transactions we completed this quarter: Workscape and Employer Services and Cobalt and Dealer Services, and continue to be quite pleased as we go deeper with each business. 
Moving onto Dealer Services. The automotive landscape is relatively stable, and dealership closings have greatly subsided. Revenues in Dealer, however, continued to be negatively impacted by the carry-forward effects of dealership closings over the past year, but fewer current closings bodes well for continued improvement in the year ahead. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our results.

We are very pleased as total revenues increased 6% to $2.2 billion in the quarter, including acquisitions. Revenues were negatively impacted nearly 1% from unfavorable foreign exchange rates as the dollar strengthened during the quarter compared with last year. However, our forecast assumes that foreign exchange impacts will turn favorable during the second half of the year and have no impact on the full year as compared to a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Pretax and net earnings were down 2% and as anticipated, first quarter earnings and margins were lower from the investments we made over the second half of fiscal 2010 to drive growth. But I'd also like to remind you that we had frozen merit increases until the fourth quarter of last year, which also resulted in negative year-to-year grow over comparisons.
Earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56 a share were flat with a year ago on fewer shares outstanding. And before we leave this slide, I'll also like to speak briefly about ADP's cash balance. As you know, our intent is to target the cash balance toward the $1 billion level at a minimum. We moved closer to this level during the first quarter by closing three strategic acquisitions for $475 million in net cash, and we bought back 1.2 million shares for about $50 million. As a result, our cash and marketable securities balance was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $1.8 billion at June 30. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and go through the business unit results for the quarter. Employment Services total revenues grew 6% or 5% organically for the quarter. We are pleased that revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States grew 2% during the quarter as we continue to see strong demand for our payroll solutions particularly in the Small Business marketplace. Beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. continued to grow with 9% growth in the quarter, including about 2% growth from the  Workscape acquisition closed early in the quarter. ASO, our BPO offering at the low end of the market, retirement services and other beyond payroll solutions such as Tax Credit Services also grew nicely during the quarter. ES' pretax margin declined 80 basis points as leverage from increased revenues was more than offset by the incremental hiring of sales and service over the second half of fiscal 2010 as well as higher compensation expense. Pays per control, which is our same-store sales employment metric, increased 1.7% in the quarter compared to the first quarter last year, which was higher than we anticipated. The number of pays in Europe declined in the quarter compared with a year ago in the same-store sales basis though the trends improved during the quarter. Client revenue retention continued to improve with a notable increase of 1.7 percentage points in the quarter. 
Gary will take you through the new business sales, so I will just repeat that sales were in line with our expectations for the quarter and also remind you that new business sales represents the expected new annual recurring dollar value of these sales and our incremental recurring revenues through our existing recurring revenue base. 
Let's continue with the quarter's results. Turning to Slide 6 and the PEO. The PEO reported 15% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic, primarily from increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees paid. Pretax margin declined 370 basis points primarily due to a tough compare with last year's first quarter, which included a $9 million favorable settlement on a state unemployment tax matter causing 310 basis points of the degradation. Additionally, compression from price sensitivity related to higher pass-through costs, as well as increased compensation expense, pressured the pretax margin. Excluding last year settlement, pretax earnings grew 8%. Year-over-year for the first quarter, average worksite employees increased 9.5% to nearly 214,000. 
Moving onto Dealer Services on Slide 7. Dealer Services revenues grew 12% for the quarter, including revenues from Cobalt. Organic revenue growth was 1%, including about one point of grow-over challenge from last year's revenue from the Cash for Clunkers program. Dealer's pretax margin improved 25 basis points. The current quarter was negatively impacted about 225 basis points from the Cobalt transaction and was offset by a 225 basis point benefit from the $7 million intangible asset impairment charge in last year's first quarter relating to General Motors' announced closure of its Saturn brand. Dealer Services continued to gain market share with strong competitive win rate.
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Before we get into the results of our investment strategy for client funds, I want to remind everyone that the safety liquidity and diversification of our client funds continue to be the foremost objective of our strategy. Client funds are invested primarily in fixed income securities and in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guideline. To give you a quick understanding of how to read the schedule as most of you have previously seen, the schedule shows the overall impact of our client funds portfolio extended investment strategy with the average balances and interest yield shown in the top half of the slide and the corresponding pretax P&L impact shown in the lower half, all color coded to help you transition from the top half to the bottom half of the slide. 
Getting into the details for the quarter, the results were slightly better than anticipated primarily due to client fund balance growth, offset by lower than anticipated yield. For the quarter, average client fund balances were up $1.1 billion or 9% compared with the year-ago period. The average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 40 basis points to 3.7%, resulting in a slight decline of $1.1 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. You can see that lower new purchase rates impacted the extended and long portfolios where the average yields earned 20 to 40 basis points lower than last year. Average borrowings were down in the quarter and the average interest rate paid on these borrowings increased to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% from 0.2% last year. The result was a negligible impact to the P&L. So focusing your attention on the net P&L impact on the lower portion of the slide, taking into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the results was a $7 million P&L decrease before tax or a decline of 4%. The overall yield of the bottom line impact when calculated is 4.4% compared to 5.0% last year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy updated forecast of fiscal 2011. Before I get into discussing the detailed forecast, I'd like to update you on the credit quality of the portfolio and what we are seeing in the marketplace regarding the current fixed income investment landscape. As was the case when we last showed you the details at our February analyst conference, currently of that 85% of the portfolio remains AAA or AA rated. As you have observed in the marketplace, the recent decline in U.S. Treasury yields and the narrow credit spread have led many corporations to issue new debt. Fully consistent with our client funds portfolio objectives of safety, liquidity and diversification, we're able to take advantage of the greater supply of new investment-grade corporate fixed income securities and add more corporate bonds to our portfolio. In addition, the steep yield curve presented greater opportunities at the longer end of the maturity curve in both the extended and long portfolios. And as a result, the duration lengthened slightly to 2.8 years at the end of the first quarter compared to 2.7 years at June 30 and 2.4 years at the end of last year's first quarter. 
I want to be clear that we have not taken more risk in the portfolio by going out further along the yield curve. There has been no change to our board-approved investment guidelines or our intent to hold the securities to maturity. Since we do not believe it's possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new security issuance behavior of corporations, we continue to base our interest assumptions in our forecast on hedged funds, future contracts and the forward yield curves for the three and a half and five-year U.S. government agencies. In the current forecast ranges we have provided, we have also taken into consideration the potential investments we may make in corporate fixed income securities as well as investing further out on the yield curve. 
Net unrealized gains as of last week were about the same as the net gain of $853 million as of September 30 reported in this morning's earnings release. Although level of unrealized gains will change as the interest rate environment changes, the way to think about this is that the unrealized gains indicate we are holding securities yielding higher rates than current market rates. As part of our extended investment strategy, our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and over time earn these higher than current market yields. I'd also like to point out that this $850 million-plus of net unrealized gain includes gross unrealized losses of just $1 million. 
Now for the fiscal 2011 forecast. This slide summarizes the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2011. And it's important to keep in mind that 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year. We have updated our forecast for growth in average client fund balances to 5% to 7% growth, which is up from our prior forecast of 2% to 3% growth. The increase is driven by better than anticipated wage growth and pays per control. You recall that the first quarter average client balances grew 9%. 
I want to provide a few comments to help you frame why we're not expecting that level of growth in balances for the full year. We saw higher wage growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 influenced by over 30% growth in bonuses, a return to merit increases and higher SUI rates. Therefore, we anticipate tougher comparisons in the second half of fiscal 2011. We're anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of 3.2% to 3.3%, down 30 to 40 basis points from fiscal 2010. We are anticipating a decline of $20 million to $25 million in client funds interests as the lower anticipated interest yield offset the expected growth in balances. 
Average new purchase rates are expected to be about 300 basis points lower than the embedded rates on maturing investments. We are anticipating that average corporate extended balances will be flat to up $100 million and the average yield on the corporate extended will be down 30 to 40 basis points. We're anticipating average borrowings will also be flat to up $100 million and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings will be up slightly in fiscal 2011 10 to 20 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% to 0.4%. 
Looking now at the lower right of the chart, you see that the continued anticipated decline in interest rate is expected to outweigh the benefit of growing average balances, resulting in a decline in pretax earnings of $30 million to $35 million for fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, we anticipate a decline of about 40 basis points from fiscal 2010's overall yield of 4.1% from the net impact of this strategy. 
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2011.

We're now on Slide 10. In our fiscal 2011 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape.

In our fiscal 2011 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also updated our forecast for you to include the impact of the acquisitions that closed during the first quarter of fiscal '11. We still anticipate that the Cobalt transaction will be slightly accretive to ADP. However, as I will discuss in a moment, cost relating to the acquisition will be dilutive to Dealer Services pretax margin. We continue to anticipate year-over-year earnings pressures from the impact of merit increases in last year's fourth quarter as well as from the sales force and service hirings that took place over the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Now let me take you through the forecast you see here on this slide.
The total ADP revenues, we anticipate growth of 7% to 8%, which reflects the recent acquisition activity mentioned a few moments ago. Excluding revenues from the acquisitions closed in the first quarter, as they were not contemplated in our prior forecast, we anticipate 3% of 5% revenue growth. This is up from our prior forecast of 1% to 3% growth due to better than anticipated results in the first quarter. We do anticipate 3% to 5% growth in diluted EPS from continuing operations compared to $2.37 from last year, which excluded favorable tax items in fiscal 2010. This compares to our prior forecast of 1% to 3% growth. We anticipate no impact to diluted earnings per share from the acquisitions closed during the first quarter of fiscal '11. As is our normal practice, no further share backs are contemplated in the forecast, although it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders obviously depending upon market conditions. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for the segment update. For our  ES business, excluding revenues from the acquisitions closed in the first quarter, as again they were not contemplated in our prior forecast, we anticipate revenue growth of about 4%, which is up from our prior forecast for 1% to 3% revenue growth. Including acquisitions, we anticipate about 5% growth. We continue to expect, for the full year, to be up some 50 basis points of pretax margin improvement, including the first quarter acquisition activity. Our forecast for both pays per control and client revenue retention had been updated to reflect the better than anticipated results in our first quarter. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of at least 1%, with more favorable pays per control comparables expected early in fiscal 2011 due to the significant declines in this metric that we saw early in fiscal 2010. We do anticipate a slight decline in pays per control in our international market of about 0.005% for the year, and we anticipate client revenue retention will improve about 50 basis points for the year. We anticipate 13% to 15% revenue growth for PEO Services with a decline in pretax margins due to higher benefit pass-through revenues and the grow-over impact of last year's $9 million favorable tax settlement as we had mentioned earlier. We continue to anticipate high single-digit growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the $1 billion in the same metric sold in fiscal 2010. And for Dealer Services, excluding Cobalt, we anticipate up to 2% revenue growth and a slight improvement in pretax margin. Including Cobalt, we anticipate over 20% revenue growth and a decline in pretax margin up to 200 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions.
As you can hopefully summarize from my comments, I am quite pleased with ADP's results for the first quarter of fiscal '11, and I hope they came through to you on this call. The economy is stable, but does remain challenging with interest rates stuck at record lows and millions of people still out of work. However, I believe ADP entered fiscal '11 from a position of considerable strength. The positive inflection points reached most of our key business metrics exiting last fiscal continued into our first quarter of fiscal '11, resulting in ADP achieving better than anticipated results for the first quarter. 
Our updated forecast for the year reflects these positive results as well as the impact from the strategic acquisitions closed during the quarter. I can assure you that ADP's business model remains solidly intact. ADP's highly recurring revenues with strong and consistent cash flow generation enabled us to continue incremental investments in our client-facing associates and in our market-leading solutions during the economic downturn. A good example is the investment we had made to roll out our initial mobile application for RUN payrolls for Small Business, and we are further investing in mobile applications across our entire solution set. 
ADP has been performing exceptionally well on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we spent nearly $500 million on strategic acquisitions that we believe will help fuel ADP's future growth, and there is more to come. We continue to execute against our five-point strategic growth program, and I remain very optimistic about ADP's long-term growth opportunities. 
Now let me turn it back to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

And with a very strong fourth quarter we had and what potentially was pulled out of the first quarter, we certainly are quite comfortable with our forecast for the rest of the year. I actually talked to most of my senior sales leaders yesterday in preparation for the call, and they all remain very optimistic about being at or above their plans for the full year. Most of them would say to you that their backlog of prospective clients was actually stronger at this point versus last year, which I think bodes well for the selling season. Our product position, particularly in the low end of the market with our new RUN platform and the new mobile applications that we've launched, our people there are actually quite bullish, and we actually had strong double-digit growth there in the first quarter. Workforce now continues to do well in the mid-market, and we've got a very strong pipeline of GlobalView prospect. So I'm pretty comfortable that we're going to have a good second quarter and a solid finish for the year.

We're also doing some analysis, which is no secret in the marketplace, around healthcare kind of solutions that we can offer to our base or to the market in general as it has a pretty good go-forward growth outlook. So we are looking at those kind of things as  well. But I think it's going to be pretty much business as usual, but you are seeing us move into the accounts payable market with the acquisition we made last year. We are looking at healthcare and we're down the path to continue to expand the portfolio.

One is that I noticed that as I was listening to Chris' comment, the other thing that's helping our balances is our strong sales growth so we're winning market share, which is obviously driving more balanced growth at the same thing at the same time. We are seeing increases in net pay because I think the economy is a little better and people are working more hours and they are hiring, to some degree, from that standpoint. The SUI increases were quite significant this past year because they generally follow by year the steepest decline in employment, but they will likely continue at these higher levels for at least this year and next, if not beyond, because the state coffers are basically empty in terms of that regard. So we're also very cautious on this metric because of the income that's earned off that is very high margin. And so we want to make sure we don't put the cart out in front of the horse, even though we are very pleased with the results we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.

Cash flow can bring that up and obviously future acquisitions and share repurchases, et cetera, will tamp that down, but the minimum level that we see is $1 billion.

But the portfolio, it's a little bit early to tell because how we're impacted next year, and we'll obviously give you some insights on that as we go forward in the year, but a lot of it has to do with the balance growth this year and what you would expect to see balance growth next year. It has a lot to do with the interest rate expectations whether the forward-yield curve plays out or whether those interest rates stay exactly where they are. I think we'll know more about that as we progress through the year. And so it's a little premature to guess that far into the future, and so more to come on that. But as you can see, we've been able to overcome some of that drag this year, and so we'll continue to focus on that. The first question was around the PEO, I guess. And the PEO, obviously, the margins are on the pressure as you grow benefit pass-throughs significantly like we have. And it's also under some pressure from the standpoint that aren't normal increases in that area when benefits are going up significantly, it's kind of a total cost. And so you don't want to hurt your retention by increasing the pricing. So it's not a competitive pricing issue per se, it's just they're experiencing significant increases in the benefits and unemployment and everything else. What is helpful in that business is that our pricing tends to be around the total payroll. So as pays per control come back, as you start adding employees as you start giving merit increases, there's a natural lift in that business that should help margins going forward. I know that I've talked about this in the past, but if you strip out those pass-throughs and look out how much we make on the bottom line versus the pricing revenue excluding those benefit pass-throughs, those margins are very, very healthy margins. And they are certainly under pressure from the standpoint of the increase in benefit pass-throughs.

I'll begin today's call with some opening comments about our first quarter results, then I'll turn the call over to Chris Reidy, our CFO, to take you through the detailed results. After which, I'll return to provide you with an updated forecast for fiscal '11. And before we take your questions, I'll also provide some concluding remarks. 
Overall, I am quite pleased with ADP's first quarter results for fiscal 2011 which, as you can see from the release, were better than anticipated. You recall as we exited last fiscal year, we did reach positive inflection points in our key business metrics. I'm pleased to report for the most part, that those positive trends continued into this first quarter of '11. 
Let's start with new business sales which, as you saw in this morning's release, were flat to last year. However, results were different by market segment. In the Small Business marketplace, including the PEO [Professional Employer Organization], we posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year. I believe our investments in our new RUN product and in our sales force has had a very positive impact in this market. Having said that, we are somewhat cautious as we move up market. The pipeline for new business sales is good, but the sale cycles remain relatively long and new business sales in the mid- and large-company markets were slightly below last year. New business sales in our international business were up nicely, excluding GlobalView sales, which declined year-over-year. We closed three quite large GlobalView transactions in the first quarter of last year, which impacted the total sales comparison from last year by a couple of points. All in all, we are still comfortable with our full year forecast for high single-digit new business sales growth for the year.
As we look at retention, I believe that the improved economy, coupled with the technology investments we have made in our service solutions and the significant increases in client service associates, helped drive this notable improvement in client revenue retention during the quarter. This increase of 1.7 percentage points clearly exceeded our expectations. And for the record, is the largest quarterly increase we have seen in this metric in about five years. 
Employment levels in the U.S. have stabilized and our pays per control same-store sales employment metric was actually up 1.7% in the quarter and also ahead of our expectations. Average client funds balances increased 9% and were higher than anticipated driven by higher wage growth, growth in pays for control and increased SUI tax. It is also noteworthy that the number of worksite employees paid in our PEO grew 9.5% in the quarter. I am very pleased with the acquisitions we closed in the first quarter and the pipeline of potential transactions is also quite good. To remind you, our M&A strategy is primarily focused on entering adjacent markets that leverage our core franchise as well as competitive roll-ups within our existing product portfolio. We are currently in the process of integrating the two largest transactions we completed this quarter: Workscape and Employer Services and Cobalt and Dealer Services, and continue to be quite pleased as we go deeper with each business. 
Moving onto Dealer Services. The automotive landscape is relatively stable, and dealership closings have greatly subsided. Revenues in Dealer, however, continued to be negatively impacted by the carry-forward effect of dealership closings over the past year, but fewer current closings bodes well for continued improvement in the year ahead. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to provide you the details of our results."
126269,113878633,82397,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary.

We are very pleased that total revenues increased 6% to $2.2 billion in the quarter, including acquisitions. Revenues were negatively impacted nearly 1% from unfavorable foreign exchange rates as the dollar strengthened during the quarter compared with last year. However, our forecast assumes that foreign exchange impacts will turn favorable during the second half of the year and have no impact on the full year as compared to a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Pretax and net earnings were down 2% and as anticipated, first quarter earnings and margins were lower from the investments we made over the second half of fiscal 2010 to drive growth. I would also like to remind you that we had frozen merit increases until the fourth quarter of last year, which also resulted in negative year-to-year grow over comparisons.
Earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56 a share were flat with a year ago on fewer shares outstanding. And before we leave this slide, I'd also like to speak briefly about ADP's cash balance. As you know, our intent is to target the cash balance toward the $1 billion level at a minimum. We moved closer to this level during the first quarter by closing three strategic acquisitions for $475 million in net cash, and we bought back 1.2 million shares for about $50 million. As a result, our cash and marketable securities balance was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $1.8 billion at June 30. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and go through the business unit results for the quarter. Employment Services total revenues grew 6% or 5% organically for the quarter. We are pleased that revenues in our Payroll and Tax Filing business in the United States grew 2% during the quarter as we continue to see strong demand for our payroll solutions particularly in the Small Business marketplace. Beyond payroll revenues in the U.S. continued to grow with 9% growth in the quarter, including about 2% growth from the Workscape acquisition closed early in the quarter. ASO, our BPO offering at the low end of the market, retirement services and other beyond payroll solutions such as Tax Credit Services also grew nicely during the quarter. ES' pretax margin declined 80 basis points as leverage from increased revenues was more than offset by the incremental hiring of sales and service over the second half of fiscal 2010 as well as higher compensation expense. Pays per control, which is our same-store sales employment metric, increased 1.7% in the quarter compared to the first quarter last year, which was higher than we anticipated. The number of pays in Europe declined in the quarter compared with a year ago on a same-store sales basis though the trends improved during the quarter. Client revenue retention continued to improve with a notable increase of 1.7 percentage points in the quarter. 
Gary took you through the new business sales, so I will just repeat that those were in line with our expectations for the quarter and also remind you that new business sales represents the expected new annual recurring dollar value of these sales and are incremental recurring revenues through our existing recurring revenue base. 
Let's continue with the quarter's results. Turning to Slide 6 and the PEO. The PEO reported 15% revenue growth for the quarter, all organic, primarily from increased pass-through revenues and an increase in the number of worksite employees paid. Pretax margin declined 370 basis points primarily due to a tough compare with last year's first quarter, which included a $9 million favorable settlement on a state unemployment tax matter causing 310 basis points of the degradation. Additionally, compression from price sensitivity related to higher pass-through costs, as well as increased compensation expense, pressured the pretax margin. Excluding last year's settlement, pretax earnings grew 8%. Year-over-year for the first quarter, average worksite employees increased 9.5% to nearly 214,000. 
Moving onto Dealer Services on Slide 7. Dealer Services revenues grew 12% for the quarter, including revenues from Cobalt. Organic revenue growth was 1%, including about one point of grow-over challenge from last year's revenue from the Cash for Clunkers program. Dealer's pretax margin improved 25 basis points. The current quarter was negatively impacted about 225 basis points from the Cobalt transaction and was offset by a 225 basis point benefit from the $7 million intangible asset impairment charge in last year's first quarter relating to General Motors' announced closure of its Saturn brand. Dealer Services continued to gain market share with strong competitive win rate.
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Before we get into the results of our investment strategy for client funds, I want to remind everyone that the safety liquidity and diversification of our client funds continue to be the foremost objective of our strategy. Client funds are invested primarily in fixed income securities and in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines. To give you a quick understanding of how to read the schedule as most of you have previously seen, the schedule shows the overall impact of our client funds portfolio extended investment strategy with the average balances and interest yield shown in the top half of the slide and the corresponding pretax P&L impact shown in the lower half, all color coded to help you transition from the top half to the bottom half of the slide. 
Getting into the details for the quarter, the results were slightly better than anticipated primarily due to client fund balance growth, offset by lower than anticipated yield. For the quarter, average client fund balances were up $1.1 billion or 9% compared with the year-ago period. The average yield on the client funds portfolio declined 40 basis points to 3.7%, resulting in a slight decline of $1.1 million in interest on funds held for clients on the P&L. You can see that lower new purchase rates impacted the extended and long portfolios where the average yields earned 20 to 40 basis points lower than last year. Average borrowings were down in the quarter and the average interest rate paid on these borrowings increased to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% from 0.2% last year. The result was a negligible impact to the P&L. So focusing your attention on the net P&L impact on the lower portion of the slide, taking into consideration the entire extended strategy presented here, the result was a $7 million P&L decrease before tax or a decline of 4%. The overall yield of the bottom line impact when calculated is 4.4% compared to 5.0% last year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 where I'll take you through the extended investment strategy updated forecast of fiscal 2011. Before I get into discussing the detailed forecast, I'd like to update you on the credit quality of the portfolio and what we are seeing in the marketplace regarding the current fixed income investment landscape. As was the case when we last showed you the details at our February analyst conference, currently about 85% of the portfolio remains AAA or AA rated. As you have observed in the marketplace, the recent decline in U.S. Treasury yields and the narrow credit spread have led many corporations to issue new debt. Fully consistent with our client funds portfolio objectives of safety, liquidity and diversification, we were able to take advantage of the greater supply of new investment-grade corporate fixed income securities and add more corporate bonds to our portfolio. In addition, the steep yield curve presented greater opportunities at the longer end of the maturity curve in both the extended and long portfolios. And as a result, the duration lengthened slightly to 2.8 years at the end of the first quarter compared to 2.7 years at June 30 and 2.4 years at the end of last year's first quarter. 
I want to be clear that we have not taken more risk in the portfolio by going out further along the yield curve. There has been no change to our board-approved investment guidelines or our intent to hold the securities to maturity. Since we do not believe it's possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new security issuance behavior of corporations, we continue to base our interest assumptions in our forecast on fed funds, future contracts and the forward yield curves for the three and a half and five-year U.S. government agencies. In the current forecast ranges we have provided, we have also taken into consideration the potential investments we may make in corporate fixed income securities as well as investing further out on the yield curve. 
Net unrealized gains as of last week were about the same as the net gain of $853 million as of September 30 reported in this morning's earnings release. While the level of unrealized gains will change as the interest rate environment changes, the way to think about this is that the unrealized gains indicate we are holding securities yielding higher rates than current market rates. As part of our extended investment strategy, our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and over time earn these higher than current market yields. I'd also like to point out that this $850 million-plus of net unrealized gain includes gross unrealized losses of just $1 million. 
Now for the fiscal 2011 forecast. This slide summarizes the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2011. And it's important to keep in mind that 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year. We have updated our forecast for growth in average client fund balances to 5% to 7% growth, which is up from our prior forecast of 2% to 3% growth. The increase is driven by better than anticipated wage growth and pays per control. You recall that the first quarter average client balances grew 9%. 
I want to provide a few comments to help you frame why we're not expecting that level of growth in balances for the full year. We saw higher wage growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 influenced by over 30% growth in bonuses, a return to merit increases and higher SUI rates. Therefore, we anticipate tougher compares in the second half of fiscal 2011. We're anticipating a yield on the client funds portfolio of 3.2% to 3.3%, down 30 to 40 basis points from fiscal 2010. We are anticipating a decline of $20 million to $25 million in client funds interests as the lower anticipated interest yield offset the expected growth in balances. 
Average new purchase rates are expected to be about 300 basis points lower than the embedded rates on maturing investments. We are anticipating that average corporate extended balances will be flat to up $100 million and the average yield on the corporate extended will be down 30 to 40 basis points. We're anticipating average borrowings will also be flat to up $100 million and the average interest rate paid on those borrowings will be up slightly in fiscal 2011 10 to 20 basis points to a blended average borrowing rate of 0.3% to 0.4%. 
Looking now at the lower right of the chart, you see that the continued anticipated decline in interest rate is expected to outweigh the benefit of growing average balances, resulting in a decline in pretax earnings of $30 million to $35 million for fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, we anticipate a decline of about 40 basis points from fiscal 2010's overall yield of 4.1% from the net impact of this strategy. 
Now I'll turn it back to Gary to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2011."

In our fiscal 2011 outlook, we are assuming no change in the current economic landscape. We have also updated our forecast for you to include the impact of the acquisitions that closed during the first quarter of fiscal '11. We still anticipate that the Cobalt transaction will be slightly accretive to ADP. However, as I will discuss in a moment, costs relating to the acquisition will be dilutive to Dealer Services pretax margin. We continue to anticipate year-over-year earnings pressures from the impact of merit increases in last year's fourth quarter as well as from the sales force and service hirings that took place over the second half of fiscal 2010. 
Now let me take you through the forecast you see here on the slide.
For total ADP revenues, we anticipate growth of 7% to 8%, which reflects the recent acquisition activity mentioned a few moments ago. Excluding revenues from the acquisitions closed in the first quarter, as they were not contemplated in our prior forecast, we anticipate 3% to 5% revenue growth. This is up from our prior forecast of 1% to 3% growth due to better than anticipated results in the first quarter. We do anticipate 3% to 5% growth in diluted EPS from continuing operations compared to $2.37 from last year, which excluded favorable tax items in fiscal 2010. This compares to our prior forecast of 1% to 3% growth. We anticipate no impact to diluted earnings per share from the acquisitions closed during the first quarter of fiscal '11. As is our normal practice, no further share backs are contemplated in the forecast, although it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders obviously depending upon market conditions. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for the segment update. For our ES business, excluding revenues from the acquisitions closed in the first quarter, as again they were not contemplated in our prior forecast, we anticipate revenue growth of about 4%, which is up from our prior forecast for 1% to 3% revenue growth. Including acquisitions, we anticipate about 5% growth. We continue to expect, for the full year, to be up some 50 basis points of pretax margin improvement, including the first quarter acquisition activity. Our forecast for both pays per control and client revenue retention have been updated to reflect the better than anticipated results in our first quarter. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of at least 1%, with more favorable pays per control comparables expected early in fiscal 2011 due to the significant declines in this metric that we saw early in fiscal 2010. We do anticipate a slight decline in pays per control in our international market of about 0.005% for the year, and we anticipate client revenue retention will improve about 50 basis points for the year. We anticipate 13% to 15% revenue growth for PEO Services with a decline in pretax margins due to higher benefits pass-through revenues and the grow-over impact of last year's $9 million favorable tax settlement as we had mentioned earlier. We continue to anticipate high single-digit growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the $1 billion in the same metric sold in fiscal 2010. And for Dealer Services, excluding Cobalt, we anticipate up to 2% revenue growth and a slight improvement in pretax margin. Including Cobalt, we anticipate over 20% revenue growth and a decline in pretax margin up to 200 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions.
As you could hopefully summarize from my comments, I am quite pleased with ADP's results for the first quarter of fiscal '11, and I hope that came through to you on this call. The economy is stable, but does remain challenging with interest rates stuck at record lows and millions of people still out of work. However, I believe ADP entered fiscal '11 from a position of considerable strength. The positive inflection points reached on most of our key business metrics exiting last fiscal continued into our first quarter of fiscal '11, resulting in ADP achieving better than anticipated results for the first quarter. 
Our updated forecast for the year reflects these positive results as well as the impact from the strategic acquisitions closed during the quarter. I can assure you that ADP's business model remains solidly intact. ADP's highly recurring revenues with strong and consistent cash flow generation enabled us to continue incremental investments in our client-facing associates and in our market-leading solutions during the economic downturn. A good example is the investment we had made to roll out our initial mobile application for RUN payrolls for Small Business, and we are further investing in mobile applications across our entire solution set. 
ADP has been performing exceptionally well on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we spent nearly $500 million on strategic acquisitions that we believe will help fuel ADP's future growth, and there is more to come. We continue to execute against our five-point strategic growth program, and I remain very optimistic about ADP's long-term growth opportunities. 
Now let me turn it back to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

I actually talked to most of my senior sales leaders yesterday in preparation for the call, and they all remain very optimistic about being at or above their plans for the full year. Most of them would say to you that their backlog of prospective clients was actually stronger at this point versus last year, which I think bodes well for the selling season.

Workforce now continues to do well in the mid-market, and we've got a very strong pipeline of GlobalView prospects. So I'm pretty comfortable that we're going to have a good second quarter and a solid finish for the year."

We are seeing increases in net pay because I think the economy is a little better and people are working more hours and they are hiring, to some degree, from that standpoint. The SUI increases were quite significant this past year because they generally follow by year the steepest declines in employment, but they will likely continue at these higher levels for at least this year and next, if not beyond, because the state coffers are basically empty in terms of that regard. So we're also very cautious on this metric because the income that's earned off that is very high margin.

And quite frankly a multinational doesn't necessarily care what platform that you're supporting them on, it's the ubiquitous information and getting them information using our templates, so you can have best-of-breed performing the function in one country and GlobalView in another.

So I think it's going to be good for the PEO, I think it's going to good for ASO, and good for the general employer services business across the industry. We think our acquisition of employees that we made a few years back, coupled with the acquisition of Workscape and the bundling in of employees into our Workforce Now product, which is at the thousand to, call it 3,000-person level, is going to clearly drive acceleration in our Benefits business. And we clearly see that the Benefits business can be well beyond $0.5 billion business for us in the planning horizon.

But the portfolio, it's a little bit early to tell because how we're impacted next year, and we'll obviously give you some insights on that as we go forward in the year, but a lot of it has to do with the balance growth this year and what you would expect to see balance growth next year. It has a lot to do with the interest rate expectations whether the forward-yield curve plays out or whether those interest rates stay exactly where they are. I think we'll know more about that as we progress through the year. And so it's a little premature to guess that far into the future, and so more to come on that. But as you can see, we've been able to overcome some of that drag this year, and so we'll continue to focus on that. The first question was around the PEO, I guess. And the PEO, obviously, the margins are under pressure as you grow benefit pass-throughs significantly like we have. And it's also under some pressure from the standpoint that our normal increases in that area when benefits are going up significantly, it's kind of a total cost. And so you don't want to hurt your retention by increasing the pricing. So it's not a competitive pricing issue per se, it's just they're experiencing significant increases in their benefits and unemployment and everything else. What is helpful in that business is that our pricing tends to be around the total payroll. So as pays per control come back, as you start adding employees, as you start giving merit increases, there's a natural lift in that business that should help margins going forward. I know that I've talked about this in the past, but if you strip out those pass-throughs and look at how much we make on the bottom line versus the pricing revenue excluding those benefit pass-throughs, those margins are very, very healthy margins. And they are certainly under pressure from the standpoint of the increase in the benefit pass-throughs."
