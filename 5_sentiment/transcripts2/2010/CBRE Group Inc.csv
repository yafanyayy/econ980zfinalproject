I'll start my comment today with some highlights from the fourth quarter and for that, please turn to Slide 4.

I'll start my comment today with some highlights from the fourth quarter and for that, please turn to Slide 4. First and most significantly, the company achieved a modest increase in total fourth quarter revenues compared to 2008. This is the first year-over-year increase we've experienced in seven quarters. In addition, adjusted net income came in almost flat in Q4 2009 compared to Q4 2008. As noted in our press release, Asia-Pacific led all other geographies in revenue growth by a significant percentage, posting a year-over-year revenue increase of 43% for the quarter. EMEA, also posted solid growth, with revenue increasing 8% in Q4 versus the prior year. Our outsourcing business continue to demonstrate strong fundamentals in the quarter as CBRE continue to capture a significant share of this work awarded in Q4. New client wins and expansions of existing relationships helped drive growth and square footage under management by approximately 300 million square feet in Q4 compared to Q4 2008. However, year-over-year comparisons show modest outsourcing revenue decline, as customers continue to spend less on their real estate needs in 2009 compared to 2008. Recurring revenue, comprised approximately 55% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, as compared to approximately 57% in the fourth quarter of 2008. As you may recall, in the third quarter we announced that we have met our goal of removing $600 million of annual run rate expenses and had targeted $535 million in realized savings for 2009. The amount of cost savings realized in 2009 versus our 2007 base year was considerably higher, coming in over $550 million. This allowed us to drive the strong EBITDA margins we were able to post once again this quarter. We continue to further strengthen our balance sheet to position the Company for growth. In November, we raised an additional $300 million of capital through an at-the-market equity offering. We also recently launched a second round of loan modification offers, primarily targeting early renewal of additional revolver capacity. Significant uncertainty remains in the market, with regard to the ultimate unwinding and resolution of the various substantial amount of underwater commercial real estate mortgages coming due over the next few years. However, we are pleased to see the stabilization that began to occur in the business in the fourth quarter and the year-over-year growth we are seeing in various areas of our business. Perhaps most importantly, we believe that CBRE was able to exploit the downturn in the global markets by continuing to attract many of our competitors, people and clients to our market-leading platform. The resulting accretion of market share, now captured by the Company should pay handsome dividends in the coming years as the markets recover. Our notable quarterly transactions are listed here on Slide 5. I will not spend time going through them, but we included them to illustrate some key business wins. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob Sulentic to go over our financial results. Bob?"

Revenue was $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, up slightly from last year resulting primarily from improvements in sales and leasing activity.

Revenue was $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, up slightly from last year resulting primarily from improvements in sales and leasing activity. Normalized EBITDA was $199 million, providing a normalized EBITDA margin of 15.3%. Our cost of services was down 130 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 55.6% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 56.9% in the fourth quarter last year. This resulted from the slight improvement in overall revenues and a higher mix of sales and lease revenue versus the prior year quarter, along with the benefits of cost reductions. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating expenses declined 3.5% to $410.7 million versus $425.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. As Brett mentioned earlier, relative to our $600 million run rate cost savings target, we have executed actions for the full amount. And we achieved over $550 million in 2009 savings. The majority of these savings were in operating expenses with some of them in cost of services.Please turn to Slide 7. Revenues from Property & Facilities Management, fees per assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. As Brett noted, these revenues represented approximately 55% of total for the fourth quarter of 2009, similar to 57% of total in the fourth quarter 2008. Leasing was the largest service line in the fourth quarter and it increased 3% in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2008. This represents the first quarterly increase in leasing revenue since the first quarter of 2008. Our Property & Facilities Management business accounted for 33% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales revenue increased by 24% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus a year ago, which was its first year-over-year quarterly increase since the fourth quarter of 2007. The Appraisal & Valuation business revenue was slightly higher in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, also a trend reversal. Global Investment Management revenue was down 10% year-over-year, while Development Services revenue was down 15% and the Commercial Mortgage Brokerage business was down only 7% as the challenges in the credit markets eased a bit and GSA lending remain strong.Please turn to Slide 8. The trend in outsourcing revenue was similar to the full year trend with the decline of 5% on a year-over-year basis. The primary reason for this trend remains low corporate spending. Despite this lower spending, we continued growing the number of clients in square footage we have under management. The number of new outsourcing contracts that included in international component increased by 50% in the last two years. As shown on the slide for the fourth quarter, we won seven new accounts, expanded six client relationships and signed 11 renewals. Our square footage under management stood at 2.2 billion at the end of the year, representing an annual increase of 16% over year-end 2008. For the full year 2009, we secured 32 new outsourcing contracts and renewed or expanded 56 existing relationships, illustrating the continuing strong momentum that was evident in 2008. Although I won't run through all the details, we've attached Slide 9, which provide certain U.S. market statistics illustrating just how challenging vacancy and absorption trends have been and are projected to be in 2010. The glimmer of hope on this slide is that the estimated range for cap rates for 2010 shifts some possibility of contracting. We have already seen some cap rate contraction among the best properties in the strongest markets.Please turn to Slide 10. Market-wide U.S. investment volumes for the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $18.1 billion according to Real Capital Analytics, down 10% from the year earlier recorded. For full year 2009, market-wide investment activity slumped 63% from 2008 to $52 billion and 87% from the 2007 peak. Fourth quarter 2009 investment activity did improve by 38% compared to a third quarter 2009 volume. This is the second straight quarterly improvement, following seven quarter-to-quarter decline stretching back to the fourth quarter of 2007. Despite the year-over-year decrease in overall U.S. dollar investment volumes, our Americas sales revenue for the quarter increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. In our Americas Leasing business, revenue declined only 2% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus prior year, much better than the full year 2009 decrease of 22%. Not surprisingly, U.S. office vacancy rates increased again by 20 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 to end the year at 16.3%. Although this was the ninth consecutive quarter of rising vacancy rates, the trend of severe increases which characterized much of the past year and a half appears to be abating.Please turn to Slide 11. Our investment sales revenue in EMEA increased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This is in stark contrast to the 41% decline for the full year 2009. It was encouraging to see that the fourth quarter 2009 increase in investment activity was broad-based, with notably stronger performance in France and the U.K. Recovery was also seen in Central and Eastern Europe, which had previously been severely impacted. CBRE's revenue from Leasing in EMEA grew 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus fourth quarter of 2008. This compares favorably to a 25% leasing decline for the full year 2009. Most notable was a rebound in London, were rental rates improved by 3.5%.Please turn to Slide 12. CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific jumped by 88% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the prior year fourth quarter. This dramatic improvement limited the full year 2009 revenue decline to only 14% versus 2008. This improvement was also broad-based with activity picking up across virtually all geographies, led by Australia and China. CBRE's leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew by 30% in the fourth quarter versus the prior-year fourth quarter, obviously much better than the full year 2009 contraction of 12%. Run rates in Asia-Pacific saw signs of stabilizing and the countries with the strongest trends were China, Japan and India.Please turn to Slide 13. Revenue for the Development Services segment was down 17% to $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2009 showed normalized EBITDA of $6.3 million after adding back $900,000 of cost containment expenses and $15 million of net write-downs of impaired assets. The fourth quarter 2009 normalized EBITDA margin was 25.7% as compared to 24.1% for the fourth quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2009, in process development totaled $4.7 billion, down 16% from year-ago levels. The pipeline at December 31, 2009, totaled $900 million, down 64% from year-ago levels. The combined total of $5.6 billion is down 31% from year-ago levels. At the end of the fourth quarter, our equity co-investments in the Development Services business totaled $64.7 million.Please turn to Slide 14. Global Investment Management revenue was relatively flat for the quarter versus last year at $38.7 million. Asset management fees increased slightly to $33.4 million versus $32.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, while acquisition, disposition and incentive fees decreased by $1.1 million. Assets under management totaled $34.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, which was almost flat compared to the third quarter of 2009, but down $3.8 billion versus year-end 2008. Our co-investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $102.2 million. Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 15.Fourth quarter 2009 EBITDA was impacted by a non-cash write-down of $3.6 million attributable to decreased property valuations and $300,000 of cost containment expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we did not realize any carried interest revenue and we reversed a net $200,000 of previously accrued carrying interest compensation expense, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 when we also did not realize any carried interest revenue but reversed the net $25.8 million of carried interest compensation expense. As of December 31, 2009, the  company maintains a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $14 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a modest EBITDA margin of 4% and 6% for the fourth quarter 2009 and full year 2009, respectively.Please turn to Slide 16. Real Capital Analytics, now classifies $176 billion of commercial real estate as distressed. This includes properties that are troubled, including those that are delinquent or in default, in lender REO or in workout. The potential for considerably more properties to become distressed is very real in view of the substantial amount of commercial real estate debt that will be coming due over the next few years. Distressed assets continue to come to market as slower paced than anticipated. Nevertheless, the company's portfolio of distressed assets being marketed for sale in the U.S. now exceeds $5 billion. We have been appointed receiver for more than 20 million square feet of property in the U.S. and 4 million square feet in the U.K.Please turn to Slide 17. There has been no significant change in our debt amortization and maturity profile in the fourth quarter. However, our net debt has declined materially as a result of our $300 million ATM equity raised and cash from operations. As you will notice on the next slide, our cash balance at the end of the year reflects this additional capital. As Brett indicated earlier, we also recently launched a second round of loan modification discussions, primarily targeting early renewal and extension of our revolver. We will announce the results of this effort once complete. At year-end 2009, we have approximately $380 million in debt, amortizing and/or maturing through 2012.Please turn to Slide 18. Excluding our mortgage brokerage warehouse facility and non-recourse real estate loans, our total net debt at the end of the fourth quarter 2009 is down to $1.4 billion. This is a reduction of $441 million from the third quarter of 2009, primarily driven by the $300 million ATM equity raised in November and cash flow from operations generated in the fourth quarter. Net debt at Q4 2009 was reduced by $546 million or 28% compared to the fourth quarter 2008. At the end of 2009, our weighted average interest rate was 7%, the same as it was at the end of the third quarter. Although we will not speak to it directly, Slide 19 is included to show annual capitalization comparisons. On Slide 20, we've illustrated our financial ratio covenant requirements. You can see that our leverage ratio, net debt to EBITDA as defined in our credit agreements at the end of the fourth quarter continued to improve with the equity raised in cash generation and had plenty of room under the maximum ratio committed of 4.25x. This leverage ratio at December 31, 2009, of 2.3x compared favorably to the December 31, 2008, ratio of 3.28x. Our trailing 12-month interest coverage ratio was 4.14x, well in excess of the required minimum of 2x. The total amount of covenant EBITDA add backs related to the credit agreement to normalized EBITDA was approximately $75 million for the trailing 12-month period ended December 31, 2009. The amount of add backs will continue to decrease as cost savings are realized in operations. I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

Leasing marke",657,"Thank you, Bob. And please turn to Slide 21. I would now like to provide some slots about expectations, as we move into 2010. While macro market conditions continue to be difficult, we are seeing more signs that the environment is improving. Leasing markets, while far from robust, have seen some return of demand as the repricing and space has created opportunity. This is especially true in the major bellwether markets. For example, London saw a 1/3 increase in Q4 absorption versus the third quarter as requirements for space, which have been put on hold, were brought back to market. New York City saw a significant turnaround in sentiment at midyear. Second half leasing averaged nearly 1.8 million square feet per month versus less than 1 million square feet on average during the first six months. However, we expect our Leasing business to show some volatility in results through 2010. Consistent growth will resume only when employers begin rehiring on a sustained basis. There have also been hopeful indicators in the beleaguered credit markets including the completion of three CMBS transactions conservatively underwritten with modest yield premiums that were oversubscribed, two of these deals were done without government backing. An increase in the lending activity from banks and life insurance as yields on corporate bonds have compressed and the reopening of the refinancing market, which remained largely closed earlier in 2009. In addition, the real estate investment property sales markets are showing increased activity and some value stabilization at the high end of the market. This trend is most clearly evident in the United Kingdom, where prices corrected sharply. Property values there increased 10% over last six months of the year, driven by 100 basis points of yield to compression. Investment markets in greater China and Australia also became notably active late in the year. Australia property saw a modest yield compression in Q4 for the first time in nearly two years. While U.S. investment sales remained historically depressed, activity has also recovered from a near dormant state earlier in the year, and cap rates have lowered for the best properties in the strongest markets. Global capital, foreign and domestic, is slowly coming off the sidelines. Outsourcing should continue to show solid growth in fundamentals, notably the number of account in the square footage we handle, this is particular true in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. The outlook for Global Investment Management and Development Services will continue to be challenged until the investment sales environment and property values improve. Among our geographies, we expect Asia-Pacific to continue leading us in terms of relative growth because of the health of their local economies. Lastly, we will continue to have a biased to supporting growth in the business versus pursuing additional rounds of cost productions. We believe unique and perhaps once in a lifetime opportunities to grow share will present themselves, as markets evolve from a crisis condition to one of recovery.In closing, I would like to comment specifically about our earnings outlook. For two years now, we have declined to provide guidance about our short-term earnings prospects and that remains the case today. However, as the global economy begins to emerge from this unprecedented financial crisis and returns to what appears to be the beginning of a more normal operating environment, we feel it is appropriate to remind you of our consistent and long-standing view of our operating leverage in a normal environment. Notwithstanding years with unusual positive or negative influence upon revenues, we believe the Company should be able to deliver annual revenue growth in the 6% to 8% range, annual EBITDA growth in the 10% to 14% range and annual EPS growth in the 15% to 20% range. While it is still far too early to describe 2010 as a normal operating environment, our initial expectation is that our performance in 2010 maybe within these more typical ranges. With that, operator, we would now like to take questions."

Last fall, we were experiencing some very, very early signs of bottoming in the commercial real estate markets. We were seeing that in Europe, and particularly the U.K. and France, in certain cities in Asia, there seem to be signs of stabilization, in fact some strength, but it was very, very early. Now having completed the full year 2009, having had a chance to really watch the seasoning of two more quarters through the business, we can draw some, I think more firm conclusions, about where we are in this cycle. First, I would say that the global markets are, as they tend to be in these cycles, they are moving towards recovery at vastly different paces. Those markets I just referenced that were showing some strength or strengthening in the early third quarter, I think on the capital market side and leasing side now showing demonstrable strength. So we're seeing good positive signs out of France, the U.K. many Asian markets and Australia as well. That having been said, the U.S. markets are still searching for bottom. That having been said, the pace of decline in the U.S. sales and leasing markets has improved sequentially each quarter through 2009. And that was really one of the things that was very important for us to watch was how Q3 and Q4 played out and what that sequential decline in sale on these revenues would look like through the year. So having completed that year, we can now tell you that the sequential decline in revenues across both sales and lease in the U.S. has improved steadily and sequentially throughout the year. Nonetheless, those revenue lines are still declining, albeit at now very, very low rates. So it appears to us, and I think we feel relatively good about this, that the U.S. markets are very close to bottoming, notwithstanding another major shock to the system, and then we'll talk about that a bit later with the potential that might be, but notwithstanding another major shock the U.S. market seem to be quite close to bottom and poised for some, what I'd imagine would be very, very slow incremental recovery. Other markets globally seem to be well ahead in some cases of the U.S. markets, and that by the way is not surprising based on how those economies are faring and the way that the, in particular U.K. devalued real estate in 2008 and 2009. Anthony, one last comment on that is this recovery cycle, as we begin to inch our way into it likely will play out quite differently than I think, than the traditional recovery cycles we're all used to, just as the down cycle did. There was nothing typical or usual about the way these markets came apart the last two and half years. And I suspect that recovery will be a bit different than what we're used to as well and different in a sense, I think it will be more incremental and longer to take firm hold globally than perhaps prior recovery cycles."

We saw very rapid declines in absorption and lease rates than might be typical. I think the recovery cycle is going to be a bit incremental for a while for two reasons. One, we don't have global economic recovery right now. The U.S., the world's largest economy is still losing jobs. So we simply can't say we're in the recovery stage, we're not. And none of the data signs that we watch here in the states would imply that we are. So you've got the bellwether market still in decline, albeit at a much slower rate of decline than it was previously. Other markets as I mentioned that are now in, I think what seems to be demonstrable recovery. So the recovery cycle that the firm will experience as a diversified global player, I think in the initial stages is going to be incremental. It's going to be something much less than the hockey stick that I think many would like to see and I think that, that hockey stick does exist out there for the business but it's probably not in the near term, I think its a ways out. And of course the big elephant in the room, Tony, as you know and all of our callers know is, there is a massive amount of commercial real estate mortgage debt in the marketplace that is going to come due over the next three or four years that as of today, could not be refinanced. And until the resolution of that issue is apparent to the marketplace, forecasting strength of recovery and forecasting growth rates and so forth is a bit tricky. So as we think about 2010, and I think as you all think about 2010, it seems to me that we're looking at that large amount of commercial mortgage debt and assuming that there isn't some sort of massive unwinding or catastrophic problem that comes from that in 2010, by the way, I think that's a good assumption. However, we all don't know how that's going to be resolved and some outcomes could be very positive for the firm and the industry, some could be less so."

We also are going to, as you implied, be more on the offense this year than we have been in the past couple of years and we want to make sure that we're in a position where if we choose to invest, we'll be able to invest. And that would be in a number of arenas in the co-investments in our two principal businesses, where we think there's going to be an awful lot of opportunity sometime over the next couple of years. And then of course in the aim to eliminate [ph] the activity that we may choose to do, we'll begin to look cautiously at those opportunities again. Nothing like we were doing in '06 and '07 but certainly this should be a good time to invest over the next year or two, and we want to make sure we're in the position to do that."

Early days, absolutely, but nonetheless they are opportunities beginning to present themselves. And we think that over the coming year, we may see some more interesting opportunities come to market. I mentioned in my comments, this is the type of down cycle we've experienced were truly once in a lifetime opportunities may very well present themselves. And those can come from, as Bob said, those can come from a variety of areas. Certainly on the capital markets side of the business, you've seen a distraction of capital values that you might clear as unprecedented. And that has had a very, very significant impact on firms who are solely focused on those product types. Imagine being a firm who's in our business, that only deals with the sale and purchase of investment properties, you saw your revenues declined by something like 90% from peak. So we're watching that space carefully, we're watching in the fund management world how that's playing out. As Bob said, we're looking at co-investment opportunities where some of our funds might have an opportunity to do some interesting things. I think its just wise, I think Bob said it right, I think its just wise at this point in the cycle where we seem to be bottoming and slowly emerging into recovery to be sidelined with some cash and be ready, should an opportunity present itself."

And as we sit here today, as I said a few minutes ago, Kevin, I know everyone would like to hear us declare that the markets are now in recovery and that leverage from cost-reduction is going to flow through to very strong profits. The fact of the matter is, we're not in recovery yet. We are in some markets, as I mentioned in the U.K., in France and some markets in Asia and Australia, those markets seem to be in recovery but the biggest market in the world is not. And so we're there right now. We're sitting here in February and we're in a situation where the U.S. commercial real estate markets are coming off of a fourth quarter where they declined again. So as you think about 2010, and we talk about earnings growth and we talk about EBITDA growth, that is despite the fact that we are still in a declining market in the States through the fourth quarter. We are telling you that we believe that -- well, we know that the rate decline has improved sequentially each quarter in 2009. And we believe we are right there, that we're close to, if not at, the bottoming of the U.S. commercial real estate market. Had that occurred in June of 2009, we'd have a much different view about 2010. But it didn't and it hasn't yet. So our expectations around 2010 are that on the back of unprecedented cost-cutting by the firm and the fact that we were able to not only hold on to all of our key people and clients, but in fact onboard, keep people and clients from our competitors, we got to be able to produce positive leverage at the EBITDA and earnings per share line. But make no mistake about it. We are not at the moment forecasting or talking about an environment in 2010 that will feel to you and I, we don't believe as a typical recovering market, where you would see a real flip strong improvements in sales and lease transactions, velocities and revenues. If that does appear in 2010 and it certainly could, you will be the first to know. But as we sit here right now, we feel that 2010 is going to be a better year, but still a tough year. And as I also said, I think that the -- what you're looking for and what you're alluding to, which is the hockey stick from leverage of cost reductions and good on-boarding of revenue, I think is still a bit away. Remember that, and you've heard this on another public call yesterday, as you move from crisis back to what feels to us to be a bit more normal environment, you are going to see some pressure on margins and profits as people actually begin earning some compensations again. So bonuses of some amount will be paid likely in 2010. You'll see some salary restoration. And those things, while not huge in scale, will also inhibit some of that hockey stick you might expect to see with 6%, 7%, 8% revenue growth. But again, I think the comment I want to make here very clearly is we are not in a strong recovery here in the States. We are in a declining marketplace that feels to us that has now bumped bottom and we're optimistic that it will begin to improve in 2010."

This cycle has taught all of us a lot of lessons. I think one of the observations I'd make about how the down cycles work on the capital markets is that in the U.K., there is a much more stringent, and you can perhaps place that word with severe mark-to-market process for commercial real estate values. And so you may recall that during the down cycle, out of the U.K., we were all getting monthly marks on commercial property values that were significantly deeper than what you are hearing from the States. So you listen to an acry [ph](1:42:15) or whoever you want to listen to and they were talking about 13%, 15%, 17%, 20% value declines. You listen to U.K. and they're talking about 40s. And what happened there was you had a very, I think a very open free system where the marks were taken rapidly and deeply. And it allowed the market to recover much more quickly because bottom was found. The market, I think, felt and appear to be a bit more transparent. And that's what these markets -- of course, as you know what these markets need is an agreement between the bid and the ask about what fair value is. And that, I think, was discovered more quickly in the U.K. than it has been able to be discovered here. U.K. also benefits from being really the international market of choice for property investors. And so I believe very strongly that many, many, many well-healed personal individual investors and funds saw the U.K. market devalued at 40%, 50%, 55% and view that to be an overcorrection and jumped in, and jumped in quick. And there were properties to buy in the U.K. In the States, we have really the opposite situation. We have a market that is a bit more difficult to determine fair value. You have a market where, due to the nature of ownership, the only people who are selling into this marketplace are individuals who have to sell. And very few are doing that. So even if you have -- and many funds right now in the States have an enormous amount of sidelined equity capital available for the purchase commercial real estate. They can't find the assets to buy. We've got a clock system at the moment. We've got a system where, for lots of reasons, properties that four years ago would have been viewed as non-performing are chugging along through the system with the same lender and borrower in place. And there's no velocity in the system. And that's this big issue I referenced earlier, which is at some point, either the market's going to improve where those properties have loans that are of a lesser face value than the value of the property. Or there's going to be some event that will occur that will start moving those properties through the system. As we sit here today, it's a bit of a limbo environment in that regard."

And I believe probably twice as much as any other firm in the business brought on last year. And that's great news because that's the foundation for years and years of growth that we will enjoy in revenues for the firm. That bad news is, is that our corporate customers, just like ourselves and probably many of the firms on this phone call, are extremely frugal with spending right now. And where that hurts us the most is in two areas. The project management work that we do for our corporate customers is a good business for us. And our corporate customers are not doing a lot of work on new space at the moment. So that project management work is at a fairly historical low. Related to that, is of course, the transaction work we do for our corporate customers. And again as directly related to project management ebbing, we are not seeing a lot of aggressive space acquisition at the moment or for the past year from our corporate customers. And so, but here's how I think about that, that's all okay. I wish they were all doing those things but that's not really the main event to me or to us. The main event to us is that this market-leading -- and we're by far the market leader in the outsourcing space. This market-leading platform is on-boarding clients at a rapid pace. And that is setting a foundation of long-term recurring revenues. And when the market does recover, we're going to see some pretty terrific stuff come through that business from the project management work and the transaction work that always flows through these corporate customers. So if there were one thing I'd really want to do in a market like this would be to on-board these new mandates and to expand these client relationships, which we have done as you know. We had some really remarkable client expansions in 2009, certainly, highlighted by Bank of America and all the international work we picked up from them. And we are poised and ready for those clients to re-enter the market. And as you heard on other calls recently, there are now signs that those corporate customers are absolutely dusting off those more long-term strategic plans and beginning to think and talk. And in fact in some cases, execute plans to take more space and do some exciting things. But we're in the nascent stages, early stages of that. And the pressure on revenues we've referenced is what I just discussed."

I'll use outsourcing sales and leases. Outsourcing, I think the numbers are now out there. We had a very strong year in 2009 in on-boarding share and outsourcing. We talked about 300 million square feet of net additions to the portfolio. I think that's close to double anyone in the industry. So that's a pretty impressive statistic. On the capital markets side, with the sale and lease of investment properties in the major markets that matter, the places where real revenue comes from, I would say we're likely the leader in virtually every one of them, in the major cities, I think that's -- with a few exceptions, that's absolutely the case. In the States, we're absolutely the market leader in investment property sales. In Europe, that's the case in most of the cities. And in Asia, it's a bit more of a mixed bag. But certainly in the markets that matter, if we're not number one, we're right there. On the Leasing side, I believe we're the market leader in virtually every major world market. Certainly we are in the States. We are in the U.K. and most of the major Western European cities as well. So our market share, we believe, has moved up nicely in this down cycle as you would expect it would. It would be disappointing if it didn't. In a down cycle, there's absolutely a flight to quality. And you also see the exit of some participants. We saw a little bit of both of that in this most recent down cycle. And also the nature of the business has changed. The Outsourcing business, as we've talked about before, has become an extremely technical, extremely complex, high hurdle business to get into. It just isn't possible, really, anymore for all the two and maybe you can reach and say, three firms to participate in that true global outsourcing. It's just too complex and too expensive to be in that business. On the sales side, the type of sale business out there right now is very complex, requires tremendous amount of underwriting. These are things we do very well. And we're very pleased with where our share has moved. It would be nice if I could reference a single publication that ranked all the firms in every market that doesn't exist in this industry. You have to look to various sources in the major markets. And you have to, kind of, ignore the thumping we all do of our chests saying, we're all number one. Go to the data, you'll find what you need.

You mentioned, Brandon, that they've been, kind of, running off over time or declining. This year's year-end impairments were dramatically lower than last year's. We think, as the market stabilizes, and it clearly appears to be stabilizing that, that trend of the impairment's running off should actually accelerate.

I would like to begin the call with some comments about our financial performance in the second quarter. We were pleased to report excellent results for the quarter with revenue, EBITDA and earnings all growing significantly over Q2 2009. All major service lines contributed to the strong results. 
As compared to the second quarter of 2009, investment sales revenue increased more than 60%. Leasing revenue rose 29%, driven by longer term and larger square footage transactions. Outsourcing revenue grew 10% with strong activity in all geographies. Development services sold two high quality assets for a significant gain this quarter. Our 23% revenue growth coupled with strong expense management delivered total normalized EBITDA of $165.2 million in the quarter, 82% higher than the second quarter of 2009. This translated into a normalized EBIDTA margin at 14.1% in the second quarter of 2010 versus 9.5% in the second quarter of 2009. 
The commercial real estate recovery continued to progress in the second quarter. The trajectory of this recovery however is difficult to determine as it is set against the backdrop of a muted and bumpy recovery of the broader economy, with wide geographic variability, from a very quick snap back in most of Asia Pacific to a moderate rebound in the US and to a rebound and stabilization in Europe.
Our notable quarterly transactions are listed here on slide 5. I will not spend time going through them. We have included them to illustrate some our key business wins in the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Gil to go over our financial results. Gil.

Revenue was $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2010, up 22.7% from last year, primarily as a result of improvement in sales, leasing and outsourcing activities. Reported EBIDTA more than doubled in the second quarter of 2010 to $161.6 million from $68.4 million in the second quarter of 2009. Normalized EBIDTA was up 81.7% to 165.2 million in the quarter from $90.9 million in the second quarter of 2009, significantly lifting normalized EBIDTA margins to 14.1%. 
Our cost of services was down 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 57.9% in the second quarter of 2010 versus 59.3% in the second quarter last year. This resulted from the strong improvement in overall revenues and a higher mix of transaction revenue versus the prior quarter along with the benefit of cost reductions. 
In the second quarter of 2010 operating expenses as a percent of total revenue declined by 270 basis points to 31.7% versus 34.4% in the second quarter of 2009. In absolute terms, the year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven by higher bonus compensation accruals as a result of stronger financial performance. 
Second quarter 2010 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.17 versus a loss of $0.02 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.18 versus $0.04 in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2010 earnings per share was impacted by approximately 50 million more diluted shares outstanding, many as a result during our November 2009 equity offerings. Our second quarter 2010 tax rate was 36.5% and our full year 2010 tax rate should approximate 36% to 38%. 
Please turn to slide 7. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue represented approximately $0.60 of total revenue for their second quarter of 2010. Property and facilities management, which remained our largest service line in the second quarter increased 10% versus a year go. It accounted for 37% of total revenue in the current quarter as compared to 42% in the second quarter of 2009. 
Leasings increased 29% in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2009. Sales revenue increased by 61% in the second quarter of 2010 versus a year ago providing confirmation that global investment sales markets are recovering. 
Appraisal and valuation revenue grew 10% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to second quarter of 2009. This was driven by an increase in our lender and special services business due to more workouts, restructuring and foreclosures. Global investment management revenue increased 23% year-over-year, development services revenue was down 13% and the commercial mortgage brokerage business posted an increase of 33% and the other sign that the capital markets are gradually improving for commercial real estate. 
Please turn to slide 8. Outsourcing revenue grew 10% in the second quarter of 2010 as the business returned to a more consistent long term growth rate. During the second quarter, our global corporate services business set a CBRE record with 34 contracts signed. Also set a CBRE record with 17 new account sign, extended seven client relationships and signed 10 renewals. 
In total for global corporate services and asset services, our square footage under management in the first half of 2010 has increased approximately 10% to a total of 2.4 billion square feet from 2.2 billion square feet at the end of 2009. This growth was fueled by continued strong expansion of the property management portfolio in China, increased property management assignments in the United Kingdom and new facilities management awards in Americas. 
Although I won't spend too much on it, we have attached slide 9, which provides certain US transaction statistics, illustrating how the outlook is improving for vacancy and absorption in 2011 versus recent historical trends. Our estimate range of cap rates for the next 12 months show a continued possibility of modest contraction. We are continuing to see some cap rate contraction among high profile properties in large markets. 
Please turn to slide 10. The steady recovery of the US investment sales market continued in the second quarter of 2010. The $20.7 billion of investment sales volume for the quarter was the most since the fourth quarter of 2008, and represents an 86% jump from the first level of the second quarter of 2009, according to real capital analytics.
Our all America sales revenue for the second quarter increased 47% on a year-over-year basis. Our Americas leasing revenue increased by 37% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2009. Nationally, the office vacancy rate increased again, but only by 10 basis points to 16.7% based on transactions through the end of the second quarter. 
Although this is the eleventh consecutive quarterly increase, it is the smallest incremental change in two and a half years. Our net absorption remains close to zero, and is still slightly negative for the year. Vacancy appears to be close to a new peak. 
Please turn to slide 11. Our investment sales revenue in EMEA increased significantly by 93% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2009. Total investment turnover showed a healthy level of growth between the first and second quarters of 2010 increasing by 16%. The market appears to be regaining its appetite for large transactions, particularly in the United Kingdom and Germany. 
In the United Kingdom we topped those rankings for both property disposals and acquisitions for the quarter. In the disposal category, our volume more than doubled than number two firm. CBRE's revenue from leasing and EMEA grew by 15% in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009 led by Paris, Frankfurt and London. 
Please turn to slide 12. CBRE's sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased by 66% in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009. This improvement was indicative of positive economic growth across the region. CBRE's leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew by 18% in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009. 
Rental rates continue to show signs of stabilizing region-wide with improvement seen in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo. Overall result today specific for the quarter reflect a shift in revenue mix as well as aggressive hiring in this region to support extensive growth. 
Please turn to slide 13. Revenue for the development services segment was down 11% to $19.7 million in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009. Operating results for the second quarter of 2010 reflected normalized EBITDA of $28.4 million, a significant improvement over prior year that was driven by gains on the sale of two high quality properties in the Houston market. These contributed approximately $25 million worth of gains to the company in the second quarter of 2010. 
In addition, there were no write-downs of cost containment expenses during the quarter. At June 30, 2010, in-process development totaled $4.4 billion, down 13% from year ago levels. The pipeline at June 30, 2010 totaled $800 million, down 47% from year-ago levels. The combined total of $5.2 billion is down 22% from year-ago levels. At the end of the second quarter, our equity current investment in the development services business totaled $57.4 million.
Please turn to slide14. Global investment management revenue was up 44% to $46.9 million in the second quarter of 2010 from $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. This was driven by rental revenue associated with the consolidation of several properties due to a change in accounting regulations effective January 1, 2010. 
Fees for assets under management were flat while acquisition fees increased as a result of an increase in capital deployment. Assets under management totaled $33.7 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2010, which was down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 but up slightly versus the first quarter of 2010. 
During the second quarter we made $1.6 billion worth of acquisition and portfolio takeovers and $300 million worth of dispositions globally. Currency fluctuations lowered the portfolio by $600 million. Our current investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $86.8 million. 
Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on slide 15. In the second quarter of 2010 there were no write-downs for cost containment expenses. In both the second quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009, we did not realize any carried interest revenue. We reversed the net $500,000 of carried interest compensation expense in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the $300,000 we reversed in the second quarter of 2009. As of June 30, 2010 the company maintained the cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $14 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. 
EBIDTA was positively impacted by acquisition fees, as well as approximately $7 million associated with the previously mentioned accounting change. Partially offsetting these amounts were bad debt provisions associated with asset management fees due from a [fund]. It should be noted that the accounting change has no bottom-line impact. This business operated at a normalized EBIDTA margin of 22% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Please turn to slide 16. Real Capital Analytics classified a $183 billion of commercial real estate as the strength at the end of the second quarter of 2010. This includes properties that are troubled, including those that are delinquent or in default in lender REO or in workout. The company's portfolio of distressed assets currently being marketed for sale in the US is now approximately $7.5 billion. In addition, to the first half of 2010, we had sold $1.3 billion of such distressed assets. We have also been appointed receivable nearly 25 million square feet of property in the US.
Please turn to slide 17. At June 30, 2010 we have only approximately $160 million of term debt amortizing or maturing through 2012. Although we repaid minimal amounts of debt during the second quarter, on July 1 we did repay $150 million of our Term B loans maturing on December 31, 2013. This will result in interest expense savings, not only on the prepaid debt, but also on all of the company's remaining Term B loans outstanding by 50 basis points.
Please turn to slide 18. Excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facility, our total net debt at the end of the second quarter of 2010 was $1.3 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2010, we paid down $56.8 million of debt, of which approximately $55 million is voluntary. This was backed at approximately $60 million for acquisitions, primarily the potion of Ikoma in Japan that we did not primarily own, that we did not previously owned and normal bonus payment. These payments were funded by cash flow from operations which included a tax free fund of approximately $85 million. At June 30, 2010, our weighted average interest rate was 7.1% similar to the first quarter of 2010 and the end of 2009. 
Our leverage ratio or net debt to EBITDA as defined in credit agreements, at the end of the second quarter was 1.69 times, well under the maximum ratio permitted of 4.25 times. Our present 12-month interest coverage ratio was 5.51 times, well in excess of the required minimum of two times. 
I will now turn the call back over to Brett

And please turn to slide 19. As we have described in our fourth quarter 2009 and first quarter 2010 calls, during the early days of recovery in both the broader global economic environment and most specifically the commercial real estate business. As is typical for early stage recovery, the trajectory of improvement and the underlying dynamics supporting commercial real estate is uneven. Nonetheless, all of the significant measures we follow closely, rental rates, absorption and yield appear to be either bottoming or improving. We've discussed with you for years that our operating strategy of eliminating large amounts of operating expense during difficult times in this past downturn, $600 million, not only allows us to drive industry leading margins through the down cycle but also produces outsized results at the profit line during recovery. 
Our results year-to-date across all financial measures, revenue, EBITDA and earnings once again prove our thesis. This recover cycle and the expansion cycle to come should provide solid footing for our base case EBITDA in earnings growth model. That being 10% to 15% EBITDA growth and high teens earning growth over the long term. While our second quarter and year-to-date performance far exceeds this model, future results will be tempered from the current extraordinary levels by a steady but careful on boarding of cost to support growth, as well as inevitably more difficult quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparison. 
As we said last quarter, our bias at the moment is that we will achieve the high end of our EPS growth model this year, and in fact may exceed it materially. However, there exists enough uncertainty in the global economic environment, and enough evidence that some of the world's major economies are slowing, that we will reserve updating our full year forecast until the end of the third quarter. And with that operator we will now take questions.

First is we're in the very early days of a recovery cycle and expansion cycle in leasing. Rental rates are still not only declining in some markets, flat in others and in a few markets beginning to appreciate. And so the pick up in leasing at the moment, is primarily new lease in revenues at the moment, is primarily longer term and greater square footage. And that is of course typical to the early stage recovery. 
We're not seeing any benefit really from increased rental rates at this time. The pretty strong pick up we're seeing in the last few transactions, and we are seeing good pick up in velocity transactions. Its a combination of two things, pent up demand left over from the downturn, but also a slow return to a more, what I would describe as normal operating environment for our corporate customers. Those folks, who had been really in the bunker the last few years, are now dusting off their mid-term and long-term strategic plans, and beginning to think about their leased space in a more typical or normal fashion. And that leads them to enter the marketplace and begin to behave in a more normal way. And of course, that brings us more transactions. It also brings us greater square footage in longer term.

We're in every business line that we want to be in and we're the global leader in virtually all of those geographies and business line. So, it's a huge benefit to us to not have to spend the money, discretionary capital to land our footprint and let me just start with that. Now that having been said, growth for us is going to come from a number of different areas. First and foremost you share growth, and we are seeing quite good share growth in a number of our areas. I think you and the other callers are well aware that in New York for example, we did eight of the top 10 leases in the first half of the year. We did 23 of the top 50, that's more than number two and three firm combined. We were named again the number one investment property dealer in the United States by Real Capital Analytics. In London, we again were named the number one firm in acquisition, disposition and leasing. So we are capturing meaningful amount of share, we are enjoying terrific lift organically from the market recovery, and we are also looking at areas to take advantage opportunistically where we are in the cycle. And those areas could include such items as acquisitions. And as we said on the last call, the marketplace for acquisitions at the moment is relatively thin, that having been said there are opportunities in the marketplace and we were watching them carefully. 
We are taking advantage of cyclical business alliance such as our restructuring business line, which we have $7.5 billion of distress that we're working on there and that's a business line that is doing quite well at the moment, but it has a life and that will dwindle off over time. The outsourcing space as big as it is for us, it's very large for us with more than twice the size of our nearest competitor in terms of square footage managed. There is a lot of space there for us to grow and we are doing so. 
So I think you will find that our growth is going to come from a variety of different areas, both organic and non-organic. The investment management space which I referenced earlier is an area that there is no better time than now for RLPs to grow investments in commercial real estate, and we are very, very active in that area. So we are very excited about where we stand in the cycle, and seen lots of areas for both organic and inorganic growth.

There is strategic acquisitions, where we've identified a gap in the platform or an area that we want to bolster and we go out and look for it, firms that can help us there, Trammell Crow and Insignia are examples of those types of acquisitions as you're well aware. The other type is opportunitistic, and these are opportunities that come to us and those types of opportunities tend to be infield firms that have for whatever reason decided that they are having a difficult time competing, and they want to roll up into one of the larger firms. And we see opportunities in the mid-term in both areas. 
Strategically, we see opportunities in investment management. We see opportunities in some of the capital markets, spaces that we operate in. And we're watching those and paying close attention to what might be available out there. Opportunistically, I believe it's fair to say we are the buyer of choice in the industry. We have a great reputation as a firm that integrates firms well, have a high respect for the culture and the people that we integrate in. And so we're contacted really all the time by mid-size and smaller firms that are looking to roll up and we're taking stock of those and paying close attention to those. 
Based on where we are in the cycle, there are actually fewer opportunities available today than there might be. As the cycle becomes more mature, the reasons of course is that the valuation against businesses today. We are very conservative on our valuation. And most firms today are not particularly interested in selling against the kind of valuation that are available in the marketplace. But we are watching all that and I would love to give you more specifics. In fact we're looking at these seven firms in these places, but obviously as a competitor issue. But I think it's fair to say that we have been by far the most acquisitive firm in the industry for decades. We intend to be so going forward.

The folks that, and I'm going to generalize horribly here, Will, but I need to. Generally, the folks that we lose or folks that probably are not hugely disappointing to us to lose; if they are in play, it's because they are dissatisfied with their business or things have changed for them and they would like to try and improve their life somewhere else. And in most cases, that's kind of okay with us and probably okay with them. 
In the few cases where we'd lose people that we like quite a bit is because they're offered really incredible sums of money, non-economic terms to leave. And in those cases, we're not going to compete with that. If firms want to pay people that kind of money to walk across the street then they should do so and we're going to let those people make those moves. But generally speaking, Will, we use this analogy for so many years but these firms really are a lot like sports teams. Being the number one firm in the business that what people want to be. And to walk away from being with the number one firm to be, number two, or three, or four, or five, requires an inducement. And in most cases it's a pretty serious inducement. 
So on the retention side, the best thing we can do to retain our people, and we've always done this, is to make sure we have a dominant firm in the business, that we have a platform that is compelling. We have a culture that is supportive and nurturing, and we think we have the most culture in the business. And certainly we've been ranked that way for a number of years. Look at the list you survey and others; a lot of reasons why staff at CBRE is happy to be here. 
In a market like this, what you will find is that as we enter recovery, firms that have gaping holes in their platform or significant weaknesses in certain markets, need to and will spend whatever it takes to recruit people over to fill those gaps and you are seeing some of that right now. 
But again, at our firm given the size of the business, a broker leaving here or a property manager leaving, it doesn't move the needle. Of course, we're sorry to see some of those people go, but it's okay.

And I think it's a very good question to try and think about if job growth stays where it is, what impact that has on leasing. 
Let me first say that our projections on the leasing business and leasing market, is that they will steadily improve as we move through the recovery phase and into expansion phase. 
The long-term growth rate that I think would be fair to think about in terms of leasing revenues is something in the high single digits. Certainly if look over, the data that we track and the results that we have produced year in, year out for many years, you would, I think you would pretty quickly come to conclusion that in recovery phase, you're going to see some slight up and in the long term expansion phase, you are going to see revenue increases in leasing in that high single digit range. You're going to see some years you have outside gains. You probably won't see years where you have much less than that.

Directionally, it is correct to characterize the markets as bottoming. It is also accurate to say that most markets are seeing rents flat or nominally up. We believe that you will see positive rent changes in the relative near term in most markets, and I would characterize that as late this year early, mid next year. Now it maybe nominal, but nonetheless moving to a positive from a negative is a very important inflection point in recovery. And we are very close to there in most markets. 
I think one of the structural dynamics to keep in mind here is, new construction is virtually absent in most markets around the world in most product types. And that has been a huge supporting dynamic behind the amount of decline in rental rates, and what we think will occur in appreciation of rental rates. But certainly, on the office side I would expect that you are going to see some rental increase fairly soon, and across a number of the markets. Rents take EMEA as an example, of the 55 markets we track in EMEA, right now rents that are stable or rising in 49 of those markets. So you really are at that point where we're in inflection point in most markets, and we should be getting some help from rental rate appreciation very soon.

Industrial, we have a number of markets where industrial is suffering from some fairly significant vacancies and those markets are a bit more tight for the way from seeing rent appreciation. But certainly, the office property market as you would expect in early stage recovery is the services firms that were probably least hurt in the downturn. It's the services firms that are usually quickest to begin hiring again, and begin thinking about expansion again and that's primarily office. So I would say that's the area that we would look to primarily, geographically we are enjoying good recovery in almost every global market. It is fair to say that Asia certainly, came out of this first and the markets like Singapore, certain markets in China such as Hong Kong, London, Paris, these markets are doing quite well on the leasing side again with a focus on office.
In terms of landlord and tenant, I think what your, correct me if I'm wrong what you are asking is the question regarding our revenues? Whether it's coming from landlord or tenant because its, I'm not sure I'm following the question?

That will begin to even out as the markets normalize. The leasing markets generally, they are coming back to a more normal footing and we are seeing good strength both on the owner and occupier side.

I'm going to let Gil talk about capital deployed because it's not really a huge issue. But, in terms of desirability, I think that in this business if you want to be a global leader in commercial real estate services you need to have both legs of that stool in a very big way. You need to have a strong outsourcing capability because we really are getting to an environment where virtually every major corporation is looking at outsourcing in one form or another. So, if you're not in that business in a big way, you are just locked out of an ever greater percentage of the large corporate customers that are out there. 
On the transaction side, you have to have a very, very strong capability in transactions in all the major markets because at the end of the day what both your corporate customers and your institutional owner customers must have from you is demonstrated expertise and complex difficult negotiations and transactions across product types, or having both is critically important. 
The margin opportunities in those businesses are both very attractive. Now the way we account for those businesses, we tend to bolt most of the transaction revenues that we generate from our outsourcing business and our brokerage business lines. So, our reporting margins in outsourcing really don't reflect the true, I'd say holistic margins of those clients, because a lot of the juice of the margins comes from the transactions we do for those clients. And we put those revenues over in the brokerage space. I think it's fair to say that both businesses provide very attractive margins to us. And certainly, what we saw the last few years is that having a market leading outsourcing business is extremely helpful in down markets. We're seeing now that that business is a growth driver in good markets. But let me let Gil address the question on capital usage within the outsourcing business.

And then, in many cases in the outsourcing business, that's reimbursed to the revenue line. So, it decreases if you will on a net basis, the capital spent on the outsourcing business. 
That said, I would say without a lot of quantitative analysis, it's probably not, it's certainly not more draining on our capital expenditures than the brokerage business, and we really only have two areas that we spend, which is lease-hold improvements in a meaningful way, lease hold improvements and information technology, IT.

Well, again, I really believe this is one of our competitive strength in the industry which is, we've enjoyed a compensation model in our brokerage business for decade. That provides us with the opportunity to weather down markets without any real need to reduce our head count in the brokerage space. As an example, our head count today in the US brokerage space is within a percentage point, not really a rounding of where it was in 2008. We have in one of the nice credit supporting dynamics to our businesses, right and this is something that we've shown for years. The capacity to grow revenues over this base of fee earners is almost limitless. Certainly there is a limit to it; we've never hit it. And so as we see the very strong organic growth which we expect to see during this recovery cycle, we don't have a need to onboard fee earners. Our brokers around the world, our fee earners around the world can take on that business and we'll do a very good job of it. 
And I don't expect that our headcount in brokerage professionals globally is going to move much in the next few years. Now, if we do an acquisition of course that's different, but we are not really in the business of adding brokers to our platform. We are in business of improving the ones that we have, and we will move out lower performers and recruit higher performers in. But one of the really amazing statistics around this business is around our business is because of this compensation model we got for years. We can onboard significant revenues without increasing much headcount, or able to weather significant downturns without reducing broker headcount and we didn't really reduce any broker headcount the last few years.

And please turn to slide four. We are pleased to once again report strong revenue and earnings growth in our business, as we continue to benefit from the ongoing recovery in the commercial real estate services industry. Our increased mark",389,"Thank you, Nick. And please turn to slide four. We are pleased to once again report strong revenue and earnings growth in our business, as we continue to benefit from the ongoing recovery in the commercial real estate services industry. Our increased market share and continued discipline in managing our operating expenses.
Our third quarter total revenue was $1.3 billion, a 24% increase over the third quarter of 2009. As was the case in the second quarter, our revenue increase was driven by sizable gains and our three largest lines of business. Investment sales revenue increased 63% around the globe. Leasing revenue rose 27% led by the Americas and outsourcing revenue grew 7% led by Asia Pacific and EMEA.
The recovery and the commercial real estate services business is especially welcome given the continued mixed signals and uncertainty about the pace of the global economic recovery. Although, we have benefited from a recovery in our industry, our revenue growth has also been fueled by our ability to continue to grow market share.
An example of this is U.S. investment property sales, where our U.S. market share grew to 17.9% in the third quarter, more than 400 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2009, and more than double our next largest competitor according to real capital analytics.
While we grew revenue by 24%, our normalized EBITDA was $175.5 million in the third quarter of 2010. A 60% increase over the $109.9 million in the third quarter of 2009, this translated into a normalized EBITDA margin of 13.9% in the third quarter of 2010 versus 10.7% in the third quarter of 2009. This accelerated growth in normalized EBITDA results from a shift in our revenue for the transaction business and the operating leverage created, as we significantly reduced our expense structure during the industry downturn.
We are pleased to be able to generate this EBITDA growth in the third quarter, when we restored certain salary, commission, and other reductions implemented during the downturn. Some of the more sizable transactions completing during or immediately following the quarter are listed on Slide five. As usual I will not go through them individually, but have included them to show some key business wins.
And with that I will now turn the call over to Gil to go over the financial results. Gil?

Revenue was $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2010, up 23.8% from last year, resulting from improvements in sales, leasing, outsourcing, and commercial mortgage brokerage activities. Reported EBITDA increased 73.1% in the third quarter of 2010 to $169.9 million from $98.1 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Normalized EBITDA was up 59.7% to $175.5 million in the quarter, from $109.9 million in the third quarter of 2009, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 13.9% for the third quarter of 2010.
Our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was down 120 basis points, to 58.1% in the third quarter of 2010 versus 59.3% in the third quarter last year. This improvement is particularly notable considering the full restoration of commission rates to pre-recession levels, in the current year quarter. The improvement also resulted from the increase in overall revenue and the higher mix of transaction revenue versus the prior year quarter along with the benefit of cost reductions.
In the third quarter of 2010, operating expenses as a percent of total revenue declined by 340 basis points to 29.6% versus 33% in the third quarter of 2009. In absolute terms, the 10.9% year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven by restoring salaries to pre-recession levels as discussed on prior calls and higher bonus compensation accruals, as a result of stronger financial performance.
Third quarter 2010 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.18 versus $0.04 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.20 versus $0.08 in the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 earnings per share was held by a $4.3 million reduction in interest expense, stemming from debt pay down, but negatively impacted by approximately 33 million more diluted shares outstanding mainly as a result of our November 2009 equity offering.
Our third quarter 2010 tax rate was 41.5%, primarily due to losses in certain jurisdictions that could not be benefited and our full year tax rate continues to approximate 36% to 38%.
Please turn to Slide 7.
Property and facilities management remained our largest service line in the third quarter of 2010 increasing 7% versus a year ago. It represented 34% of total revenue in the current year quarter, as compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2009. Leasing increased 27% in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2009. It came in a close second to outsourcing at 33% of total company revenue in Q3, 2010.
Sales revenue increased 63% in third quarter of 2010 versus a year ago, reflecting the continuation of the strong trend we have seen throughout 2010. Investment sales increased to represent 16% of total company revenue in the third quarter of 2010 versus only 12% in the third quarter of 2009.
Appraisal and valuation revenue was down 4% in third quarter of 2010, as compared to the third quarter of 2009, this was driven by EMEA, where investment sales activity grows while still robust slows slightly. Global investment management revenue increased 17% year-over-year. Development services revenue was up 7% and the commercial mortgage brokerage business posted an increase of 216% driven by loan sales and strong Government sponsored entity activity, as well as some improvement on the part of additional lenders.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue represented approximately 57% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2010.
Please turn to slide 8.
The outsourcing business continued a positive growth trend with revenue rising 7% in the third quarter of 2010. This is indicative of the steady growth we expect from this business. Business was strong again in the third quarter of 2010. We set a new CBRE record with 19 new accounts. We renewed eight contracts during the third quarter, and we also expanded our service offering for six existing outsourcing clients.
Our performance this quarter also includes two notable trends that bode well for our future. One is the growth of international business, particularly in Asia Pacific, where outsourcing is in the infancy and also in EMEA with a pace of adoption is quickening. The second is increased penetration in the Government and healthcare sectors. Two vertical industries we have targeted for opportunity.
Overall, our global portfolio of property and facilities under management totaled 2.5 billion square feet at the end of the third quarter an increase of 14% year-to-date.
Slide 9 demonstrates the improving or expected improvement in vacancy rates and absorption into 2011. The slide depicts the average national cap rates and notwithstanding the related projections we continue to see cap rate contraction more specifically among high profile properties in large markets.
Further evidence of the recovery of the investment sales market is that top tier assets are trading actively at cap rates between four and three quarters and 6%. And financing for these assets has become much more available at attractive rates.
Please turn to Slide 10. The recovery of the U.S. investment sales market continued in the third quarter of 2010, as market wide sales more than doubled to $28.9 billion according to real capital analytics. Our CBRE America sales revenue for the third quarter increased 69% on a year-over-year basis. This was the strongest year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2007. This strength is certainly evident in CBRE's institutional pipeline activity, which more than doubled when compared to trough levels but is still less than half the peak levels of 2007.
Our Americas leasing revenue outpaced year-to-date growth in the third quarter of 2010 increasing by 36% as compared to the third quarter of 2009. Nationally the office vacancy rate decreased by 10 basis points to 16.6%. Net absorption in U.S. office product was positive for the second straight quarter.
Please turn to Slide 11.
Our investment sales revenue in EMEA increased by 42% in the third quarter of 2010 as compared to the third quarter of 2009. Total market investment sales turnover on a year-over-year basis increased 24% from the third quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2010. cap rates in the market continued to decrease against specifically for prime properties.

Revenue for the development services segment was up 9% to $22 million in the third quarter of 2010, versus the third quarter of 2009 driven by higher development fees. Operating results for the third quarter of 2010 for this segment included normalized EBITDA of $10.7 million, and meaningful improvement over prior year that was driven by gains from asset sales.
At September 30th, 2010 in process development totaled $4.9 billion up from $4.4 billion at June 30th, 2010, and $4.7 billion at yearend 2009. The pipeline at September 30th, 2010 totaled $1.1 billion up from $800 million at June 30th, 2010 and $900 million at yearend 2009. The combined total of $6 billion is up 15% from June 30th, 2010 and 7% from yearend 2009.
At the end of the third quarter, equity current investment in development services business totaled $60 million.

Global investment management revenue was up 51% to $49.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 from $32.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. $9 million of this increase was driven by rental revenue, associated with the consolidation of several properties due to a change in accounting regulations, effective January 1st, 2010.
Fees for assets under management were up 12% in the third quarter of 2010, and acquisition fees increased to $4.8 million from $1.8 million, as a result of a notable increase in the pace of capital deployment. Assets under management totaled $35.7 billion at the end of third quarter of 2010, which was up 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and 6% versus the second quarter of 2010.
During the third quarter, we had $1.5 billion of acquisitions and portfolio takeovers and $600 million of dispositions globally. Currency fluctuations increased the portfolio about $1.1 billion. Year-to-date 2010, we have raised new capital of approximately $4 billion and have approximately $2.4 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the third quarter.
Our current investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $94.1 million. Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 15.
In the third quarter of 2010, we wrote-down only $1.2 million of investments. In both the third quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2009, we did not realize any carried interest revenue. In the third quarter of 2010, we reversed a net $1.4 million of carried interest compensation expense accrual as compared to the $6 million we reversed in the third quarter of 2009.
As of September 30th, 2010, the company maintains a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $13 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. EBITDA was positively impacted by acquisition fees, as well as approximately $7 million associated with the previously mentioned accounting change. This business operated at a normalized EBITDA margin of 33% for the third quarter of 2010, and 20% year-to-date 2010.

Real capital analytics classified $192 billion of commercial real estate as distressed at the end of the third quarter of 2010. This includes properties that are troubled including those that are delinquent or in default in lender REO or in work out. The company's portfolio of distressed assets currently being marketed for sale in the U.S. is now approximately $7.5 billion. Year-to-date, 2010, we have sold $1.5 billion of such distressed assets in the U.S.
The $7.5 billion appears to be consistent with the second quarter of 2010 but it is actually up slightly due to continued sales in the third quarter and a drop in asset values based on current appraisals.

The left side of Slide 17 shows our amortization and debt maturity scheduled for the period ended September 30th, 2010. The right side of this slide has been adjusted to reflect outstanding debt post closing of the $350 million, 2020 senior unsecured notes offering completed immediately following the end of the third quarter.
As you can see, we continue to prepay debt and maturities have been significantly extended. In addition as you may recall, we previously announced that we intend to use approximately $500 million of cash on hand and $650 million of proceeds for proposed new secure term loans to retire the remaining existing term loans outstanding.
Further, we are planning on putting a new $700 million revolver in place, to allow us more financial flexibility and remove the need to carry excess cash on the balance sheet that returns very little in today's interest rate environment. These activities are expected to close in the fourth quarter, and are therefore not depicted on this slide.

Excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facility, our total net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2010 was $1.16 billion. During the nine months ended September 30th, 2010 our net debt position decreased by $245 million or 17% including the 150 million of existing term loan we prepaid this quarter, were now seasonally strongest quarter still ahead for 2010.
At September 30th, 2010 our weighted average interest rate was approximately 7%, which should come down in the fourth quarter of 2010 depending on our current refinancing efforts. Our leverage ratio on covenant basis now stands at 1.27 times at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Our total company recourse net debt to EBITDA stood at 1.85 times which is below our current target of two times.
And with that I will now turn the call back over to Brett.

We are very pleased with our overall year-to-date performance. Our industry has benefited from a sharp recovery thus far in 2010, which frankly, we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year. This type of recovery is not unusual for our industry, as it initially comes out of a significant down cycle, and it is normally followed by periods of more moderate growth, as the continuing recovery is fueled by improving commercial real estate fundamentals.
We are encouraged to see the investment sales market become more active, to see the lending improve and become more competitive, to see tenants enter into typical or even opportunistic leases and to see outsourcing clients think longer term, as they look to restore their businesses to order.
We believe that revenue growth in sales and leasing should continue, but are of course mindful of that year-over-year comparisons will get tougher here in the fourth quarter. We also believe that the number of new contracts recently signed in our outsourcing business is an indicator of continued solid growth in that business.
We believe that the addition of new clients and expansion of services with existing clients it is by the return to more normal activity volumes will drive a low double-digit growth rate in outsourcing overtime.
As already mentioned in the third quarter we restored salary, commission, and other reductions implemented during the industry downturn. Despite doing so, we continue to generate year-over-year growth in our normalized EBITDA margins achieving close to 14% for the third quarter of 2010. Give given these trends and the fact that we are almost 10 months through 2010, we are now revising our full year earnings estimates to between $0.65 and $0.70 per diluted share.
And with that operator, we will now take questions.

Let me take the first stab at that and then I will ask Gil to round out my comments. The first thing I would say, Sloan is that it was evidence through our numbers through the third quarter, I think, we have done a really remarkable job in maintaining expenses or keeping a good governor on expenses even though revenues are growing quite rapidly. Our margins for the quarter were significantly higher than our major competitors in the business. And we are frankly something we are quite proud of.
As we go into later quarters of this recovery and then expansion cycle, we will continue to on board expenses and prudent fashion. We are bringing on an enormous amount of new business right now, but we don't see any great need to ramp up expenses for those new business wins. And I am sure that as the months and quarters ahead come through we will have opportunities to invest into good opportunities that present themselves. But again, I want to stress the point, we as you know we spend an ordinate amount of energy here maintaining industry leading margins we are going to continue to do that. Gil?

I think that you know, I understand your point quite clearly and you are on a very important, a very valid point which is how much of this improvement of leasing was pent-up demand and how much of this is structural improvement based on market dynamics, I think it is little bit of both.
If we are sitting here a year from now and there has been no material job growth globally, and economic activity is generally flat, these comps are going to get harder, materially harder. However, that is not our view. And if job growth continues to improve, even incrementally, that's okay as long as economic activity continues to improve and again even incrementally. That's okay, then the leasing numbers should continue to improve along with them.
Remember that our forecast, that rental rates have likely bottomed and every major world market. And rental rates will now begin improving depending on which market and which product type you are looking at. Some time right now or over the next six to nine months, our improvement in leasing revenues reflects rental decreases. So, when you get even rent stability or rent increase that's a huge supporter to our leasing revenues.
So, there's a lot of factors you have to think about in this, the way I think about it is, we are going to be enjoying increasing rents, generally over the next few years. We are going to be enjoying improved economic activity over the next few years and improving job growth and all of that should support quite descent growth in leasing revenues globally.

So, when we talk about square foot under management, it includes accounts where we maybe have contractual transaction management arrangements as well as facility management, management for land lords and project management. When we talk about the fees in that revenue pie chart in the earnings deck, it excludes transaction management because those revenues are included in sale and lease. And so that accounts for one difference. The other is just there's, as I have listed there's a large mix of four specific mixes of businesses within that square footage, and so you can have varying dynamics, but the biggest driver is going to be square footage under management where the revenues portion are not in that property management and facilities revenue number.

Just to that point, I think it is, you know, it is true, I think our reporting on this is less than perfect. It is very difficult to aggregate exactly right. The revenues that flow from these global clients and we think that tracking it by activity is a better deputation for the market than by client types. So, in other words, in that outsourcing space has Gil mentioned what had stripped out of there is virtually all of the transaction revenues which are frankly a big piece of as you would imagine of those accounts, frankly the highest margins piece of those accounts, those we put over by activity under lease and sales or evaluation et cetera. So that as Gil said that can I think distort the view of that business a little. But I would say generally speaking I would say we are quite pleased with the trajectory of our outsourcing business. It is growing very well right now.
And we also are quite pleased with the perspective or the attitudes of our major global clients which is resoundingly positive. These folks and we listen in very carefully because they tell us in a very clear way what we should expect from the market in the coming years and what they're telling us is that they're much less concerned about economic activity or job growth this quarter or next quarter or for that matter even this year. There are lot more focus on what they think the prospects or business are for the next three, four, five years. And I would say that there's a very high percentage of our major global clients have a positive outlook over that mid and long-term. And it is that positive outlook that is driving their decisions to around a real estate. And that's what is driving frankly a lot of our revenue growth in leasing, sales and in the outsourcing space.
I am sorry for the long answer but it is a complicated question.

And the way that works is our local markets and our business lines produce budgets. As you would expect and hope for. They're doing that right now for next year. And those budgets get worked over quite hard by us and there is a process where these budgets move back and forth between corporate and the field. That may happen, two, three, four times over the next few months, but we will end up with a budget for every single office we have around the world, every business client, and we demand strict adherence to those budgets.
So, the flexibility that the business has around expenses, they exert during the budget process, but once that budget process is done, there really isn't any flexibility they have to increase spending. Now, in a year like this year, where we saw revenue growth frankly much stronger than we expected, we went back out to them and provided some flexibility around some initiative that we had tabled, that they had wanted to do this year and we do that a lot. We will get this year 20, 30 different growth initiatives from around the business around the business, around the world. We may approve a third of those, maybe half of those and we will table two-thirds or a half and we will then take a peak at the business in the first quarter, at the end of the second quarter, and if the business warrants further investment we will make it.
But the way in which you pick margins up and the way which you position a firm to come through a downturn like we did is I believe is, you must keep very, very strong, very rigid controls over spending and in a market like we are in now it feels quite good. There's an enormous temptation to loosen up those reigns and that isn't going to happen.

One of them for me was watching how quickly our commercial development company was able to reduce expense structurally. That business reduced more expense as a percent of total than any business we have in the world. We did it more quickly than any business we had in the world. They maintained positive EBITDA profitability throughout the down cycle. Imagine that, a commercial development from throughout the down cycle and in fact they have been a material contributor to our EBITDA this year, all of the things I just told you, were lessons for me, and we are very surprising and very impressive actually in that business. It is a very, very well managed business.
That business is superbly positioned at the moment to take advantage of an improving market. That business is very much a problematic business in the sense that it isn't a commercial development company that goes out and tie the plan and looks for lender and build to speck building and hopes for leasing to occur rather it is a very sophisticated business. It looks lot more like a fund management business there. They have institutional partners they have programs that they run with those partners, we have virtually nothing at risk. Into those programs other than a very small co-investment. It is a business also that is focused a lot of energy on development work that doesn't have any risk.
So, this is build to suite work for large customers it is also Government work, it is educational related. So, housing at colleges or health centers this sort of thing. These folks have found really a terrific way to build a successful development firm that is sustainable in up markets and down and I think that they would tell you that their opportunities going forward looked quite good.
In terms of expanding outside United States, they spent quite a bit of time and energy exploring those opportunities at the peak of the last cycle and even then they determine that probably wasn't right for us. That the risks to the business outside the states were just too high to warrant the investment. And I think that's smart. It is like the rest of our business, we go some pains to tell all of you folks about, that there are a lot of places we think we could invest money and make money. We managed 2.5 billion square feet of commercial buildings around the world. There's probably a lot of services done on those buildings, we can do janitorial, we can do elevators, we can do window cleaning, a lot of things we can do but we don't do them.
Either because we think the risks are too high or there's business we don't understand. I think in development, what they are concluded is the opportunities are ripe enough in markets that they have been in for 30 or 40 years that they can achieve their growth targets without putting the business at risk. Frankly I like that.

The market for the past year globally in the Capital Markets has been almost exclusively focus on core class A properties, which isn't all that surprising given the pain that fund managers and limited partners went through the past three years. What is clearly occurred is that while a lot of money has been raised for investment in commercial real estate, the current exceptional interest rate environment allows investors to find acceptable yield in the least risky investment, which are core assets, therefore the bulk of the buy sell activity is occurring in that segment of the marketplace.
The distressed market and we have talked about this on earlier calls. While we have a terrific restructuring business and we are working for the FDIC and excited about the business in there, that's not really the distressed market that people think about. The distressed market people think about is $1.4 trillion of commercial mortgages that have a higher face value than the properties they're on. And distressed market people are interested in these is that group of assets, and it seems clear at the moment, that there isn't going to be a titanic flushing of those assets through the market like we saw in the early 1990s we have seen it.
Rather the Government and things around the world are dealing with this issue be it Ireland, with their loan purchase program or the United States with the accounting rule that is been put through, the incentive to bank is to work out these issues or to hold them. And so that has been the rule of the day. And as long as that stays the rule of the day, you're not going to see a big distressed opportunity, but you will see recovery and expansion phase much sure. You will see invested capitol migrate away or it migrates into not away from but into higher risk opportunities and that will happen when limited partners are accepting higher risk in the asset class. It will happen when folks determine they can't place their money in court, there's not enough to go around. It will happen when interest rates move up a bit and they are between those rates and yields require folks to take a bit more risk. But at the moment, the activity is, is almost entirely focused right now on these core assets. That's true globally. It is true in Hong Kong, it is true in States, true in London. And this will be I think slow migration into higher risk, higher yield properties overtime.
