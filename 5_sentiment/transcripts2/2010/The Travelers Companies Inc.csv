By now you’ve seen our fourth quarter results and clearly they stand on their own merits. For the quarter, we reported record net income as well as record net and operating income per diluted share. For the year we reported net income in excess of $3.6 billion and return on equity of 13.5%.
In the quarter, we repurchased 30.1 million common shares for just over $1.5 billion and for the year we repurchased 69.4 million common shares for approximately $3.3 billion. Throughout the past year, we have continued to capitalize on our competitive advantages to generate top tier profits and return excess capital to shareholders thereby producing attractive returns.
Jay and Brian will have more to say about our results in a few minutes. What I would like to do is to take the next few minutes and give you a broader perspective on our recent history and what it means to you. In the five full fiscal years, since the combination of Travelers into St. Paul, we have clearly distinguished ourselves amongst financial service companies in terms of overall financial performance.
Our cumulative earnings from continuing operations have totaled over $17 billion. We have achieved a cumulative average annual return on equity from continuing operations of 14.1%. We’ve returned $13 billion of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends, and our average annual growth in book value per share and dividend per share has been 10.9% and 8.4% respectively. This performance has resulted in a total return to shareholders defined by share price appreciation and the reinvestment of dividends, which ranks us as a top performing financial service company.
On page four of the webcast, you can see our five, three and two year total return performance compared to a significant number of leading U.S. listed financial service companies including the 20 largest Standard & Poor’s financials by market capitalization. In each time period, our total return ranks us no lower than sixth.
On page five of the webcast, you can see similar statistics for the Dow 30 industrial average companies. We’re very proud of these results and we believe that they are the result of well executed strategies. We know that many of you focus intensely on the rate dynamics of our business. Brian is going to discuss in detail our rate levels across all three of our business segments, but in summary, the impact of renewal rate changes on renewal premiums remained positive in the quarter across all three business segments.
Nonetheless, while we agree that pricing is an important aspect in our business, it is not the only competitive lever by a long shot. Where we believe we are different from so many in our industry is in the exceptional value we provide to our customers, brokers and agents through the breadth of products and services we provide. In the last five years, we have made significant investments in our franchise to enhance this value, whether it is developing technology platforms such as TravelersExpress and Floridian Auto & Home to help agents more easily do more business with us.
Introducing new products including our growing suite of middle market industry edge products to meet the specialized and changing needs of our customers, redesigning our claim processes or helping our customers minimize their risks through our industry leading risk control services, we are constantly looking to enhance our value proposition. These investments have been important and we believe they have contributed meaningfully to our ability to differentiate Travelers in a crowded industry.
With respect to pricing, we’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, our industry is no different than most. Product pricing is an important element of success and we wrestle with pricing strategy every day. However, we do not believe that our business is a commodity business.
Pricing is only one component of competition and agents, brokers and customers have preferences regarding the company with which they choose to do business. Our investments have been geared towards making Travelers a more compelling choice and enhancing our profitability.
As we look forward the investment opportunity we will continue to provide is pretty straightforward. We will always manage shareholders capital with a view that on their behalf we should be appropriately compensated for risk that we assume whether it’s on the right side or the left side of the balance sheet.
We will continue to build on our competitive advantages as well as continue to seek rate where needed, so that the pricing of our product reflects our long term return expectations. We remain committed to continue returning excess capital as evidenced by the stated assumption in our 2010 guidance of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in common share repurchases.
Before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I’d like to address the subject of providing annual earnings guidance. We’ve thought long and hard about whether the practice is one which we should continue. Our thought process considered the fact that we exclude reserve development from our guidance and catastrophes are fundamentally unpredictable.
However, many in the analyst community nonetheless include their own estimates for both. We believe that our core earnings are actually quite predictable given our straightforward approach of running our business and that the level of transparency, clarity and insight that we provide to investors on a regular quarterly basis is industry leading.
Given the general nervousness that exists in the financial marketplace, and the risk of individuals misperceiving why we would stop a practice that we’ve been following for sometime, we have decided to continue providing guidance this year consistent with past practice. However, it is our intention to stop providing explicit earnings per share guidance after 2010 and over the next year we will reach out to the investment community to make sure we have a smooth transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Jay.

In fact, despite supplementing norma",975,"Thanks, Jay. Let me refer to page six and start with my usual statement that our balance sheet remains extremely strong and that all of our capital, leverage and liquidity measures were at or better than target levels. In fact, despite supplementing normal dividends paid from our operating companies with a special $500 million fourth quarter operating to holding company dividend.
Our operating company capital actually increased to $23.2 billion at the end of the year from $21.5 billion at the beginning of the year. This increase resulted from our very strong fourth quarter results and, to a lesser extent, from the favorable impact of certain fourth quarter regulatory changes.
As many of you know, the NAIC recently adopted two rules that the life insurance industry had been pressing for, a temporary rule effective for 2009 and 2010 easing restrictions on the amount of deferred tax assets insurance companies could recognize on their stat balance sheets, and another rule to change requirements for valuing non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities from an approach based upon ratings from traditional rating agencies to one based upon a model developed by PIMCO.
While neither of these regulatory changes impacted our GAAP financial statements, the deferred tax asset change and the non-agency RMBS valuation methodology change had the positive effect of increasing operating company capital by approximately $500 million and $100 million respectively.
Full year share repurchases were $3.3 billion and common stock dividends were $690 million. Despite accelerating share repurchases in the second half of the year with the intention of lowering holding company liquidity to an amount that was closer to our target level, our strong profitability and the timing of operating company dividends resulted in holding company liquidity of $2.1 billion at year end, exactly where we began the year and almost twice our target level. Our plan is to reduce this amount in 2010.
We increased our leverage slightly from 19.5% at the beginning of the year to 20.3% at the end of the year and we increased book value per share by 22% to $52.54, the fifth straight annual increase in book value per share since the Travelers/St. Paul merger.
After-tax net realized investment gains were $130 million in the quarter, driven by an after-tax gain of $103 million on the sale of half of our Verisk holdings. Fourth quarter net realized investment gains also included impairments of only $16 million after-tax, and combining this with prior quarters, we recorded a full year after-tax net realized investment gain of $22 million.
Total net unrealized investment gains were $2.8 billion on a pre-tax basis at year end, which included only $150 million of investments for which fair value was continuously less than 80% of amortized cost. All in all, we ended 2009 with an extremely strong balance sheet, positioning us very well for our planned increase in share repurchases to a range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2010.
Page seven provides a comparative analysis of fourth quarter and year-to-date operating income and GAAP combined ratios. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $328 million after-tax in the current quarter, compared to $189 million in the prior year quarter as all three of our business segments once again experienced favorable development.
While there were no cats in the quarter, we did experience a very modest increase in estimated cat losses related to several storms that occurred earlier in the year. This in contrast to the benefit we recorded in the prior year quarter from a reduction in loss estimates related to hurricanes that had occurred earlier that year.
Also impacting the current quarter, was a $52 million after-tax net benefit from the favorable re-estimation of current year loss ratios, primarily in BI due to better than expected frequency trends. So overall, we’re very pleased with our 2009 underwriting performance.
Net investment income of $653 million after-tax is shown on page eight, was up $215 million from the prior year quarter due to a dramatic turnaround in non-fixed income performance. The 7% yield on our non-fixed income portfolio in the current quarter, which was driven by much stronger private equity and hedge fund performance, compared to a negative 14.9% in the prior year quarter, the height of the financial market turmoil.
While the 20 basis points after-tax yield on our short term portfolio was considerably lower than the prior year quarter due to the lower rates, the long term fixed-income portfolio’s after-tax yield remained constant at 3.7%. As shown on page nine of the webcast, we achieved a 14% operating return on equity for full year 2009, up from 12.4% in the prior year.
Fixed income NII, less interest on our corporate debt, what we refer to as the passage of time component, contributed 8.3 points for the year, down slightly from 2008 due to the lower short term interest rates. Non-fixed income NII, a much smaller contributor to operating ROE, rebounded somewhat from its 2008 level contributing a slightly negative 0.1 points, while the contribution from underwriting income also improved to 5.8 points due to more normal cat losses.
Consistent with information we shared with you in recent quarter’s full year operating ROE was negatively impacted by abnormally low yields on non-fixed income and short term investments. Year-to-date, the non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 0.6% after-tax, rather than what we considered to be a more normal level of positive 7% and short term rates averaged 0.3% after-tax rather than a more normal level of say 2.5%.
Had these investments performed at more normal levels, 2009 full year operating ROE would have been approximately 150 basis points higher. All in all, cumulatively from 2005, we produced an average annual ROE of approximately 14.4% consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE.
Brian is now going to provide more in-depth information about our quarterly results.

Turning to the business insurance segment on slide 10, operating earnings were up significantly in the quarter due to improved underwriting results and higher net investment income. The underwriting improvement was driven by increased favorable prior year reserve development and a re-estimation of the current year loss ratio due to overall frequency and commercial auto liability severity both being better than expectations.
The combined ratio net of these items and catastrophe losses were up 1.8 points quarter-over-quarter, which is primarily the margin compression we’ve been speaking about throughout 2009. For the full year, the adjusted combined ratio was essentially unchanged as the margin compression was offset by lower large losses and less non-cat weather losses.
Net written premiums are down 9% for the quarter and 3% for the year. This is the result of the impact of the economy on our insureds and the next two slides are intended to illustrate how we think about that impact on our written premiums. Slide 11 takes our full year 2008 net written premium and walks through how much of that business we retain and how much new business we wrote. It then measures the change in premium resulting from the increased or decreased in our insureds exposures.
In other words, did the accounts we wrote have payrolls, business receipts, vehicles owned, etc., going up or down? So working the slide from left to right, we have full year 2008 net written premium of $11.22 billion. This is essentially the business that was up for renewal in 2009, and we retained 82% of that. For those of you that might be looking for rate on renewed accounts, it was essentially flat for the year.
We then wrote new business of $2.2 billion, or 20% of the previous year’s net written premium. So if the insureds exposures for all of 2008 remained constant, we would have grown premiums by 2%. Obviously, these exposures don’t stay constant and, in fact, during most years, they are increasing as the economy expands. We see this in a few different ways, through renewal premium increases as a result of greater insurable values or through audit premium.
As many of you know, we go through an audit process in our commercial business and adjust our premiums charged to reflect changes in insureds payrolls, vehicles, property values, etc., but in 2009, the economy didn’t expand and the slide shows the impact. First, the premium changes due to reduced exposures on renewed accounts had a 2% negative impact.
In addition, a reduction in audit premium and increased cancellation and endorsement changes resulting from business failures or reduced coverage needs further reduced premiums by 3%. So a long winded, but hopefully clear way of saying that our premiums went from 2% growth to 3% contraction, because our customers’ businesses shrunk and, accordingly, they needed less insurance.
The next slide walks through the same analysis for the fourth quarter, and you can see the negative economic impact is even greater driven significantly by audit premium. Since we are auditing accounts, we wrote a full year ago, it makes sense that this dynamic would have worsened over the course of 2009. Similarly, as we look into 2010, it’s logical that the drag will continue through the next few quarters reflecting the economic environment of early 2009.
Since we are not economists, we don’t want to start projecting this too far into the future, but if the economy did hit bottom in early 2009, we should see some marginal improvement in these metrics by mid to late 2010. So a lot of words to explain a pretty basic concept, the results are what they are and the economic impact on our insureds is real, but, importantly, given our solid retention, rate and new business dynamics, when the economy does begin to rebound we’re positioned to see some very healthy organic growth.
Now before I get into the production statistics, let me take a minute to make clear what we mean when we talk about positive renewal rate change. Every quarter we show you several graphs with premium, rate and exposure change. On slide 13, we’ve tried to very simply portray, that when we say positive rate change, we mean a true rate increase, not just a smaller decrease. Obviously, less negative is better, but it is not adding to premiums and for the last three quarters all three of our segments have been in the green.
Turning to the production statistics on slide 14, overall retention remains high with a stable trend in select accounts and other business insurance and a modest decline in commercial or middle market business. The total price change is significantly better than the prior year quarter, while versus last quarter Select was up slightly and Commercial Accounts and Other Business Insurance were down slightly.
We believe that these results continue to demonstrate successful execution on our competitive advantages and capabilities in the marketplace. The next page takes the renewal premium change data and splits it into its two primary components, pure rate and exposure change. Across all of business insurance and in each of these individual businesses rate is positive. As we just talked about, overall exposure is declining as a result of the economic environment, so total price change is a slight negative.
Select Accounts is still getting positive exposure change in its renewal premium. This is primarily a result of higher insured values on commercial properties. So in Business Insurance, we have now been talking for three consecutive quarters about the positive rate change, and we are well aware that this is somewhat inconsistent with the broader marketplace view of pricing.
On the next slide, we took the rate change in Business Insurance and showed it in total and by our five major product lines. While the degree of this change varies for each line of business due to both the initial profitability and market conditions, it is important to note that our composite positive change is not being disproportionately driven by one or two lines of business and as a result, we believe the improvement is more sustainable.
So we continue to be encouraged that we are getting rate improvement in our commercial business and to give you some further insight into our mood as we head into 2010, slide 17 shows our preliminary look at the rate change within commercial accounts for the month of January.
I want to point out that I am just talking about commercial accounts that other business units may not be as positive and we never want to overemphasize the importance of one month’s results, but given that January is the largest month of the year for commercial accounts, we felt that our ability to continue to get positive rate here was particularly noteworthy. Recognize that these statistics are not fully developed and are subject to change, but we do believe they demonstrate the sustainability of our competitive advantages in the market.
2009, new business results shown on the next page or up 2% quarter-over-quarter, in Select Accounts, we have less new business for this period. This is a direct result of our conscious decision to get some rate in those products, where it is needed and increased competition within the large end of the Select business. The Select Express product, which is our no touch insurance solution for small business customers, continues to produce strong new business results driven by a historically high flow of new business opportunity.
We continue to see significant increases in the flow of new opportunities in commercial accounts and other Business Insurance. As we have discussed in the past, we are maintaining our strategic underwriting focus and accordingly, our hit ratios have come down, but we are extremely pleased with the new business results for the quarter, although we continue to see the effects of the economic downturn in a majority of our businesses.
We remain very pleased with our effective execution, position in the marketplace and results this quarter and for the full year. We firmly believe that as the economy stabilizes and eventually improves our competitive advantages, our breadth of product, industry leading metrics, point of sale capabilities and leadership position with independent agents will continue to matter and differentiate us in the marketplace resulting in both continued growth and profitability.
Moving to the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, slide 19, operating earnings in the quarter were up $40 million driven by favorable prior year development in a number of different businesses and increased net investment income. This was partially offset by losses on a non-renewed professional liability program in Ireland, which resulted in the increase in the adjusted GAAP combined ratio for the quarter.
For the full year, the adjusted combined ratio was up just slightly as margins generally continued to hold steady. Net written premiums for the segment, after adjusting for the impact of the changes in foreign exchange rates, were down slightly for the quarter about 1% and the full year of about 2%. The largest driver of the year-over-year change is the impact of the economy on surety volume.
Turning to the production statistics on slide seven and starting with surety. For the fourth quarter, we did see quarter-over-quarter growth in the construction surety book of business driven by activity in our large national accounts market within our surety business.
However, fewer construction surety opportunities continue to exist in the marketplace and as a result we do not see this quarter’s results representative of a larger macro trend. Given market conditions we continue to feel very good about the top line story in this business, the credit quality of our book of business and our market position going forward.
Quarter-over-quarter retention and new business and management liability was down as a result of our underwriting initiatives and continued to focus on getting rate where we need it. Renewal premium change decreased to minus 1%, but the pure rate change was at plus 2%. The rate improvement was offset by other renewal price change at minus 3%. The other RPC was impacted by a combination of interventional underwriting actions and the impact of the economy on exposures.
In our international business, retention was down marginally versus the prior year quarter, renewal premium change was slightly positive with underlying rate improvement at 3%. New business is down modestly compared to the prior year quarter as intentional underwriting actions in the United Kingdom and Lloyds were partially offset by continued growth in personal lines products in Ireland.
We continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruption on our management liability business, which we have shared with you over the past couple of years and our conclusions remain the same. Our current loss estimates continue to be within our planned expectations.
So, overall for the segment our consistent focus on strategic underwriting actions has resulted in some intentional rate and growth variations by product within Financial, Professional & International. We’re very pleased with these results and continue to be encouraged by both our top line performance and underlying profitability within this book of business, particularly in light of the difficult economic conditions.
Turning to slide 21 and Personal Insurance, both the auto and property businesses continued to perform well given the current economic environment. Full year operating earnings were up 29% year-over-year driven by lower catastrophe weather related losses in the current year.
While we did not encounter an event the size of Hurricane Ike in the current year, we did have catastrophe losses that were consistent with our 2009 expectations. Additionally, non-catastrophe weather was active throughout the year and marginally exceeded our expectations.
Moving to the quarter, operating earnings are down slightly from the same period last year due to less prior year favorable development and a reduction to Hurricane Ike’s estimate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the late development of auto claims at year end 2008.
Agency net written premiums, which exclude any premiums attributable to our recently announced direct-to-consumer initiative, are up 2% compared to the prior year, byline automobile premiums are down 1% due to lower policy growth, which we attribute to our pricing discipline, and property premiums are up 6% compared to the prior year resulting from strong renewal pricing and new business growth.
Looking at slide 22, Agency Auto’s combined ratio of 100.9% was higher than fourth quarter 2008 primarily due to the timing of 2008 weather related losses. Specifically, during the last few weeks of ‘08, we experienced heavy weather activity and those losses developed into early 2009. If we strip out this noise and take into consideration the expected fourth-quarter seasonality, we believe our auto product is achieving margin improvement due to our local and disciplined rate actions more than offsetting current loss trends.
Agency Property’s combined ratio when adjusted for cats was 76.6%, two points higher than the fourth quarter 2008. Like the rest of the industry, we are seeing some loss cost pressures on our property book primarily driven by the year-over-year increases in the cost of labor and materials associated with weather related losses.
Turning to slide 23, we continue to be pleased with our Agency Auto production results, especially in light of current market conditions. While policies in force are down, retention is flat compared to prior year quarter with continued positive renewal premium change. Overall we feel good about our new business production as we see the decline we experienced in previous quarters flattening out.
We remain pleased with our Agency Property production results for this quarter. In spite of the difficult housing market all of our production metrics improved compared to the same prior year period, retention, renewal premium change and PIF growth remains at two year highs and new business is up 20% compared to the same quarter last year. It’s also important to note that we have achieved these production results with a combined ratio that is significantly below the industry average.
So overall a great quarter, record net earnings and earnings per diluted share and given the economic environment, solid top line performance, but we believe that these results are less about the near term economic or insurance marketplace conditions and more about the long term capabilities and competitive advantages we’ve built.
These capabilities are sustainable and we will continue to differentiate ourselves to our independent agents, customers and brokers through the products and services we provide. So we feel great about the short term, but we are just as bullish about our long term position in our marketplace.
Now let me turn it back to Jay Benet.

This was a re-estimation of current year losses and is not actually an adjustment to prior period development at all. On the second question of exposure Brian and I will tag team this a little bit.
First, there is a settle but unmeasurable dynamic that occurs, which is the amount of new business that we would do, or any insurer does, is actually already exposure adjusted from previous periods. If a new business account had a payroll of $1 million three years ago it would have driven workers comp premium of X; if that payroll is now down to $900,000 it will be 90% of X.
So there’s an unmeasurable, because obviously we didn’t have the account previously, an unmeasurable element of new business that is already reflecting the drag in the economy. Then there’s the second and very quantifiable and measurable dynamic of auto premium adjustments and exposure drops and Brian, why don’t you speak to that?

We write the business on a given day and then in that there is an assumption of what the exposure is going to be, whether that’s payroll or receipts or whatever and at the end of the policy we audit that and adjust the premium charge accordingly. In the vast majority of times that’s usually a significant positive number, fairly significant as in can be 3% to 5% overtime and in this environment that’s really closer to zero.
One of the settle dynamics when you start thinking of going forward into 2010 is that right now in the fourth quarter of ‘09 we were auditing accounts that we had written in fourth quarter of ‘08 and obviously first quarter we’ll be doing the first quarter of ‘09. So the economy was bottoming much more than we had expected when we wrote this business, so you’d expect the audit premium to be down dramatically.

In its simplest form, if someone tells me that, rate will never change from here, loss trend will never change, and investment yields will never change is it possible to get back to a mid-teens return on equity? It’s pretty hard to do it. I’m satisfied that given all of the risks inherent in our business that we’re deploying capital very, very thoughtfully, that we are investing with a great sense of sophistication and with a healthy regard for the fact that there’s still maybe difficult times ahead.
We are not of the mindset here from an investment profile that it’s time to step down and change the profile in any serious way. I’m working from memory here, but I was looking at spreads just yesterday and my recollection is that the difference right now between AAA and BBB, in effect, are actually no wider than they were two years ago. That round numbers it was about 111 basis points and that’s about where the spreads existed before the financial crisis emerged.
So you’d ask yourself the question of whether redeploying into higher risk assets at this point really, are you being paid for it. Are you being paid for taking that risk? Our assessment is that, you’re not and that we’d rather continue to do what we’re doing. So all things considered I am very pleased with how we’re producing at an 11% return on equity given where we are, but that shouldn’t be read by any investor that becomes our target or that we are satisfied with it.
We are hopeful that conditions in the insurance arena or in the investment arena will change and allow us more quickly to get back towards that mid-teens return on equity that we aspire to. Bill, was there anything on the investment front you want to add?

We actually gave information maybe two quarters ago, perhaps three, on the duration of our liabilities. If you go back, we can certainly provide you another copy of that. One of the things that I think surprised lots of folks is that the duration of our liabilities was actually considerably shorter than most outside people seem to believe.
So, as you speak about this obviously, the short tail lines, where inflation is less of a near term concern, and then you’ve got longer tail lines, which is workers comp where we worry about medical inflation and general liability where we worry about tort inflation. Observation would be again that the duration even of those liabilities is actually somewhat shorter than most people believe and again, happy to provide a copy of that to you.
Having said that, inflation in and of itself is a really complex issue. You start getting into not just loss trends, but what does it mean for investment yields, what about new money, what about the ability to redeploy out of the investment portfolio. There is no simple answer.
It’s certainly a more challenging environment from an insurance perspective than one where loss costs are not subject to that kind of inflation, but we’ll pull back together the information that we had on duration and maybe that will be helpful to you at least in trying to get a sense of what that would mean for us?

We actually do, we don’t have a price list, but we do speak to field folks all the time and ask them to either become more aggressive or less aggressive, it varies by region and it varies even down to the product. This is not seat-of-the-pants management, its management by the number and by the data and there have been times in 2009, where we approached the market more aggressively and there have been times where we approached it less aggressively and if one were to see the data you would actually see the differences.
It is measurable and it is adjustable. We’re always trying to push it as hard as we can, not so hard as to find ourselves taking on business at pricing that we don’t think can get us to acceptable target levels, but pushing always as hard as we can to get in effect to the edge and that’s an expression that we use internally all the time.

First, and I’ll try and answer the question, but I’d make an observation that loss inflation doesn’t exist independent of the other levers that we have in the business. Meaning, rate expectations are set by returns and those rate expectations are going to be driven by the loss inflation as well as the investment returns that are embedded in the business.
So they will operate together, so my caution in this is not to somehow come to the conclusion that loss dynamics are independent of any other factor with which we manage the business. First, there’s been a significant reduction in frequency in many lines of business insurance over the last at least four or five years and maybe even longer; and there has been an awful lot written about why that’s the case, all of it speculative.
There are lots of people who attribute it to a higher degree of respect for insurance, that individuals and businesses have an appreciation for long standing relationships. There actually does seem to be less for what I’ll call frivolous claims; I don’t mean that in a substantive sense, but less low level claims than we’ve seen before and that trend has been long term and it’s been in effect systemic.
I think that has surprised lots of people in the industry and is one of the reasons why as much favorable reserve development as has happened over the last several years has happened, because you make estimates at the beginning of each year not only about what level of frequency you expect, but also severity. The severity can be absolutely right on, but if the frequency is considerably less then you end up in a situation with favorable development and that’s been one of the reasons why the development has been as significant as it’s been.
Brian, you’ve got a view about individual lines?

If we had the ability, I’ve always said, we’re more than happy to grow our business if there are opportunities to add volumes and do so with pricing that’s attractive. If we grow our business organically, we’re going to need capital to support it and we’ll retain that capital to do so. So that’s clearly, that’s what we do. So first and foremost, as we have the ability to write more insurance at attractive pricing we sure would do it.
The dynamic of what investment yields are for capital that we retain is also a very important phenomenon. At the margin, a dollar retained is going to get invested in our portfolio at relatively in the context of historically speaking, at relatively low yields and frankly, we’re happy to return the capital to investors to let them, if they’ve got a different view of the world in the investment arena, let them make that decision.
If yields were too suddenly and for some reason spike and spike dramatically, it would become a more interesting decision about what level of capital should be retained and invested and what level we purchase shares. We are all owners, by the way, every level, everybody in management here, of a significant stake in the company. We think about it from that perspective, which is as an owner what would be the right thing to do. So those are both important factors. I don’t know how to rank them.

Before I turn it over to Jay, I’d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
All statements other than statements of historical facts maybe forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company’s reserves and other topics.
The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release, and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that maybe non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website.
With that out of the way, here is a Jay Fishman.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from last year’s quarter and a return on equity of nearly 10%. 
Included in this number was $0.61 a share in catastrophes, arising out of the multiple storms in the Eastern United States as well as the earthquake in Chile. Just to put this number in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the first quarter included in our previously provided guidance was about $0.13 a share. 
Offsetting the cats we benefited from favorable prior year development, and our underlying performance from both underwriting and net investment income was a bit better than our expectations. The net result was operating income, which was in line with our expectations going into the quarter, allowing us to reaffirm our previously issued fully year 2010 operating earnings per share guidance. 
Also it’s reflective of our continuing strong earnings power. In an environment which remains similar to last quarter in terms of both economic and insurance market conditions, our business dynamics from a solid and we are generally consistent with recent operating experience.
Renewal rate gains remained positive in each of our business segments, retention was strong and the business in total remained on par with last year’s quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter, and announced the increase in our regularly quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders.
Given that our operating dynamics this quarter were generally consistent with recent quarters, our call this morning is going to be somewhat different than in the past. We are still providing all of the same information in our presentation as we have previously, but we will not be going page by page with you, so as to have more time for questions.
Before turning over to Jay, I want to take just a minute to acknowledge and thank our claim department for all of their exceptional work, not only this quarter but over the last couple of years. In 2008, we had Ike Gustav in Dally, and while there were no major storms in 2009 it was still a quite active cat year. Of course, in the first quarter of 2010 we were again faced with an exceptional number of claims due to the multiple storms on the East Coast.
[Inaudible] and her entire claim team have been remarkably busy providing industry meeting customer service to our insureds, and again demonstrating our commitment to providing high quality service to all of our insureds during their greatest time of need.
With that, let me turn it over to Jay.

There are several points that I’d like to highlight relating to pages zero to seven, many of which you’ve heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong. All capital leverage and liquidity measures were half or better than target level.
Even after repurchasing $1.4 billion of our stock and paying dividends of $168 million in the quarter, holding company liquidity increased to over $3 billion, almost three times on a target level due to the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our parent company. Holding company liquidity is expected to move towards its target level during the remainder of the year as we continue our share repurchases.
Book value for share increased once again, and on an as reported basis operating income for the quarter did meet our expectations; that is operating performance ex the caps and ex the non-cap weather, and also adjusting for the favorable reserve development, but including net investment income, all of that was inline with our expectations going into the quarter. 
Despite the high cap losses and the relatively low yield on short term and non fixed income investments, we recorded a double digit operating ROE, and finally our results included one time tax charge of just under $12 million or approximately $0.02 per share, related to the recently and acted federal health care legislation that eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies.
Brian is now going to provide some color about our operating performance.

392856,99095166,57399,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Jay.

We have included on pages eight through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discussed with you. As Jay mentioned we are not going to go through each slide, but instead speaks more broadly about the significant drivers for the quarter leaving more time for question.
Obviously weather had a big impact on our results and will be the headline for the quarter. We had six domestic cat events, the two largest being the February snow storm in the Mid Atlantic that paralyzed Washington DC for several days; and then Easter in mid March that impacted New York, New Jersey and Southern New England. In addition there were several international events, the largest being the earthquake in Chile, so all-and-all a very active catastrophe quarter.
But looking beyond the near term impact of weather, our production in core underwriting results continue to perform very well. In business insurance, the tensions remain strong and were up slightly across the business, renewal pricing improved modestly, with pure rate continuing to be positive for the segment, exposure change on renewed accounts were still down, but the rate of decline moderated slightly from last quarter.
On the new business side, we feel good about the continued flow of new opportunities, particularly in middle market and the small end of select. New business writings in the quarter were down from prior year, primarily due to the pricing discipline we are maintaining in the larger end of the select business. This segment of the market has been particularly competitive and reduced writings here reflect that position.
On a written basis premiums are down, a direct result of the impact of the challenging economy on our customers. Some of that impact is seen in renewal premium statistics, but the majority comes from reduced audit premiums, and increased cancellations and endorsements. These impacts either emerge over the life of the policy or in the case of audits, aren’t reflected until the end of the policy period. 
Since we are generally auditing the accounts we wrote a full year ago, we expect this drag may continue to the next few quarters. As the economy stabilizes and eventually improves, we believe that based on our historical experience the audit premium will rebound. 
There are a lot of weather and prior year impacts in the combined ratio. Excluding these we are experiencing the modest deterioration we had expected. Frequency remains while claims severity is relatively benign, and pure loss trend is marginally outpacing our modest rate gains. This deterioration is somewhat larger than the 30 basis point change in the adjusted combined ratio on the slide, because the first quarter of 2009 does not include the positive impact of the adjustment we made to the full year ’09 combined ratio in the second half of last year. 
Moving to the financial professional and international segment, net written premiums after adjusting for the impact of changes and foreign exchange rates, were up significantly for the quarter. The primary driver of this increase was less seated premium year-over-year, resulting mainly from changes in the structure of our reinsurance, that directionally aligned retentions in our international business, with the company’s US retention practices, and to a lesser extent lower reinsurance costs. 
For the second consecutive quarter, we did see quarter over quarter growth in our construction surety book of business due to activity in our large national accounts market. In our international business, new business is up compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in marine and accident and special risk products and the like. 
Operating earnings in the quarter were down from the prior year quarter, as a result of our exposure to multiple international named events, primarily the Chilean earthquake. The losses we experienced were consistent with the fact the Chilean earthquake was the seventh largest recorded, and was 500 times stronger than the earthquake in Heidi.
Turning to personal auto, agency retention remains strong and the renewal premium change continued to be positive. New business improved significantly, and it was at the highest level in the last five quarters. We believe that the new business declines that we saw in the previous quarters were due to the fact that we were ahead of the market in seeking increased rate. You can see from the change in agency autos quarter-over-quarter combined ratio, that profitability has improved as rate gains are now outpacing the lost cost.   
Approximately one point of this improvement was attributable to lower frequency, which we believe was a result of the winter storms impact on miles driven. After normalizing for the quarter’s frequency, core auto margins are improving and well within company targets. 
Within agency property the story this quarter was clearly the weather. Adjusting for the weather the combined ratio for the quarter was modestly higher compared to the prior year quarter, a portion of which is the expected slight margin compression. This compression continues to be driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. 
Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. It continues to steadily grow with strong retention and continued positive renewal premium change, and new business is up significantly compared to the same quarter last year.
So even with an extraordinary number of catastrophic events in the quarter, we posted solid results. Core combined ratios remain within company targets, new business remains robust despite the challenging macro economic conditions; rate overall remains positive and retentions continue to be strong. 
We believe that these results are direct outcome of long-term capability and competitive advantages we have built, as exemplified by our claim response this quarter. These capabilities are sustainable and will continue to differentiate Travelers with independent agents, customers and brokers.
Now before I turn it back to Jay Benet, let me touch on an issue that’s gotten a good bit of press. On page 17, we’ve outlined why we believe our exposure to Chinese drywall will not be problematic. 
First, from a business profile prospective, we have no direct liability exposure to Chinese drywall manufacturers, and have virtually no general liability exposure to US residential contractors. In fact, we have no general liability exposure to 37 of the 38 US residential contractors identified in Bloomberg, and the one we do right has in SAR and our limits above that are minimal. 
On the homeowner side, we are disproportionately under represented in the states with significant impacts. So we do not expect the significant number of claims, but given our policy structure limits profile, we believe any losses should be contained.
Additionally, the fact that there is very strong product ID here its helpful. That is, we know where it is, where it came from, and when it got here, and all of this should help limit this claim activity. To date we’ve gotten 52 claims and we are comfortable our overall exposure is not problematic.
Now with that, let me turn it back to Jay Benet.

We are now assuming cat losses of $640 million after tax or $1.30 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first quarter and our original estimates for quarters two through four. 
No further estimates of prior year reserved development either favorable or unfavorable; a low single digit decrease in average invested assets ex-unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to share repurchases; full year share repurchases that are still in the range of $3.50 to $4.0 billion; and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards in the range of $490 million to $495 million shares, which is a bit higher than we what we had previously assumed through the impact of the recent increase in the price of our shares. 
Before I close, let me explain in response to several questions we have been asked, why we did not prerelease this quarter’s cat losses? We write cat exposures as part of the ordinary course of our business, and cat losses are just one of the number of items that could impact the quarter’s results. 
We think it is more informative generally to release all of our results together so that the information is presented in context. This is particularly true in a quarter like this, when the cat losses came from a number of relatively smaller events and we have losses from seven cats in the quarter as Brian said, some of which occurred very late in the quarter. 
It’s also our strong preference to take the time to acquire regular quarterly closing process to our result before we announce. This approach makes more sense for a company of the size that we are now, especially in a quarter when we had a number of moving pieces and our performance on an overall basis was generally consistent with our expectations. 
Finally this approach is also consistent with the overtime nature of the company’s stated financial objective, and our previously disclosed intention to stop giving guidance beyond this year. 
So with that, I believe Jay has a closing comment he would like to make.

You may have noticed that a number of our senior executives have over the last year or so, sold some of their shares and I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our views. 
Our senior executives receive a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of performance-based equity. As a result of that, as well as our recent performance, all of our named executive officers and substantially all of our senior executives, have equity positions that are well in excess of the company’s ownership requirements. This actually has been the case for quite some time. 
The recent financial crisis underscored for all of us the importance of prudent personal financial planning and diversification. Given this and our significant executive ownership, we don’t discourage executive sales driven by personal financial decisions, as long as the minimum share ownership requirements continue to be met.

Relative to lost trend, I think as Brian said earlier, the loss trend, it’s running at a benign levels. So probably running a little bit ahead of where the rate gains has been so. We would expect in terms of just the underlying trends in our business, if you see some margin compression of a modest amount in the BI segment. 
Now if you flip to the other extreme and look at Pi, Pi is in a different position. Pi has been experiencing rate gains for a period of time, and as those earn in and the loss costs remained pretty benign in that business, I think we’d see some margin expansion there, again all things being equal. All of this is going to be dependent upon the weather and loss activity that you heard of talk about from quarter to quarter, but I think just overall slight expansion.

We watched two primary factors, that the whole of our quote information, and we can clearly see that our quote flow is off and then we look at the competitiveness of our core activities, specifically in comparative raters and we can see that our closed ratio is also up this quarter. 
If you look at the stat supplement, you can see the output of that, that we do have sequential gain in TIF from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So as we’ve got those margins right in the middle of the target to where we want them to be, we are going to continue driving that growth and you can see that in some of the data that we reported this quarter.

As it relates to the first part of the question, looking at FDII -- now FDII goes through the same processes as the rest of our businesses. Each quarter we are looking at changes in actuarial views associated with very granular levels of our reserves, and whether it’s in international business or whether it’s in the bond in financial products business we’ll take positive of their reserve development or negative reserve development when see or need to do that.
I don’t think there is anything in particular that’s been driving the reserve development in FDII, but it has been depending upon the quarter partly bond and financial products and partly international. The longer the tail associated with the business the more we wait. 
So I think in the bond and financial products business it’s probably been more of the early 2000 type events that have been reserved for, and we have seen claim activities just doubling out a little lower than what our expectations were. 
As it relates to just the rest of the businesses, I am not sure I can really answer your question as to whether it’s development on case reserves versus rethinking of the IBNR, because as you know, as times go on, there is less and less IBNR and more cases. So we tend to look at it in its totality, but it’s the same phenomena. Whether it’s looked at by an individual business line or particular accident year, what we are seeing is that time has developed and on some of the longer tail lines we are seeing certainly favorable reserve development dealing with less payments of claims than we anticipated. 
Some of the development is the roll forward from older accident years to more current accident years, if in fact the reserve analysis is indicating that the original loss text were higher than what they would seem to be, but that’s not the major driver of it. The major driver is just looking at the claim exiting. I hope that responsive to your question.

The returns are not at levels that we want them to be, and we have been consistently public about seeking rate gains where we need them. So I didn’t mean to imply by that answer, that every product that we have met hurdles in every specific way. In a very general sense in responding to the question about the expense ratio overall, we feel pretty good about the overall returns that our portfolio products generate. 
It certainly doesn’t mean that we don’t have products where a competitive environment is such that strategically we are seeking rate, so that we can bring those products either into the range of acceptability and there is a number of those that are not further up into the range of acceptability to meet our long term hurdles.

There are several different dynamics operating there, but the two principle ones are audit premiums which one should think of as retrospective in nature. 
Clients make estimates of what their ratable factors at the inceptions of the policy, at the end of the policy we come in and we do an audit. It turns out that the ratable factors that might be payroll, it might be sales, it might be trucks on the road, but it turned out to be less than they had originally anticipated because of the speedy depth of decline in the economy, and so we have an audit premium return of previously written premium to us. We think of that as almost a retrospective adjustment. 
Then there is imbedded in our renewal business, change in exposure on a renewal basis, which is not always entirely factual, because once again clients make estimates of what their ratable factors will be, and it wouldn’t surprise any of us, if in fact given the economy that there is a tendency at the moment to continue to overestimate if you like, the impact of the economy and so it becomes, and under state the exposure which is something we believe is happening today, but we can’t prove it and we can’t obviously find it in the numbers. 
It will be interesting as the economy levels out and ultimately returns to what our sense is, that the retrospective audit premium dynamic will be the first to change, because in fact the catch up will occur, and then we will begin to see the renewal dynamic of exposure a little slower and a little bit longer, but those are two very different dynamics of the economy that just tend, given our arithmetic to be lump together, and maybe that’s helpful.

Ninea, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I think in Bryan’s comments he talked about us being in front of some of the rate cycle in late 2008 into 2009, and you can see that in our RPC statistics. We spend quite a bit of time really looking at filing activity across the country and understanding what the competitors are doing in terms of simple metrics like the ratio increases of filings to decreases. 
We seen an environment where increases are still outpacing decreases, and quite a bit closer to four to one right now. So as we moderate some of our rate; as the market moves with of those, probably to the levels that we were at in 2009, again as I talked about our “enclosed ratios” we can see we are becoming more competitive in the market place and feeling very good about our margins underneath that, and that’s driving some of the sequential growth.

Sometimes there are accounts that are in that market place, because the agent, that is the only way in the small commercial side they can access markets. 
So one of the other reasons why business moves out of excess and surplus lines, wholesales businesses into traditional distribution, is the agents hopefully for all appropriate reasons get appointed and come directly to us.

So our normal first quarter flow of weather events is always there, because there is always no storms and there is always a little bit of wind and there is always some of that, most of that got lumped into a cat and therefore we’ve got our offsetting benefit.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company’s reserves and other topic. 
The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involved risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers' operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that maybe non-GAAP financial measures.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase",480,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of nearly 10%. Included in this number was $0.61 a share in catastrophes arising out of the multiple storms in the Eastern United States, as well as the earthquake in Chile. 
Just to put this number in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the first quarter included in our previously provided guidance was about $0.13 a share. Offsetting the cats, we benefited from favorable prior-year development and our underlying performance from both underwriting and net investment income was a bit better than our expectations. The net result was operating income, which was in line with our expectations going into the quarter, allowing us to reaffirm our previously issued full year 2010 operating earnings per share guidance. Also, it's reflective of our continuing strong earnings power. 
In an environment which remained similar to last quarter in terms of both economic and insurance market conditions, our business dynamics remained solid and were generally consistent with recent operating experience. Renewal rate gains remained positive in each of our business segments, retention was strong and new business in total remained on par with last year's quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter and announced an increase in our regularly quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders. 
Given that our operating dynamics this quarter were generally consistent with recent quarters, our call this morning is going to be somewhat different than in the past. We're still providing all of the same information in our presentation as we have previously, but we will not be going page by page with you so as to allow more time for questions. 
Before turning over to Jay, I want to take just a minute to acknowledge and thank our claim department for all of their exceptional work, not only this quarter, but over the last couple of years. In 2008, we had Ike, Gustav and Dolly and while there were no major storms in 2009, it was still a quite active cat year. And of course, in the first quarter of 2010, we were again faced with an exceptional number of claims due to the multiple storms on the East Coast. Doreen Spadorcia and her entire Claim team  have been remarkably busy, providing industry-leading customer service to our insureds  and again demonstrating our commitment to providing high-quality service to all of our insureds during their greatest time of need. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay."

There are several points that I'd  like to highlight relating to Pages 4 to 7, many of which you've heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong, all capital leverage and liquidity measures",246,"Thanks, Jack. There are several points that I'd  like to highlight relating to Pages 4 to 7, many of which you've heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. 
First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong, all capital leverage and liquidity measures were at or better than target levels, even after repurchasing $1.4 billion of our stock and paying dividends of $168 million in the quarter, holding company liquidity increased to over $3 billion, almost 3x our target level due to the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our parent company. 
Holding company liquidity is expected to move towards its target levels during the remainder of the year as we continue our share repurchases. Book value per share increased once again. And on an as-reported basis, operating income for the quarter did meet our expectations. That is, operating performance ex the cats and ex the non-cat weather and also adjusting for the favorable reserve development but including net investment income, all of that was in line with our expectations going into the quarter. 
Despite the high cat losses and the relatively low yield on short-term and non-fixed income investments, we recorded a double-digit operating ROE. And finally, our results included a one-time tax charge of just under $12 million or approximately $0.02 per share, related to the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation that eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies. Brian is now going to provide some color about our operating performance."
392856,99095166,57455,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay. We have included on Pages 8 through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discussed with you. As Jay mentioned, we're not going to go through each slide, but instead, speak more broadly about the significant driv",1165,"Thanks, Jay. We have included on Pages 8 through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discussed with you. As Jay mentioned, we're not going to go through each slide, but instead, speak more broadly about the significant drivers for the quarter, leaving more time for questions. 
Obviously, weather had a big impact on our results and will be the headline for the quarter. We had six domestic cat events, the two largest being the February snowstorm in the Mid-Atlantic that paralyzed Washington D.C. for several days and the Nor'easter in mid-March that impacted New York, New Jersey and Southern New England. In addition, there were several international events, the largest being the earthquake in Chile. So all in all, a very active catastrophe quarter. 
But looking beyond the near-term impact of weather, our production and core underwriting results continued to perform very well. In Business Insurance, retentions remained strong and were up slightly across the business. Renewal pricing improved modestly, with pure rate continuing to be positive for the segment, exposure change on renewed accounts was still down. But the rate of decline moderated slightly from last quarter. 
On the new business side, we feel good about the continued flow of new opportunities, particularly in middle market in the small end of Select. New business writings in the quarter were down from prior year, primarily due to the pricing discipline that we are maintaining in the larger end of the Select business. This segment of the market has been particularly competitive and reduced writings here reflect that position. 
On a written basis, premiums are down. A direct result of the impact of the challenging economy on our customers. Some of that impact is seen in renewal premiums, statistics. But the majority comes from reduced audit premiums and increased cancellations and endorsements. These impacts either emerged over the life of the policy or in the case of audits, aren't reflected until the end of the policy period. 
Since we are generally auditing accounts we wrote a full year ago, we expect this drag may continue to the next few quarters. As the economy stabilizes and eventually improves, we believe that based on our historical experience, the audit premium will rebound. 
There are lot of weather and prior-year impacts in the combined ratio. Excluding these, we are experiencing the modest deterioration we had expected. Frequency remains low, claim severity is relatively benign and pure loss trend is marginally outpacing our modest rate gains. This deterioration is somewhat larger than the 30 basis point change in the adjusted combined ratio on the slide because the first quarter of 2009 does not include the positive impact of the adjustment we made to the full year '09 combined ratio in the second half of last year. 
Moving to the financial Professional & International segment. Net written premium, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, were up significantly for the quarter. The primary driver of this increase was less seeded premium year-over-year, resulting mainly from changes in the structure of our reinsurance that directionally align retentions in our international business with the company's U.S. retention practices. And to a lesser extent, lower reinsurance costs.
For the second consecutive quarter we did see quarter-over-quarter growth in our Construction Surety book of business due to activity in our large national accounts market. In our International business, new business is up compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to growth in marine and accidents and special list products in Lloyds. Operating earnings in the quarter were down from the prior-year quarter, as a result of our exposure to multiple international named events, primarily the Chile in earthquake. The losses we experienced were consistent with the fact that Chile in earthquake was the seventh largest reported and was 500x stronger than the earthquake in Haiti.
Turning to Personal Auto, agency retention remained strong and the renewal premium change continue to be positive. New business improved significantly and it was at the highest level in the last five quarters. We believe that the new business declines that we saw in the previous quarters were due to the fact that we were ahead of the market and seeking increased rates. 
You can see from the change in Agency Autos' quarter-over-quarter combined ratio, the profitability has improved as rate gains are now outpacing lost costs. Approximately one point of this improvement was attributable to lower frequency, which we believe was a result of the winter storms impact on miles driven. After normalizing for the quarter's frequency, core Auto margins are improving and well within company targets.
Within Agency Property, the story this quarter was clearly the weather. Adjusting for the weather, the combined ratio for the quarter was modestly higher compared to the prior-year quarter, a portion of which is the expected slight margin compression. This compression continues to be driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles.
Agency Property production results for the quarter continue to be strong, in spite of the difficult housing market. PIF continues to steadily grow with strong retention and continued positive renewal premium change. New business is up significantly compared to the same quarter last year. So even with an extraordinary number of catastrophic events in the quarter, we posted solid results. 
Core combined ratios remained within company targets, new business remains robust despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, rate overall remains positive and retentions continue to be strong. We believe that these results are a direct outcome of the long-term capability from competitive advantages we have built as exemplified by our claim response this quarter. These capabilities are sustainable and we'll continue to differentiate Travelers within dependent agents, customers and brokers.
Now before I turn it back to Jay Benet, let me touch on an issue that has gotten a good bit of press. On Page 17, we've outlined why we believe our exposure to Chinese drywall will not be problematic. First, from a business-profile perspective, we have no direct liability exposure to Chinese drywall manufacturers and have virtually no general liability exposure to U.S. residential contractors. In fact, we have no general liability exposure to 37 of the 38 U.S. residential contractors identified in Bloomberg and the one we do right has an SIR [ph]  And our limits above that are minimal. 
On the Homeowner side, we are disproportionately underrepresented in the states with significant impacts. So we do not expect a significant number of claims but given our policy structure limits profile, we believe any losses should be contained.  Additionally, the fact that there is very strong product ID here is helpful. That is, we know where it is, where it came from and when it got here.

We're now assuming cat losses of $640 million after tax or $1.30 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first quarter and our original estimates to quarters two through four. No further estimates of prior-year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, a low single-digit decrease and average invested assets, ex unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to share repurchases. 
Full year share repurchases, that are still in the range of 3.5 billion to 4.0 billion and the weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards in the range of 490 million shares to 495 million shares, which is a bit higher than what we had previously assumed, due to the impact of the recent increase in the price of our shares.
Before I close, let me explain in response to several questions we've been asked, why we did not pre-release this quarter's cat losses. We write cat exposures as part of the ordinary course of our business and cat losses are just one of a number of item that could impact the quarter's results. We think it is more informative generally to release all of our results together so that information is presented in context. This is particularly true in a quarter like this when the cat losses came from a number of relatively smaller events. And we have losses from seven cats in the quarter, as Brian said. Some of which occurred very late in the quarter. 
It's also our strong preference to take the time to acquire a regular quarterly closing process to our results before we announce. This approach makes more sense for a company of this size that we are now, especially in a quarter when we had a number of moving pieces on our performance on an overall basis was generally consistent with our expectations. Finally, this approach was also consistent with the over time nature of the company's stated financial objectives and are previously disclosed intention to stop giving guidance beyond this year. So with that, I believe Jay has a closing comments he'd like to make."

You may have noticed that a number of our senior executives have over the last year or so sold some of their shares and I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our views. 
Our senior executives received a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of performance-based equity. As a result of that, as well as our recent performance, all of our named executive officers and substantially all of our senior executives have equity positions that are well in excess of the company's ownership requirements. This actually has been the case for quite some time. 
The recent financial crisis underscored for all of us the importance of prudent, personal, financial planning and diversification. Given this and our significant executive ownership, we don't discourage executive sales driven by personal financial decisions as long as the minimum share ownership requirements continue to be met. And with that operator, we'll open it up for questions."

So we would expect, in terms of just the underlying trends in our business to see some margin compression of a modest amount in the BI segment. If you flip to the other extreme and look at PI, PI is in a different position. PI has  been experiencing rate gains for a period of time.

As it relates to the first part of the question, and looking at FPII, FPII goes to the same processes as the rest of our businesses. Each quarter, we're looking at changes in actuarial views associated with very granular levels of our reserves.

And I don't think there's anything in particular that's been driving the reserve development in FPII, but it has been a part of, depending upon the quarter, partly Bond and Financial products, and partly International. The longer the tail associated with the business, the more we wait. So I think in the Bond and Financial Products business, it's probably been more of the early 2000-type events that have been reserved for. And we've seen claim activity just settling out a little lower than what our expectations were. As it relates to just the rest of the businesses, I'm not sure I can really answer your question as to whether it's development on case reserves versus rethinking of the IBNR because as you know, as time goes on, less and less IBNR and more cases. And we tend to look at it in its totality, but it's the same phenomenon whether it's looked at by an individual business line or particular accident year. What we're seeing is that as time has developed, on some of the longer tail lines, we're seeing favorable reserve development that's dealing with less payments of claims than we anticipated. Some of the developments is the roll forward from older accident years to more current accident years if in fact the reserve analysis is indicating that the original loss picks were higher than what they would seem to be.

There are two -- several different dynamics operating there, but the two principal ones are audit premiums, which one should think of as retrospective in nature. Clients make estimates of what their ratable factors are at the inception of a policy. At the end of a policy, we come in and we do an audit. It turns out the ratable factors that might be payroll, it might sales, it might be trucks on the road. It turned out to be less than they had originally anticipated because of the speed and depth of the decline in the economy. And so we have an audit premium. They return a previously written premium to us. We think of that as almost a retrospective adjustment. Then there's embedded in our renewal business, change in exposure on a renewal basis, which is not always entirely factual because once again, clients make estimates of what their ratable factors will be. And it wouldn't surprise any of us if in fact, given the economy, that there's a tendency at the moment to continue to overestimate, if you like, the impact of the economy. And so it becomes difficult -- and understate the exposure, which is something we believe is happening today, but we can't prove it. We can't obviously find it in the numbers. And it'll be interesting as the economy levels out and ultimately returns to watch our census [ph] (44:04) that the retrospective audit premium dynamic will be the first to change because in fact, the catch-up will occur and then we'll begin to see the renewal dynamic of exposure a little slower and a little bit longer. But those are two very different dynamics of the economy that just tend, given our arithmetic, to be lumped together. And maybe that's helpful in thinking about it."

And the spending that we've done over the last several years has been long term, investment oriented, not action driven. The ramp up that we had in advertising has been very specifically behind our Direct-to-Consumer business where we're doing a lot more. The short story on our direct-to-consumer personal lines initiative is that it's a long-term program. We said that we would lose money along the way. We continue to lose money on it. In terms of driving customers from media to a quoting process, that's been actually pretty encouraging. So in the context of the effectiveness of the advertising, if the measure of it is the response that people have to it, that's actually been pretty good. Then the next learnings that we've had and we've spoken about it, next, really, is we have to take on in learning how to convert that response into higher numbers of quotes and then ultimately into higher number of sales.

Good morning, and welcome to the Travelers discussion of our first quarter 2010 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.
Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business in the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions.  
Before I turn it over to Jay, I’d like to draw your attention to the following on Page 1 of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company’s reserves and other topic. 
The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involved risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers' operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that maybe non-GAAP financial measures.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase",480,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of nearly 10%. Included in this number was $0.61 a share in catastrophes arising out of the multiple storms in the Eastern United States, as well as the earthquake in Chile. 
Just to put this number in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the first quarter included in our previously provided guidance was about $0.13 a share. Offsetting the cats, we benefited from favorable prior-year development and our underlying performance from both underwriting and net investment income was a bit better than our expectations. The net result was operating income, which was in line with our expectations going into the quarter, allowing us to reaffirm our previously issued full year 2010 operating earnings per share guidance. Also, it's reflective of our continuing strong earnings power. 
In an environment which remained similar to last quarter in terms of both economic and insurance market conditions, our business dynamics remained solid and were generally consistent with recent operating experience. Renewal rate gains remained positive in each of our business segments, retention was strong and new business in total remained on par with last year's quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter and announced an increase in our regularly quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders. 
Given that our operating dynamics this quarter were generally consistent with recent quarters, our call this morning is going to be somewhat different than in the past. We're still providing all of the same information in our presentation as we have previously, but we will not be going page by page with you so as to allow more time for questions. 
Before turning over to Jay, I want to take just a minute to acknowledge and thank our claim department for all of their exceptional work, not only this quarter, but over the last couple of years. In 2008, we had Ike, Gustav and Dolly and while there were no major storms in 2009, it was still a quite active cat year. And of course, in the first quarter of 2010, we were again faced with an exceptional number of claims due to the multiple storms on the East Coast. Doreen Spadorcia and her entire Claim team  have been remarkably busy, providing industry-leading customer service to our insureds  and again demonstrating our commitment to providing high-quality service to all of our insureds during their greatest time of need. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay."

There are several points that I'd  like to highlight relating to Pages 4 to 7, many of which you've heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong. All capital leverage and liquidity measures",246,"Thanks, Jack. There are several points that I'd  like to highlight relating to Pages 4 to 7, many of which you've heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. 
First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong. All capital leverage and liquidity measures were at or better than target levels. Even after repurchasing $1.4 billion of our stock and paying dividends of $168 million in the quarter, holding company liquidity increased to over $3 billion, almost 3x our target level due to the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our parent company. 
Holding company liquidity is expected to move towards its target levels during the remainder of the year as we continue our share repurchases. Book value per share increased once again. And on an as-reported basis, operating income for the quarter did meet our expectations. That is, operating performance x the cats and x the non-cat weather and also adjusting for the favorable reserve development but including net investment income, all of that was in line with our expectations going into the quarter. 
Despite the high cat losses and the relatively low yield on short-term and non-fixed income investments, we recorded a double-digit operating ROE. And finally, our results included a one-time tax charge of just under $12 million or approximately $0.02 per share, related to the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation that eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies. Brian is now going to provide some color about our operating performance."

We have included on Pages 8 through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discuss with you. As Jay mentioned, we're not going to go through each slide, but instead, speak more broadly about the significant driver",1163,"Thanks, Jay. We have included on Pages 8 through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discuss with you. As Jay mentioned, we're not going to go through each slide, but instead, speak more broadly about the significant drivers for the quarter, leaving more time for questions. 
Obviously, weather had a big impact on our results and will be the headline for the quarter. We had six domestic cat events, the two largest being the February snowstorm in the Mid-Atlantic that paralyzed Washington D.C. for several days and the Nor'easter in mid-March that impacted New York, New Jersey and Southern New England. In addition, there were several international events, the largest being the earthquake in Chile. So all in all, a very active catastrophe quarter. 
But looking beyond the near-term impact of weather, our production and core underwriting results continued to perform very well. In Business Insurance, retentions remained strong and were up slightly across the business. Renewal pricing improved modestly, with pure rate continuing to be positive for the segment, exposure change on renewed accounts was still down. But the rate of decline moderated slightly from last quarter. 
On the new business side, we feel good about the continued flow of new opportunities, particularly in middle market in the small end of Select. New business writings in the quarter were down from prior year, primarily due to the pricing discipline that we are maintaining in the larger end of the Select business. This segment of the market has been particularly competitive and reduced writings here reflect that position. 
On a written basis, premiums are down. A direct result of the impact of the challenging economy on our customers. Some of that impact is seen in renewal premiums' statistics. But the majority comes from reduced audit premiums and increased cancellations and endorsements. These impacts either emerged over the life of the policy or in the case of audits, aren't reflected until the end of the policy period. 
Since we are generally auditing accounts we wrote a full year ago, we expect this drag may continue to the next few quarters. As the economy stabilizes and eventually improves, we believe that based on our historical experience, the audit premium will rebound. 
There are lot of weather and prior-year impacts in the combined ratio. Excluding these, we are experiencing the modest deterioration we had expected. Frequency remains low, claim severity is relatively benign and pure loss trend is marginally outpacing our modest rate gains. This deterioration is somewhat larger than the 30 basis point change in the adjusted combined ratio on the slide because the first quarter of 2009 does not include the positive impact of the adjustment we made to the full year '09 combined ratio in the second half of last year. 
Moving to the financial Professional & International segment. Net written premium, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, were up significantly for the quarter. The primary driver of this increase was less seeded premium year-over-year, resulting mainly from changes in the structure of our reinsurance that directionally aligned retentions in our International business with the company's U.S. retention practices. And to a lesser extent, lower reinsurance costs.
For the second consecutive quarter, we did see quarter-over-quarter growth in our Construction Surety book of business due to activity in our large national accounts market. In our International business, new business is up compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to growth in marine and accidents and special risk products in Lloyds. Operating earnings in the quarter were down from the prior-year quarter, as a result of our exposure to multiple international named events, primarily the Chilean earthquake. The losses we experienced were consistent with the fact that Chilean earthquake was the seventh largest reported and was 500x stronger than the earthquake in Haiti.
Turning to Personal Auto, agency retention remained strong and the renewal premium change continue to be positive. New business improved significantly and it was at the highest level in the last five quarters. We believe that the new business declines that we saw in the previous quarters were due to the fact that we were ahead of the market and seeking increased rates. 
You can see from the change in Agency Autos' quarter-over-quarter combined ratio, that profitability has improved as rate gains are now outpacing lost costs. Approximately one point of this improvement was attributable to lower frequency, which we believe was a result of the winter storms impact on miles driven. After normalizing for the quarter's frequency, core Auto margins are improving and well within company targets.
Within Agency Property, the story this quarter was clearly the weather. Adjusting for the weather, the combined ratio for the quarter was modestly higher compared to the prior-year quarter, a portion of which is the expected slight margin compression. This compression continues to be driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles.
Agency Property production results for the quarter continue to be strong, in spite of the difficult housing market. PIF continues to steadily grow with strong retention and continued positive renewal premium change. New business is up significantly compared to the same quarter last year. So even with an extraordinary number of catastrophic events in the quarter, we posted solid results. 
Core combined ratios remained within company targets, new business remains robust despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, rate overall remains positive and retentions continue to be strong. We believe that these results are a direct outcome of the long-term capability from competitive advantages we have built, as exemplified by our claim response this quarter. These capabilities are sustainable and we'll continue to differentiate Travelers within dependent agents, customers and brokers.
Now before I turn it back to Jay Benet, let me touch on an issue that has gotten a good bit of press. On Page 17, we've outlined why we believe our exposure to Chinese drywall will not be problematic. First, from a business-profile perspective, we have no direct liability exposure to Chinese drywall manufacturers and have virtually no general liability exposure to U.S. residential contractors. In fact, we have no general liability exposure to 37 of the 38 U.S. residential contractors identified in Bloomberg and the one we do right has an SIR [ph]  And our limits above that are minimal. 
On the Homeowner side, we are disproportionately underrepresented in the states with significant impacts. So we do not expect a significant number of claims but given our policy structure limits profile, we believe any losses should be contained.  Additionally, the fact that there is very strong product ID here is helpful. That is, we know where it is, where it came from and when it got here. And all of this should help limit this various [ph] claim activity. To date, we've gotten 52 claims and we are comfortable -- our overall exposure is not problematic. 
Now with that, let me turn it back to Jay Benet."

We're now assuming cat losses of $640 million after tax or $1.30 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first quarter and our original estimates to quarters two through four. No further estimates of prior-year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, a low single-digit decrease and average invested assets, ex unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to share repurchases. 
Full year share repurchases, that are still in the range of 3.5 billion to 4.0 billion and the weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards in the range of 490 million shares to 495 million shares, which is a bit higher than what we had previously assumed, due to the impact of the recent increase in the price of our shares.
Before I close, let me explain in response to several questions we've been asked, why we did not pre-release this quarter's cat losses. We write cat exposures as part of the ordinary course of our business and cat losses are just one of a number of item that could impact the quarter's results. We think it is more informative generally to release all of our results together so that information is presented in context. This is particularly true in a quarter like this when the cat losses came from a number of relatively smaller events. And we have losses from seven cats in the quarter, as Brian said. Some of which occurred very late in the quarter. 
It's also our strong preference to take the time to acquire a regular quarterly closing process to our results before we announce. This approach makes more sense for a company of this size that we are now, especially in a quarter when we had a number of moving pieces on our performance on an overall basis was generally consistent with our expectations. Finally, this approach was also consistent with the over time nature of the company's stated financial objectives and are previously disclosed intention to stop giving guidance beyond this year. So with that, I believe Jay has a closing comments he'd like to make."

You may have noticed that a number of our senior executives have over the last year or so sold some of their shares and I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our views. 
Our senior executives received a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of performance-based equity. As a result of that, as well as our recent performance, all of our named executive officers and substantially all of our senior executives have equity positions that are well in excess of the company's ownership requirements. This actually has been the case for quite some time. 
The recent financial crisis underscored for all of us the importance of prudent, personal, financial planning and diversification. Given this and our significant executive ownership, we don't discourage executive sales driven by personal financial decisions as long as the minimum share ownership requirements continue to be met. And with that operator, we'll open it up for questions."

And of course, that will get earned in, along with the rate gains that we've seen in the first quarter. Relative to loss trend, I think as Brian said earlier, what loss trend, well, it's running at a benign level. It's still probably running a little bit ahead of where the rate gain has been. So we would expect, in terms of just the underlying trends in our business to see some margin compression of a modest amount in the BI segment. If you flip to the other extreme and look at PI, PI is in a different position. PI has  been experiencing rate gains for a period of time. And as those earned in and the lost cost remained pretty benign in that business, I think we'd see some margin expansion there. And again, all things being equal, all of this is going to be dependent upon the weather and loss activity that you've heard us talk about from quarter-to-quarter.

As it relates to the first part of the question, and looking at FPII, FPII goes to the same processes as the rest of our businesses. Each quarter, we're looking at changes in actuarial views associated with very granular levels of our reserves. And whether it's in the International businesses or whether it's in the Bond and Financial Products businesses, we'll take positive reserve development or negative reserve development when we see a need to do that. And I don't think there's anything in particular that's been driving the reserve development in FPII, but it has been a part of, depending upon the quarter, partly Bond and Financial products, and partly International. The longer the tail associated with the business, the more we wait. So I think in the Bond and Financial Products business, it's probably been more of the early 2000-type events that have been reserved for. And we've seen claim activity just settling out a little lower than what our expectations were. As it relates to just the rest of the businesses, I'm not sure I can really answer your question as to whether it's development on case reserves versus rethinking of the IBNR because as you know, as time goes on, less and less IBNR and more cases. And we tend to look at it in its totality, but it's the same phenomenon whether it's looked at by an individual business line or particular accident year. What we're seeing is that as time has developed, on some of the longer tail lines, we're seeing favorable reserve development that's dealing with less payments of claims than we anticipated. Some of the developments is the roll forward from older accident years to more current accident years if in fact the reserve analysis is indicating that the original loss picks were higher than what they would seem to be. But that's not the major driver of it. The major driver is just looking at the claim activity. I hope that's responsive to your question."

There are two -- several different dynamics operating there, but the two principal ones are audit premiums, which one should think of as retrospective in nature. Clients make estimates of what their ratable factors are at the inception of a policy. At the end of a policy, we come in and we do an audit. It turns out the ratable factors that might be payroll, it might sales, it might be trucks on the road. It turned out to be less than they had originally anticipated because of the speed and depth of the decline in the economy. And so we have an audit premium. They return a previously written premium to us. We think of that as almost a retrospective adjustment. Then there's embedded in our renewal business, change in exposure on a renewal basis, which is not always entirely factual because once again, clients make estimates of what their ratable factors will be. And it wouldn't surprise any of us if in fact, given the economy, that there's a tendency at the moment to continue to overestimate, if you like, the impact of the economy. And so it becomes difficult -- and understate the exposure, which is something we believe is happening today, but we can't prove it. We can't obviously find it in the numbers. And it'll be interesting as the economy levels out and ultimately returns to watch our senses that the retrospective audit premium dynamic will be the first to change because in fact, the catch-up will occur and then we'll begin to see the renewal dynamic of exposure a little slower and a little bit longer. But those are two very different dynamics of the economy that just tend, given our arithmetic, to be lumped together. And maybe that's helpful in thinking about it."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Given the very substantial second quarter weather losses for the entire property casualty industry of course for us, we were pleased with our performance this quarter reporting net income of a $1.35 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of 10.1%. Recognizing that our operating income of $1.39 per diluted share is about $0.11 below consensus estimates, I would like to make the following observations. First, the $0.11 differential equates to approximately $50 million after tax. I point out that for the first six months of the year we have an excess of $1.3 billion.
Secondly, the shortfall was attributable to second quarter weather losses which aggregated $285 million after tax or $0.58 per diluted share. To put that cost in context, we estimate for catastrophes for the second quarter included in our previously provided guidance was $92 million after taxes or $0.19 per diluted share. As best as we can tell consensus estimates included $0.22 per diluted share for second quarter catastrophe losses. To put the first half weather losses in context, we have already recorded $597 million of after tax catastrophe losses or $1.19 per diluted share. The methods used to estimate our expected annual catastrophe losses indicate an expected annual loss of $390 million after tax or $0.80 per diluted share for the entire 2010 year. So we have been after just six months we are now well in excess of our expected annual loss estimate for the full year.
Recognizing that we do not control the timing of weather, we just take these events in stride. There have been periods where catastrophe losses have been exceptionally low such as in 2006 and 7 and there were times when they ran abnormally high. We praise our product for the long term and weather will occur when it does. We do not believe this high level of catastrophe loss is in any way a result of changed underwriting standards or reinsurance practices and Brian is going to have more to say about our cap losses later.
Third, the quarter also benefited from $251 million or $0.51 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. Again as best as we can tell consensus estimate s for the quarter included $0.23 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. And just a reminder because development is so unpredictable we do not include it in any of our guidance. In terms of the operating environment for the second quarter, we remain quite pleased with our performance in our personal insurance segment both auto and home owners.
Given the amount of discussion at this time last year on our agency auto business, we are particularly pleased with the improving rate of change of policies enforced in personal insurance. Profitability in the first half improved versus last year and we are pleased that the actions taken to improve profitability which we spoke to you about this time last year are coming through in the results.
In our commercial businesses the operating environment really remained very similar to last quarter. Retention rates remained quite strong and rate on renewal business remained positive but it was at a lower level than in the first quarter. The negative impact of the economy on net written premiums has moderated somewhat from recent quarters and we are hopeful that this bodes well for future economic growth. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter and since the second quarter of 2006 we have now repurchased over $12 billion of our common stock. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders.
Given that municipal bonds have been receiving a lot of attention lately, we felt we would take a few minutes this morning to have Bill Heyman take the truth strategy and the tactical positioning behind our muni portfolio and demonstrate why we are comfortable with what we own. Our investment team has applied to our municipal portfolio the same very thoughtful approach to risk and reward that served us exceptionally well during the capital market crises over the last several years. I am sure you will find it helpful.
And with that let me turn it over to Jay.

There are a few points based on the data contained on pages 4 through 7 of the webcast that I would like to highlight this quarter. First is our strong balance sheet. All capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. Second is the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter and the payment of $173 million in common stock dividends. This brings a total cash we returned to our shareholders to $3.1 billion in the first half of this year.
Holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter down as planned from the $3 billion we held at the beginning of the quarter due to our share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our holding company. Another quarter in which we increased both value per share, operating performance, ex-cats [ph] and favorable prior year reserve development but including that investment income that was in line with our expectations.
Another quarter of net favorable reserve development in each of our segments mostly driven by business insurance where we are announcing better than expected loss results with property, worker's comp and commercial auto product lines and recent accident years and where we have reestimated unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves given recent loss results. And finally a double-digit ROE and operating ROE despite the record second quarter cap losses. I would also like to point out that we successfully renewed our cat treaties this quarter, keeping essentially the same structure but at a modestly lower cost. The new treaties are outlined on several pages on the webcast and are described more fully in our second quarter 10-Q which has been filed earlier today. So let us have Brian now discuss our operating performance.

Before I go into the business-specific results, a few comments on this quarter's catastrophe losses. As Jay mentioned, this was the highest level of second quarter catastrophe losses in our history so obviously a different weather quarter and it is on the heels of high first quarter catastrophe loss. In this quarter the activity was not of a national headline variety but it was a very active quarter with numerous significant events.
Page 8 lists out the 14 industry-designated cats for the second quarter of 2010 with initial property claim services or PCS essence [ph]. Although 14 second quarter events are not unusually high for the industry, the severity of the number of these events is clearly out of pattern. The initial industry estimates of 3.6 is very preliminary and based on reported activity to date. This will obviously develop up and we are confident that once fully developed this will be one of the largest industry catastrophe second quarters. As we look at our level of losses, we are confident that they are not a result of changes in our mixed business, selection process, geographic footprint, or public grant and we do not see anything that would indicate a fundamental change in weather patterns.
Slide 9 displays our first and second quarter catastrophe loss ratios for the last six years or since our first full year post merger. It shows that for 2010 both quarters were significantly above average level. Within the previous five years with the exception of the second quarter of 2008, catastrophe weather losses were relatively mild. Accordingly, we do not see 2010 as a trend but just another data point which we will factor into our assessment of risk and reward. So we are going to stay in the weather business and we will continue to actively manage our closure.
Now let me shift to discussing the segment results and I will start with business insurance. When excluding catastrophe unpredictability, underwriting income was very strong driven by continued favorable prior year reserve development. In the current year, loss trend continued to be fairly benign and consistent with our expectations. The renewal rate change on premium for the first half of the year has been slightly positive but is below loss trend and less than expected. So the impact on margins is slightly more than we anticipated.
Overall, net written premiums were down slightly in the quarter, but not down as much as earlier in the year. The negative impacts of the economy on our insureds, which we see in lower exposures and reduced audit premium continued but have moderated from earlier levels.    So, now I will turn to pricing, and if unpredictability has been the message with the weather, stability is the message in our aggregate domestic commercial insurance pricing.
Slide 11 grasps our renewal premium change and splits out the [inaudible] rate and exposure change components. The short story here is that nothing is really changing. Overall renewal premium change on guaranteed cost business was essentially flat, with a modest improvement in exposure change, offsetting the modest decline in rate change. These overall trends are fairly consistent on an individual business basis, but as always, there are differences, and I would like to highlight a few things.
Starting with Slide 12, and select accounts. We have been getting some good premium increases and retentions have been consistent, but a few points below where we historically have been. New business has been mixed with strong results in smaller accounts, but in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, lower new business levels in Express Plus.
In the second quarter, we moderated our pricing strategy and believe this helped boost our Express Plus new business in the quarter. On the renewal book, we typically work 90 days in advance. So, any impact on retention will start in the third quarter. Overall, we continue to feel very good about our Select Express platform and how we are positioned in this market.
In commercial accounts, retentions have remained very strong and the renewal premium change has improved modestly, going from a slight negative to a slight positive.
If you look at the commercial accounts chart at the bottom of page 13, you can see that there's essentially flat premium change as a result of improving exposure changes and slightly lower rate changes. When negotiating the renewal, we are negotiating both the pure rate and total premium with the accounts. As the impact of the economy on our customers' exposures has become less negative, it has become increasingly more difficult to negotiate a rate increase, especially when it would result in an overall premium increase.
New business results for commercial accounts were down compared to the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of last year, our new business writings benefited from the marketplace disruption caused by the financial distress of several of our competitors. Absent this impact, the results reflect a normal seasonality of our business. Our new business flow has stabilized at record levels, with quote rates slightly and close rates down slightly. Given these dynamics, we continue to be very pleased with our new business performance.
In other business insurance, retentions have remained very strong or price change for both the rate and exposure have moved more significantly than the overall commercial business. These pricing impacts are primarily driven by our large property business, with some significant softening in rates but improvement in exposure. As competitive pressures in this class of business increased in the coming quarter driven by ample reinsurance capacity and a benign 2009 hurricane season, we made a conscious decision to maximize our retention on this business and not push rates on large property accounts. Similarly large property new business became increasingly more competitive with aggressive concessions to expiring terms and conditions frequently required to motivate accounts to leave their current carrier and we are not willing to make these concessions.
In summary, we continue to prudently manage each of our businesses and adjust our actions to the unique needs. But in the aggregate, the results are not different than our recent experience, that is, solid retentions, relatively stable pricing, and a strong flow of new business opportunities.
In the financial, professional, and international insurance segment, the core underwriting margins were generally stable in the quarter as the marginal rate gains essentially offset slightly increasing loss trends. Additionally, the underwriting margins benefited from a reduction in surety reinsurance cost associated with prior year reinsurance [trading].
Net written premiums, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates were down for the quarter. In some of our management liability lines of business and in some of our international lines, we believe pricing is not consistent with our profitability targets, so our writings in those lines are down.
Turning to production statistics on page 16, although renewal premium change is slightly negative in both management liability and international, for most of the businesses contained here, we have achieved positive rate gains.
Turning to personal insurance. In agency, auto, our underwriting margin, after adjusting for the impact of tax, and prior year developments, improved quarter-over-quarter, as rate gains once again outpaced loss cost trends. Within agency, property, we have been speaking to you for sometime regarding the slight margin compression, driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. As the rate gains we achieved in recent quarters continue to earn through our property business, we have crossed an inflection point, where in the second quarter our rate improvement outpaced loss cost trends.
Agency, auto new business improved in the second quarter as we reintroduced our 12-month policy. As we have become more confident in our new business products and are consistently within target returns, we felt it was appropriate to reintroduce a longer term policy. The aggregate timing impact of this additional six months of written premium was about $30 million in the quarter. As the rollout of this product is completed, the impact on our new business written premiums will increase throughout 2010. More significantly, we are pleased with the improving rate of change in policies in force. We believe the PIF change is a result of our improved competitive position compared to third and fourth quarter of 2009.
Agency, property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. Quarter-over-quarter PIF growth was at the highest level since third quarter of 2007. Retention improved two points, and new business is up 15% compared to the same quarter last year.
Given the expansion in core underwriting margins and the strong topline trends in these products, we are very pleased with both our current and going forward marketplace position in personal insurance.
So, let me sum it up. Weather has been bad. But it's a big part of our business, and the one thing we know for sure is that it will change. The commercial marketplace, both domestic and international is fairly stable. We obviously wish it was improving, but we feel great about our position and are confident we will maximize the opportunity. And in personal insurance, we are encouraged by the trends both for us and the industry.
With that, let me now turn it over to Bill Heyman to discuss our tax-exempt portfolio.

Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press, I thought I would spend a few minutes discussing the sector in general and our portfolio in particular. As you know, we have a tax-exempt portfolio of about $41 bi",1232,"Thanks Brian. Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press, I thought I would spend a few minutes discussing the sector in general and our portfolio in particular. As you know, we have a tax-exempt portfolio of about $41 billion. You may not know that of that about $7 billion consists of bonds which have been pre-refunded, which means they have been [inaudible] maturity or their first call date usually with US treasury securities. Still the $34 billion remaining constitutes about half of our fixed income portfolio.
The first observation I make is that we have fortunately always starting long before credit cards became an issue, viewed taxes and credits as credits first, without regard to any advantages or taxes [inaudible]. While optimization of the alternative minimum tax provides a target allocation, it's not a bucket we feel we must fill regardless of quality. And a general obligation of the school district competes with the corporate bond or mortgage-backed security for investing dollars. We scrutinized closely not only the creditworthiness of the issuer but the nature of the obligation. For example, in some cases, revenue bonds could be stronger than [GOs] and vice versa. Furthermore, where issuers have enhanced their creditworthiness with bond insurance, we've always ignored it. The result was that several years ago, when the bond insurers more or less simultaneously lost their AAA ratings, we did not make portfolio changes.
The result of high credit underwriting standards means that our portfolio does not closely resemble the broad market. For example, we own about 23 million of municipal healthcare revenue bonds, or about one-tenth of 1% of our portfolio. Such bonds represent roughly 7% of the broad market and since 1970, 39% of all municipal defaults have been in the healthcare sector. Conversely, we are overweighted in pre-refunded bonds, states and local general obligation bonds and water and sewer bonds. Recent focus on general obligation bonds relates to the potential for these bonds to be treated like senior unsecured debt with bondholders becoming general creditors alongside employees, retirees and vendors.
The general credit [at construct] is most descriptive of general obligation bond issued by states and general funds act like pools collecting revenues from a wide range of taxes and paying salaries, making pension contributions, paying vendors, as well as servicing their general obligation debt.
In contrast, this construct is probably not descriptive of many local general obligation bonds. We expect that in its premises where there is a many local GOs would be treated as secured creditors based upon legal presidents and the provisions of Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code which provides that the security interest in special revenues remains valid and enforceable in bankruptcies.
As you know most school district general obligation bonds are specifically authorized by voters and validate issuance [ph]. This authorization allows the pledge of ad valorem taxes to be levied on all taxable property within the school districts without limitation as to greater amount. The collection of these taxes is generally segregated in the debt service fund outside of the general fund and these funds can only be used to service the authorized debt and are not available that can ask the general purposes of this school.
The unlimited in nature and segregation of this debt service, tax revenue contrast sharply with the school districts other property tax revenues which are statutorily limited and commingled with its state peoples funding and used for operations. In addition to assembling the portfolio selectively, we manage it actively. The portfolio contains approximately 8000 discrete securities but have only 925 issuers. They're over 50,000 issuers in the municipal markets.
We have general obligation bonds of (inaudible) 75 cities, there are over 5300 in the Bloomberg database. So we feel we know our cities well. We monitor closely financial position and operations of our credits, while it is true that we are basically buying to hold investors. We have in the past year reduced often substantially, positions and issuers with credit worthiness as in our view deteriorated. So I would add we believe it even those issues we sold are overwhelmingly likely to pay every dollar on time.
As we demonstrated two years ago with our mortgage portfolio, we do not blindly rely on ratings, but it is nonetheless worth noting that roughly 50% of our municipal portfolio holdings which are not funding having an average AAA rating from Moody's S&P and Fitch, compared to only 17% of the broad market. Almost 96% are rated AA3 or higher, only 4%, 4.3% are rated A or lower compared to 33% in the index.
Rating agencies are looking at the same challenging economic budget and spending dynamics affecting state and local governments that all of us are, yet the ratings of our holdings remain very strong. A recent publication my Moody's points out that over the entire period 1970 to 2009, the riskiest 20% of municipal issuers measured by ratings accounted for 86% of all defaulters. Our portfolio contains approximately $7.2 billion in state general obligations with only about $330 million in the headwind [ph] states of California, Illinois and New York.
The table in the webcast contains the aggregate holdings and the average ratings of our top 16 states. With the exception of our holdings from California which averages AA2, the average rating for each state is AA1 or higher. The general obligation bonds of the top five states totaled $1.4 billion. All that said we have purchased very few big state GOs in recent years and have sold a few recently.
The other slide in the webcast presents the runoff of our state GOs based on current market yields for those borrowers and the coupons structure of our holdings nearly 70% of our state GOs will mature or will be called by 2015. For local general obligation bonds from the top five states totaled $6.4 billion and the revenue bonds from these states totaled $3.6 billion.
Our general obligation bonds and issuers other than states consists towards school district exposures with the moderate number of counties, cities, community college districts and other special districts. As we just discussed the nature of these obligations is such that most could be considered as obligations sent through by a pledge or revenue from ad valorem property taxes levied without limitation to greater amount.
As we have discussed previously a fixed income portfolio exist first and foremost to ensure our commitment to our policy holders. We underwrite the invested risks assumed in our portfolios with careful consideration of the tradeoff between risk and returns. Just as in the other fixed income assets, we do not reach for yield in our municipal portfolio in attempt to outperform our benchmark, lose investment manager's compensation or for any other reason. We expect our fixed income assets, including our municipal portfolio, to provide adequate risk adjusted returns and support our insurance operations in pursuit of maximizing wealth for shareholders over the long term. Obviously, history may not be indicative of the future and ratings cannot be relied upon with certainty, but we believe our portfolio is strong and we wouldn't trade it for anyone else's. We can certainly have losses in our municipal portfolio, and even material losses, but even due to the prism of recent events, we feel very comfortable with what we own.
Let me turn it over now to Jay Benet.

Well, let's discuss updated guidance for the full year. We've got information on Page 22 of full year 2010 fully diluted operating income per share, which has now been refined from the previous range of $5.20 to $5.55 to a new range of $5.20 to $5.45, which is a $.10 reduction of the upper-end of the range that primarily resulted from commercial-renewal premium increases in 2010, not meeting our original expectations which we believe is attributable to the impact of the continuing difficult economic environment. In round numbers, this range for operating income should still translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11% as we've said before.
We continue to anticipate some accident near-loss ratio deterioration on a consolidated basis for full year 2010, ex cuts, as we expect loss-cost increases to modestly outpace projected earned-rate increases in our commercial businesses for the full year. So in your modeling, please remember that the second half of last year included favorable re-estimations of current year-loss ratios for first half 2009 losses, so quarterly loss ratio comparisons for 2010 versus 2009, must take this into consideration.
We're now assuming cut losses of $835 million after tax or $1.71 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cut losses to the first half and our original estimates for the second half of the year, no further estimates of prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable, below single-digit decrease in average investment assets ex unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to the share repurchases of full-year share repurchases of $4 billion, and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases in employee equity awards of approximately 487 million shares.
So with that, why don't we open it up for Q&A?

First on the share buyback, we have historically scaled back in the third quarter, a pending, obviously, catcheese and of course it seems to us like we've already endured two quarters of that season already. My recollection was that the original estimates of share buyback included in the guidance was $3 billion, $4 billion and - $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And essentially we are still largely on that target for the moment. We may alter that as we go into the quarter, depending upon second half of the year that is, depending upon earnings, depending upon whether our reserve development can extend to the course and all that. But nonetheless, it's a plan that we embraced beginning of the year and for the moment we're sticking to it.
Your second question and maybe Brian and I will ham and egg this a little bit. We certainly can't approve this to you, it's largely anecdotal. It's from sitting with conversations with our field folks and I'm speaking now about your question regarding the commercial insurance environment.
Our census is that there isn't anything that has particularly changed competitively. You all seem to be fixated all the time, have some company or companies change their pricing strategy or tactics, we certainly don't see that and have no evidence of it.
What we are hearing from our field folks is that as exposure is leveling out and it was - a comment I made earlier was that it looks as though exposure is trying to get back to zero broadly speaking in the commercial lines businesses is that it's getting more challenging to get rate increases.
If you're a customer you really don't focus on the granular dynamics that make up your price, your premium. You're really not all that worried about how much is exposure and how much is rate change and all that nonsense, what you as a customer tend to look at is, is my premium going up or down in its simplest form and as exposure flattens out to the extent that you try and get rate gains you're asking for a premium increase in this economic environment or census is that it's getting just more challenging to pass that rate increase on.
There is more or little more resistance both from the intermediaries, the agents and brokers as well as the customers to accepting meaningful rate increases. Now it's interesting, we didn't present the data but we certainly do look at the distribution of rate gains in our middle market business each and every quarter. We've shared that with you previously and to the extent they are lost dynamics at work to the extent that an account has loss experience, that's different more problematic than what it had originally been expected. We do get rate gains. There are still significant accounts where we'll see a plus five or even a plus 10 rate gain but it largely is loss driven. It's not in effect margin or profitability driven.
So, I'd love to hear if Brian has any comment but our census is that the margin picture broadly in our commercial businesses is modestly deteriorating, that it's and that is that our ability to get rate in the aggregate is a little bit less than what you're experiencing broadly speaking in loss trends.
So that's the way that we would I think I'd answer.

So we certainly wouldn't want to make the statement that as long as exposures are coming up we can never get rate changes. If you think of where the psyche of our typical commercial customer is today they saw the economy take a big dip, they saw their business by and large take a big dip.
The good news is, if we look at our total portfolio they're kind of back to not dipping anymore. They're not yet back to growing or anything close to robustly growing and in that mindset they saying they're going - again, loss experience being neutral we're going to struggle with premium increases. So that's the dynamic we're seeing today.

When we went back, you go back to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, which obviously contemplated normal tax and no reserve development, the return on equity that we were projecting for the year was about 11% and in the context of the environment we're in, both the investment environment and important to remember the investment environment combined with the economic environment, that's a pretty good return.
It's difficult for us to plead that profitability measures in our business are inadequate and as a consequence we need to improve margins in this investment and economic environment to the extent that we're capable of producing an 11% return on equity we feel pretty good.
So, we continue to try and keep rate where most importantly where the loss experience demonstrates that we should and to the extent that we can improve our profitability dynamic as we move forward we'll continue to do that but it's not as if we're starting from a point of impaired profitability in any way, it's a pretty strong franchise and a pretty strong profit picture in the context of that environment.

In terms of the other assets, the results of the quarter where it could be the more [ph] to strong distributions in private equity, cash flow from the portfolio for the first six months was about even that means distribution equal capital contributions, which is better than we would have expected and there was a lot of net investment income gain in the results that we saw.
Hedge funds made money but not very much, made a couple of points better than the broad index. Our hedge fund portfolio was only about 470 million, it was 1.6 billion at the time of our merger. And frankly we find it difficult to put an ex-ante facto, which managers will do well and which won't. So we have handful of relationships of longstanding.
In real estate, a lot of our funds had marked down properties probably excessively and the first half of the year reflected a balance in evaluations excluding municipals. I agree with you, one can argue both sides of the equation forcefully.
We think about this issue everyday but I would add we're not talking our book because we can't get out of where we are. If we decided that instead of 34 billion, forget the (inaudible) for the moment instead of 34 billion it ought to be 20 billion or 25 billion. The quality of our holdings would permit us to make that adjustment and the market is very firm, frankly it's firm, it's very firm even in credits we wouldn't buy.
In terms of the risks in the sector and I think I alluded to this at investor day in May. I think the risks are less of economic default but even with states with big budget problems are when you analyze them is not very heavily taxed.
The risks are that some jurisdictions will seek, if a court allows them, it may not to, repudiate their debt simply because they choose not to increase taxes or cut budgets.
I think with respect to larger jurisdictions the possibility of it is pretty remote. It is one thing to only have access to the capital market at a higher price and frankly most jurisdictions haven't even faced that penalty yet. It is another to lose access to the capital market altogether, which is what would happen in a political repudiation.
So I agree, the issue is not free from doubt and our take on it can be disputed but it's not (inaudible).

So it always feels good when it happens.
Of course, it feels terrific when your results are impacted this way and certainly it's a whole lot better than underestimating the loss cost, which means, you're under pricing your product and that's really a disaster. But we really try hard to get it right, because in the end, what we're about is trying to grow a business and getting it right is what's going to help us do that the best.

When you look at the components that makeup the reserve development, frequency continues to be behaving in a way that when you go through the reserve setting process, you come up with as soon as what frequency is going to be and it's behaving better than that. And that's been a trend that's been going on for a while.
When actuaries and finance people are looking at what the reserve process should be as it relates to favorable frequency and work with their business partners in terms of pricing and everything. If you look at what the current trends are, you wonder are things are going to get better than they are when you're at a favorable position.
And sometimes you just look at it and say, “Well, they're pretty good. And I can't imagine them getting better and sometimes they do.” So that's been a part of it. We're in a very low inflationary environment today. And looking out several years as to what severity is going to be, it's just a little bit of a change in the inflationary outlook is going to have an impact as well. So you have to go back to what's the some base upon which all of this is being done and on a gross basis, our reserves are in excess of $50 billion. So that's absolute level of these changes in terms of percentage point are very, very low. But given the nature of that reserve base, they impact the income statement as you've seen but as Jay said, each one of these quarters, we're doing best estimates of what we see out there using all the information and there's the changes. We just update the reserves.

Because if you look at where the development has come from not just in this quarter but over a good period of time, I'd say two things. First on the liability side where we had a lot of favorable reserve development, one of the toughest things to estimate that over time is where that sort of environment fell in and what the sustainable impact of that is. And so, that's been a big variable driving our improvement and at the same time, over and again, this is a five to six-year kind of statement.
We've done a lot in our liability claim process that we think has helped the way we do business and service our customers and we think that's had a pretty strong impact there. But it takes time to see the impact of those things coming through the lost data and so that's been driving it. And then the other area is workers' comp which has continued, again, I always say this with comp - very much a state-by-state gain. But in the aggregate where we play, we continued to see some favorable moves there and frequency dynamics that Jay Benet talked about but comp would be an area where that's really been true - just trying to look at those frequency trends and project forward what do we think they're going to be in the future.

Obviously one has to rethink all those returns. If we are in a protracted period at very low interest rates, we may all - all of us is going to be stuck in the mindset in what these assets are going to make in the world before 2008. But those are of course fact numbers.;

And to the extent that you are, how confident would you be to really act upon that in terms of your forward pricing? You know, I think of the personal auto industry 10 years ago where, in other words, we were about to experience several years of abrupt defalling frequency and I think some of the more aggressive companies like Progressive had wished that they had been able to fully anticipate that to really grow their book.

There are long-tail lines where you take a deep breath obviously before you embrace an emerging trend. And I'm going to make an example, in workers' comp, we are still contemplating meaningful medical inflation. We're not pricing our product. We talk all the time that benign lost cost and inflation, you should always be excluding medical work in medical portion of workers comp. But we assume a robust inflation rate and we'll obviously see how that works out.
Generally speaking, I think a couple of individual exceptions Brian talked about, asphalt shingles which a number of carriers have highlighted because it's a by-product price of oil. That loss cost trends severity have, broadly speaking, been awfully benign. That doesn't mean zero. It doesn't mean that we don't see some embedded inflation in lines of business. And we, as the shorter the tail of that business is, the more we're willing to embrace it and incorporate it into our pricing because if we're long, it doesn't take long before we can reprice the product. The same thing holds true for frequency.
In many lines of business, there has been a long-term systemic decline in frequency and I would actually say that it's gotten - well we've been chasing it. You ask the question all the time as frequency comes down, is it making a new level or is it going to return back to previous levels, not only in from a pricing perspective but also from the reserving perspective as well. I think the same thing holds true to the extent that these are shorter-tail lines of business. We're pretty aggressive in embracing and to the extent that they are longer-tail, we're a little more reluctant to move in that direction.
I think one of the things that's affected workers' compensation, I can't prove. It's just the data that we look at is that as our economy has moved increasingly to a service-based environment, frequency and workers' comp has come down. They've done another great surprise to people. And so that sort of a dynamic, that element, if you feel more comfortable embracing so it's very line specific. And I think it's difficult to generalize if there's a line that you're particularly interested in, you can attempt to answer.

I, at first, I certainly don't think that the insurance industry ignores investment returns as we price our products, we are driven by available investment returns in the marketplace. When - shortly after the crisis, when the world sort of settled back down and we were confronted with a different kind of fixed income environment than had existed , the real question was will you go into knee jerk react to a changing interest rate environment, causing disruption to agents, brokers, customers and all of your distribution. Who are you going to take a deep breath and see what would happen to investment returns over time.
I've spoken about this earlier, it was our decision to take this in the longer view and not to knee jerk. Now 18 months ago and attempt to drive pricing up in some very dramatic fashion, I think that would have been not only highly disruptive, but candidly not very successful. That would be a strategy that I think would have failed. Now I think, and again, this is how we perceive it, you can certainly ask other companies what their view is. It may very well be that this economic malaise, such as it is, is longer rather than shorter and it may very well that this investment environment is a consequence, longer rather than shorter. And we are in, as I said the early stages of really thinking through the implications of that. It's a long view - we speak about returns over time. We try hard not to get tangled up and candidly this quarter, next quarter. But we managed this business to generate returns over time, and one of the questions that we long to ask ourselves is, in the investment environment that's available and given other investments? We recognize that we compete against other investments, including investments that are fixed income.
We have land numbers of 3% yield at the moment, what are the implications of that? How do we think about our company? And what do we strive to produce for investors in a very different investment environment that existed even a couple of years ago. And it's a very legitimate question and we're ankle-deep in it at the moment as we try and weigh our weight through it. It's complex. Obviously, no one company can adopt the strategy that's disruptive in the marketplace and thinks somehow that it will be successful. We operate in a very competitive environment. So you have to balance all of those factors. More to follow, I just know immediate, clear answers about that issue, but a very relevant question.

392856,108550544,68716,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Given the very substantial second quarter weather losses for the entire property/casualty industry and, of course, for us, we were pleased with our performance this quarter repo",704,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Given the very substantial second quarter weather losses for the entire property/casualty industry and, of course, for us, we were pleased with our performance this quarter reporting net income of $1.35 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of 10.1%. 
Recognizing that our operating income of $1.39 per diluted share is about $0.11 below consensus estimates, I'd like to make the following observations. First, the $0.11 differential equates to approximately $50 million after-tax. I'd point out that for the first six months of the year, we've earned an excess of $1.3 billion. 
Secondly, the shortfall was attributable to second quarter weather losses, which aggregated $285 million after-tax or $0.58 per diluted share. To put that cost in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the second quarter included in our previously provided guidance was $92 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share. As best as we can tell, consensus estimates included $0.22 per diluted share for second quarter catastrophe losses. 
To put the first half weather losses in context, we've already recorded $597 million of after-tax catastrophe losses or $1.19 per diluted share. The methods used to estimate our expected annual catastrophe losses indicate an expected annual loss of $390 million after-tax or $0.80 per diluted share for the entire 2010 year. So even after just six months, we are now well in excess of our expected annual loss estimate for the full year. 
Recognizing that we don't control the timing of weather, we just take these events in stride. There have been periods where catastrophe losses have been exceptionally low such as in 2006 and '07, and there were times where they run abnormally high. We price our product for the long term, and weather will occur when it does. We don't believe this high level of catastrophe loss is in anyway a result of changed underwriting standards or reinsurance practices, and Brian is going to have more to say about our cat losses later. 
Third, the quarter also benefited from $251 million or $0.51 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. Again, as best as we can tell, consensus estimates for the quarter included $0.23 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. And just a reminder, because development is so unpredictable, we don't include it in any of our guidance. 
In terms of the operating environment for the second quarter, we remain quite pleased with our performance in our Personal Insurance segment, both Auto and Homeowners. Given the amount of discussion this time last year on our Agency Auto business, we're particularly pleased with the improving rate of change of policies enforced in Personal Insurance. Profitability in the first half improved versus last year, and we're pleased that the actions taken to improve profitability, which we spoke to about this time last year, are coming through in the results. 
In our Commercial businesses, the operating environment really remained very similar to last quarter. Retention rates remained quite strong, and rate on renewal business remained positive but it was at a lower level than in the first quarter. The negative impact of the economy on net written premiums has moderated somewhat from recent quarters, and we're hopeful that this bodes well for future economic growth. 
We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter. And since the second quarter of 2006, we've now repurchased over $12 billion of our common stock. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders. 
Given that municipal bonds have been receiving a lot of attention lately, we felt we'd take a few minutes this morning to have Bill Heyman to take you through the strategy and the tactical positioning behind our muni portfolio and demonstrate why we're comfortable with what we own. Our investment team has applied to our municipal portfolio the same very thoughtful approach to risk and reward that served us exceptionally well during the capital market crises over the last several years. I'm sure you'll find it helpful. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Jay"

There are few points based on the data contained on Pages 4 through 7 of the webcast that I'd like to highlight this quarter. 
First is our strong balance sheet. All capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. Second is the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter and the payment of $173 million in common stock dividends. This brings the total cash we returned to our shareholders to almost $3.1 billion in the first half of this year. 
Holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter, down as planned from the $3 billion we held at the beginning of the quarter due to our share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our holding company. Another quarter in which we increased book value per share. Operating performance, x cats [catastrophes] and favorable prior year reserve development, but including net investment income, that was in line with our expectations. 
Another quarter of net favorable reserve development in each of our segments, mostly driven by Business Insurance, where we are now seeing better-than-expected loss results for property, workers' comp and commercial auto product lines in recent accident years and where we have re-estimated unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves given recent loss results. And finally, a double-digit ROE and operating ROE despite the record second quarter cat losses. 
I'd also like to point out that we successfully renewed our cat treaties this quarter, keeping essentially the same structure but at a modestly lower cost. The new treaties are outlined on several pages in the webcast, and it's the described more fully in our second quarter 10-Q, which has been filed earlier today. 
So let's have Brian now discuss our operating performance."
392856,108550544,68716,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay. Before I go into the business-specific results, a few comments on this quarter's catastrophe losses. As Jay mentioned, this was the highest level of second quarter catastrophe losses in our history. So obviously a difficult weather quarter, a",1544,"Thanks, Jay. Before I go into the business-specific results, a few comments on this quarter's catastrophe losses. As Jay mentioned, this was the highest level of second quarter catastrophe losses in our history. So obviously a difficult weather quarter, and it's on the heels of high first quarter catastrophe losses. In this quarter, the activity was not of the national headline variety, but it was a very active quarter with numerous significant events. 
Page 8 lists out the 14 industry-designated cat for the second quarter of 2010 with initial Property Claim Services, or PCS, estimates. Although 14 second quarter events is not unusually high for the industry, the severity of a number of these events is clearly out of pattern. The initial industry estimates of $3.6 billion is very preliminary and based on reported activity to date. This will obviously develop up, and we are confident that once fully developed, this will be one of the largest industry catastrophe second quarters. As we look at our level of losses, we're confident that they are not a result of changes in our mix of business, selection process, geographic footprint or coverage grant and we don't see anything that would indicate a fundamental change in weather patterns. 
Slide 9 displays our first and second quarter catastrophe loss ratios for the last six years, or since our first full year post-merger. It shows that for 2010, both quarters were significantly above average level. Within the previous five years, with the exception of the second quarter of 2008, catastrophe weather losses were relatively mild. Accordingly, we don't see 2010 as a trend but just another data point, which we will factor into our assessment of risk and reward. So we're going to stay in the weather business, and we'll continue to actively manage our exposure.
Now let me shift to discussing the segment results, and I'll start with Business Insurance. When excluding catastrophe unpredictability, underwriting income was very strong driven by continued favorable prior-year reserve development. In the current year, loss trend continued to be fairly benign and consistent with our expectations. The renewal rate change on premium for the first half of the year has been slightly positive but is below loss trend and less than expected. So the impact on margins is slightly more than we anticipated. 
Overall, net written payments were down slightly in the quarter, but not down as much as earlier in the year. The negative impacts of the economy on our insureds, which we see in lower exposures and reduced audit premium continued but have moderated from earlier levels. So now I'll turn to pricing, and if unpredictability has been the message with the weather, stability is the message in our aggregate domestic Commercial Insurance pricing. 
Slide 11 grasps our renewal premium change and splits out the pure rate and exposure change components. The short story here is that nothing is really changing. Overall, renewal premium change on guaranteed cost business was essentially flat with a modest improvement in exposure change offsetting the modest decline in rate change. These overall trends are fairly consistent on an individual business basis. But as always, there are differences, and I'd like to highlight a few things. 
Starting with Slide 12 in Select Accounts. We've been getting some good premium increases and retentions have been consistent but a few points below where we historically have been. New business has been mixed with strong results in smaller accounts. But in the fourth quarter 2009 and the first quarter 2010, lower new business levels in Express Plus. In the second quarter, we moderated our pricing strategy and believe this helped boost our Express Plus new business in the quarter. On the renewal book, we typically work 90 days in advance so any impact on retention will start in the third quarter. Overall, we continue to feel very good about our Select Express platform and how we are positioned in this market. 
In Commercial Accounts, retentions have remained very strong and the renewal premium change has improved modestly going from a slight negative to a slight positive. If you look at the Commercial Accounts chart at the bottom of Page 13, you can see that this essentially flat premium change is the result of improving exposure changes and slightly lower rate changes. When negotiating a renewal, we are negotiating both the pure rate and total premium with the account. As the impact of the economy on our customers' exposures has become less negative, it has become increasingly more difficult to negotiate a rate increase especially when it would result in an overall premium increase. 
New business results for Commercial Accounts were down compared to the prior-year quarter. In the second quarter of last year, our new business writings benefited from the marketplace disruption caused by the financial distress of several of our competitors. Absent this impact, the results reflect the normal seasonality of our business. Our new business flow has stabilized at record levels, with quote rates up slightly and close rates down slightly. Given these dynamics, we continue to be very pleased with our new business performance. 
In Other Business Insurance, retentions have remained very strong, while the price change for both the rate and exposure have moved more significantly than the overall Commercial business. These pricing impacts are primarily driven by our large property business, with some significant softening in rate but improvement in exposure. As competitive pressures in this class of business increased in the current quarter driven by ample reinsurance capacity and a benign 2009 hurricane season, we made a conscious decision to maximize our retention on this business and not push rate on large property accounts. Similarly, large property new business became increasingly more competitive with aggressive concessions to expiring terms and conditions frequently required to motivate accounts to leave their current carrier, and we are not willing to make these concessions. 
In summary, we continue to prudently manage each of our businesses and adjust our actions to the unique needs. But in the aggregate, the results are not different than our recent experience, that is solid retention, relatively stable pricing and a strong flow of new business opportunities. 
In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, the core underwriting margins were generally stable in the quarter as the marginal rate gains essentially offset slightly increasing loss trends. Additionally, the underwriting margin benefited from a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior-year reinsurance treaties.
Net written premiums after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates were down for the quarter. In some of our Management Liability lines of business and in some of our International lines, we believe pricing is not consistent with our profitability targets, so our writings in those lines are down. 
Turning to the production statistics on Page 16. Although renewal premium change is slightly negative in both Management Liability and International, for most of the businesses contained here, we've achieved positive rate gains. 
Turning to Personal Insurance. In Agency Auto, our underwriting margins after adjusting for the impact of tax and prior-year development improved quarter-over-quarter as rate gains once again outpaced the loss cost trends. Within Agency Property, we have been speaking to you for some time regarding the slight margin compression driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. As the rate gains we achieved in recent quarters continue to earn through our Property business, we have crossed an inflection point where, in the second quarter, our rate improvement outpaced lost cost trends. 
Agency Auto new business improved in the second quarter, as we reintroduced our 12-month policy. As we become more confident in our new business products and are consistently within target returns, we felt it was appropriate to re-introduce a longer-term policy. The aggregate timing impact of this additional six months of written premium was about $30 million in the quarter. 
As the rollout of this product is completed, the impact on our new business written premiums will increase throughout 2010. More significantly, we are pleased with the improving rate of change in policies enforced. We believe the PIF change is a result of our improved competitive position compared to third and fourth quarter of 2009. 
Agency Property production was, also for the quarter, continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. Quarter-over-quarter PIF growth was at the highest level since third quarter 2007. Retention improved two points, and new business is up 15% compared to the same quarter last year. Given the expansion in core underwriting margins and the strong top line trends in these products, we are very pleased with both our current and going forward marketplace position in Personal Insurance. 
So let me sum it up. Weather's been bad, but it's a big part of our business, and the one thing we know for sure is that it will change. The commercial marketplace, both domestic and international, is fairly stable. We obviously wish it was improving, but we feel great about our position and are confident we will maximize the opportunity. And in Personal Insurance, we are encouraged by the trends, both for us and the industry. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Bill Heyman to discuss our tax-exempt portfolio."
392856,108550544,68716,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press, I thought I would spend a few minutes assessing this sector in general and our portfolio in particular. As you know, we have a tax-exempt portfolio of about $41",1241,"Thanks, Brian. Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press, I thought I would spend a few minutes assessing this sector in general and our portfolio in particular. 
As you know, we have a tax-exempt portfolio of about $41 billion. You may not know that of that, about $7 billion consists of bonds which have been pre-refunded, which means they have been defease to maturity with their first call date usually with U.S. Treasury securities. So the $34 billion remaining constitutes about half of our fixed income portfolio. 
The first observation I'd make is that we have, fortunately, always starting long before credit quality became an issue, viewed tax exempt credits as credits first without regard to any advantages their tax exempt stated at first. While optimization of the alternative minimum tax provides a target allocation, it is not a bucket we feel we must fill regardless of policy and a general obligation of the school district competes with the corporate bond or mortgage-backed security for our investment dollars. 
We scrutinize closely not only the credit worthiness of the issuer but the nature of the obligation. For example, in some cases, revenue bonds could be stronger than GOs and vice versa. Furthermore, where issuers have enhanced their creditworthiness with bond insurance, we have always ignored it. The result was that several years ago, when the bond insurers more or less simultaneously lost their AAA ratings, we did not make portfolio changes. 
The result of high credit underwriting standards means that our portfolio does not closely resemble the broad market. For example, we own about $23 million of municipal healthcare revenue bonds or about one-tenth of 1% of our portfolio. Such bonds represent roughly 7% of the broad market and since 1970, 39% of all municipal defaults had been in the healthcare sector. 
Conversely, we are overweighted in pre-refunded bonds, states and local general obligation bonds and water and sewer bonds. Recent focus on general obligation bonds relates to the potential for these bonds to be treated like senior unsecured debt, with bondholders becoming general creditors alongside employees, retirees and vendors. The general creditor construct is most descriptive of general obligation bonds issued by state, as the general funds act like pools collecting revenues from a wide range of taxes fees and paying salaries making pension contributions, paying vendors as well as servicing their general obligation debt. 
In contrast, this construct is probably not descriptive of many local general obligation bond. We expect that in extremis, holders of many local GOs will be treated as secured creditors based upon legal precedents and the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that the security interest in special revenues remain valid and enforceable in bankruptcy.
As you know, most school district general obligation bonds are specifically authorized by voters in a ballot initiative. This authorization allows the pledge of ad valorem taxes to be levied on all taxable property within the school district without limitation as to rate or amount. The collection of these taxes is generally segregated in the debt service bond outside of the general fund, and these funds can only be used to service the authorized debt and are not available to finance the general purposes of the school. The unlimited nature and segregation of this debt service tax revenue contrast sharply with the school district's other property tax revenues, which are statutorily limited and commingled with its state for per-pupil funding and use for operations. 
In addition to assembling the portfolio selectively, we managed it actively. The portfolio contains approximately 8,000 discrete securities, but have only 925 issuers. There are over 50,000 issuers in the municipal market. We have general obligation bonds of a mere 75 cities. There are 5,300 in the Bloomberg database. So we feel we know our cities well. We monitor closely the financial condition and operations of our credits. While it is true that we are basically buying to hold investors, we have in the past year reduced, often substantially, positions and issuers whose creditworthiness has, in our view, deteriorated. So I would add we believe that even those issues we sold are overwhelmingly likely to pay every dollar on time. 
As we demonstrated two years ago with our mortgage portfolio, we do not blindly rely on ratings. But it is nonetheless worth noting that roughly 50% of our municipal portfolio holdings, which are not pre-refunded, carry an average AAA rating from Moody's, S&P and Fitch compared to only 17% of the broad market. Almost 96% are rated Aa3 or higher. Only 4%, 4.3% are rated A or lower compared to 33% in the index. 
Rating agencies are looking at the same challenging economic budget and spending dynamics affecting state and local governments that all of us are, yet the ratings of our holdings remain very strong. A recent publication by Moody's points out that over the entire period 1970 to 2009, the riskiest 20% of municipal issuers, measured by ratings, accounted for 86% of all the defaulters.
Our portfolio contains approximately $7.2 billion in state general obligations, with only about $330 million in the headline states of California, Illinois and New York. The table in the webcast contains the aggregate holdings and the average ratings of our the top 16 states. With the exception of our holdings in California, which averaged Aa2, the average rating for each state is double Aa1 or higher. The general obligation bonds at the top five states totaled $1.4 billion. 
All that said, we have purchased very few big state GOs in recent years and have sold a few recently. The other slide of the webcast presents the runoff of our stage GOs. Based on current market yields for those borrowers and the coupon structure of our holdings, nearly 70% of our state GOs will mature or be called by 2015. 
For local general obligation bonds from the top five states totaled $6.4 billion, and the revenue bonds from these states totaled $3.6 billion. Our general obligation bonds and issuers other than states consist largely of school district exposures with a moderate number of counties, cities, community college districts and other special districts. As we just discussed, the nature of these obligations is such that most could be considered as obligations secured by a pledge of revenues from ad valorem property taxes levied without limitation as to rate or amount. 
As we have discussed previously, our fixed income portfolio exists, first and foremost, to ensure our commitment to our policy holders. We underwrite the investment risks assumed in our portfolios with careful consideration of the trade-off between risk and return. Just as in the other fixed income assets, we do not reach for yield in our municipal  portfolio in attempt to outperform our benchmark, lose investment managers' compensation or for any other reason. We expect our fixed income assets, including our municipal portfolio, to provide adequate risk-adjusted returns and support our insurance operations in pursuit of maximizing wealth for shareholders over the long term. 
Obviously, history may not be indicative of the future, and ratings cannot be relied upon with certainty. But we believe our portfolio was strong, and we wouldn't trade it for anyone else's. We could certainly have losses in our municipal portfolio, maybe even material losses. But even viewed through the prism of recent events, we feel very comfortable with what we own. 
Let me turn it over now to Jay Benet."

Well, let's discuss updated guidance for the full year. We've got information on Page 22 for full year 2010, fully diluted operating income per share, which has now been refined from the previous range of $5.20 to $5.55 to a new range of $5.",302,"Thanks, Bill. Well, let's discuss updated guidance for the full year. We've got information on Page 22 for full year 2010, fully diluted operating income per share, which has now been refined from the previous range of $5.20 to $5.55 to a new range of $5.20 to $5.45, which is a $0.10 reduction of the upper end of the range that primarily resulted from commercial renewal premium increases in 2010, not meeting our original expectations, which we believe is attributable to the impact of the continuing difficult economic environment. In round numbers, this range for operating income should still translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11% as we've said before. 
We continue to anticipate some accident year-loss ratio deterioration on a consolidated basis for full year 2010, x cats, as we expect loss cost increases to modestly outpace projected earned rate increases in our commercial businesses for the full year. So in your modeling, please remember that the second half of last year included favorable re-estimations of current year loss ratios for first half 2009 losses. So quarterly loss ratio comparison for 2010 versus 2009 must take this into consideration. 
We're now assuming cat losses of $835 million after-tax or $1.71 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first half and our original estimates for the second half of the year; no further estimates of prior-year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable; below single digit decrease in average invested assets, x unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to the share repurchases; full year share repurchases of $4 billion; and a weighted average diluted share count, after share repurchases and employee equity awards, of approximately 487 million shares. 
So with that, why don't we open it up for Q&A?"

It appears that we're lapping some of the more challenging comparisons. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much of a benefit the stabilizing economy could be and why does Travelers feels it can still raise prices as exposures increase?"

My recollection was that the original estimates of share buyback included in the guidance was $3 billion to $4 billion, $3.5 billion to $4  billion. And essentially, we are still largely on that target for the moment. We may alter that as we go into the quarter depending upon second half of the year, that is depending upon earnings, depending upon weather, reserve development to the extent it occurs and all that. But nonetheless, it's a plan that we embraced the beginning of the year, and for the moment, we're sticking to it. Your second question, and maybe Brian and I will ham and egg this a little bit. We certainly can't approve this to you. It's largely anecdotal. It's been sitting with conversations with our field folks and I'm speaking now about your question regarding the commercial insurance environment. Our sense is, is that there isn't anything that has particularly changed competitively. You all seemed to be fixated all the time, have some company or companies change their pricing strategy or tactics. We certainly don't see that and have no evidence of it. What we are hearing from our field folks is that as exposure is leveling out, and it was a comment I made earlier is that it looks as though exposure is trying to get back to zero, broadly speaking, in the Commercial Lines businesses, is that it's getting more challenging to get rate increases. If you're a customer, you really don't focus on the granular dynamics that make up your price, your premium. You're really not all that worried about how much is exposure and how much is rate change and all that nonsense. What you as a customer tend to look at is my premium going up or down in its simplest form. And as exposure flattens out to the extent that you're try and get rate gains, you're asking for a premium increase. In this economic environment, our sense is, is that it's getting just more challenging to pass that rate increase on. There's a little more resistance, both from the intermediaries, the agency brokers, as well as the customers to accepting meaningful rate increases. Now it's interesting. We didn't present the data, but we certainly do look at the distribution of rate gains in our middle market business each and every quarter. We've shared that with you previously, and to the extent there are loss dynamics at work, to the extent that the account has loss experience that's different, more problematic than what it had originally been expected, we do get rate gain. There are still significant accounts where we will see a plus five or even a plus 10 rate gain, but it largely is loss-driven. It's not in effect margin or profitability driven. So I'd love to hear if Brian has any comment, but our sense is, is that the margin picture broadly in our commercial businesses is modestly deteriorating, and that is that our ability to get rate in the aggregate is a little bit less than what you're experiencing broadly speaking in loss trends. So that's the way that we would -- I think I'd answer."

So we certainly wouldn't want to make the statement that as long as exposures are coming up, you can never get rate changes. If you think of where the psyche of our typical commercial customer is today, they saw the economy take a big dip. They saw their businesses, by and large, take a big dip. The good news is if we look at our total portfolio, they're kind of back to not dipping any more. They're not yet back to growing or anything close to robustly growing. And in that mindset, they're saying they're going -- again, loss experience being neutral, we're going to struggle with premium increases. So that's the dynamic we're seeing today and..."

When we went back -- we go back to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year which obviously contemplated normal tax and normal reserve development, the return on lean equity that we were projecting for the year was about 11%. And in the context of the environment we're in, both the investment environment -- it's important to remember, the investment environment combined with the economic environment, that's a pretty good return. It's difficult for us to plead that probability measures in our business are inadequate and as a consequence we need to improve margins in this investment and economic environment, to the extent that we're capable of producing an 11% return on equity, we feel pretty good. So we continue to try and seek rates where -- and most importantly, where the loss experience demonstrates that we should and to the extent that we can improve our profitability dynamic. As we move forward, will continue to do that. But it's not as if we're starting from a point of impaired profitability in any way. It's a pretty strong franchise and a pretty strong profit picture in the context of that environment."

In terms of the other assets, the results of the quarter were attributable to strong distributions in private equity. Cash flows from the portfolio for the first six months was about even, that means distribution equal capital contributions which is better than we would've expected. And there was a lot of net investment income gained in the results that we saw. Hedge funds made money but not very much, maybe a couple of points better than the broad index. Our hedge fund portfolio was only about $470 million, it was $1.6 billion at the time of our merger. And frankly, we find it difficult to predict de facto, which managers will do well and which won't. So we have a handful of relationships of long-standing. In real estate, a lot of our funds had marked-down properties probably excessively, and the first half of the year were affected the balance in valuations. Let's go to municipal. I agree with you. One can argue both sides of the equation forcefully. We think about this issue everyday. But I would add, we're not talking our book because we can't get out of where we are. If we decided that instead of $34 billion -- forget the pre-refundeds for the moment, instead of $34 billion, it ought to be $20 billion or $25 billion. But the quality of our holdings would permit us to make that adjustment. And the market is very firm, thankfully it's very firm, even credits -- it's very firm, even in credits we wouldn't buy. In terms of the risks in the sector, and I think I alluded to this at Investor Day in May, I think the risks are less of economic default. But even some states with big budget problems are, when you analyze them, it's not very heavily taxed. The risks are that some jurisdictions will seek, if a court allows them but may not, to repudiate their debt simply because they choose not to increase taxes and such budgets. I think with respect to larger jurisdictions, the possibility of this is pretty remote. It is one thing to only have access to the capital markets at a high price. And frankly, most jurisdictions haven't even paid debt penalty yet. It is another to lose access to the capital market altogether, which is what would happen in a political repudiation. So I agree, the issue is not free from doubt, and our take on it can be disputed but it's not all that likely."

I think when you look at the components that make up the reserve development, frequency continues to be behaving in a way that when you go through the reserve setting process, you come up with estimates on what frequency it's going to be and it's behaving better than that. And that's been a trend that's been going on for a while. When actuaries and finance people are looking at what the reserve process should be as it relates to favorable frequency and work with their business partners in terms of pricing and everything. If you look at what the current trends are, you wonder if things are going to get better than they are when you're in a favorable position. And sometimes, you just look at it and say ""Well, they're pretty good and I can't imagine them getting better,"" and sometimes, they do. So that's been a part of it. We are in a very low inflationary environment today. And looking out several years as to what the severity is going to be, just a little bit of a change in the inflationary outlook is going to have an impact as well. So you'd have to go back to what's the base upon which all of this is being done. And on a gross basis, all reserves, they're in excess of $50 billion. So that's the absolute level of these changes, in terms of percentage points, are very, very low. But given the nature of their reserve base, they impact the income statement as you've seen. But as Jay said, each one of these quarters, we're doing best estimates of what we see out there using all the information and as it changes, we'll just update the reserves."

So two other points -- because if you look at where the development has come from, not just in this quarter but over a good period of time, I'd say two things. First, on the liability side, where we've had a lot of favorable reserve development, one of the toughest things to guesstimate at over time is where the current environment is selling and what the sustainable impact of that is. And so that's been a big variable driving our improvement. And at the same time, over and again, this is a 5 to 6 year kind of statement. We've done a lot in our liability claim process that we think has helped the way we do business and service our customers, and we think that's had a pretty strong impact there. But it takes time to see the impact of those things coming through the lost data. And so that's been driving it. And then the other area is workers comp, which has continued -- again, I always say this with comp, very much a state-by-state gain. But in the aggregate where we play, we've continued to see some favorable moves there and frequency dynamics that Jay Benet talked about. But comp would be an area where that's really been true, as trying to look at those frequency trends and project forward whether we think they're going to be in the future."

There are long tail lines where you take a deep breath, obviously, before you embrace an emerging trend. And I'd make an example, in workers comp, we are still contemplating meaningful medical inflation. We're not pricing our product. We talk all the time about benign loss cost and inflation. We should always be excluding medical work and medical portion of workers comp when we assume a robust inflation rate and we'll obviously see how that works out. Generally speaking, I think a couple of individual exceptions Brian talked about as a chingle [ph] which a number of carriers have highlighted because it's a by-product price of oil, that loss cost trends severity have, broadly speaking, been awfully benign. That doesn't mean zero. It doesn't mean that we don't see some embedded inflation in lines of business. And the shorter the tail of that business is, the more we're willing to embrace it and incorporate it into our pricing because before long, it doesn't take long before we can reprice the product. The same thing holds true for the frequency. In many lines of business, there has been a long-term systemic decline in frequency. And I would actually say that it's gotten where we've been chasing it. You ask the question all the time, as frequency comes down, is it making a new level? Is it going to return back to previous levels, not only from a pricing perspective, but all of also from a reserving perspective as well. I think the same thing holds true to the extent that these are shorter tail lines of business, we're pretty aggressive in embracing it. And to the extent that they're longer tail, we're a little more reluctant to move in that direction. I think one of the things that's affected workers compensation -- I can't prove this, but just in data that we look at, is that as our economy has moved increasingly to a service-based environment, frequency and workers comp has come down. It don't   naturally surprise to people and so that sort of he dynamic, that element, that we feel more comfortable embracing. So it's very line-specific and I think it's difficult to generalize it. There's a line that you're particularly interested in we can't attempt to answer."

As we price our product, we are driven by available investment returns in the marketplace. Shortly, after the crisis when the world sort of settled backed down and we were confronted with a different kind of fixed income environment and it existed grievously, the real question was would you go into knee-jerk react to a changing interest rate environment, causing disruption to agencies, brokers, customers and all of your distribution. We really wanted to take a deep breath and see what would happen to investment returns over time. I've spoken about this earlier. It was a hard decision to take this in the longer view and not to knee-jerk now 18 months ago and attempt to drive pricing up in a very dramatic fashion. I think that would've been not only highly disruptive but candidly not very successful. That would've been a strategy that I think would have failed. Now I think, and again this is how we perceive it, you can certainly ask other companies what their view is, it may very well be that this economic malaise such as it is, is longer rather than shorter. And it may very well be that this investment environment is, as a consequence, longer rather than shorter. And we are, as I said, in the early stages of really thinking through the implications of that. It's a long view. We speak about returns over time. We try hard not to get tangled up, and candidly, this quarter, next quarter that we manage this business to generate returns over time. And one of the questions that we're going to ask ourselves is in the investment environment that's available and given other investments, we recognize that we compete against other investments including investments that are fixed income. We have round numbers of 3% yield at the moment. What are the implications of that? How do we think about our company and what do we strive to produce for investors in a very different investment environment that existed even a couple years ago? And it's a very legitimate question and we're ankle-deep in it at the moment as we try and wade our way through it. It's complex. Obviously, no one company can adopt the strategy that's disruptive in the marketplace and thinks somehow that it will be successful. We operate in a very competitive environment. So we have to balance all of those factors. More to follow. I just have no immediate clear answers about that issue, but a very relevant question."

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results, having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12",924,"Well thank you Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results, having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% increase over last year's amount
Operating return on equity was a strong 14.3% and we experienced very solid underwriting results across each of our business segments. Our consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 19.6%.
In an insurance pricing environment that remains largely flat in the commercial businesses, we were pleased to produce an increase of 2% net written premiums for the quarter.
Investment returns remained reduced from historical patterns as remarkably low interest rates, particularly short rates continue to impact net investment income. Lastly we've grown our book value from year-end 2009 by 13% to $59.11, a in a very strong quarter.
This morning we're going to do things a bit differently than we have in previous quarters. All of the data that we have historically provided is still included in our webcast.
However we're only going to hit the highlights and you can review the details on your own and obviously Gabby is available later to take any questions you may have. Instead, we're going to take the opportunity to share a few additional insights into our business that we think you'll find interesting.
First, we've spoken at length in previous presentations about our program's design to grow our business organically. This morning we're going to share with you summery analytics of our business insurance account growth and we suspect that a number of you will be surprised with the growth we've achieved. Second, a number of you have asked about the impact of reduced interest rates on our net investment income.
Jay Benet shared an analysis of the impact of reinvestment rates at an investor conference in September and we've updated it for current conditions. We've analyzed the maturities in our fixed income portfolio for the next three years and we'll share with you the projected impact on net investment income if re investment rates remain at current levels.
The municipal bond environment remains a topic of some interest. We've updated an analysis of our municipal bond portfolio that we did for the second quarter webcast based on current ratings and market conditions. As we've said before, it is an actively managed portfolio where we are constantly evaluating risk and return of individual securities. There are never any guarantees but we couldn't be more pleased with the positioning of the portfolio.
Finally, before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I want to comment on a topic that we're thinking about regularly. As we've discussed before we believe the most thoughtful way to run a property casualty business for the long term is to produce superior returns on equity. As many of your understand, we can't promise consistent growth in either revenues or earnings and do so maintaining a thoughtful risk profile.
Consequently a number of years ago consistent with our aspiration for superior returns on equity and given what we viewed as typical underwriting and investment environments. We determined that we will target a mid-teens return on equity overtime and do so by achieving top tier profitability and returning access capital to shareholders.
Two very important origin that previous sentence are overtime. Since January 2005 the first full year after the merger of St. Paul and Travelers, our average annual operating return on equity is 14.1%, then we have recorded more than $20 billion in operating income and have returned nearly $17 billion in total shareholders, $13 billion in share repurchases and nearly $4 billion in dividends. Given the current general economic and investment environments few people have asked whether we intend to change our goal now.
We are certainly not economists nor do we what the future holds. However, the underlying assumption we are making is that the economy will eventually return to a more typical investment environment particularly with respect to the fixed income world.
Consequently we are not changing our goal now, having said that we have been very clear in the recent past that the current environment simply doesn't permit achievement of a consistent mid-teens return right now if one assumes no favorable reserve development and normal catastrophes in weather costs.
If in fact the market ultimately presents long term meaningfully reduced investment returns not only for us but also for the market at large which for us are not offset by improved underwriting conditions.
We will obviously rethink what that means for our aspirations and what investors can expect of us. So for now our target remains intact and we continue to execute in the marketplace consistent with that goal.
We seek rate selectively and thoughtfully where weight is needed especially in those cases where account loss experience has been inconsistent with our underwriting expectations.
But we are always managing rate and retention with a clear view of maximizing long term value to our arbitrarily and aggressively seek rate and be a victim of adverse selection and watch our retention drop perfidiously will not be a smart or thoughtful reaction to the current environment. As Brian will explain in greater detail our field people take their lead from us and right now their direction is unambiguous.
We feel great about how they are executing and we believe that we will continue to be amongst the best performing property and casualty companies around. With that let me turn it over to Jay.

Operating results ex-cap and favorable reserve development and including net investment income were generally inline with our expectations as they have been all year.
The third quarter results benefited from a relatively low level caps a $117 million pre-tax which was lower than prior year CAT losses of a 158 million pre-tax as well as what we “normally planned for in the third quarter”. I would remind you though that year-to-date CAT losses have been quite high over a $1 billion on a pre-tax basis as compared to 441 million pre-tax in the first nine months of last year which would approximate a more normal year-to-date amount.
We had another quarter of net favorable prior year reserve development in each of our segments concentrated this quarter in DI and FPII. The quarters reserve development included and asbestos reserve increase of a $140 million pre-tax. Included in this asbestos reserve increase and therefore in the current quarters operating income was a $70 million pre-tax benefited related to the recent favorable ruling we received against Munich Re and certain members of (inaudible).
The total awarded to us by the court in this ruling was $417 million, broken down as follows, $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement and interest of $166 million.
Based upon this ruling, we reduced our uncollectible reinsurance reserve by $70 million, thereby reflecting in our financial statements the full $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement. Importantly the benefit of the $166 million interest award was not reflected in either the current quarter asbestos charge or in the current quarter's operating income since GAAP requires its interest to be treated as a contingent gain generally until all appeals have been exhausted and or the dollar amount is received.
All of our capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. We are holding company liquidity at $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which was more than twice the target level due to the timing of share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies for our holding company.
During the third quarter we repurchased $600 million of our common shares, a higher amount than we would normally repurchase in the third quarter due to the strength of our balance and the light wind season we have experienced thus far and paid $169 million in common stock dividends bringing the total cash we returned to our shareholders in the past nine months to almost $4 billion. Third quarter operating ROE was 14.3% and book value for share once again increased, up 6% in the quarter and up 15% from a year ago.
Page 4 makes reference to our very high quality investment portfolio which includes a $4.6 billion pre-tax net unrealized gain at the end of the third quarter; up significantly from the $2.8 billion pre-tax net unrealized gain we recorded at the beginning of the year. A little over 60% of the net unrealized gain relates to the muni bond portfolio.
Page 5 provides an update of certain data we previously provided to you related to our muni bond portfolio. There have not been any significant changes in the portfolio recently, not withstanding our active management of the portfolio based upon a risk reward view for each individual holding due to its very high quality.
The portfolio currently includes bonds that have gross unrealized gains of $2.8 billion pre-tax and bonds that have gross unrealized losses of only $8 million. That's right, only $8 million of losses, not billions.
I'd also like to make some specific comments related to page 9 of the webcast. During a presentation I made at a recent conference, I referred to today's low interest rate environment and provided an illustration based upon our portfolio schedule bond maturities in 2011, 2012 and 2013 of the impact on net investment income in those years. If the current interest rate environment persists through this period of time and all of the variables such as average assets, mix, credit quality and duration remain constant.
The illustration I provided at the conference was based upon reinvesting a 10 year rate or approximately 100 basis points lower than the combined yield on the maturing bonds, rounding the interest rate differential to the nearest 50 basis points.
Since then interest rates have fallen even further and we have updated the illustration to reflect a 150 basis point interest rate decline. We've also added another line to the illustration which shows the differential between NII and the subsequent years. Again all other variables being held constant that includes the partial year impact of reinvesting 2010 maturities at lower interest rates. The full year impact of this activity will not be felt until 2011 in subsequent years since 2010 maturities will have taken place throughout 2010 rather than on the first day of the year.
As you model these years I would also remind you that NII will also be impacted by the reduction and average invested assets that results from our share repurchase program and with that let me give the mike over to Brian.

Our typical disclosures on the business segment is also around pages 11 through 22 and we will of course take questions on any topic. Instead of going through the slides I will give a few perspectives on our businesses and the marketplace. In business insurance we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our franchisee. Both our account retention and flow of new business opportunities remain near historically high levels which we believe will enable us to grow premiums if and when the economy improves.
Core underwriting margins continue to contract modestly in the quarter consistent with both prior quarters and our expectations. In short the loss cost trend slightly outpaced through the rate changes.
We continue to see the negative impact as the economy is having on our insured exposures. Audit premiums which are retroactive premium adjustments charged to reflect changes and insured pay roll, vehicles, property values or business receipts have improved but are still negative.
The exposure change on renewals which is a perspective look has also improved throughout the year and is now approaching zero. On a combined basis these impacts are reducing premiums approximately 2% through the third quarter.
So in another word our data suggest that the economy is bottoming out but we don't see any evidence at current economic expansion. Given these trends our underwriting strategy remains consistent. Retain our quality business, optimize the profitability on this retained book by getting rate where it is warranted and write new business for long term profitable growth. Directionally this strategy maybe the same as many of our competitors but aligning it with our competitive advantages namely our talent, technology, actionable management information and breadth of distribution, we believe we are very well positioned.
Over the last seven quarters we have seen significant account growth and as a result we believe that we are growing market share. On slide 16, you can see that since year end 2008 we have grown accounts in business insurance by 8.5% compound annual growth rate.
On the next slide we have taken this data and broken it out for two of our major businesses. In our small commercial business or select accounts you can see that it is growing by a 10.6% CAGR. This increase has been driven by our select express product that's our no touch insurance solution for small business customers.
Through the combination of our sophisticated rating capability and cost efficient frontline delivery we are able to provide our agents and customers with an industry leading product and platform.
Within select in the plus end or the larger end of this market we have allowed our accounts to be decreased due to extremely competitive market conditions.
On the slide you can also see that we have grown commercial accounts by 4.4% compound annual growth rate. The increase in the number of accounts in this business is driven primarily by the continued introduction of the new products and the specialization and expertise of these products and our front line underwriting and claim staff bring to the marketplace.
This growth in commercial accounts is representative of what we are seeing across our middle market businesses. So we're encouraged by this increase in the number of accounts and again if and when the economy improves the resulting impact on exposure should create a compelling written premium trend.
Given both this top line dynamic and the current core underwriting profitability of this book of business, we remain very pleased with business insurance current performance and its position in the marketplace moving forward.
In the financial professional and international segment, I will make just a few overall comments. First, writings in our international businesses are down compared to prior year quarter as we are addressing risk in pricing in light of catastrophe and other severe weather losses over the past year.
Secondly, although we remain very pleased with the market position and quality of our construction surety business. The impact of the economy on construction spending has resulted in fewer new business opportunities and are writings in this quarter reflect this.
And lastly, we continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruptions on our management liability business and our conclusions remain the same. That is our losses are developing within or slightly favorable to our expectations.
Turning to personnel insurance, we're extremely pleased with both the underwriting and production results in the quarter. In both agency, auto and property policies in force continue to grow and core underwriting margins expanded as earned rate increases outpaced loss cost trends.
In our property line of business, weather losses were both less than third quarter expectations and a welcome relief from the pattern we saw in the first half of the year. While the continental U.S. was not meaningfully impacted by any of the storms generated during the peak of the hurricane season, the number of near misses this quarter highlights the importance of underwriting controls and risk management policies in this business.
Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market with quarter-over-quarter pip growth remaining at historically high levels. In agency auto our new business continued to improve and we had our best quarter-over-quarter policies in force increase since the end of 2008
Given the continued expansion in core underwriting margins and strong top line trends, we remain pleased with both our current and going forward positions in these businesses.
So across all of our businesses we feel great about our execution in the marketplace and one the primary reasons we believe our organization has executed so well in these times of uncertainty is that we have kept our message to the field clear, unambiguous and consistent. And that is and in these market conditions, just like pretty much any other, the role of our underwriters is to maximize the long term value of the portfolio to balance the desire to keep our quality business well at the same time optimizing the returns on that portfolio.
Fundamentally, they do that by making sure they understand the accounts risk characteristics and can estimate the potential losses from these exposures. They then seek the select risks in the marketplace where the premium level is appropriate for this view of the losses.
We believe our field understands their role as the best tools in the business to execute and as long as they keep doing this we will keep competing in the marketplace successfully. With that, let me turn it back over to Jay.

We also did that in the third quarter but when you do that it impacts prior quarters of the current year. So I think when you see the full year results, you'll see more of what Brian is talking about and if there are impacts associated with large loss activity and small weather we'll try to point that out as well.

The return on equity that we publish in our press release and in our financials is straightforward GAAP return on equity which is the earnings that we reported for the period divided by average equity for the period and Jay and Doug can take you through all of that. We obviously understand that if our entire $70 billion investment portfolio were re-priced today at today's reinvestment rates, that we would end up with a different return.
We understand that, internally the analytics that we have we actually do look at it that way. We actually do evaluate products and businesses and lines based upon investing cash flows at today's available rates and it's those analytics that form the basis of our pricing strategy and our growing strategy and they are proprietary.
They are important, they are the subject of substantial discussion here and it's that return that gives us our approach to whether we are aggressively growing, not aggressively growing or willing to strength. Brian spoke today about letting the large end of select strength because we are pricing with such and the risk selection effect that the returns are simply aren't adequate to support business.
So we are letting that shrink somewhat. And certainly we understand one of the reasons that Jay presented the schedule that he did about investment income is that if these investment markets continue. If they are what they are and the underwriting environment never changes and there is no favorable development. Now we are not going to be able to achieve mid-teens return on equity and we certainly understand that and it's actually not all that difficult to model out the business and see what you think it is.
We certainly do it all the time and it can be achieved. So we talk pretty simple, the numbers that you get in press release and GAAP things we are all getting and internally we have robust analytics that left us evaluate the current underwriting profitability based up on today's reinvestment rate and that's what establishes our underwriting energy or enthusiasm.

There has at least in my career never been a period with a gap between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been any wider than it is today. I find it actually remarkable that they are high quality equities with the dividend is actually higher than the debt yield on the ten year debt, high quality companies.
So it tells you that the market place is at the moment somewhat upside down and the real question that you are asking and I think it's extra-ordinarily relevant one is that is going to continue and possibly been in an environment where the two year treasury is a 2.4% and the cost of equity is a 10 or will there not be arbitrage activities that will take place. But in one fashion or another we will lower that gap, reduce that gap into a more normal historical rage. We are extremely attentive to it. One can speculate that one way that cost of equity will go down is a rising equity market and some folks have asked me why do you think the market is generally is rising now. One of the answers to it is that it's reflecting at a decline cost of equity. It's somewhat kind of intuitive to think of it that way but frankly it's entirely possible.
So, I don't know what the cost of equity will be in a few years. My guess is that you got a financial company ten years from now in today's environment and you look back three years from now and the company has achieved a 10% cumulative return on equity and you will feel great.
You won't feel good, you will feel great and if you look broadly at the financial services arena and we do and I do and you will look at the returns that institutions of producing particularly in the banking arena where the rules and regulations and levels of dynamics are changing so much I think that the dynamic of what returns are going to be over the next few years is a fascinating question and what it is that investors are going to seek but my comment was for now our goal is our goal.
We will do the best we can. We are not going at arbitrarily and go out through the marketplace and say, the worst thing in the world to do is to go out to the marketplace and say we want five points of rate on every account. You'll get five points of rate on accounts that need 10 and you'll lose accounts that don't need any.
The easiest way to get adverse selection is to take away the underwriters authority to evaluate risk and return on an individual trade. So no mystery here. We acknowledge the environment is not possible right now, nothing we can achieve with these returns. But the two words overtime are just critical to us and that's how we think about. This is a long term business and we manage it over time.

So all the big names that you and we have been reading about in the news, we have very, very limited exposure there.
We don't view it as an exposure really to the community banks and we think that's because they just haven't been foreclosing the kinds of volumes that would involve the processes that is really in question here and we haven't seen any indication if that's the case.

First our entire portfolio of subprime and also ABS is are actually $300 million and $200 million of that was 2004 and prior and we have added $100 million selectively since the crisis began. So, not a significant investment there, still very highly rated.
On the residential CMO side that $2.3 billion of that again virtually all 2004 and prior we turned away from the market as both the mortgage market and the real estate market really heated up.
862 million of it is agency and 1.4 billion is non-agency. The facts and circumstances of this what actually is happening and the implications are as confusing as I have ever seen it, and it's not at all clear what the long term issue really is. If we are talking about episodic relatively short term delays in foreclosure activity, our assessment is no problem with respect to the investments and we have already seen some of that episodic short term delay.
And the other extreme is the notion of a long term industry wide broad-based foreclosure moratorium. We don't know how to access that, I don't know how to access some thing that actually has never happened before and frankly I think of all of the issues that will incur the impact of asset backed securities may actually be the smallest in that kind of environment.
So I don't know to size up that kind of long term broad-based moratorium. Again the episodic short term stuff we could be wrong on this but our assessment is no underlying problem.
With respect to the flip side of the issue which is the ability to put mortgages back to the originating institutions, of course the GFCs have always have had that. There is nothing particularly no on that front and again we could be wrong on this but our assessment has been that it's hard for us to figure out a scenario where mortgages get put back to the originating institution and the bond holders lose -- the originating institution seems to me it could be in a position to lose but we have some difficulty figuring out the scenario where the bond holder loses but early days on this would even be an understatement. It's right at the beginning. Bill?

You obviously read the story about Pimco and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sending to Bank of America with a list of 115 tools, where they would like to see mortgages put back. We looked at that list. We own three of them. We think -- I think there are three cross currants. One the validity of foreclosures which have taken place, two the ability on our perspective basis to foreclose and courts are beginning to get more particular in terms of what they demand and that's probably good. And three the whole put back phenomenon and they would cut differently across the portfolio. My guess is the probability of any of the three having a significant impact to us or anyone else, that might be more remote than the newspapers are suggesting and whatever happens is going to happen over time to the extent that if there was a put back phenomenon we would benefit. It's easier for GSEs to put back mortgages than non agency pools because all the GSEs have to do this pool they weren't confirming. So we'd be beneficiaries but we're not counting on much.

The growth dynamics that you are seeing here in the charts, the account growth, I got to go back and talk to the fact that once been driven by Select Express which is a technology platform that lowers cost, lowers agent cost and lowers our cost significantly and so it's been a platform based dynamic of growth not price based. A platform based dynamic of growth and in Bill Cunningham's in his middle market business it's really been about new product development and role out. We have provided lots of information about that previously not a price driven strategy and again the data. It's so clear that it supports this, you are looking at retention that is historical highs and renewal pricing that's more or less a flat a little below or flat and so our focus is not and it destined to get confused to some folks is not to cut price too aggressively grow our book.
It's to use our competitive advantages where they exist, like the express, like the new product development in middle market that allows us to the geography that Greg spoke about. Where there are ways to grow your business without being pricing competitive to do it.

If we were getting minus one on each and every account that's one strategy, we have got accounts in here where we are getting plus 10s and we have got accounts that are certainly getting minus 10s. It's blending to something pretty close to neutral. We feel good about the profitability about our book and we wake up every morning wanting to retain most of the accounts.

Let me be a little more specific. So we are talking about allocating capital. Each of our products, each of our business is based up on the duration and the volatility are actually defined and amount of capital too.
The embedded return that we calculate for the portfolio assumes that the premium dollars come in at new investment rates but that the capital, because the capital sits and just continues to roll has a much longer duration so the capital that supports it is somewhat more reflective of the historical capital embedded in the portfolio.
So, premiums come in entirely at new money rates. Again this is the analytics that we use, the capital based up on allocated capital to that product reflecting more of the historical duration kind of because again it supports the business as one piece of business rolls off and new piece of business comes on. The capital has a different duration than the new premium base and if you look at the business insurance segment in the aggregate as we did just yesterday and making sure that we can answer this question.
The policy view, the return that we see in the business that we are writing today is very low double digit. That's where we fall; I don't want to get more specific than that because obviously it's reflecting of our pricing strategy. But it wouldn't take much to move into high single digits but its very low double digits.

I'm not sure you can really have full visibility to all those components but what ends up happening is that the 2.4 grows to 2.8 and the two major drivers of that are the size of the dividends coming up from the operating companies versus the amount of share repurchases that go out.

Somebody is going to look that up for me. But we also said during the first or second quarter, I'm not sure which one was that based on the capital positions of the operating companies which had gotten very robust, we were actually going to go to our regulators and say that we wanted to take capital out of the operating companies at a higher level than that would have indicated and get their authority to do that which we did and we did that in the first quarter. And when you do that it also changes the dynamics going forward of what constitutes normal dividend versus what constitutes a special dividend. So in each of the quarters we have gone to our regulators and said we'd like to take X out and in each of the quarters we've been given permission to do that. But its all in conjunction with a strategy as Jay has talked about of always rightsizing the capital at the place and you've heard me say before that we manage to a certain level of capital and the operating companies to support the AA ratings and that's what all we're doing.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% i",922,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% increase over last year's math. Operating return on equity was a strong 14.3% and we experienced very solid underwriting results across each of our business segments. Our consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 90.6%. In an insurance pricing environment that remains largely flat in the commercial businesses, we were pleased to produce an increase of 2% net written premiums for the quarter. investment returns were made reduced from historical patterns as remarkably low interest rates, particularly short rates, continue to impact debt investment income. 
Lastly, we've grown our book value from year-end 2009 by 13% to $59.11. We're in a very strong quarter. This morning we're going to do things a bit differently than we have in previous quarters. All of the data that we've historically provided is still included in our webcast. However, we're only going to hit the highlights and you can review the details on your own and obviously Gabby is available later to take any questions you may have. Instead, we're going to take the opportunity to share a few additional insights into our business that we think you'll find interesting. 
First, we've spoken at length in previous presentations about our programs designed to grow our business organically. This morning, we're going to share with you summary analytics of our business insurance account growth and we suspect that a number of you will be surprised at the growth that we've achieved. 
Second, a number of you have asked about the impact of reduced interest rates on our net investment income. Jay Benet shared an analysis of the impact of reinvestment rates at an investor conference in September and we've updated it for current conditions. We've analyzed the maturities in our fixed income portfolio for the next three years and will share with you the projected impact on net investment income, if reinvestment rates remain at current levels. 
The municipal bond environment remains a topic of some interest. We've updated an analysis of our municipal bond portfolio that we did for the second quarter webcast based on current ratings and market conditions. As we've said before, it is an actively managed portfolio where we are constantly evaluating risk and return of individual securities. There are never any guarantees, but we couldn't be more pleased with the positioning of the portfolio.
Finally, before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I want to comment on a topic that we're thinking about regularly. As we've discussed before, we believe the most thoughtful way to run a Property Casually business for the long term is to produce superior returns on equity. As many of you understand, we can't promise consistent growth in either revenues or earnings and do so maintaining a thoughtful risk profile. 
Consequently, a number of years ago, consistent with our aspiration for superior returns on equity, and given what we view as typical underwriting in investment environments, we determined that we would target a mid-teens return on equity overtime and do so but achieving top-tier profitability and returning excess capital to shareholders. Two very important words in that previous sentence are over time. 
Since January 2005, the first full year, after the merger of the St. Paul and Travelers, our average annual operating return on equity is 14.1% and we've recorded more than $20 billion in operating income and have returned nearly $17 billion in total shareholders, $13 billion in share repurchases and nearly $4 billion in dividends. Given the current general economic and investment environments, a few people have asked whether we intend to change our goal now. We're certainly not economists, nor do we know what the future holds. However, the underlying assumption we are making is that the economy will eventually return to a more typical investment environment, particularly with respect to the fixed income world. Consequently, we are not changing our goal now. Having said that, we've been very clear in the recent past that the current environment simply doesn't permit achievement of a consistent mid-teens return right now if one assumes no favorable reserve development and normal catastrophes and weather costs. 
If in fact, the market ultimately presents long term, meaningfully reduced investment returns, not only for us but also for the market at large, which for us are not offset by improved underwriting conditions, we will obviously rethink what that means for our aspirations and what investors can expect of us. So for now our target remains intact, and we continue to execute in the marketplace consistent with that goal. We seek rates selectively and thoughtfully where rate are needed especially in those cases where account loss experience has been inconsistent with our underwriting expectations. But we are always managing rate and retention with a clear view of maximizing long-term value to arbitrarily and aggressively seek rate and be a victim of adverse selection and watch our attention drop precipitously would not be a smart or thoughtful reaction to the current environment. 
As Brian will explain in greater detail, our field people take their lead from us and right now, their direction is unambiguous. We feel great about how they are executing and we believe that we will continue to be amongst the best performing property and casually companies around. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jay."
392856,113941855,80883,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay. I'd like to start with a few overall comments about the quarter relating to Pages  4 through 10 of the webcast.

I'd like to start with a few overall comments about the quarter relating to Pages  4 through 10 of the webcast. Operating results x cat [catastrophes] and favorable reserve development and including net investment income were generally in line with our expectation as they have been all year. Our third quarter results benefited from a relatively low level of cat, so $117million pretax, which was lower than prior year cat losses of $158 million pretax as well as what we would ""normally plan"" for in the third quarter. 
I would remind you though that year-to-date, cat losses have been quite high over $1 billion on a pretax basis as compared to $441 million pretax in the first nine months of last year, which would approximate a more normal year-to-date amount. We had another quarter of net favorable prior-year reserve development in each of our segments concentrated this quarter in BI and FPII. The quarter's reserve development included an asbestos reserve increase of $140 million pretax. Included in this asbestos reserve increase and therefore, in the current quarter's operating income was a $70 million pretax benefit related to the recent favorable ruling we received against Munich Re and certain numbers of ECRA [Excess Casualty Reinsurance Association]. The total awarded to us by the court in this ruling was $417 million broken down as follows. $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement and interest of $166 million. 
Based upon this ruling, we reduced our uncollectible reinsurance reserve by $70 million, thereby reflecting in our financial statement the full $251, million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement. Importantly, the benefit of the $166 million interest award was not reflected in either the current quarters asbestos charge or in the current quarter's operating income since GAAP requires that interest be treated as a contingent gain, generally until all appeals have been exhausted and/or the dollar amounts is received. All of our capital leverage and liquidity measures remain at or better than target levels. We have holding company liquidity of $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which was more than twice the target level due to the timing of share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies for our holding company. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $600 million of our common shares, a higher amount than we would normally repurchase in the third quarter due to the strength of our balance sheet and the light wind season we have experienced thus far and saved $169 million in common stock dividend bringing the total cash we returned to our shareholders in the past nine months to almost $4 billion. 
Third quarter operating ROE was 14.3% and book value per share once again increased, up 6% in the quarter and up 15% from a year ago.
Page 4 makes reference to our very high-quality investment portfolio, which includes a $4.6 billion pretax net unrealized gain at the end of the third quarter, up significantly from the $2.8 billion pretax net unrealized gain we reported at the beginning of the year. A little over 60% of the net unrealized gain relates to the muni bond portfolio. 
Page 5 provides an update of certain data we previously provided to you related to our new bond portfolio. We have not been any significant changes in the portfolio recently notwithstanding our active management of the portfolio based upon our risk reward the for each of the individual holding due to its very high quality. The portfolio currently includes bonds that have gross unrealized gains of $2.8 billion pretax and bonds that have gross unrealized losses of only $8 million. That's right, only $8 million of losses, not billion. 
I'd also like to make some specific comments related to Page 9 of the webcast. During the presentation I made at the recent conference, I referred to today's low-interest rate environment and provided an illustration based upon our portfolio scheduled by maturities in 2011,2012 and 2013 of the impact on net investment income in those years that the current interest rate environment persist for this period of time and all of the variables such as average assets, mix, credit quality and duration, remain constant. The illustration I provided at the conference was based upon reinvesting a 10-year rate or approximately 100 basis points lower than the combined yield on the maturing bonds rounding the interest rate differential to the nearest 50 basis points. 
Since then, interest rates have fallen even further and we have updated the illustration to reflect a 150 basis points interest-rate decline. We've also added another line to the illustration, that shows the differential between 2010 NII and the subsequent years, again, all of the variables being held constant that includes the partial year impact of reinvesting 2010 maturities of lower interest rates. The full year impact of this activity will not be felt until 2011 and subsequent since the 2010 maturities will have taken place throughout 2010 rather than on the first day of the year. As you model these years, I would remind you that NII will also be impacted by the reduction in average invested assets that results from our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me give the mic over to Brian."

Our typical disclosures on the business segment results around Pages 11 through 22, and we will of course take questions on any topic. Instead of going through the slides, I will give a few perspectives on our businesses and the marketplace. 
In Business Insurance, we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our franchise. Both our account retention and flow of new business opportunities remain near historically high levels, which we believe will enable us to grow premiums if and when the economy improves. Core underwriting margins continued to contract modestly in the quarter, consistent with both prior quarters and our expectations. In short, the lost cost trends slightly outpaced earned rate changes. We continue to see the negative impact the economy is having on our insurance exposures. Audit premiums, which are retroactive premium adjustment charge to reflect changes and insures payroll, vehicles, property values or business receipt have improved, but are still negative. The exposure change on renewals, which is a prospective look, has also improved throughout the year and is now approaching zero. 
On a combined basis, these impacts are reducing premiums approximately 2% through the third quarter. So in other words, our data suggests that the economy is bottoming out, but we don't see any evidence of current economic expansion. Given these trends, our underwriting strategy remains consistent: Retain our quality business; optimize the probability on this retained book by getting rate, where it is warranted; and write new business for longer profitable growth. 
Directionally, this strategy may be the same as many of our competitors, but by aligning it with our competitive advantages, namely our talent, technology, actionable management information and breadth of distribution, we believe we are very well positioned. Over the last seven quarters, we've seen significant account growth and as a result, we believe that we're growing market share. 
On Slide 16, you can see that since year end 2008, we've grown accounts in Business Insurance by a 8.5% compound annual growth rate. On the next slide, we've taken this data and broken it out for two of our of major business. 
In our small Commercial business, or Select Accounts, you can see that it is growing by a 10.6% tagger. This increase has been driven by our Select Express product, that's our no-touch insurance solution for small business customers. Through the combination of our sophisticated rating capabilities and cost-efficient front-line delivery, we are able to provide our agent and customers with an industry-leading product and platform. Within Select, in the plus end, or the larger end of this market, we have allowed our accounts to decrease, decrease due to extremely competitive market conditions. On the slide, you can also see that we've grown Commercial Accounts by 4.4% compound annual growth rate. 
The increase in the number of accounts in this business is driven primarily by the continued introduction of new products and the specialization and expertise of these products and our front-line underwriting and claim staff bring to the marketplace. This growth in Commercial Accounts is representative of what we are seeing across our middle market business. So we are encourage by this increase in the number of accounts, and again, if and when the economy improves, the resulting impact on exposures should create a compelling written premium trend. Given both these top line dynamic and the current core underwriting profitability of this book of business, we remain very pleased with Business Insurance's current performance and its position in the marketplace moving forward. 
In the Financial Professional and International segment, I will make just a few overall comments. First, writings in our International businesses are down compared to prior-year quarter as we are addressing risk and pricing in light of the catastrophe and other severe weather losses over the past year. Secondly, although we remain very pleased with the market position and quality of our Construction Surety business, the impact of the economy on construction spending has resulted in fewer new business opportunities, and our writings in this quarter reflect this. And lastly, we continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruptions on a Management Liability business and our conclusions remain the same, that is, our losses are developing within or slightly favorable to our expectations. 
Turning to Personal Insurance. We are extremely pleased with both the underwriting and production results in the quarter. In both Agency, Auto and Property, policies in force continued to grow and core underwriting margins expanded as earned rate increases outpaced loss cost trends. In our Property line of business, weather losses were both less than third quarter expectations and a welcome relief from the pattern we saw in the first half of the year.  While the continental U.S. was not meaningfully impacted by any of the storms generated during the peak of the hurricane season, the number of near misses this quarter highlights the importance of underwriting controls and risk management policies in this business. 
Agency Property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market, with quarter-over-quarter PIF growth remaining at historically high levels. The Agency Auto, our new business continued to improve and we had our best quarter-over-quarter policies in force increase since the end of 2008. Given the continued expansion in core underwriting margins and strong top line trends, we remained pleased with both our current and going-forward positions in these businesses.
So across all of our businesses, we feel great about our execution in the marketplace. And one of the primary reasons we believe our organization has executed so well in these times of uncertainty is that we have kept our message to the field clear, unambiguous and consistent. And that is, in these market conditions, just like pretty much any other, the role of our underwriters is to maximize the long-term value of the portfolio. The balance to desire to keep our quality business while at the same time optimizing the returns on that portfolio. 
Fundamentally, they do that by making sure they understand the accounts risk characteristics and can estimate the potential losses from these exposures. They then seek the select risks in the marketplace where the premium level is appropriate for this view of the losses. We believe our field understands their role, has the best tools in the business to execute and as long as they can keep doing this, we will keep competing in the marketplace successfully. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Jay."

The return on equity that we publish in our press release and in our financials is straightforward GAAP return on equity, which is the earnings that we reported for the period divided by average equity for the period. and Jay and Dough can take you through all of that. We obviously understand that if our entire $70 billion investment portfolio were repriced today at today's reinvestment rates, but we would end up with a different return -- we understand that. Internally, the analytics that we have, we actually do look at it that way. We actually do evaluate products and businesses and lines based upon investing cash flows at today's available rates. And it's those analytics that form the basis of our pricing strategy and our volume strategy, and they are proprietary. They are important, they are the subject of substantial discussions here and it's that return that gives us our approach to whether we're aggressively growing, not aggressively growing or  willing to shrink. Bryan spoke today about letting the large end of select shrink because the pricing was such and the risk selection itself, selection is such that the returns simply aren't adequate to support the business. But in that shrink somewhat. And certainly, we understand that one of the reasons that Jay presented the schedule over it about investment income is that if these investment markets continue, if they are what they are, and the underwriting environment never changes and there's no more favorable development. Yes, we're not going to be able to achieve the mid-teens return on equity and we certainly understand that and it's actually not all that difficult to model up the business and see what you think it is. We certainly do it all the time, and it can be achieved. It's all pretty simple, the numbers that you get in the press release are GAAP that we're all accustomed to getting. And internally, we have robust analytics that let us evaluate the current, underlying profitability based upon today's reinvestment rate and that's what establishes our underwriting energy or enthusiasm."

There has, at least in my career, never been a period where the GAAP between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been any wider than it is today. I find it actually remarkable that there are high-quality equities where the dividend yield is actually higher than the debt yield on the 10-year debt high-quality companies. So it tells you that the marketplace is at the moment, somewhat upside down. And the real question that you're asking, when I think it's an extraordinary relevant one, is that going to continue? Can you possibly be in an environment where the 2-year treasury is at 2.4% and the cost of equity is a 10%. Or will there not be other treasury activities that will take place? That in one fashion or another will lower that GAAP, reduce that GAAP into a more normal historical range. We're extremely attentive to it. One can speculate that one way that the cost of equity will go down is a rising equity market. And some folks have asked me, gee, why do you think the market generally is rising now? One of the answers to it, is that it's reflecting a decline in cost of equity. It's somewhat kind of intuitive to think of it that way. But frankly, it's entirely possible. So I don't know what the cost of equity will be in a few years. My guess is, is that you've got financial company three years from now, in today's environment. And you look back three years from now and the company's achieved a 10% period on return on equity, you'll feel great. You'll won't feel good, you'll feel great. And if you look broadly at the financial services arena and we do and I do, and you'll look at the returns that institutions are producing, particularly in the banking arena where the rules and regulations and leverage dynamics are changing so much, I think that the dynamic of what returns are going to deal for the next three years is a fascinating question and what it is that investors are going to seek. But my comment was for now, our goal is our goal. We will do the best we can. We are not going to act arbitrarily and go out to the marketplace and say, worst thing in the world to do is to go out to the marketplace and say want five points of rate on every account. You'll get five points of rate on accounts that need 10 and you'll loose accounts that don't need any. The easiest way to get adverse selection is to take away the underwriter's authority to evaluate risk and return on an individual trade. So no mystery here. We acknowledge the environment is not possible right now. Not you that can't achieve mid-teens returns, but the two words, over time, are critical to us. And that's how we think about. This is long-term business and we manage it over time."

The facts and circumstances of this -- of what actually is happening and the implications are as confusing as I've ever seen it, it's not at all clear what the long-term issue really is. If we're talking about episodic, relatively short-term delays in foreclosure activity, our assessment is no problem with respect to the investments. And we've already seen some of those episodic, short-term delay. At the other extreme is the notion of a long-term industry-wide, broad-based foreclosure moratorium. We don't know how to assess that. I don't know how to assess something that actually has never happened before. And frankly, I think of all of the issues that will occur, the impact on asset-backed securities may actually be the smallest in that kind of an environment. So I don't know how to size up that kind of long-term, broad-based moratorium. Again the episodic short-term stuff, we could be wrong on this but our assessment is no underlying problem. With respect to the flip side of the issue, which is the ability to put more mortgages back to the originating institutions, of course the GSEs have always had that. There's nothing particularly new on that front. And again, we could be wrong on this but our assessment has been that it's hard for us to figure out a scenario where mortgages get quick back to their originating institution and the bondholders lose. The originating institutions seems to make it at the end position to lose , but we have some difficulty figuring out the scenario where the bondholder Loses.

We looked at that base by the way, we found we own three of them. I think there are three cross currents, one, the validity of foreclosures which have taken place. Two, the ability on perspective basis to foreclose, and of course they're beginning to get more particular in terms of what they demand and that's probably good. And three, the whole put back phenomena. And they would cut different across the portfolio. My guess is the probability of any of the three having a impact to us or anyone else might be more remote than the newspapers are adjusting and whatever happens is going to happen over time. To the extent that there's a put-back phenomenon, we benefited. It's easier for GSEs to put back mortgages than non-agency pulls, because all the GSEs have to do is to prove they weren't performing.

The growth dynamic that you're seeing here in the charts, the account growth I'm going back and talk to the fact that one is driven by Select Express, which is a technology platform that lowers cost, lower agent cost, lowers our costs significantly and so it's been a platform based dynamic of growth, not price based, a platform based dynamic of growth.

We've provided lots of information about that previously, not a price-driven strategy. And again the data is so clear that it supports this.

Let me be a little more specific. So we're talking about allocated capital. Each of our products, each of our business is based upon the duration and the volatility our actuaries design and amount of capital to. The embedded return that we calculate for the portfolio assumes that the premium dollars come in at new investment rates, but that the capital because the capital sits and just continues to roll has a much longer duration so the capital that supports it is somewhat more reflective of the historical capital embedded in the portfolio. So premiums come in entirely at new money rates. Again, this is the analytics that we use. The capital based upon allocated capital to that product reflecting more of a historical duration kind of -- because again, it supports the business. As one piece of business roll off, a new piece of business comes on, the capital has a different duration than the new premium base. And if you look at the Business Insurance segment in the aggregate, as we did just yesterday in making sure that we can answer this question, the policy view, the return that we see in the business that we're writing today, is very low double digit. That's where it falls. I don't want to get more specific than that because obviously, it's reflecting of our pricing strategy. But it wouldn't take much to move into high single digits but it's very low double digits."

And we did that in the first quarter and when you do that, it also changes the dynamics growing forward of what constitutes a normal dividend versus what constitutes the special dividend. So in each of the quarters, we have gone to our regulators and said, we'd like to take x out and in each of the quarters, we've been given permission to do that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% i",920,"Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% increase over last year's math. Operating return on equity was a strong 14.3% and we experienced very solid underwriting results across each of our business segments. Our consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 90.6%. In an insurance pricing environment that remains largely flat in commercial businesses, we were pleased to produce an increase of 2% net written premiums for the quarter. Investment returns remained reduced from historical patterns as remarkably low interest rates, particularly short rates, continue to impact debt investment income. 
Lastly, we've grown our book value from year-end 2009 by 13% to $59.11. All in, a very strong quarter. This morning we're going to do things a bit differently than we have in previous quarters. All of the data that we've historically provided is still included in our webcast. However, we're only going to hit the highlights and you can review the details on your own and obviously Gabby is available later to take any questions you may have. Instead, we're going to take the opportunity to share a few additional insights into our business that we think you'll find interesting. 
First, we've spoken at length in previous presentations about our programs designed to grow our business organically. This morning, we're going to share with you summary analytics of our Business Insurance account growth and we suspect that a number of you will be surprised at the growth we've achieved. 
Second, a number of you have asked about the impact of reduced interest rates on our net investment income. Jay Benet shared an analysis of the impact of reinvestment rates at an investor conference in September and we've updated it for current conditions. We've analyzed the maturities in our fixed income portfolio for the next three years and will share with you the projected impact on net investment income, if reinvestment rates remain at current levels. 
The municipal bond environment remains a topic of some interest. We've updated an analysis of our municipal bond portfolio that we did for the second quarter webcast based on current ratings and market conditions. As we've said before, it is an actively managed portfolio where we are constantly evaluating risk and return of individual securities. There are never any guarantees, but we couldn't be more pleased with the positioning of the portfolio.
Finally, before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I want to comment on a topic that we're thinking about regularly. As we've discussed before, we believe the most thoughtful way to run a Property Casualty business for the long term is to produce superior returns on equity. As many of you understand, we can't promise consistent growth in either revenues or earnings and do so maintaining a thoughtful risk profile. 
Consequently, a number of years ago, consistent with our aspiration for superior returns on equity, and given what we viewed as typical underwriting in investment environments, we determined that we would target a mid-teens return on equity over time and do so by achieving top-tier profitability and returning excess capital to shareholders. Two very important words in that previous sentence are over time. 
Since January 2005, the first full year, after the merger of St. Paul and Travelers, our average annual operating return on equity is 14.1% and we've recorded more than $20 billion in operating income and have returned nearly $17 billion in total to shareholders, $13 billion in share repurchases and nearly $4 billion in dividends. Given the current general economic and investment environments, a few people have asked whether we intend to change our goal now. We're certainly not economists, nor do we know what the future holds. However, the underlying assumption we are making is that the economy will eventually return to a more typical investment environment, particularly with respect to the fixed income world. Consequently, we are not changing our goal now. Having said that, we've been very clear in the recent past that the current environment simply doesn't permit achievement of a consistent mid-teens return right now if one assumes no favorable reserve development and normal catastrophes and weather costs. 
If in fact, the market ultimately presents long term, meaningfully reduced investment returns, not only for us but also for the market at large, which for us are not offset by improved underwriting conditions, we will obviously rethink what that means for our aspirations and what investors can expect of us. So for now our target remains intact, and we continue to execute in the marketplace consistent with that goal. We seek rates selectively and thoughtfully where rate is needed especially in those cases where account loss experience has been inconsistent with our underwriting expectations. But we are always managing rate and retention with a clear view of maximizing long-term value to arbitrarily and aggressively seek rate and be a victim of adverse selection and watch our retention drop precipitously would not be a smart or thoughtful reaction to the current environment. 
As Brian will explain in greater detail, our field people take their lead from us and right now, their direction is unambiguous. We feel great about how they are executing, and we believe that we will continue to be amongst the best performing property and casually companies around. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jay."

I would remind you though that year-to-date, cat losses have been quite high over $1 billion on a pretax basis as compared to $441 million pretax in the first nine months of last year, which would approximate a more normal year-to-date amount. We had another quarter of net favorable prior-year reserve development in each of our segments concentrated this quarter in BI and FPII. The quarter's reserve development included an asbestos reserve increase of $140 million pretax. Included in this asbestos reserve increase and therefore, in the current quarter's operating income was a $70 million pretax benefit related to the recent favorable ruling we received against Munich Re and certain members of ECRA [Excess Casualty Reinsurance Association]. The total awarded to us by the court in this ruling was $417 million broken down as follows: $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement and interest of $166 million. 
Based upon this ruling, we reduced our uncollectible reinsurance reserve by $70 million, thereby reflecting in our financial statement the full $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement. Importantly, the benefit of the $166 million interest award was not reflected in either the current quarter's asbestos charge or in the current quarter's operating income since GAAP requires this interest to be treated as a contingent gain, generally until all appeals have been exhausted and/or the dollar amount is received. All of our capital leverage and liquidity measures remain at or better than target levels. We have holding company liquidity of $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which was more than twice the target level due to the timing of share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies for our holding company. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $600 million of our common shares, a higher amount than we would normally repurchase in the third quarter due to the strength of our balance sheet and the light wind season we have experienced thus far and paid $169 million in common stock dividends, bringing the total cash we returned to our shareholders in the past nine months to almost $4 billion. 
Third quarter operating ROE was 14.3% and book value per share once again increased, up 6% in the quarter and up 15% from a year ago.
Page 4 makes reference to our very high-quality investment portfolio, which includes a $4.6 billion pretax net unrealized gain at the end of the third quarter, up significantly from the $2.8 billion pretax net unrealized gain we reported at the beginning of the year. A little over 60% of the net unrealized gain relates to the muni bond portfolio. 
Page 5 provides an update of certain data we previously provided to you related to our muni bond portfolio. There have not been any significant changes in the portfolio recently notwithstanding our active management of the portfolio based upon a risk reward view for each individual holding due to its very high quality. The portfolio currently includes bonds that have gross unrealized gains of $2.8 billion pretax and bonds that have gross unrealized losses of only $8 million. That's right, only $8 million of losses, not billion. 
I'd also like to make some specific comments related to Page 9 of the webcast. During the presentation I made at a recent conference, I referred to today's low-interest rate environment and provided an illustration based upon our portfolio scheduled bond maturities in 2011, 2012 and 2013 of the impact on net investment income in those years if the current interest rate environment persists through this period of time and all of the variables such as average assets, mix, credit quality and duration, remain constant. The illustration I provided at the conference was based upon reinvesting at ten-year rates or approximately 100 basis points lower than the combined yield on the maturing bonds rounding the interest rate differential to the nearest 50 basis points. 
Since then, interest rates have fallen even further and we have updated the illustration to reflect a 150 basis point interest-rate decline. We've also added another line to the illustration, that shows the differential between 2010 NII and the subsequent years, again, all of the variables being held constant that includes the partial year impact of reinvesting 2010 maturities of lower interest rates. The full year impact of this activity will not be felt until 2011 and subsequent years, since the 2010 maturities will have taken place throughout 2010 rather than on the first day of the year. As you model these years, I would remind you that NII will also be impacted by the reduction in average invested assets that results from our share repurchase program. 
And with that, let me give the mic over to Brian."

Our typical disclosures on the business segment results are on Pages 11 through 22, and we will of course take questions on any topic. Instead of going through the slides, I will give a few perspectives on our businesses and the marketplace. 
In Business Insurance, we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our franchise. Both our account retention and flow of new business opportunities remain near historically high levels, which we believe will enable us to grow premiums if and when the economy improves. Core underwriting margins continued to contract modestly in the quarter, consistent with both prior quarters and our expectations. In short, the lost cost trends slightly outpaced earned rate changes. We continue to see the negative impact the economy is having on our insurance exposures. Audit premiums, which are retroactive premium adjustment charged to reflect changes in insured's payrolls, vehicles, property values or business receipts have improved, but are still negative. The exposure change on renewals, which is a prospective look, has also improved throughout the year and is now approaching zero. 
On a combined basis, these impacts are reducing premiums approximately 2% through the third quarter. So in other words, our data suggests that the economy is bottoming out, but we don't see any evidence of current economic expansion. Given these trends, our underwriting strategy remains consistent: Retain our quality business; optimize the profitability on this retained book by getting rate where it is warranted; and write new business for long-term profitable growth. 
Directionally, this strategy may be the same as many of our competitors, but by aligning it with our competitive advantages, namely our talent, technology, actionable management information and breadth of distribution, we believe we are very well positioned. Over the last seven quarters, we've seen significant account growth and as a result, we believe that we're growing market share. 
On Slide 16, you can see that since year end 2008, we've grown accounts in Business Insurance by a 8.5% compound annual growth rate. On the next slide, we've taken this data and broken it out for two of our of major business. 
In our small Commercial business, or Select Accounts, you can see that it is growing by a 10.6% tagger. This increase has been driven by our Select Express product, that's our no-touch insurance solution for small business customers. Through the combination of our sophisticated rating capabilities and cost-efficient front-line delivery, we are able to provide our agents and customers with an industry-leading product and platform. Within Select, in the plus end, or the larger end of this market, we have allowed our accounts to decrease, decrease due to extremely competitive market conditions. On the slide, you can also see that we've grown Commercial Accounts by 4.4% compound annual growth rate. 
The increase in the number of accounts in this business is driven primarily by the continued introduction of new products and the specialization and expertise of these products and our front-line underwriting and claim staff bring to the marketplace. This growth in Commercial Accounts is representative of what we are seeing across our middle market businesses. So we are encouraged by this increase in the number of accounts, and again, if and when the economy improves, the resulting impact on exposures should create a compelling written premium trend. Given both this top line dynamic and the current core underwriting profitability of this book of business, we remain very pleased with Business Insurance's current performance and its position in the marketplace moving forward. 
In the Financial, Professional and International segments, I will make just a few overall comments. First, writings in our International businesses are down compared to prior-year quarter as we are addressing risk and pricing in light of catastrophe and other severe weather losses over the past year. Secondly, although we remain very pleased with the market position and quality of our Construction Surety business, the impact of the economy on construction spending has resulted in fewer new business opportunities, and our writings in this quarter reflect this. And lastly, we continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruptions on our Management Liability business and our conclusions remain the same, that is, our losses are developing within or slightly favorable to our expectations. 
Turning to Personal Insurance. We are extremely pleased with both the underwriting and production results in the quarter. In both Agency, Auto and Property, policies in force continued to grow and core underwriting margins expanded as earned rate increases outpaced loss cost trends. In our Property line of business, weather losses were both less than third quarter expectations and a welcome relief from the pattern we saw in the first half of the year. While the continental U.S. was not meaningfully impacted by any of the storms generated during the peak of the hurricane season, the number of near misses this quarter highlights the importance of underwriting controls and risk management policies in this business. 
Agency Property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market, with quarter-over-quarter PIF growth remaining at historically high levels. In Agency Auto, our new business continued to improve and we had our best quarter-over-quarter policies in force increase since the end of 2008. Given the continued expansion in core underwriting margins and strong top line trends, we remained pleased with both our current and going-forward positions in these businesses.
So across all of our businesses, we feel great about our execution in the marketplace. And one of the primary reasons we believe our organization has executed so well in these times of uncertainty is that we have kept our message to the field clear, unambiguous and consistent. And that is, in these market conditions, just like pretty much any other, the role of our underwriters is to maximize the long-term value of the portfolio. To balance the desire to keep our quality business while at the same time optimizing the returns on that portfolio. 
Fundamentally, they do that by making sure they understand the account's risk characteristics and can estimate the potential losses from these exposures. They then seek the select risks in the marketplace where the premium level is appropriate for this view of the losses. We believe our field understands their role, has the best tools in the business to execute and as long as they can keep doing this, we will keep competing in the marketplace successfully. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Jay."

We are focused on retention and I would say taking new business selectively. No one should come to the conclusion that we are focused on growth. There isn't anything in the comments or in the data that should point anyone to the conclusion that we're focusing on growth, as the words you used. It is a very selective approach. It is not only based on price, but it's risk selection. We spend most of the time on these calls speaking about rate. Our folks in the fields spend most of their time focused on risk selection. So it's as I said, a complex business where you balance the elements, I just couldn't be more pleased with how we're managing through this largely unprecedented environment."

The return on equity that we publish in our press release and in our financials is straightforward GAAP return on equity, which is the earnings that we reported for the period divided by average equity for the period. And Jay and Doug can take you through all of that. We obviously understand that if our entire $70 billion investment portfolio were repriced today at today's reinvestment rates, what we would end up with a different return -- we understand that. Internally, the analytics that we have, we actually do look at it that way. We actually do evaluate products and businesses and lines based upon investing cash flows at today's available rates. And it's those analytics that form the basis of our pricing strategy and our volume strategy, and they are proprietary. They are important, they are the subject of substantial discussions here and it's that return that gives us our approach to whether we're aggressively growing, not aggressively growing or willing to shrink. Bryan spoke today about letting the large end of select shrink, because the pricing was such and the risk selection was such that the returns simply aren't adequate to support the business. So we're letting that shrink somewhat. And certainly, we understand that one of the reasons that Jay presented the schedule about investment income is that if these investment markets continue, if they are what they are, and the underwriting environment never changes and there's no more favorable development, yes, we're not going to be able to achieve the mid-teens return on equity and we certainly understand that and it's actually not all that difficult to model up the business and see what you think it is. We certainly do it all the time, and it can be achieved. It's all pretty simple, the numbers that you get in the press release are GAAP, things that we're all accustomed to getting. And internally, we have robust analytics that let us evaluate the current, underlying profitability based upon today's reinvestment rate and that's what establishes our underwriting energy or enthusiasm."

There has, at least in my career, never been a period where the gap between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been any wider than it is today. I find it actually remarkable that there are high-quality equities where the dividend yield is actually higher than the debt yield on the ten-year debt, high-quality companies. So it tells you that the marketplace is at the moment, somewhat upside down. And the real question that you're asking, and I think it's an extraordinary relevant one, is that going to continue? Can you possibly be in an environment where the two-year Treasury is at 2.4% and the cost of equity is a 10%. Or will there not be other Treasury activities that will take place? But in one fashion or another, we'll lower that gap, reduce that gap into a more normal historical range. We're extremely attentive to it. One can speculate that one way that the cost of equity will go down is a rising equity market. And some folks have asked me, gee, why do you think the market generally is rising now? One of the answers to it, is that it's reflecting a decline in cost of equity. It's somewhat counterintuitive to think of it that way. But frankly, it's entirely possible. So I don't know what the cost of equity will be in a few years. My guess is, is that if you've got a financial company three years from now, in today's environment, and you look back three years from now and the company has achieved a 10% period on return on equity, you'll feel great. You won't feel good, you'll feel great. And if you look broadly at the financial services arena, and we do and I do, and you look at the returns that institutions are producing, particularly in the banking arena where the rules and regulations and leverage dynamics are changing so much, I think that the dynamic of what returns are going to be over the next few years is a fascinating question and what it is that investors are going to seek. But my comment was for now, our goal is our goal. We will do the best we can. We are not going to act arbitrarily and go out to the marketplace and say, worst thing in the world to do is to go out to the marketplace and say we want five points of rate on every account. You'll get five points of rate on accounts that need ten, and you'll loose accounts that don't need any. The easiest way to get adverse selection is to take away the underwriter's authority to evaluate risk and return on an individual trade. So no mystery here. We acknowledge the environment is not possible right now. Not you that can't achieve mid-teens returns, but the two words, over time, are just critical to us. And that's how we think about. This is a long-term business and we manage it over time."

So all of the big names that you and we've been reading about in the news where -- we have very, very limited exposure there. We don't view it as an exposure, really, to the community banks and we think that's because they just haven't been foreclosing in the kind of volumes that would've involved the processes that are really in question here, and we haven't seen any indication that, that's the case.

First, our entire portfolio of subprime in [indiscernible] ABSs are actually $300 million and $200 million of that was 2004 and prior.

On the residential CMO side, we've got $2.3 billion of that, again virtually all 2004 and prior. We turned away from the market as both the mortgage market and the real estate market really heated up. $862 million of it is agency and $1.4 billion is non-agency. The facts and circumstances of this -- of what actually is happening and the implications are as confusing as I've ever seen it, it's not at all clear what the long-term issue really is. If we're talking about episodic, relatively short-term delays in foreclosure activity, our assessment is no problem with respect to the investments. And we've already seen some of that episodic, short-term delay. At the other extreme is the notion of a long-term, industry-wide, broad-based foreclosure moratorium. We don't know how to assess that. I don't know how to assess something that actually has never happened before. And frankly, I think of all of the issues that will occur, the impact on asset-backed securities may actually be the smallest in that kind of an environment. So I don't know how to size up that kind of long-term, broad-based moratorium. Again the episodic short-term stuff, we could be wrong on this, but our assessment is no underlying problem. With respect to the flip side of the issue, which is the ability to put mortgages back to the originating institutions, of course the GSEs have always had that. There's nothing particularly new on that front. And again, we could be wrong on this, but our assessment has been that it's hard for us to figure out a scenario where mortgages get put back to their originating institution and the bondholders lose. The originating institution seems to me could be in a position to lose, but we have some difficulty figuring out the scenario where the bondholder loses.

We looked at that base, by the way, we found we own three of them. I think there are three cross currents, one, the validity of foreclosures which have taken place. Two, would be ability on a prospective basis to foreclose, and of course they're beginning to get more particular in terms of what they demand and that's probably good. And three, the whole put-back phenomena. And they would cut differently across the portfolio. My guess is the probability of any of the three having a significant impact to us or anyone else, it might be more remote than the newspapers are suggesting and whatever happens is going to happen over time. To the extent that there's a put-back phenomenon, we would benefit. It's easier for GSEs to put back mortgages than non-agency pulls, because all the GSEs have to do is to prove they weren't performing. So we'd be beneficiaries, but we're not counting on much."

We've provided lots of information about that previously, not a price-driven strategy. And again the data is so clear that it supports this. You're looking at retention that is at historical highs and renewal pricing that's more or less at flat, a little below or flat.

And we've talked about this a lot in the past and Jay, touched on it. It's the spread across the portfolio that really matters there. If we were getting minus one on each and every account, that's one strategy. We've got accounts in here where we're getting plus tens, and we've got accounts that are certainly getting minus tens. It's blending to something pretty close to neutral. We feel good about the profitability of our book, and we wake up every morning wanting to retain most of those accounts. So I think to characterize our strategy is taking down prices to grow in our minds is not consistent with how we think about it."

Let me be a little more specific. So we're talking about allocated capital. Each of our products, each of our businesses is based upon the duration and the volatility our actuaries assign an amount of capital to. The embedded return that we calculate for the portfolio assumes that the premium dollars come in at new investment rates, but that the capital, because the capital sits and just continues to roll, has a much longer duration so the capital that supports it is somewhat more reflective of the historical capital embedded in the portfolio. So premiums come in entirely at new money rates. Again, this is the analytics that we use. The capital based upon allocated capital to that product reflecting more of a historical duration kind of -- because again, it supports the business. As one piece of business rolls off, a new piece of business comes on, the capital has a different duration than the new premium base. And if you look at the Business Insurance segment in the aggregate, as we did just yesterday in making sure that we can answer this question, the policy view, the return that we see in the business that we're writing today, is very low double digit. That's where it falls. I don't want to get more specific than that because obviously, it's reflecting of our pricing strategy. But it wouldn't take much to move into high single digits, but it's very low double digits."

The mechanics of this thing are taking dividends out of the operating companies and bring them up to the holding company. There are other things that impact it like stock option and equity awards, that's a relatively small number. Taxes come into play. Going on the other way, interest on the corporate debt, shareholder dividend, stock repurchases themselves, any pension plan funding we do. So those are the components of it. I'm not sure you can really have full visibility to all those components, but what ends up happening is that the $2.4 billion grows to $2.8 billion.

I'm thinking about 10-K at the beginning of the year, of course, we had indicated that we could take dividends up without special authorization of something around $3.5 billion is my recollection. Somebody's going to look that up for me, but we also said during the first or second quarter, I'm not sure which one, was that based on the capital positions of the operating companies, which had gotten very robust, we were actually going to go to our regulators and say that we wanted to take capital out of the operating companies at a higher level than that would have indicated and get their authority to do that, which we did. And we did that in the first quarter and when you do that, it also changes the dynamics going forward of what constitutes a normal dividend versus what constitutes a special dividend. So in each of the quarters, we have gone to our regulators and said, we'd like to take x out and in each of the quarters, we've been given permission to do that. But it's all in conjunction with the strategy, as Jay has talked about, as always rightsizing the capital to place.
