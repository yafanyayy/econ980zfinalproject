We're going to begin this morning by taking a minute to review a few of our major accomplishments in 2009 if I could. And 2009 was a difficult year, in many respects, with a lot of volatility. But across our company, I think we really did an outstanding job of handling that volatility to deliver solid results. Cash generation was a priority for us, as we've mentioned throughout the year and we generated over $300 million of free cash flow. This is our best free cash flow generation since the year 2000, and Curt will give you more details in just a few minutes. Our flexible structure enabled us to respond quickly to the recession, and we reduced our costs by $200 million. And this is reflected in our earnings, both for the year and the fourth quarter. We made progress on our growth initiatives. We entered into a JV with SK for adding acetate tow capacity in Korea that serves the growing demand in Asia, and a new capacity will be up and running by the end of this quarter. We've added both new monomer and polymer capacity for our Tritan Copolyster and we're pleased with the start up there, and we're able to meet the growing demand we're seeing. And we also continued to expand our Regalite adhesive facility in the Netherlands, increasing capacity by 30% in 2009 to keep up with that demand.Despite the difficult global economic environment, our Fibers segment delivered a record earnings year, topping the previous record they set in 2008. And we did a great job on safety, something we all don't get to see that much off. But in 2009, we had our best-ever OSHA Recordable injuries' rate, reducing injuries by 40% from 2008, building on our reputation for excellence in safety. So we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flow and to grow our core businesses.Next is an update on how we did against the corporate-outlook statements we gave you, both on our last in October and during our Investor Day in November. This is something I do on each call, and my intent is to hold us accountable for the expectations we give you. First, on full year EPS, we told you in November, we expected it to be approximately $3.50 and this implied EPS for the fourth quarter of just over $1. Excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges in both periods and other operating income in 2008, we were slightly above expectations and I'll talk more about that in a minute. We also said that the cost-reduction actions we have taken would be evident in our results, and they are. And on cash, we told you we would build on the free cash flow we had generated through nine months, including generating more than $100 million in cash from working capital for the year, and we did that from the fourth quarter.Now onto the financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue was up slightly, as higher volumes more than offset lower selling prices. This is the first quarter we've seen positive year-over-year volume comparisons in two years since the fourth quarter of 2007. It's a sign that we are beginning to see a rebound in volume, which we expect will continue in 2010. Selling prices were down due to the global recession and decline in raw material and energy cost. Operating earnings increased significantly, mainly due to the higher volume that I mentioned, lower costs for raw materials and energy, and the cost-reduction actions that I've talked about.Moving on to the full year comparison. Sales revenue was down due both to lower prices and volumes. Prices fell largely due to lower raw material and engine costs, volumes were down due to the recession. Earnings declined but given the severity of the recession, I would say they remained pretty solid. EPS declined just under 20%, which one compared with previous recessions is a significant improvement. For example, from 2000 and 2001, our EPS declined by over 70%. The portfolio actions we have taken to strengthen our core businesses, along with the cost-reduction actions we took in '08 and '09, led to much improved earnings in this recession compared to the last one.Now to the segments, beginning with Fibers. As many of you know, Rick Johnson has led Fiber since 1996, and so he's seen the impact that recessions can have on this business. He calls Fibers, recession resistant but not recession proof. And then in 2009, Fibers' recession resistance lead to new annual record of operating earnings, topping last year's record. So it kind of begs the question, what's it take to be called recession proof? Higher selling prices were offset by lower sales volume, with the volume decline coming in the acetyl chemicals and acetate tow product lines.For tow, the decline was more in the second half of the year, due to the recession and the cigarette tax increases that were implemented in the U.S. and Europe. Looking ahead to 2010, Fibers is well positioned for another strong year. Demand should begin to rebound as the global economy recovers. We also expect our acetate tow JV with SK in Korea to start up in this quarter, and there will be some cost associated with that, as we qualify the material with our customers. So we roll it all together, we expect 2010 earnings to be somewhat below 2009 but remain very solid.Next stop is CASPI [Coatings, Adhesive, Specialty Polymers and Inks]. This is another business setting records in a very difficult economic environment. Fourth quarter with earnings of $77 million was their best fourth quarter ever. And this follows a record earnings that reported in the third quarter. Volume was up 15% in the fourth quarter due to the demand recovery, while prices declined, as I discussed earlier. For the year, operating earnings increased as lower raw material and energy cost and cost reductions more than offset lower volumes and prices. Looking forward to 2010, they have a chance to set a new record for operating earnings above the $242 million they reported in 2007. Their biggest headwind is the higher raw material and energy cost with more than 50% of the revenue in specialty product lines. The higher costs will impact their margins. Improving volume is the biggest tailwind, and we think we are in the early stages of seeing that improvement. Assuming the economic recovery continues, CASPI is set up for another strong year. Performance Chemicals Intermediates is next (sic) [Performance Chemicals and Intermediates], PCI. Operating earnings improved in the fourth quarter due to lower raw material and energy cost, higher volumes and lower cost per unit due to higher capacity utilization. For the year, operating earnings declined, primarily due to lower prices and cost related to the reconfiguration of our Texas facility during the second quarter. I would also point out that for the full year, PCI earned their cost of capital. And this is much different from their results in the last recession where in 2001, their operating earnings were only $13 million for the year.  We've talked about the actions we've taken that lift the trough in this business, and 2009 is evidence that we've been successful in this effort. Looking forward in 2010, we expect raw material and energy cost to increase, pressuring margins. But we also expect sales volume to increase, as the global economy improves. So as a result, we expect PCI operating earnings to be up versus '09, approaching $100 million.Next is Specialty Plastics. With their results in the fourth quarter, they've now placed the two successive quarters with double-digit operating earnings. Fourth quarter earnings improved, primarily due to higher sales volume, and we've consistently said the key to improvement in this business is higher volumes. Fourth quarter was the third successive quarter of volume improvement for Specialty Plastics. While demand growth is still slow for the industry overall, the number of copolyester is growing faster than the polycarbonate, acrylic and PVC, to name a few, of the things we compete against and the things we're displacing. For the full year, operating earnings declined mainly due to lower volumes and prices driven by the recession. Looking forward to 2010, as I mentioned earlier, the Tritan monomer and resin facilities are up and running, and we are pleased with the start up. And with the facilities now up and running, Specialty Plastics will have additional fixed cost though, a more than $7 million per quarter, about $30 million, for full year 2010. Some of that new from outside the company, some of that just reallocated costs within the company. And this all occurs as they ramp up their volumes. And despite these costs, we expect the operating earnings for Specialty Plastics to be around $40 million for the year and very well positioned to grow from there, going forward. Finally, Performance Polymers. In October, I said the fourth quarter was going to ugly for Performance Polymers, and it was. Loss in the quarter was due to the operational challenges we've had in South Carolina and the shutdown we took to address them, as well as depressed demand due to continued difficult market conditions. The full year loss was also due to the operational issues in Carolina, as well as lower selling prices. Clearly, we aren't happy with the results on this business. And we are taking no regrets [ph] actions to improve their performance.To remind you, we said we have two issues: Operational performance and upgrading our commercial footprint, the markets we serve. I think we can check the box for the operational. The shutdown in Carolina during the fourth quarter went well, and we've now demonstrated that it can run at full rates with Class 1 material. That's good news. Now with the progress on that, we can now address our commercial footprint and improve our mix of customers. We expect these actions will lead to a much smaller loss sequentially, and for the full year in this business.That brings me to our guidance. We're coming into 2010 with positive momentum, given our results over the last couple of quarters. We are in the early stages of volume improvement, and expect that will continue as the global economy improves. While we have a headwind of about $40 million year-over-year from the reversal of extraordinary measures to reduce cost in '09, namely the across-the-board 5% pay reduction, that we then restored in December. We will continue to benefit from the over $150 million of cost-reduction actions we've taken in other areas. And I would add that by year end, our headcount was down 2% from our spring-restructuring levels. And for 2010, we expect attrition to continue to run ahead of hiring.A headwind that we are already seeing here in January is higher raw material and energy cost, and we expect on average through the year, these costs will be higher than they were in '09. Adding all that up, we expect our first quarter EPS to be slightly above our fourth quarter EPS of $1.14, and we expect our full year 2010 EPS to be 20% above our 2009 EPS of $3.63.On top of that, we expect revenue from an asset to your [ph] license for PCI in the first half of the year, could be first or second quarter, we'll see. And we estimated it'll have about a $0.07 per share impact, positive. One last point, at our Investor Day in November, we've made the case for why we can achieve a 20% compound annual growth rate for our EPS from 2009 through a recovery, which we estimate would be in 2012. Given the results we reported in '09 and our expectations for 2010, we believe we are on track to deliver that growth. Employees throughout our company are clear on the role in delivering that EPS growth, and we are committed to making it happen. Now before I turn it over to Curt, I'd like to continue my practice of taking a minute to highlight one of Eastman's executives. In this quarter, I choose Norris Sneed, our chief Administrative Officer, who has been with the company for 31 years. Norris head's our human resource function, our information technology group, as well as manufacturing and support worldwide. He and his people are instrumental in the swift actions we took to mitigate the recession's impact over this past year. He is supported by Parker Smith in manufacturing, Keith Sturgill in IT and Ed McKenner [ph] in HR. And together, they accomplished a lot. So if you like the costings we achieved in '09, Norris is just one of the leaders who deserve the tip of our collective hat. And now I'll turn it over to Curt."

I'm going to start by looking at our financial highlights for the year on Slide 14.

I'm going to start by looking at our financial highlights for the year on Slide 14. Our cash from operations of $758 million represents a terrific result in a difficult environment. Working capital was a source of cash, having been reduced by $118 million. And this in line with our projections from earlier in the year. We also generated about $125 million in positive cash flow through a change in tax-accounting method to accelerate the timing of deductions for a manufacturing repairs expense, which we discussed in the third quarter.Our cash from operations also reflected $181 million use of cash for our pension contributions of which, $150 million was made in the fourth quarter. Moving next to capital expenditures in 2009, we cut our CapEx by more than half compared with 2008. Second-half 2009 capital expenditures were at a significantly lower run rate than first after due to the completion of several growth projects.After, also, excluding our dividend of $128 million, our free cash flow was $320 million in 2009. As Jim mentioned, this is the best annual free cash flow we've generated since 2000, and is a testament to our focus on cash throughout the year. The result is that we are in a solid financial position, having reduced net debt by $256 million, and our net-debt-to-cap ratio is at 35%.Turning to Slide 15, as we continue to generate cash, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. In 2009, our dividend was $128 million or $1.76 per share, and our yield continues to be in the top-quartile peer companies. We pay the dividend every year, we have been a public company and management remains committed to it. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 21 million of shares. As a result, our shares outstanding at the end of 2009 was the same as it was at the end of 2008.Going into 2010, we have $96 million remaining on our current-stock authorization, and remain committed to repurchasing shares over the coming quarters, primarily as a means to offset dilution.  We are also focused on our debt structure, which remains attractive as shown Slide 16. In the fourth quarter, we improved our position with a $250 million tenured bond at a 5.5% rate. The 5.5% rate is the best we've achieved with this tenor. The order book was six times over subscribe and the quality of the order book was outstanding. With the success of the bond offering, we decided to put a similar amount of cash to work in the quarter, making a $150 million pension contribution, and paying down our European credit facility. With this transaction, we've added a nice 2019 layer to our already attracted debt ladder, and we have funded debt or debt-like obligations that we'd otherwise have to address over the coming next few years.Looking next at cash, we put to work in our organic investments. We are beginning to see the returns from these investments we have made over the past few years. As Jim mentioned earlier, in 2009, we expanded our Regalite capacity, and we'll see the benefit of that in the CASPI segment starting in 2010. In the fourth quarter 2008, we added acetate tow capacity in the U.K., and our Fibers segment continues to benefit from that investment, which is reflected in their record 2009 results.We have taken a number of actions to transform our South Carolina PET facility and with the improved operation of the facility, we expect to see their results improved significantly in 2010. In our Tritan monomer and resin manufacturing facilities are up and running, as of the beginning of the year and we have aggressive schedule for filling out that resin facility over the next two years. This will be one of the key components that will lead to improved performance in Specialty Plastics particularly, in 2011. In 2010, we are also looking at M&A opportunities with a focus on the four areas of emphasis you see listed in Slide 18. One example of how we look at these opportunities is the venture we have with SK in Korea. To acquire SK's tow and other manufacturing assets and then to expand the tow capacity to a total of 20,000 net tons, which is about a 15% capacity addition for Eastman. This expense our footprint in a differentiated product line in a growing region. And we expect the acquisition to be completed and the capacity online by the end of the first quarter.Another example that combines two of these focus areas is the acquisition we completed a few weeks ago. We acquired a small specialty polymers manufacturing facility located near Shanghai. This is right in our sweet spot. It will support our Ensure product line and CASPI segment. Ensure is a sustainably-advantage cellulose tester used in the coatings for the packaging and consumables' markets.  We continue to explore other opportunities that also provide differentiated products and advantage feedstocks to complement our existing sustainably advantage product lines.Turning to some corporate items to assist with expectations for 2010. Starting with depreciation and amortization, which I expect to increase to just under $290 million in 2010, as we have added some new manufacturing facilities that come online. Pension expense should be slightly higher due to the lower discount rate and historical performance of our assets, mostly offset by the benefit of the pension contributions in 2009. And if we do make a pension contributions in 2010, at this point, I expect it would be less than $25 million.Our interest expense is expected to be higher, this is a combination of the lower capitalized interest, as manufacturing facilities have come online and thus reduced our capital expenditures and the new debt issue that I mentioned. The tax rate is expected to come down in 2010 to approximately 33%, which is about normal for us. Remember, the rate was higher in 2009, primarily because of the change during the second quarter in the tax accounting method to accelerate the timing and deductions for manufacturing repairs expense that I mentioned earlier, and the reversal of a tax credit related to the Beaumont, Texas facility, a project during -- which we discussed in the third quarter.Our capital expenditures for 2010 are planned to be between $250 million and $275 million. Our maintenance level is now around $200 million, and we plan to spend $50 million to $75 million on targeted-growth initiatives. This growth spending will be staged relative to the underlying economic recovery and target markets. And we remain focused on optimizing maintenance capital, much like we did in 2009. When I consider our expectations for earnings growth in 2010, plus these items, I expect our free cash flow in 2010 will be above $100 million. This includes a build in working capital due to our expectations for a higher raw material and energy cost, and higher sales revenue. We also expect to see a more normal working capital pattern for the year, including a build in working capital in the first quarter.In conclusion, Eastman is well positioned for growth in 2010 and beyond. We are evaluating all options for creating value, organic investments, M&A, share repurchases and our debt profile. We will continue to be disciplined, as we approach growth, as we've been demonstrating. Thanks again for your attention and with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

And as I look at how it plays off, I imagine it will still have a pretty strong start to the year, and then we'll just see how these two forces play out, the volumes at our back and pressure on spreads in our base."

And in particular, the mix of products in places like CASPI, and just the acceptance of some of our specialty products, and how well they're doing competing with other materials. I guess that's really hard for me to break out. I wouldn't want people to go wildly optimistic and start moving well north of $6 just on the back of one quarter that came in. But yes, we raised guidance slightly, didn't we? Last just November, we were saying 20% higher than 350. Now we're saying 20% higher than 363.

And that's where we think  we're going to more than make up for it in volume that's why we say we think CASPI can have record year this year in 2010. But there's no doubt that the more special the product, the more likely you are to not to be able to pass along raw material increases in price, just as you can be a little sticky when it goes the other way. When you get to the more commodity products, that's where the best way to handle that is with price. And that's what the market expects. They have transparency, they look through the raw materials. You kind of have to take it specialty versus commodity when it comes to the magnitude of the move. Let me give you an anecdotal example as to why it's so hard to call. So we start the year, propane's at $1.10, and you know we use propane to feedstocks for our oxo stream particularly down in Texas. We've seen as high as -- this is just in the month of January now. We've seen as high as $1.45. I think the last time I looked, it was $1.35. Inevitably, January can be a volatile month because of the winter. But it's logical to expect raw materials and energy to move up. And it's logical to expect a little bit of the squeeze, which is what Jim implied mainly on the specialty products, like in the coatings on the margins. But overall, we kind of gave our guidance balancing the volumes, as well unexpected squeeze because of the raw materials moving up. I can't say several hundred million or something like that or '09 to 2010. We'll just have to see how volatility is."

Beginning with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in January. For first quarter EPS, we told you we expected to be slightly above the $1.14 we reported in the fourth quarter, and since then, we had an outage in our Longview, Texas, which negatively impacted our results. But we were able to more than offset the impact of the outage with strong volume and improved mix and a strong March. I'll talk more about the quarter in a minute. 
Next, we told you that we projected our full year 2010 EPS would be 20% higher than our 2009 EPS of $3.63. I'll talk more about our expectations for 2010 EPS when I get to the outlook, but given our strong start in our first quarter, we expect to be well above this projection. 
We also told you that we expect to generate more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2010. This is on top of a $320 million of free cash we generated in 2009. Although we used cash in the first quarter due to a working capital build, which is reflective of our strong revenues, given our expectations for strong earnings performance, we expect to more than meet this objective. Curt will walk you through this in more detail in his section. 
We told you that we expected to recognize earnings from an acetyl license in the first half of 2010 and this happened in March. This license, along with the license we with Chang Chun Petrochemical in Taiwan, is a recognition of the value of our acetyl coke production technology. 
And we've told you that we expect to make progress on joint ventures and acquisitions in 2010 and we have. In March, we announced the completion of the acetate tow manufacturing plant in Korea that is owned by our joint venture with SK, in which we have a controlling interest. Also in March, we announced we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Genovique Specialties Corporation, which will strengthen our Non-Phthalate Plasticizer business in the PCI segment. 
Next is a review of our financial results for first quarter 2010. And as I mentioned, we were more than able to offset the impact of the outage at our Longview, Texas facility. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year. Volumes increased 22%. Part of the increase is a comparison to depressed demand in first quarter 2009, obviously. But it also reflects the benefit of growth initiatives in areas like Specialty Plastics. 
Our operating margin increased to 12%, up substantially year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The increased earnings reflected the higher volumes, the improved capacity utilization and the resulting lower unit cost and a positive shift in product mix. The net impact of both the acetyl license revenue and the outage at the Longview facility is about negative $0.15 per share. That's the net. I'd also add we had good momentum in the quarter with March being our strongest month. 
Turning to the segments, starting with Fibers. What a great business. Fibers operating earnings in the quarter tied their quarterly record set in third quarter 2009, and they have now set a record in four of the last five quarters. Revenue, volume and pricing were all similar to first quarter 2009 levels. 
Operating earnings increased due to the slight increase in prices and higher acetate yarn utilization. In first quarter 2009, acetate yarn capacity utilization was around 30%. In the first quarter 2010, it was in the mid-80s. As I mentioned, the 27,000 net ton acetate tow facility in Korea started up in the first quarter, and we're making good progress qualifying material with customers, but there will be somewhat of a headwind from the new capacity in 2010 as we fill it out. We expect this will be offset with the stronger acetate yarn volumes. And as a result, we expect 2010 operating earnings to be similar to the $300 million they reported in 2009. 
Next up is CASPI, another great business. The biggest story for CASPI is a rebound in volume, up 34% year-over-year. The volume increase is due to the comparison against depressed volume in first quarter 2009 and some inventory restocking. They also upgraded their mix, mainly due to an increase in volumes for their specialty coalescence and specialty polymers, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Operating earnings increased substantially year-over-year but were down $11 million sequentially. The sequential decline was due to the negative $10 million of on the Longview outage and some margin compression. Operating margin was 18% and excluding the impact of the outage, would've been 20%. Looking forward, given their strong start to the year and expected continued strong results in the second quarter, they have a good chance to set a new operating earnings record in 2010 above the $242 million that they reported in 2006. 
PCI is next. Revenue increased substantially, up 58% year-over-year. Volume was up due to the comparison against depressed levels in first quarter 2009. We're also benefiting from tightness caused by planned maintenance and competitor outages and ethylene and foroxos [ph] in Asia. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs, and product mix improved due to increased volumes of higher-priced olefin derivatives and sales revenue from the acetyl license. Operating earnings improved substantially year-over-year due to the higher volume and price and improved product mix and the sales revenue from the acetyl license. The negative impact of the Longview outage and the revenue from the acetyl license mostly netted out to zero for PCI. 
Looking forward, we expect tightness to continue in a number of our olefin derivatives and for sales volume to remain strong. As a result, we expect our full year operating earnings to be above $125 million, more than double their 2009 operating earnings of $54 million. 
I'd also like to make a comment about all the hard work our employees in Longview did to limit the impact of the outage we experienced in the quarter. Of course, you never like to have an outage like this. But when you do, it's great to know there is an experienced group that limits the impact and gets us back to serving our customers, and that's why we have such a great reputation for reliability. 
Specialty Plastics is next, and their story is very straightforward. Volume has recovered with the economy and our growth initiatives are beginning to pay off. Sales revenue increased 59% year-over-year due to higher sales volume and improved product mix. Volume was up 50% year-over-year and 20% sequentially and set a new quarterly record for the segment. For reference, year-over-year volume increases for competitive materials, such as polycarbonate, acrylic, ABS and others were probably between 5% to 20% according to the CMAI. 
We are starting to see the benefit of growth initiatives in core copolyesters in areas such as shrink film and handled food packaging, and adoption of our new Tritan copolyester is ahead of schedule due to the product properties, including a higher temperature resistance and the fact that it is BPA free. 
Product mix improved as we had higher volumes for our cellulosic plastics for LCD screens, and we are now benefiting from the recovery in this market. Operating earnings improved substantially due to the higher volume, higher capacity utilization and the improved product mix. 
Looking at the full year, we now expect operating earnings to be above $60 million for the year. And I remind you that this includes about $7 million of cost a quarter, $30 million a year of fixed costs for the new Tritan capacity. 
Turning next to Performance Polymers. Operating results for the quarter were a loss of $13 million compared with a loss of $14 million in the first quarter 2009. The slight improvement in operating results was due to higher selling prices and the improved operation of the IntegRex facility, which were mostly offset by higher raw material and energy cost. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, we are continuing to focus on upgrading our commercial footprint and improving our mix of customers. We made good progress in the first quarter, and we expect this progress will be reflected in our results in the second quarter. At the same time, the PET market in North America continues to be difficult with lackluster demand and capacity being added. Taking this together, we expect results from second quarter will approach breakeven. 
Most of you have probably seen the news release we issued before the call this morning announcing that we are reviewing strategic actions for our Performance Polymers business. We've hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch for the strategic review, and you've heard me say on many occasions that we have taken no-regrets actions to improve the performance of this business. These include improving our operational performance and upgrading our commercial footprint. We've made good progress in these areas. And as a result, I believe this is the right time to determine whether or not Eastman is the highest and best owner for this business. And we're targeting completing this effort by the end of this year. 
Turning next to regional performance. Given our very strong corporate results, it's probably not a surprise that we have strong regional results. You'll see that our revenue and volume growth year-over-year was strongest outside North America. Asia revenue was up 60% with a 34% increase in volume. A favorable shift in product mix also contributed 16% to the revenue growth. The biggest contributor to the revenue growth was Specialty Plastics, and this is a combination of cellulosic plastics for LCDs and higher volumes for Tritan copolyester. CASPI was also much stronger, particularly in their specialty polymers and specialty coalescent product lines. Revenue in our European region was up 55% with volume up 28%. Strength was particularly good in the CASPI, PCI and Specialty Plastics segments. The improvement in product mix was due in part to revenue from the acetyl license here. Latin America revenue increased 66%, off a smaller base of course, and with this improvement largely in Performance Polymers. 
That brings me to our guidance for the second quarter and the full year. We're seeing clear signs of a global recovery in our volumes. We've seen it in our first quarter results, and we expect it will continue in the second quarter. I'd also mention that our visibility, while still limited, has improved slightly. A result of the higher volumes is that our capacity utilization has improved, leading to lower unit cost. We also expect volatility in raw material and energy cost to continue. So looking at the second quarter, we expect EPS will be between $1.50 and $1.60. This outlook includes approximately another $5 million to $10 million of residual costs for the Texas outage that'll fall in the second quarter. So for the year, given our first quarter results and our expectation for a strong second quarter, we expect full year earnings per share to be between $5 and $5.25. 
Now before I turn it over to Curt, let me take one minute for the executive spotlight. And my choice this quarter is heavily influenced by two trips I've recently taken. The first trip was to Brazil, where I went to São Paulo and Conoserie [ph] and the second trip went around the world through Rotterdam; Zug, Switzerland; Dubai; Riyadh; Singapore; Shanghai, and yes, I'm a still little jet lagged. On both of these trips, I was very impressed with and proud of our regional leaders. Those of you who attended our Investors Day will remember Juan Carlos Parodi, Gupta Amat and Michael Chung. These three leaders are not only quite talented but have a depth of experience in their region. Juan Carlos has responsibility for Mexico and everything south and many of the opportunities he and his team are working on are in Brazil, a country of tremendous potential for Eastman. 
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region just turned in a fantastic quarter and Gupta's team is focused on continuing that success by pursuing opportunities in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and of course they will work on integrating the Genovique acquisition in Estonia. 
Finally, I take a great deal of comfort that we have someone with Michael Chung's abilities and customer contacts to head the important region of Asia. Supported by strong teams in Singapore and Shanghai, we expect continued strong growth in this region as well. So typically, I'd pick only one exec for the spotlight, but given our international results this quarter, I hope you can understand how I thought it appropriate to recognize our three regional leaders. 
And now I turn it over to Curt."

In the first quarter, we used $25 million of cash in operations. This excludes the impact of adopting amended accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets. The result for Eastman of adopting this accounting change is at $200 million of receivables, previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under our receivables securitization program, are now included in the balance sheet in the first quarter as trade receivables. 
As a result, receivables were increased in the first quarter 2010 cash flow statement reducing cash from operations by $200 million. Aside from the adoption of this accounting guidance, receivables increased $214 million due to increased sales revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $88 million, excluding the impact of adoption of the accounting guidance, reflecting the increase in working capital during the quarter. Our net debt to capital now stands at 42%, up from the end of the year, mainly due to adoption of amended accounting guidance. 
Turning next to growth. As the global economy recovers and our volumes and capacity utilization increases, we have a number of capacity additions that have and will contribute to our growth. One example is our 2009 Regalite expansion in Middleburg, the Netherlands. Regalite is used in a wide variety of hot melt adhesives, polymer compounds and plastic modifications which are used in end markets such as disposable diapers. We expanded capacity by approximately 30% in 2009 alone and have increased capacity by 65% since 2006. This expanded facility is currently running at a high rate due to strong customer demand for this product, and we are considering additional expansions. 
Another example is the 30,000 metric ton Tritan copolyester resin facility that was completed at the end of 2009. You may recall that in addition to the resin capacity, we built monomer capacity for Tritan to support 60,000 metric tons of resin capacity. You heard from Jim that adoption of Tritan is happening quicker than anticipated. As we fill out the first resin facility, we will consider when to add a second 30,000 metric ton resin line to meet growing market demand for Tritan. 
A third example is the 27,000 metric tons of acetate tow capacity in Korea that was completed this quarter to meet growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region. We have a controlling interest in the JV that owns this facility. It represents about 15% increase to our acetate tow capacity, and while we won't see much of the benefit in 2010 as we qualify product with our customers, we are well positioned for growth in 2011. 
Another capacity addition for Eastman, not on the slide, is the acidic and hydride capacity we will market as a result of our acetyl license with Sipchem. In addition to completing the license with Sipchem in March, we will now market up to 50,000 metric tons of acidic and hydride from their facility in the Middle East. 
In addition to these capacity additions, we are looking at a number of other opportunities for organic growth throughout the company. For example, we're evaluating an expansion of our CTA capacity for the LCD market that was postponed in 2009 due to the recession. And we have a history of finding low-cost debottleneck opportunities with their manufacturing streams. Eastman is fortunate to have multiple opportunities for organic growth. 
In addition to the Korean acetate tow joint venture, we are also looking to grow through acquisitions. In mid-March, we announced that we're entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Genovique Specialties, shown here on Slide 15, a leading producer of non-phthalate plasticizers. Our current plasticizer product lines in the PCI segment is expected to generate approximately $300 million in revenue in 2010, with roughly double-digit operating margins. As a reminder, our current general-purpose plasticizers are used in flexible PVC applications. The Genovique acquisition is expected to add more than 50% to our existing revenue base with complementary specialty plasticizer product lines and is expected to have operating margins above those of our existing business. The transaction is expected to be accretive in 2010 including transaction costs. 
Looking forward, the compound annual growth rate for non-phthalate plasticizers in North America and Europe is expected to be approximately 7% over the next five years, and our expanded geographic footprint with manufacturing sites in Estonia and China will provide growth opportunities in emerging markets. The transaction is expected to close any time now and we'll provide more details after the close. 
As we have discussed in the past, we are focused on four areas of emphasis with our joint venture and acquisition activities as summarized on Slide 16. The Genovique acquisition is an example of how we can achieve multiple aspects of these areas of emphasis in a transaction. It has manufacturing locations in emerging geographies, non-phthalate plasticizers are differentiated products and viewed as green and sustainable by the marketplace and it benefits from some backward integration to basic raw materials. 
As we look at additional JVA opportunities, we remain focused on these four areas of emphasis. And I would add that the market looks more attractive to us today than it did six months ago. 
Turning next to Slide 17. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our last dividend payment was the 64th consecutive dividend that we have paid to stockholders. In addition, in the first quarter, we repurchased $20 million of shares. Our remaining authorization is $75 million and we expect to repurchase shares over the coming quarters primarily as a means to offset dilution. 
Turning next to an update on our expectations for free cash flow. First, consistent with our guidance, we are expecting strong business performance. We are also expecting working capital for the year to increase, but consistent with our seasonal patterns, it will be a source of cash in the second half of the year. Although first quarter capital expenditures were low on a historical basis, we continue to expect they will be in the $250 million to $275 million range as expenditures ramp up for the remainder of the year. This includes spending on growth initiatives and incremental capacity additions. As you know, we remain committed to our solid dividend. The net result is that we expect to generate between $200 and $300 million of free cash flow in 2010. 
In conclusion, Eastman continues to be well positioned for growth in 2010 and beyond. You see us taking action to create value from our balance sheet with organic growth initiatives, joint ventures and acquisitions and share repurchases. And we'll continue to be disciplined as we implement growth initiatives to create value for stockholders. 
Thanks for your attention and your interest in Eastman Chemical Company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

I'll take it in order. So Tritan, really doing well for us, exceeding our expectations in terms of the demand out there, and it's driven by its performance characteristics as well as of course it's BPA free. We're getting good traction, particularly in Asia where a lot of the products are molded so you see that in our Asia results. You're not really seeing a positive impact on earnings. In fact, the costs as we ballpark-ed for you, around $7 million, $7.5 million of fixed cost a quarter. The way we look at our volume ramp up, it's probably not until sometime next year that Tritan actually has a positive EFO impact. So you're seeing these results are still overcoming negative numbers for Tritan as it ramps up. So that means the rest of the business is actually better than the net number you see. One of the things in the rest of that business that's doing quite well now is displayed. And we're a little bit up the value chain from some of the other players that report who are closer to the actual flat screen maker. But now it's catching up with us. So we see that continuing as well. I will say that with Specialty Plastics, we know of certain cases where some volume was pulled forward into the first half of the year. So that's why I didn't just take 4x the 20 and say the year would be 80. I think we ballpark-ed it around 60. We know some of that volume got pulled forward. But overall, a great story in Specialty Plastics."

Just on the utilization rates, we started doing that when the world fell apart because we wanted to give everyone some kind of benchmark, some kind of a sketch or something they could use to just get a grasp of where we are, and we even based our 2012 projection of $6. We said that was based upon getting back to full utilization rates which would kind of be recovery rates. And so it's not ideal as we talk about utilization rates. I just want to make that clear to people. One of the things you miss is that as our utilization rates go up, we always have the opportunity to start upgrading our mix, and that's what we typically will do. As the utilization rates get higher, we'll start updating our mix and then we'll start adding capacity. So that's kind of what you ought to be expecting out of Eastman. If you just look across our streams, though, to give you an answer on utilization rates, acetyl's the highest as you might expect. The Olathe [ph] stream, of course, was, you might say artificially low in the first quarter because that's where the cracker outage was. Polyester would be in between. Overall for the corporation, we were kind of mid-80s in the first quarter. If I look at the month and we really -- it's not a good practice to start giving monthly results. We like to do it by quarter, but we thought it was worthwhile for investors to know that the quarter ended on a strong note. And I can just say that is continuing into the second quarter, which is what we said in our remarks."

That's going to have a more powerful impact. If you get over to, say the olefin stream there, it may be more the case you're talking about where there may be a fly up in more the commodities side. But overall, I mean we're pretty optimistic, pretty bullish that we got a good mix story going. If anything, I'd say there's a little more risk on the margin compression in terms of just following the raws in the pricing. That's where we're really paying a lot of attention, and that's what we're going to focusing on. Assuming the volumes stay strong and keep coming back with the economy, which of course is a big assumption, then we're really going to have our work cut out for us to make sure we can do our best having pricing following raws and energy, maintain that margin. And I'm a little less worried about a negative mix-in effect, because just like I say, historically typically, we'll be able to work on the mix and improve the mix as the volumes come back."

So in that regard, typically your fourth quarter is your weakest quarter. First, second, better quarters, maybe second, third may be your best quarters, but again, we knew specific things, why this quarter was fairly strong. We pulled some customer sales forward into the first quarter. But the underlying trend is solid. This is a business that's heading towards $100 million, $125 million and because of Tritan, I can easily see a path to get there as that swings from a negative to a positive. Paraxylene is always a concern, and of course, Specialty Plastics more of a specialty business, so a lot of times the pricing isn't quite as transparent, like the raw goes up, you raise your price; the raw goes down, you lower your price. I think the guys are doing a noticeably better job on that right now and also I think the pressure that some of the other competing materials are under, you can kind of see how often we're winning just by looking at our volume growth. You can see that we're winning when we come head-to-head with other competing materials. So that's something we always have to watch for. Can your pricing keep up with the raws, but right now, I think we're doing a pretty good job."

Thanks for joining us. I am going to begin on slide 3. Beginning with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in January. For first quarter EPS we told we expected to be slightly above",2113,"Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I am going to begin on slide 3. Beginning with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in January. 
For first quarter EPS we told we expected to be slightly above the $1.14 we reported in the fourth quarter and since then we had an outage at our Longview, Texas site which negatively impacted our results. We were able to more than offset the impact of the outage with strong volumes, improved mix and a strong March. I will talk more about the quarter in a minute. 
Next we told you we projected our full-year 2010 EPS to be 20% higher than our 2009 EPS of $3.63. I will talk more about our expectations for 2010 EPS when I get to the outlook but given our strong start in our first quarter we expect to be well above this projection. We also told you we expect to generate more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2010. This is on top of the $320 million of free cash we generated in 2009. Although we used cash in the first quarter due to a working capital build which is reflective of our strong revenues, given our expectations for strong earnings performance we expect to more than meet this objective. Curt will walk you through this in more detail in his section. 
We told you that we expected to recognize earnings from a acetyl license in the first half of 2010. This happened in March. This license along with the license we have with Chang Chun Petrochemical in Taiwan is a recognition of the value of our acetyl co-production technology. We have told you we expect to make progress on joint ventures and acquisitions in 2010. We have. In March we announced the completion of an acetate tow manufacturing plant in Korea the is owned by our joint venture with SK in which we have a controlling interest. Also in March we announced we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Genovique Specialties Corporation which will strengthen our non-phthalate plasticizer business in the PCI segment. 
Next is a review of our financial results for first quarter 2010. As I mentioned we were more than able to offset the impact of the outage at our Longview, Texas facility. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year. Volumes increased 22%. Part of the increase is a comparison to depressed demand in first quarter 2009 obviously but it also reflects the benefit of growth initiatives in areas like specialty plastics. Our operating margin increased to 12%, up substantially year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. 
The increased earnings reflected the higher volumes, improved capacity utilization and the resulting lower unit costs and a positive shift in product mix. The net impact of both the acetyl license revenue and the outage at the Longview facility is about negative $0.15 per share; that is the net. I would also add we had good momentum in the quarter with March being our strongest month. 
Turning to the segments, starting with fibers. What a great business. Fiber’s operating earnings in the quarter tied their quarterly record set in the third quarter 2009 and we have now set a record in four of the last five quarters. Revenue, volume and pricing were all similar to first quarter 2009 levels. Operating earnings increased due to the slight increase in prices in higher acetate yarn utilization and first quarter 2009 acetate yarn utilization was around 30%. In the first quarter 2010 it was in the mid 80’s. 
As I mentioned, the 27,000 net ton acetate tow facility in Korea started up in the first quarter and we are making good progress qualifying material with customers but there will be somewhat of a headwind from the new capacity in 2010 as we fill it out. We expect this will be offset with the stronger acetate yarn volumes and as a result we expect 2010 operating earnings to be similar to the $300 million reported in 2009. 
Next up is CASPI, another great business. The biggest story for CASPI is the rebound in volumes, up 34% year-over-year. The volume increase is due to the comparison against depressed volumes in the first quarter 2009 and some inventory restocking. They also upgraded their mix mainly due to an increase in volumes for their specialty coalescent and specialty polymers particularly in Asia Pacific. Operating earnings increased substantially year-over-year but were down $11 million sequentially. 
The sequential decline was due to the $10 million impact of the Longview outage and some margin compression. Operating margin was 18% and excluding the impact of the outage would have been 20%. Looking forward, given their strong start to the year and expected continued strong results in the second quarter they have a good chance to set a new operating earnings record in 2010 above the $242 million they reported in 2006. 
PCI is next. Revenue increased substantially, up 58% year-over-year. Volume was up due to the comparison against depressed levels in the first quarter 2009. We are also benefiting from tightness caused by planned maintenance and competitor outages in ethylene and [inaudible] in Asia. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs and product mix improved due to increased volumes of higher priced olefin derivatives and sales revenue from the acetyl license.
Operating earnings improved substantially year-over-year due to the higher volume and price, improved product mix and the sales revenue from the acetyl license. The negative impact of the Longview outage and the revenue from the acetyl license mostly netted out to zero for PCI. Looking forward we expect tightness to continue in a number of our olefin derivatives and for sales volumes to remain strong. As a result, we expect our full-year operating earnings to be above $125 million, more than double our 2009 operating earnings of $54 million. 
I would also like to make a comment about all of the hard work our employees in Longview did to limit the impact of the outage we experienced in the quarter. Of course you never like to have an outage like this, but when you do it is great to know there is an experienced group that limits the impact and gets us back to serving our customers. That is why we have such a great reputation for reliability. 
Specialty plastics is next. Their story is very straight forward. Volume has recovered with the economy and their growth initiatives are beginning to pay off. Sales revenue increased 59% year-over-year due to higher sales volume and improved product mix. Volume was up 50% year-over-year and 20% sequentially and set a new quarterly record for the segment. For reference, year-over-year volume increases for competitive materials such as polycarbonate, acrylic, [ADS] and others were probably between 5-20% according to [CNAI]. We are starting to see the benefit of growth initiatives in polyesters and areas such as shrink film and handled food packaging and adoption of our new Tritan copolyester is ahead of schedule due to the product properties including higher temperature resistance and the fact it is BPA free. 
Product mix improved as we had higher volumes for our cellulosic plastics for LCD screens and we are now benefiting from a recovery in this market. Operating earnings increased substantially due to the higher volumes, higher capacity utilization and improved product mix. Looking at the full-year we now expect operating earnings to be above $60 million for the year. I remind you this includes about $7 million of cost per quarter, $30 million a year of fixed costs related to Tritan capacity. 
Turning next to performance polymers. Operating results for the quarter were a loss of $13 million compared to the loss of $14 million in the first quarter 2009. The slight improvement in operating results was due to higher selling prices and improved operation of the IntegRex facility which were mostly offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Looking forward to the second quarter we are continuing to focus on upgrading our commercial footprint and improving our mix of customers. 
We made good progress in the first quarter and we expect this progress will be reflected in our results in the second quarter. At the same time, the PET market in North America continues to be difficult with lackluster demand and capacity being added. Taking this together we expect results in second quarter will approach break-even. Most of you have probably seen the news release we issued before the call this morning announcing we’re reviewing strategic actions for our performance polymer business. 
We have hired Bank of America/Merrill Lynch for the strategic review and you have heard me say on many occasions that we have taken no-regrets actions to improve the performance of this business. These include improving our operational performance and upgrading our commercial footprint. We have made good progress in these areas and as a result I believe this is the right time to determine whether or not Eastman is the highest and best owner for this business. We are targeting completing this effort by the end of this year.  
Turning next to regional performance. Given our very strong corporate results it is probably not a surprise that we had strong regional results. You will see that our revenue and volume growth year-over-year was strongest outside of North America. Asia revenue was up 60% with a 34% increase in volume. A favorable shift in product mix also contributed 16% to the revenue growth. The biggest contributor to the revenue growth was specialty plastics. This was a combination of cellulosic plastics for LCDs and higher volumes for Trident copolyester. 
CASPI was also much stronger particularly in their specialty polymers and specialty coalescent product lines. Revenue in our European region was up 55% with volume up 28%. Strength was particularly good in the CASPI, PCI and specialty plastic segments. The improvement in product mix was due in part to revenue from the acetyl license here. Latin America revenue increased 66%, off a smaller base of course, and with this improvement largely in performance polymers. 
That brings me to our guidance for the second quarter and the full-year. We are seeing clear signs of a global recovery in our volumes. We have seen it in our first quarter results and we expect it will continue in the second quarter. I would also mention that our visibility while still limited has improved slightly. Our results of the higher volumes is that our capacity utilization has improved, leading to lower unit costs. We also expect volatility in raw material and energy costs to continue. 
Looking at the second quarter we expect EPS will be between $1.50 and $1.60. This outlook includes approximately another $5-10 million of residual costs for the Texas outage that will fall in the second quarter. For the year, given our first quarter results and our expectation for a strong second quarter we expect full-year earnings per share to be between $5.00 and $5.25. 
Before I turn it over to Curt let me take one minute for executive spotlight. My choice this quarter is heavily influenced by two trips I have recently taken. The first trip was to Brazil where I went to Sao Paolo and [inaudible]. The second trip went around the world through Rotterdam; Zug, Switzerland; Dubai; Riyadh; Singapore; Shanghai and yes I am still a little jet lagged. 
On both of these trips I was very impressed with and proud of our regional leaders. Those of you who attended our Investors Day will remember when Carlos Parodi, [Mass] and Michael Chung. These three leaders are not only quite talented but have a depth of experience in their regions. Carlos has responsibility for Mexico and everything south and many of the opportunities he and his team are working on are in Brazil, a country of tremendous potential for Eastman. 
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region just turned in a fantastic quarter and [inaudible] team is focused on continuing that success by pursuing opportunities in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Of course they will work on integrating the Genovique acquisition in Estonia. 
Finally, I take a great deal of comfort that we have someone with Michael Chung’s abilities and customer contacts to head the important region of Asia. Supported by strong teams in Singapore and Shanghai, we expect continued strong growth in this region as well. Typically I would pick only one exec for the spotlight but given our international results this quarter I hope you can understand how I thought it appropriate to recognize our three regional leaders. 
Now I will turn it over to Curt.

I am going to start by reviewing our first quarter 2010 financial highlights on slide 13. In the first quarter we used $25 million of cash in operations. This excludes the impact of adopting amended accounting guida",1134,"Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. I am going to start by reviewing our first quarter 2010 financial highlights on slide 13. 
In the first quarter we used $25 million of cash in operations. This excludes the impact of adopting amended accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets. The result for Eastman in adopting this accounting change is $200 million of receivables previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under our receivables securitization program are now included in the balance sheet in the first quarter as trade receivables. 
As a result, receivables were increased in the first quarter 2010 cash flow statement reducing cash from operations by $200 million. Aside from the adoption of this accounting guidance receivables increased $214 million due to increased sales revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $88 million excluding the impact of adoption of the accounting guidance, reflecting the increase in working capital during the quarter. Our net debt to capital now stands at 42%, up from the end of the year namely due to adoption of amended accounting guidance.  
Turning next to growth. As the global economy recovers and our volumes and capacity utilization increases we have a number of capacity additions that have and will contribute to our growth. One example is our 2009 Regalite expansion in Middelburg, Netherlands. Regalite is used in a wide variety of hot melt adhesives, polymer compounds and plastic modifications which are used in end markets such as disposable deckers. We expanded capacity by approximately 30% in 2009 alone and have increased capacity by 65% since 2006. 
This expanded facility is currently running at a high rate due to strong customer demand for this product and we are considering additional expansions. Another example is the 30kmt Tritan copolyester resin facility that was completed at the end of 2009. You may recall that in addition to the resin capacity we built monomer capacity for Tritan to support 60kmt of resin capacity. You heard from Jim that adoption of Tritan is happening quicker than anticipated. As we fill out their first resin facility we will consider when to add a second 30kmt resin line to meet growing market demand for Tritan. 
A third example is the 27kmt of acetate tow capacity in Korea that was completed this quarter to meet growing demand in the Asia Pacific region. We have a controlling interest in the JV that owns this facility. It represents about a 15% increase to our acetate tow capacity and while we won’t see much of the benefit in 2010 as we qualify product with our customers we are well positioned for growth in 2011. 
Another capacity addition for Eastman not on the slide is the acetic anhydride capacity we will market as a result of our acetyl license with Sipchem. In addition to completing the license with Sipchem in March we will now market up to 50kmt of acetic anhydride from their facility in the Middle East. 
In addition to these capacity additions we are looking at a number of other opportunities for organic growth throughout the company. For example, we are evaluating an expansion of our CTA capacity for the LCD market that was postponed in 2009 due to the recession and we have a history of finding low cost and bottleneck opportunities with our manufacturing streams. Eastman is fortunate to have multiple opportunities for organic growth. 
In addition to the Korean acetate tow joint venture we are also looking to grow through acquisitions. In mid-March we announced we are entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Genovique Specialties shown here on slide 15, a leading producer of non-phthalate plasticizers. Our current plasticizer product line in the PCI segment is expected to generate approximately $300 million in revenue in 2010 with roughly double digit operating margins. As a reminder, our current general purpose plasticizers are used in flexible PVC applications. 
The Genovique acquisition is expected to add more than 50% to our existing revenue base with complementary specialty plasticizer product lines and is expected to have operating margins above those of our existing business. The transaction is expected to be accretive in 2010 including transaction costs. 
Looking forward the compound annual growth rate for non-phthalate plasticizers in North America and Europe is expected to be approximately 7% over the next five years. Our expanded geographic footprint with manufacturing sites in Estonia and China will provide growth opportunities in emerging markets. The transaction is expected to close any time now and we will provide more details after the close. 
As we have discussed in the past we are focused on four areas of emphasis with our joint venture and acquisition activities as summarized on slide 16. The Genovique acquisition is an example of how we can achieve multiple aspects of these areas of emphasis in a transaction. It has manufacturing locations in emerging geographies. Non-phthalate plasticizers are differentiated products and viewed as green and sustainable by the marketplace. And it benefits from some backward integration to basic raw materials. 
As we look at additional JVA opportunities we remain focused on these four areas of emphasis. I would add the market looks more attractive to us today than it did six months ago. 
Turning next to slide 17, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our last dividend payment was the 64th consecutive dividend we have paid to stockholders. In addition, in the first quarter we repurchased $20 million of shares. Our remaining authorization is $75 million and we expect to repurchase shares over the coming quarters primarily as a means to offset dilution. 
Turning next to an update on our expectations for free cash flow. First, consistent with our guidance we are expecting strong business performance. We are also expecting working capital for the year to increase but consistent with our seasonal patterns it will be a source of cash in the second half of the year. Although first quarter capital expenditures were low on a historical basis, we continue to expect they will be in the $250-275 million range as expenditures ramp up for the remainder of the year. This includes spending on growth initiatives and incremental capacity additions. As you know, we remain committed to our solid dividend. The net result is we expect to generate between $200-300 million of free cash flow in 2010.  
In conclusion, Eastman continues to be well positioned for growth in 2010 and beyond. EC has taken action to create value from our balance sheet with organic growth initiatives, joint ventures and acquisitions and share repurchases. We will continue to be disciplined as we implement growth initiatives to create value for stockholders. 
Thanks for your attention and your interest in Eastman Chemical Company. With that I will turn it back over to Greg.

As I said before I love this business and you are finally getting to see what I get to see all along. I will take it in order. Tritan is really doing well for us and is exceeding our expectations in terms of the demand out there and it is driven by its performance characteristics as well as of course it is BPA free. We’re getting good traction particularly in Asia where a lot of the products are molded. You see that in our Asia results. 
You are not really seeing a positive impact on earnings. In fact the costs, as we ball parked for you are around $7-7.5 million of fixed costs a quarter. The way we look at our volume ramp up it is probably not until sometime next year that Tritan actually has a positive EFO impact. So you are seeing these results are still overcoming negative numbers for Titan as it ramps up. So that means the rest of the business is actually better than the net number you see. 
One of the things the rest of that business is doing quite well now is displays. We are a little bit up the value chain from some of the other players that report who are closer to the actual flat screen maker but now it is catching up with us. So we see that continuing as well. I will say with specialty plastics we know of certain cases where some volume was pulled forward into the first half of the year so that is why I just didn’t take four times the 20 and say the year will be 80. I think we ball parked it around 60. We know some of that volume got pulled forward. Overall a great story in specialty plastics.

On the utilization rates, we started doing that when the world fell apart because we wanted to give everyone some kind of benchmark and some kind of thumbnail sketch or something they could use to just get a grasp of where we are and even based our 2012 projection of $6 and we said that was based upon getting back to full utilization rates which kind comes with the recovery rates. So it is not ideal as we talk about utilization rates. I just want to make that clear to people. One of the things you miss is that as our utilization rates go up we always have the opportunity to start upgrading our mix. 
That is what we typically will do. As utilization rates get higher we will start upgrading our mix and then we will start adding capacity. So that is kind of what you ought to be expecting out of Eastman. If you just look across our streams though to give you an answer on utilization rates, acetyl is the highest as you might expect. The olefin stream of course was you might say artificially low in the first quarter because that is where the cracker outage was. Polyester would be in between. Overall for the corporation we were kind of mid 80’s in the first quarter. 
If I look at the months, it is not a good practice to start giving monthly results. We like to do it by quarter but we thought it was worthwhile for investors to know that the quarter ended on a strong note and I can say that is continuing into the second quarter which is what we said in our remarks.

I think the bigger driving force will be how successful are we with the upgrade in the mix. If you just take your choices, you are running your acetyl stream hard, your flywheel is going to be selling acid in the North American market but then to the extent you can upgrade that into other derivatives you will. That is going to have a more powerful impact. 
If you get over to the olefin stream, there it is maybe more the case you are talking about where there may be a fly up in more of the commodity side. Overall we are pretty optimistic and pretty bullish that we have a good mix going. If anything I would say there is a little more risk on the margin compression in terms of just following the laws and the pricing. That is where we are paying a lot of attention and that is what we are going to be focusing on. Assuming the volumes stay strong and keep coming back to the economy which is of course a big assumption then we are really going to have our work cut out for us to make sure we do our best to having pricing following raw and energy, maintain that margin. I am a little less worried about a negative mix effect. Like I said, historically typically we will be able to work on the mix and improve the mix as the volumes come back.

Things like our Tritan product are really just getting traction there. I can only imagine how good the demand and the growth for that is going to be there especially our products in CASPI. It is the exact same thing. You know what is going on. Eastman has products that give certain performance characteristics. A lot of times they save labor or higher quality and therefore as the middle class grows and they can afford say better paint, for example, they are going to do that because labor costs more to paint in 3 years versus 5 or 7 years. So they are going to use our products for better product to save labor. You can just see that happening.

Part of it is we know of specific things that pulled sales forward from the second half to the first half, more so in plastics than in PCI. We know there were some outages in the PCI arena. Some other competitors were down the same way we were down except we have a license fee to offset ours being out. We just kind of roll all that together and say the first half of the year is going to be quite good. The second half of the year will fall off.

Paraxylene is always a concern for especially plastics. It is more of a specialties business. A lot of times the pricing isn’t quite as transparent. If the raw goes up you raise your price and if the raw goes down you lower your price. I think the guys are doing a noticeably better job on doing that right now and also I think the pressure some of the other competing materials are under you can kind of see how often we are winning just by looking at our volume growth.

I'm going to begin on Slide 3. Beginning with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in January.

Beginning with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in January. For first quarter EPS, we told you we expected to be slightly above the $1.14 we reported in the fourth quarter, and since then, we had an outage in our Longview, Texas, which negatively impacted our results. But we were able to more than offset the impact of the outage with strong volume and improved mix and a strong March. I'll talk more about the quarter in a minute. 
Next, we told you that we projected our full year 2010 EPS would be 20% higher than our 2009 EPS of $3.63. I'll talk more about our expectations for 2010 EPS when I get to the outlook, but given our strong start in our first quarter, we expect to be well above this projection. 
We also told you that we expect to generate more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2010. This is on top of a $320 million of free cash we generated in 2009. Although we used cash in the first quarter due to a working capital build, which is reflective of our strong revenues, given our expectations for strong earnings performance, we expect to more than meet this objective. Curt will walk you through this in more detail in his section. 
We told you that we expected to recognize earnings from an acetyl license in the first half of 2010 and this happened in March. This license, along with the license we have with Chang Chun Petrochemical in Taiwan, is a recognition of the value of our acetyl coA production technology. 
And we've told you that we expect to make progress on joint ventures and acquisitions in 2010 and we have. In March, we announced the completion of the acetate tow manufacturing plant in Korea that is owned by our joint venture with SK, in which we have a controlling interest. Also in March, we announced we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Genovique Specialties Corporation, which will strengthen our Non-Phthalate Plasticizer business in the PCI segment. 
Next is a review of our financial results for first quarter 2010. And as I mentioned, we were more than able to offset the impact of the outage at our Longview, Texas facility. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year. Volumes increased 22%. Part of the increase is a comparison to depressed demand in first quarter 2009, obviously. But it also reflects the benefit of growth initiatives in areas like Specialty Plastics. 
Our operating margin increased to 12%, up substantially year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The increased earnings reflected the higher volumes, the improved capacity utilization and the resulting lower unit cost, and a positive shift in product mix. The net impact of both the acetyl license revenue and the outage at the Longview facility is about negative $0.15 per share. That's the net. I'd also add we had good momentum in the quarter with March being our strongest month. 
Turning to the segments, starting with Fibers. What a great business. Fibers operating earnings in the quarter tied their quarterly record set in third quarter 2009, and they have now set a record in four of the last five quarters. Revenue, volume and pricing were all similar to first quarter 2009 levels. 
Operating earnings increased due to the slight increase in prices and higher acetate yarn utilization. In first quarter 2009, acetate yarn capacity utilization was around 30%. In the first quarter 2010, it was in the mid-80s. As I mentioned, the 27,000 net ton acetate tow facility in Korea started up in the first quarter, and we're making good progress qualifying material with customers, but there will be somewhat of a headwind from the new capacity in 2010 as we fill it out. We expect this will be offset with the stronger acetate yarn volumes. And as a result, we expect 2010 operating earnings to be similar to the $300 million they reported in 2009. 
Next up is CASPI, another great business. The biggest story for CASPI is a rebound in volume, up 34% year-over-year. The volume increase is due to the comparison against depressed volume in first quarter 2009 and some inventory restocking. They also upgraded their mix, mainly due to an increase in volumes for their specialty coalescence and specialty polymers, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Operating earnings increased substantially year-over-year but were down $11 million sequentially. The sequential decline was due to the negative $10 million impact of the Longview outage and some margin compression. Operating margin was 18% and excluding the impact of the outage, would've been 20%. Looking forward, given their strong start to the year and expected continued strong results in the second quarter, they have a good chance to set a new operating earnings record in 2010 above the $242 million that they reported in 2006. 
PCI is next. Revenue increased substantially, up 58% year-over-year. Volume was up due to the comparison against depressed levels in first quarter 2009. We're also benefiting from tightness caused by planned maintenance and competitor outages in ethylene and foroxos [ph] in Asia. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs, and product mix improved due to increased volumes of higher-priced olefin derivatives and sales revenue from the acetyl license. Operating earnings improved substantially year-over-year due to the higher volume and price and improved product mix, and the sales revenue from the acetyl license. The negative impact of the Longview outage and the revenue from the acetyl license mostly netted out to zero for PCI. 
Looking forward, we expect tightness to continue in a number of our olefin derivatives and for sales volume to remain strong. As a result, we expect our full year operating earnings to be above $125 million, more than double their 2009 operating earnings of $54 million. 
I'd also like to make a comment about all the hard work our employees in Longview did to limit the impact of the outage we experienced in the quarter. Of course, you never like to have an outage like this. But when you do, it's great to know there is an experienced group that limits the impact and gets us back to serving our customers, and that's why we have such a great reputation for reliability. 
Specialty Plastics is next, and their story is very straightforward. Volume has recovered with the economy and our growth initiatives are beginning to pay off. Sales revenue increased 59% year-over-year due to higher sales volume and improved product mix. Volume was up 50% year-over-year and 20% sequentially and set a new quarterly record for the segment. For reference, year-over-year volume increases for competitive materials, such as polycarbonate, acrylic, ABS and others were probably between 5% to 20% according to the CMAI. 
We are starting to see the benefit of growth initiatives in core copolyesters in areas such as shrink film and handled food packaging, and adoption of our new Tritan copolyester is ahead of schedule due to the product properties, including a higher temperature resistance and the fact that it is BPA free. 
Product mix improved as we had higher volumes for our cellulosic plastics for LCD screens, and we are now benefiting from the recovery in this market. Operating earnings improved substantially due to the higher volume, higher capacity utilization and the improved product mix. 
Looking at the full year, we now expect operating earnings to be above $60 million for the year. And I remind you that this includes about $7 million of cost a quarter, $30 million a year of fixed costs for the new Tritan capacity. 
Turning next to Performance Polymers. Operating results for the quarter were a loss of $13 million compared with a loss of $14 million in the first quarter 2009. The slight improvement in operating results was due to higher selling prices and the improved operation of the IntegRex facility, which were mostly offset by higher raw material and energy cost. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, we are continuing to focus on upgrading our commercial footprint and improving our mix of customers. We made good progress in the first quarter, and we expect this progress will be reflected in our results in the second quarter. At the same time, the PET market in North America continues to be difficult with lackluster demand and capacity being added. Taking this together, we expect results from second quarter will approach breakeven. 
Most of you have probably seen the news release we issued before the call this morning announcing that we are reviewing strategic actions for our Performance Polymers business. We've hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch for the strategic review, and you've heard me say on many occasions that we have taken no-regrets actions to improve the performance of this business. These include improving our operational performance and upgrading our commercial footprint. We've made good progress in these areas. And as a result, I believe this is the right time to determine whether or not Eastman is the highest and best owner for this business. And we're targeting completing this effort by the end of this year. 
Turning next to regional performance. Given our very strong corporate results, it's probably not a surprise that we have strong regional results. You'll see that our revenue and volume growth year-over-year was strongest outside North America. Asia revenue was up 60% with a 34% increase in volume. A favorable shift in product mix also contributed 16% to the revenue growth. The biggest contributor to the revenue growth was Specialty Plastics, and this is a combination of cellulosic plastics for LCDs and higher volumes for Tritan copolyester. CASPI was also much stronger, particularly in their specialty polymers and specialty coalescent product lines. Revenue in our European region was up 55% with volume up 28%. Strength was particularly good in the CASPI, PCI and Specialty Plastics segments. The improvement in product mix was due in part to revenue from the acetyl license here. Latin America revenue increased 66%, off a smaller base of course, and with this improvement largely in Performance Polymers. 
That brings me to our guidance for the second quarter and the full year. We're seeing clear signs of a global recovery in our volumes. We've seen it in our first quarter results, and we expect it will continue in the second quarter. I'd also mention that our visibility, while still limited, has improved slightly. A result of the higher volumes is that our capacity utilization has improved, leading to lower unit cost. We also expect volatility in raw material and energy cost to continue. So looking at the second quarter, we expect EPS will be between $1.50 and $1.60. This outlook includes approximately another $5 million to $10 million of residual costs for the Texas outage that'll fall in the second quarter. So for the year, given our first quarter results and our expectation for a strong second quarter, we expect full year earnings per share to be between $5 and $5.25. 
Now before I turn it over to Curt, let me take one minute for the executive spotlight. And my choice this quarter is heavily influenced by two trips I've recently taken. The first trip was to Brazil, where I went to São Paulo and Conoserie [ph] and the second trip went around the world through Rotterdam; Zug, Switzerland; Dubai; Riyadh; Singapore; Shanghai, and yes, I'm a still little jet lagged. On both of these trips, I was very impressed with and proud of our regional leaders. Those of you who attended our Investors Day will remember Juan Carlos Parodi, Gupta Amat and Michael Chung. These three leaders are not only quite talented but have a depth of experience in their region. Juan Carlos has responsibility for Mexico and everything south and many of the opportunities he and his team are working on are in Brazil, a country of tremendous potential for Eastman. 
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region just turned in a fantastic quarter and Gupta's team is focused on continuing that success by pursuing opportunities in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and of course they will work on integrating the Genovique acquisition in Estonia. 
Finally, I take a great deal of comfort that we have someone with Michael Chung's abilities and customer contacts to head the important region of Asia. Supported by strong teams in Singapore and Shanghai, we expect continued strong growth in this region as well. So typically, I'd pick only one exec for the spotlight, but given our international results this quarter, I hope you can understand how I thought it appropriate to recognize our three regional leaders. 
And now I turn it over to Curt."

In the first quarter, we used $25 million of cash in operations. This excludes the impact of adopting amended accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets. The result for Eastman of adopting this accounting change is at $200 million of receivables, previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under our receivables securitization program, are now included in the balance sheet in the first quarter as trade receivables. 
As a result, receivables were increased in the first quarter 2010 cash flow statement reducing cash from operations by $200 million. Aside from the adoption of this accounting guidance, receivables increased $214 million due to increased sales revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $88 million, excluding the impact of adoption of the accounting guidance, reflecting the increase in working capital during the quarter. Our net debt to capital now stands at 42%, up from the end of the year, mainly due to adoption of amended accounting guidance. 
Turning next to growth. As the global economy recovers and our volumes and capacity utilization increases, we have a number of capacity additions that have and will contribute to our growth. One example is our 2009 Regalite expansion in Middleburg, the Netherlands. Regalite is used in a wide variety of hot melt adhesives, polymer compounds and plastic modifications which are used in end markets such as disposable diapers. We expanded capacity by approximately 30% in 2009 alone and have increased capacity by 65% since 2006. This expanded facility is currently running at a high rate due to strong customer demand for this product, and we are considering additional expansions. 
Another example is the 30,000 metric ton Tritan copolyester resin facility that was completed at the end of 2009. You may recall that in addition to the resin capacity, we built monomer capacity for Tritan to support 60,000 metric tons of resin capacity. You heard from Jim that adoption of Tritan is happening quicker than anticipated. As we fill out the first resin facility, we will consider when to add a second 30,000 metric ton resin line to meet growing market demand for Tritan. 
A third example is the 27,000 metric tons of acetate tow capacity in Korea that was completed this quarter to meet growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region. We have a controlling interest in the JV that owns this facility. It represents about 15% increase to our acetate tow capacity, and while we won't see much of the benefit in 2010 as we qualify product with our customers, we are well positioned for growth in 2011. 
Another capacity addition for Eastman, not on the slide, is the acidic and hydride capacity we will market as a result of our acetyl license with Sipchem. In addition to completing the license with Sipchem in March, we will now market up to 50,000 metric tons of acidic and hydride from their facility in the Middle East. 
In addition to these capacity additions, we are looking at a number of other opportunities for organic growth throughout the company. For example, we're evaluating an expansion of our CTA capacity for the LCD market that was postponed in 2009 due to the recession. And we have a history of finding low-cost debottleneck opportunities with their manufacturing streams. Eastman is fortunate to have multiple opportunities for organic growth. 
In addition to the Korean acetate tow joint venture, we are also looking to grow through acquisitions. In mid-March, we announced that we're entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Genovique Specialties, shown here on Slide 15, a leading producer of non-phthalate plasticizers. Our current plasticizer product lines in the PCI segment is expected to generate approximately $300 million in revenue in 2010, with roughly double-digit operating margins. As a reminder, our current general-purpose plasticizers are used in flexible PVC applications. The Genovique acquisition is expected to add more than 50% to our existing revenue base with complementary specialty plasticizer product lines and is expected to have operating margins above those of our existing business. The transaction is expected to be accretive in 2010 including transaction costs. 
Looking forward, the compound annual growth rate for non-phthalate plasticizers in North America and Europe is expected to be approximately 7% over the next five years, and our expanded geographic footprint with manufacturing sites in Estonia and China will provide growth opportunities in emerging markets. The transaction is expected to close any time now and we'll provide more details after the close. 
As we have discussed in the past, we are focused on four areas of emphasis with our joint venture and acquisition activities as summarized on Slide 16. The Genovique acquisition is an example of how we can achieve multiple aspects of these areas of emphasis in a transaction. It has manufacturing locations in emerging geographies, non-phthalate plasticizers are differentiated products and viewed as green and sustainable by the marketplace and it benefits from some backward integration to basic raw materials. 
As we look at additional JVA opportunities, we remain focused on these four areas of emphasis. And I would add that the market looks more attractive to us today than it did six months ago. 
Turning next to Slide 17. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our last dividend payment was the 64th consecutive dividend that we have paid to stockholders. In addition, in the first quarter, we repurchased $20 million of shares. Our remaining authorization is $75 million and we expect to repurchase shares over the coming quarters primarily as a means to offset dilution. 
Turning next to an update on our expectations for free cash flow. First, consistent with our guidance, we are expecting strong business performance. We are also expecting working capital for the year to increase, but consistent with our seasonal patterns, it will be a source of cash in the second half of the year. Although first quarter capital expenditures were low on a historical basis, we continue to expect they will be in the $250 million to $275 million range as expenditures ramp up for the remainder of the year. This includes spending on growth initiatives and incremental capacity additions. As you know, we remain committed to our solid dividend. The net result is that we expect to generate between $200 and $300 million of free cash flow in 2010. 
In conclusion, Eastman continues to be well positioned for growth in 2010 and beyond. You see us taking action to create value from our balance sheet with organic growth initiatives, joint ventures and acquisitions and share repurchases. And we'll continue to be disciplined as we implement growth initiatives to create value for stockholders. 
Thanks for your attention and your interest in Eastman Chemical Company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

I'll take it in order. So Tritan, really doing well for us, exceeding our expectations in terms of the demand out there, and it's driven by its performance characteristics as well as of course it's BPA free. We're getting good traction, particularly in Asia where a lot of the products are molded so you see that in our Asia results. You're not really seeing a positive impact on earnings. In fact, the costs as we ballpark-ed for you, around $7 million, $7.5 million of fixed cost a quarter. The way we look at our volume ramp up, it's probably not until sometime next year that Tritan actually has a positive EFO impact. So you're seeing these results are still overcoming negative numbers for Tritan as it ramps up. So that means the rest of the business is actually better than the net number you see. One of the things in the rest of that business that's doing quite well now is displayed. And we're a little bit up the value chain from some of the other players that report who are closer to the actual flat screen maker. But now it's catching up with us. So we see that continuing as well. I will say that with Specialty Plastics, we know of certain cases where some volume was pulled forward into the first half of the year. So that's why I didn't just take 4x the 20 and say the year would be 80. I think we ballpark-ed it around 60. We know some of that volume got pulled forward. But overall, a great story in Specialty Plastics."

Just on the utilization rates, we started doing that when the world fell apart because we wanted to give everyone some kind of benchmark, some kind of a thumbnail sketch or something they could use to just get a grasp of where we are, and we even based our 2012 projection of $6. We said that was based upon getting back to full utilization rates which would kind of be recovery rates. And so it's not ideal as we talk about utilization rates. I just want to make that clear to people. One of the things you miss is that as our utilization rates go up, we always have the opportunity to start upgrading our mix, and that's what we typically will do. As the utilization rates get higher, we'll start upgrading our mix and then we'll start adding capacity. So that's kind of what you ought to be expecting out of Eastman. If you just look across our streams, though, to give you an answer on utilization rates, acetyl's the highest as you might expect. The olefin stream, of course, was, you might say artificially low in our first quarter because that's where the cracker outage was. Polyester would be in between. Overall for the corporation, we were kind of mid-80s in the first quarter. If I look at the month and we really -- it's not a good practice to start giving monthly results. We like to do it by quarter, but we thought it was worthwhile for investors to know that the quarter ended on a strong note.

But overall, I mean we're pretty optimistic, pretty bullish that we got a good mix story going. If anything, I'd say there's a little more risk on the margin compression in terms of just following the raws in the pricing. That's where we're really paying a lot of attention, and that's what we're going to be focusing on. Assuming the volumes stay strong and keep coming back with the economy, which of course is a big assumption, then we're really going to have our work cut out for us to make sure we can do our best having pricing following raws and energy, maintain that margin.

A lot of times they save labor, are higher quality, and therefore, as a middle class grows and they can afford to buy, say, a better paint, for example, they're going to do that because labor costs more to paint in three years versus five year, seven years, whatever. So they're going to use our products for a better product to save labor, and you can just see that happening. The same thing switching to disposable diapers from cloth diapers, et cetera.

So the first thing we're going to be doing with cash is making sure, especially on our specialty products, that we don't run out of capacity. And so you're going to see us starting to add some capacity in some key areas. The second thing is we're going to continue to look at the acquisitions, particularly things that have an international vent with the emerging markets or a sustainability vent but above all that have some really good financials, such that they're accretive.

So in that regard, typically your fourth quarter is your weakest quarter.

We pulled some customer sales forward into the first quarter. But the underlying trend is solid. This is a business that's heading towards $100 million, $125 million and because of Tritan, I can easily see a path to get there as that swings from a negative to a positive. Paraxylene is always a concern, and of course, Specialty Plastics more of a specialty business, so a lot of times the pricing isn't quite as transparent, like the raw goes up, you raise your price; the raw goes down, you lower your price. I think the guys are doing a noticeably better job on that right now and also I think the pressure that some of the other competing materials are under, you can kind of see how often we're winning just by looking at our volume growth. You can see that we're winning when we come head-to-head with the other competing materials. So that's something we always have to watch for.

As usual, I’ll begin on Slide number 3. Now, as I normally do, I’ll begin with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in April.
For second quarter EPS, we told you we expected to be between $1.50 and $1.60. I updated this guidance at an Investors Conference in early June saying we expected to be above $1.60. Of course, we did report EPS well above $1.60 last night, and I’ll talk more about that in a minute.
Next, we told you that we projected our full year 2010 EPS would be between $5 and $5.25. This was updated in early June to range of $5.25 to $5.50. I’ll talk more about our expectations for 2010 EPS when I get to outlook, but given our strong first half, we now expect to be well above this projection.
We also told you that we expect to generate between $200 million and $300 million of free cash flow in 2010, and given our strong earnings, we are on track to be at the top of this range. Curt will walk you through this in more detail in his section.
We told you we would be disciplined on capital allocation and we have been. In April, we completed the acquisition of Genovique Specialties Chemicals. We expect the acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2010 despite transaction cost and will be accretive above the cost of capital in 2011.
We bought back more than $50 million of stock in the first half to offset dilution and we’ve held our capital expenditures this year to record lows, only now loosening the purse strings to meet increasing demand.
Moving next to Slide number 4 and a review of our financial results for second quarter 2010, our EPS of $2.05 was a quarterly record, with our next best quarter coming 15 years ago.
Revenue increased 38% year-over-year. The main driver was volume, up 21% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We benefited from our growth initiatives and the actions we have taken over the years to improve our portfolio of businesses and reduce our cost structure.
Sequentially, volume increased as demand continued to improve. We benefited from competitor outages in Asia, particularly for Oxos and PCI, and there were some limited inventory restocking, particularly in the more specialty product lines CASPI. Of course, the year-over-year increase was helped by the comparison to the recessionary levels of second quarter 2009.
Operating earnings more than doubled year-over-year and our operating margin increased to over 15% in the second quarter, up almost 500 basis points year-over-year and 350 basis points sequentially. The increased earnings reflected higher volumes, improved capacity utilization and resulting lower unit costs and higher selling prices.
In addition, we recognized residual cost in the second quarter from the outage at our Longview facility that occurred in February. These costs were mostly offset by a partial insurance recovery in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with these results. But we aren’t standing still, and I’ll talk more about that in a few minutes.
Turning to the segments now, starting with Fibers on Slide number 5, I’ve said it before and I’ll continue to say it - what a great business. Fibers operating earnings in the quarter were another quarterly record, and over the past six quarters they have set records in four of them. Higher revenue reflected higher volume and the higher volume was due to continued solid acetate tow volume and an increase in acetate yarn volume.
Operating earnings increased due to the higher volume and higher acetate yarn capacity utilization. The operating margin in the quarter was just over 30% and is right at 30% for the six months.
Looking at the full year, we expect to set a new annual operating earnings record above $300 million and this would be the sixth record year out of the last seven.
Next up is CASPI, and this is another great business. We also set a quarterly record here with $94 million of operating earnings, surpassing last year’s third quarter. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year and was up 11% sequentially. Volume, price and mix were all contributors to the revenue increase year-over-year.
Volume was up due to improved customer demand with a rebound in the economy. Sequentially, volume increased 5% due to growth in all regions and we believe some limited inventory restocking for some of our more specialty businesses for longer value change.
So in crisis, we’re up to offset higher raw material and energy cost, particularly for our commodity solvents. The favorable shift in mix reflects higher volume for our specialty polymers and specialty coalescents, particularly in Asia Pacific and European.
The increased operating earnings reflected the higher volume and higher capacity utilization and the favorable shift in mix. The operation margin increased to 23%. Looking forward, we expect CASPI will set an annual earnings record with operating earnings approaching $300 million.
PCI is next on Slide number 7. We also had a terrific quarter in this business. Revenue increased substantially, up a very strong 72% year-over-year. Volume was up due to the rebound in the economy over the last 12 months. We also benefited from tightness caused by planned maintenance and outages for Oxos in Asia.
Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy cost. Sequentially, revenue was up 13% due to higher volumes as we recovered from the Texas outage in the first quarter. Operating earnings increased year-over-year due to higher selling prices, higher volume, and higher capacity utilization which led to lower cost.
I’d also remind you that the second quarter 2009 results included approximately $15 million of cost related to the reconfiguration of our Longview Texas plant.
Looking forward, a number of the facilities have experienced outages in the second quarter are now back on line. However, we expect sales volume will remain solid, albeit at a slightly lower margin. As a result, we expect full year operating earnings to approach $200 million for this year.
Specialty plastics is next and here our sales revenue increased 44% year-over-year due to volume, which was up 36%. We’re continuing to see the benefit of growth initiatives in core copolyesters and areas such as, shrink film and handled food packaging, and adoption of our new Tritan copolyester continues to be ahead of schedule due to the product properties, including a higher temperature resistance and the fact that it is BPA-free.
As Curt will discuss in his section, we have begun work on adding another 30,000 met tons resin capacity for Tritan, which we expect will be online by the end of 2011.
We also had a favorable shift in product mix due to higher volumes for our cellulosics used in the LCD market. Sequentially, revenue was up 9%, due to an 8% increase in volume, which was driven by the growth initiatives in core copolyester and increased demand for Tritan. This is a sixth quarter in a row, where Specialty Plastics has had sequential volume improvement.
Operating earnings increased substantially year-over-year, due to the higher volume and higher capacity utilization. So looking at the full year, we now expect operation earnings to approach $19 million for the year as a momentum they have built up in the first half of the year carries through to the second half.
Turning next to Performance Polymers on Slide number 9, sales revenue increased 20% year-over-year due to higher selling prices and response to higher raw material and energy cost, and increased volume due to the improved operation of our IntegRex-based PET manufacturing facility.
Back in January I said we could check the box on improving the operational performance of our IntegRex asset, and in the second quarter we demonstrated that we had indeed addressed the operational issues.
We are essentially running our IntegRex facility flat out setting record production volumes and achieving debottleneck capacity, and very importantly, achieving our expected cost positions. Our Class I yields are greater than 98%.
Primarily because of the improved volume from IntegRex, we are in the black for the quarter. But year-over-year, operating earnings were about flat as the volume improvement was offset by continued difficult market conditions pressuring margins. Looking forward, we expect the last three quarters of the year, when taking an aggregate, will be around breakeven.
Lastly, a few comments about the strategic options we’re pursuing for this business. I’d like to say the response from the market after our announcement in April has been very strong, and I’d say the process is proceeding on schedule. We continue to expect to complete the effort by the end of the year.
Next as we look at the regions and you can see from the Slide, revenue was up significantly in all regions. Europe was a star for us this quarter with a record for operation earnings due to volumes which increased 23% in the quarter and 25% for the first half of the year as we benefit from capacity we’ve added recently.
You might remember in fourth quarter 2008, we added acetate tow capacity in U.K. and this is running at a very high utilization rate. At the end of last year, we expanded our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity by 30% and we are now going to expand it again for 2011. We’ve been prudent with the capacity we’ve added and we are now seeing the benefits.
Asia was also strong with 28% revenue growth due to equal increases in volume, price, and mix. Operating earnings increased both year-over-year and sequentially in Asia. Latin America revenues were up a strong 50% driven mainly by Performance Polymers, CASPI and PCI. And North America revenue was up 40% due to volume which was up 24% with a strongest growth in PCI, CASPI and Specialty Plastics.
That brings me to our guidance for the third quarter and the full year on Slide number 11. Given our very strong results in the first half of the year, we have good momentum heading into the second half of the year.
We expect to continue to benefit from the economic recovery we’ve seen and from the continued implementation of growth initiatives that I’ve discussed throughout my remark...
As many of you know, we do typically have a seasonal decline in our volumes in the second half of the year and we have that seasonal decline included in our expectations. We also know there were some competitor outages in the first half that we aren’t expecting in the second half and those will be a headwind.
We’re expecting raw material and energy cost to be less volatile in the second half of the year compared with the first half. Taking these factors into consideration, we expect our third quarter 2010 EPS to be between $1.65 per share and $1.75 per share and we are raising our full year 2010 EPS guidance to between $6.20 per share and $6.40 per share.
I’ll close with a few comments about 2011. Back at our Investor Day in November of last year, we said we could get to greater than $6 a share in our recovery and we thought that might be around 2012. Well, clearly, the recovery has come faster than anyone expected, including us. So, with an expectation for our EPS to be better than $6 this year, we are focused on improving on this in 2011. We recognize there are many things that are outside of our control, the biggest being growth in the global economy, but we are working on things we can control.
On this slide are just a few of the initiatives that will benefit our 2011 earnings. We’ve have talked a lot about Genovique since we closed the transaction a few months back, and we expect it will be accretive even after transaction costs this year and next year it will be accretive above cost of capital. So it will be a benefit in 2011 over 2010.
The Korea acetate tow facility will also be a benefit for next year as we qualify the material and work towards filing out the facility. As a reminder, this adds about 15% to our acetate tow capacity.
On Tritan, we are ahead of schedule, filling off the first 30,000 net tons of resin capacity, which is greater than $100 million in revenue. As we make progress, we transition from a hurt this year to approaching neutral next year, and when additional resin capacity comes online, we expect to see positive income.
With demand rebounding as strongly as it has, we are taking advantage of incremental opportunities for capacity expansions and looking at other growth opportunities. This is a core competency for Eastman and taking together these projects are meaningful positive. To sum up, with reasonable economic growth, I’m confident we can grow EPS in 2011.
Now, before I turn it over to Curt, let me take one minute and highlight one of our key executives within Eastman. Ron Lindsay, Executive Vice President of Performance Polymers and Chemical Intermediates, has been with Eastman for 30 years after graduating as a Chemical Engineer from Clemson University. He also went to the Harvard AM Program, but I don’t know if he wants to admit that to everybody.
I think of Ron as having particular expertise and operational excellence in understanding our acetyl, olefin and polyester streams very, very well. This quarter’s numbers are evidence of the fine results he has been able to achieve in PCI relying heavily on Heidi Barnes and Mike Humby to run the business with him. In Performance Polymers, Jennifer Stewart and Phil Begley have been instrumental in the improvement you see in that business.
Also, Ron helped us reach the decision to discontinue our Beaumont gasification efforts and is in the process of winding down that program. If that isn’t enough, he also has responsibility for the engineering and construction group as well as leading our efforts to find more advantaged feedstock opportunities around the globe. As you can see, Ron is a highly valued member of the Eastman Executive Team.
Now, let me turn it over to Curt.

Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I’m going to start by reviewing our second quarter 2010 financial highlights on Slide number 14.In the second quarter, we generated $206 million in cash from operations. This reflects very strong net",901,"All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I’m going to start by reviewing our second quarter 2010 financial highlights on Slide number 14.
In the second quarter, we generated $206 million in cash from operations. This reflects very strong net earnings in our continued working capital discipline. We did have a modest $55 million build in working capital as we had an increase in receivables, reflecting the strong sales revenue improvement, and a small rebuild in inventory following our Texas outage in the first quarter.
Our capital expenditures were $47 million as our maintenance level expenditures are increasing related to our improved capacity utilization. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $129 million and is $41 million year-to-date.
During the quarter, as Jim mentioned, we did acquire Genovique for approximately $160 million. Our integration efforts are proceeding very well and we are on track to achieve the financial expectations with this transaction.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio remained at 41% at the end of this second quarter.
Turning next on Slide number 15 to update our free cash flow for the year, as provided in our full year EPS guidance, we are expecting continued strong net earnings for the year.
We also expect working capital will increase on a full year basis, but will be a source of cash in the second half of the year consistent with seasonal changes in demand. As a reminder, we are excluding the impact of the adoption of an amended accounting guidance applied to the company’s accounts receivable securitization program during the first quarter.
Our capital expenditures will ramp up in the second half of the year as we work to add capacity in response to growth in customer demand and continue to support our strong operating performance.
For the year, capital expenditures will be approximately $250 million, which is at the low end of the $250 million to $275 million range I had given previously. Put this together with our continued strong dividend, we expect free cash flow for the year will be approximately $300 million on the high end of my previous guidance.
As I just mentioned, we are working on capacity additions to meet strong customer demand we’ve seen in many parts of the company. First, we are expanding capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters in the Specialty Plastic segment.
We plan to expand CHDM capacity by approximately 25% in two phases. The first phase will come online in mid-2011 and the second phase will be online in 2012. This capacity addition will enable us to meet our customers as demand for copolyesters continues to grow.
Next is the continued expansion in our hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins in Middleburg, the Netherlands and in Longview, Texas.
In Middleburg, we expanded capacity for our Regalite hydrocarbon resin by 30% in 2009 and have expanded capacities by 65% since 2006. We are increasing capacity in additional 20% and expect to have the expansion online in early 2011.
We are also expanding our capacity for Eastotac hydrocarbon resins at our Longview facility, and expect this increase will also be online in early 2011.
Hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins are used in variety of hot melt adhesives and serve the packaging and hygiene markets. Work has begun on expanding the resin capacity for our Tritan copolyesters.
You’ll recall that we built a monomer facility to support 60,000 metric tons of resin capacity and then built a 30,000 metric ton resin facility. As Jim indicated in his remarks demand has exceeded our expectations and we are ahead of our schedule for filling this out.
As a result, we are working on adding the second 30,000 metric tons of capacity and expect it to have it online by the end of 2011. As a reminder, each 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity is greater than $100 million in revenue.
Moving next to joint ventures and acquisitions, as we’ve discussed before, these four areas of emphasis are how we are targeting joint venture and acquisition opportunities as shown here on Slide number 17.
Genovique is an example of an acquisition that really has achieved all four. Its asset base includes manufacturing assets in Estonia, and a joint venture in China. Its non-phthalate plasticizer product lines are differentiated and viewed as green and sustainable by the market. The Estonia plant benefits from backward integration to benzoic acid.
We will continue to pursue joint venture and acquisitions that achieve one or more of these attributes.
Turning next to Slide number 18, we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our last dividend payment was the 65th consecutive dividend we have paid to stockholders. In addition, in the second quarter we repurchased $33 million of shares and year-to-date, we purchased $53 million.
As of the end of the quarter, our remaining authorization was approximately $40 million and we expect to continue to repurchasing shares over the coming quarters, primarily as a means to offsetting dilution.
In conclusion, we are focused on growth for 2011 and beyond. We are expanding capacity and target product lines where there is demonstrated demand growth. We are reviewing our joint venture and acquisition opportunities in a disciplined manner, and we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders both through a strong dividend and with share repurchases.
Thanks for your attention and for you interest in Eastman Chemical. With that, I’ll turn it back to Greg.

I’d say the other thing, the raw materials didn’t move exactly the way we were expecting during the last few weeks of the month. So we didn’t get any increase; in fact, probably came off the other way, it came down. Let’s call it some overhang from the cracker outage in the first quarter and we could factor that pain into the results, we didn’t realize we were going to get about $10 million of a partial insurance settlement until the very end of the quarter. So there was no way we could predict that. Part of it is stuff we couldn’t have seen. Maybe some of it is us being conservative, but when I said we’d be north of $1.60, there was no way I thought we were going to be anywhere near $2, and the quarter just came in very strong.

Now as I normally do, I'll begin with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in April. 
For second quarter EPS, we told you we expected to be between $1.50 and $1.60. I updated this guidance at an Investors Conference in early June saying we expect it to be above $1.60. And of course, we did report EPS well above $1.60 last night, and I'll talk more about that in a minute.
Next, we told you that we projected our full year 2010 EPS would be between $5 and $5.25. This was updated in early June to a range of $5.25 to $5.50. I'll talk more about our expectations for 2010 EPS when I get to outlook. 
But given our strong first half, we now expect to be well above this projection. We also told you that we expect to generate between $200 million at $300 million of free cash flow in 2010. And given our strong earnings, we are on track to be at the top of this range. Curt will walk you through this in more detail in his section. 
And we told you we would be disciplined on capital allocation, and we have been. In April, we completed the acquisition of Genovique Specialties Chemicals. We expect the acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2010, despite transaction cost and will be accretive above the cost of capital in 2011. We bought back more than $50 million of stock in the first half to offset dilution, and we've held our capital expenditures this year to record lows, only now, loosening purse strings to meet increasing demand.
Moving next to Slide 4 and a review of our financial results for second quarter 2010, our EPS of $2.05 is a quarterly record, with our next best quarter coming 15 years ago. Revenue increased 38% year-over-year. The main driver was volume, up 21% year-over-year and 9%, sequentially. We benefited from our growth initiatives and the actions we have taken over the years to improve our portfolio of businesses and reduce our cost structure. Sequentially, volume increased as demand continued to improve. We benefited from competitor outages in Asia, particularly for oxos and PCI and there were some limited inventory restocking, particularly in the more specialty product lines in CASPI. And of course, the year-over-year increase was helped by the comparison to the recessionary levels of second quarter 2009. 
Operating earnings more than doubled year-over-year and our operating margin increased to over 15% in the second quarter, up almost 500 basis points year-over-year and 350 basis points sequentially. The increased earnings reflected higher volumes, improved capacity utilization and resulting lower unit cost and higher selling prices. In addition, we recognized residual cost in the second quarter from the outage at our Longview facility that occurred in February. These costs were mostly offset by a partial insurance recovery in the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with these results, but we aren't standing still, and I'll talk more about that in a few minutes.
Turning to the segments now, starting with Fibers on Slide 5. I've said it before and I'll continue to say it: what a great business. Fiber's operating earnings in the quarter were another quarterly record. And over the past six quarters, they have set records on four of them. Higher revenue reflected higher volume, and the higher volume was due to continued solid acetate tow volume and an increase in acetate yarn volume. Operating earnings increased due to the higher volume and higher acetate yarn capacity utilization. The operating margin in the quarter was just over 30% and is right at 30% for the first six months. Looking at the full year, we expect to set a new annual operating earnings record above $300 million, and this would be the sixth record year out of the last seven.
Next up is CASPI, and this is another great business. We also set a quarterly record here with $94 million of operating earnings, surpassing last year's third quarter. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year and was up 11%, sequentially. Volume, price and mix were all contributors to the revenue increase year-over-year. Volume was up due to improved customer demand with a rebound in the economy. Sequentially, volume increased 5% due to growth in all regions, and we believe some limited inventory restocking for some of our more specialty businesses are longer value chains. 
Selling prices were up to offset higher raw materials and energy cost, particularly for our commodity solvents. And the favorable shift in mix reflects higher volumes for our specialty polymer and specialty coalescence, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe. The increased operating earnings reflected a higher volume and higher capacity utilization and a favorable shift in mix. And the operating margin increased to 23%. Looking forward, we expect CASPI will set an annual earnings record with operating earnings approaching $300 million.
PCI is next on Slide 7, and we also had a terrific quarter in this business. Revenue increased substantially, up a very strong 72% year-over-year. Volume was up due to the rebound in the economy over the last 12 months. We also benefited from tightness caused by planned maintenance and outages for oxos in Asia. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs. Sequentially, revenue was up 13% due to higher volumes, as we recovered from the Texas outage in the first quarter. 
Operating earnings increased year-over-year due to higher selling prices, higher volume and higher capacity utilization, which led to lower cost. I'd also remind you that the second quarter 2009 results included approximately $15 million of cost related to the reconfiguration of our Longview, Texas plant. 
Looking forward, a number of the facilities experienced outages in the second quarter are now back online. However, we expect sales volume will remain solid, albeit at a slightly lower margin. As a result, we expect full year operating earnings to approach $200 million for this year.
Specialty Plastics is next. And here, our sales revenue increased 44% year-over-year due to volume, which was up 36%. We're continuing to see the benefit of growth initiatives in core copolyesters in areas such as, shrink film and handled food packaging and adoption of our new Tritan copolyester continues to be ahead of schedule due to the product properties, including a higher temperature resistance and the fact that it is BPA-free. And as Curt will discuss in his section, we have begun work on adding another 30,000 met [metric] tons of resin capacity for Tritan, which we expect will be online by the end of 2011. 
We also had a favorable shift in product mix due to higher volume for our cellulosics used in the LCD market. Sequentially, revenue was up 9% due to an 8% increase in volume, which was driven by the growth initiatives in core copolyester and increased demand for Tritan. This is the sixth quarter in a row where Specialty Plastics has had sequential volume improvement. 
Operating earnings increased substantially year-over-year due to the higher volume and higher capacity utilization. And so looking at the full year, we now expect operating earnings to approach $90 million for the year, as the momentum they have built up in the first half of the year carries through to the second half.
Turning next to Performance Polymers on Slide 9. Sales revenue increased 20% year-over-year due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs and increased volume due to the improved operations of our IntegRex-based PET manufacturing facility. Back in January, I said we could check the box on improving the operational performance of our IntegRex asset. And in the second quarter, we demonstrated that we had indeed addressed the operational issues. We are essentially running our IntegRex facility flat out, setting record production volumes and achieving debottleneck capacity, and very importantly, achieving our expected cost positions. And our Class 1 yields are greater than 98%. Primarily, because of the improved volume from IntegRex, we are in the black for the quarter. But year-over-year, operating earnings were about flat as the volume improvement was offset by continued difficult market conditions pressuring margins.
Looking forward, we expect the last three quarters of the year, when taken in aggregate, will be around breakeven. 
Lastly, a few comments about the strategic options for pursuing for this business. I'd like to say the response from the market after our announcement in April has been very strong. And I'd say the process is proceeding on schedule. We continue to expect to complete the effort by the end of the year.
Next is a look at the regions. And you can see from the slide that revenue was up significantly in all regions. Europe was a star for us this quarter with a record for operating earnings due to volumes, which increased 23% in the quarter and 25% for the first half of the year, as we benefit from capacity we've added recently. You might remember in fourth quarter 2008, we added acetate tow capacity in the U.K., and this is running at a very high utilization rate. And at the end of last year, we expanded our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity by 30% and we are now going to expand it again for 2011. We've been prudent with the capacity we've added, and we are now seeing the benefits. 
Asia was also strong, with 28% revenue growth due to equal increases in volume, price and mix. Operating earnings increased both year-over-year and sequentially in Asia. Latin America revenues were up a strong 50%, driven mainly by Performance Polymers, CASPI and PCI. And North America revenue was up 40% due to volume, which was up 24% with the strongest growth in PCI, CASPI and Specialty Plastics. 
That brings me to our guidance for the third quarter and the full year on Slide 11. Given our very strong results in the first half of the year, we have good momentum heading into the second half of the year. We expect to continue to benefit from the economic recovery we've seen and from the continued implementation of growth initiatives that I've discussed throughout my remarks. As many of you know, we do typically have a seasonal decline in our volumes in the second half of the year, and we have that seasonal decline included in our expectations. We also know there was some competitor outages in the first half that we aren't expecting in the second half, and those will be a headwind. And we're expecting raw material and energy costs to be less volatile in the second half of the year compared with the first half. 
Taking these factors into consideration, we expect our third quarter 2010 EPS to be between $1.65 and $1.75 per share, and we are raising our full year 2010 EPS guidance to between $6.20 and $6.40 per share. And I'll close with a few comments about 2011.
Back at our Investor Day in November of last year, we said we could get to greater than $6 a share in our recovery, and we thought that might be around 2012. Well, clearly a recovery has come faster than anyone expected, including us. But we have an expectation for our EPS to be better than $6 this year, we are focused on improving on this in 2011. We recognize there are many things that are outside of our control, the biggest being growth in the global economy, but we are working on things we can control. 
On this slide are just a few of the initiatives that will benefit our 2011 earnings. We've talked a lot about Genovique since we closed the transaction a few months back. We expect it will be accretive even after transaction cost this year and next year will be accretive about cost of capital, so it will be a benefit in 2011 over 2010. The Korea acetate tow facility will also be a benefit for next year as we qualify the material and work towards filling out the facility. As a reminder, this adds about 15% to our acetate tow capacity. 
On Tritan, we are ahead of schedule filling up the first 30,000 met tons of resin capacity, which is greater than $100 million in revenue. And as we make progress, we transitioned from a hurt this year to approaching neutral next year. And when additional resin capacity comes online, we expect to see positive income. 
And with demand rebounding as strongly as it has, we are taking advantage of incremental opportunities for capacity expansions and looking at other growth opportunities. This is a core competency for Eastman. And taken together, these projects are meaningful positive. 
To sum up, with reasonable economic growth, I'm confident we can grow EPS in 2011. 
Now before I turn it over to Curt, let me take one minute and highlight one of our key executives within Eastman. Ron Lindsay, Executive Vice President of Performance Polymers and Chemical Intermediates has been with Eastman for 30 years after graduating as a Chemical Engineer from Clemson University. He also went to the Harvard AMP [Advanced Management Program] program, but I don't know if he wants to admit that to everybody. I think of Ron as having particular expertise in operational excellence in understanding our acetyl, olefin and polyester streams very, very well. This quarter's numbers are evidence of the fine results he's been able to achieve in PCI, relying heavily on Heidi Barnes and Mike Humby to run the business with him. In Performance Polymers, Jennifer Stewart and Phil Begley have been instrumental in the improvement you see in that business. Also, Ron helped us reach the decision to discontinue our Beaumont gasification efforts and is in the process of winding down that program. And as if that isn't enough, he also has responsibility for the engineering and construction group, as well as leading our efforts to find more advantage feedstock opportunities around the globe. As you can see, Ron is a highly valued member of the Eastman Executive Team. 
Now let me turn it over to Curt."

In the second quarter, we generated $206 million in cash from operations. This reflects a very strong net earni",903,"All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start by reviewing our second quarter 2010 financial highlights on Slide 14. 
In the second quarter, we generated $206 million in cash from operations. This reflects a very strong net earnings in our continued working capital discipline. We did have a modest $55 million build in working capital, as we had an increase in receivables, reflecting the strong sales revenue improvement and a small rebuild in inventory, following our Texas outage in the first quarter. 
Our capital expenditures were $47 million, as our maintenance level expenditures are increasing related to our improved capacity utilization. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $129 million and is $41 million year-to-date. 
During the quarter, as Jim mentioned, we did acquire Genovique for approximately $160 million. Our integration efforts are proceeding very well, and we are on track to achieve the financial expectations with this transaction. Our net debt-to-capital ratio remained at 41% at the end of this second quarter.
Turning next on Slide 15 to update on free cash flow for the year. As provided, in our full year EPS guidance, we are expecting continued strong net earnings for the year. We also expect working capital will increase on a full year basis, but will be a source of cash in the second half of the year, consistent with seasonal changes in demand. As a reminder, we are excluding the impact of the adoption of an amended accounting guidance supplied to the company's accounts receivable securitization program during the first quarter. 
Our capital expenditures will ramp up in the second half of the year, as we work to add capacity in response to growth in customer demand and continue to support our strong operating performance. For the year, capital expenditures will be approximately $250 million, which is at the low end of the $250 million to $275 million range I'd given previously. Put this together with our continued strong dividend, we expect free cash flow for the year will be approximately $300 million on the high end of my previous guidance. 
As I just mentioned, we are working on capacity additions to meet strong customer demand we've seen in many parts of the company. First, we are expanding capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters in the Specialty Plastics segment. We plan to expand CHDM capacity by approximately 25% in two phases: The first phase will come online in mid-2011 and the second phase will be online in 2012. This capacity addition will enable us to meet our customers, as demand for copolyester continues to grow. 
Next is the continued expansion in our hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins in Middleburg, The Netherlands and in Longview, Texas. In Middleburg, we expanded capacity for our Regalite hydrocarbon resin by 30% in 2009 and have expanded capacities by 65% since 2006. We are increasing capacity in additional 20% and expect to have the expansion online in early 2011. 
We are also expanding our capacity for Eastotac hydrocarbon resins at our Longview facility and expect this increase will also be online in early 2011. Hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins are used in a variety of  hot melt adhesives and serve the packaging and hygiene markets. And work has begun on expanding the resin capacity for our Tritan copolyesters. 
You'll recall that we built a monomer facility to support 60,000 metric tons of resin capacity and then built a 30,000 metric ton resin facility. As Jim indicated in his remarks, demand has exceeded our expectations, and we are ahead of our schedule for filling this out. 
As a result, we are working on adding the second 30,000 metric tons of capacity and expect it to have it online by the end of 2011. As a reminder, each 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity is greater than $100 million in revenue. 
Moving next to joint ventures and acquisitions. As we discussed before, these four areas of emphasis are how we are targeting joint venture and acquisition opportunities as shown here on Slide 17.  Genovique is an example of an acquisition that really has achieved all four. Its asset base includes manufacturing assets in Estonia and a joint venture in China. Its non-phthalate plasticizer product lines are differentiated and viewed as green and is sustainable by the market. And the Estonia plant benefits from backward integration to benzoic acid. We will continue to pursue joint venture and acquisitions that achieve one or more of these attributes.
Turning next to Slide 18. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our last dividend payment was the 65th consecutive dividend we have paid to stockholders. In addition, in the second quarter, we repurchased $33 million of shares and year-to-date, we have purchased $53 million. 
As of the end of the quarter, our remaining authorization was approximately $40 million, and we expect to continue to repurchasing shares over the coming quarters, primarily as a means to offsetting dilution. 
In conclusion, we are focused on growth for 2011 and beyond. We are expanding capacity at target product lines, where there is demonstrated demand growth. We are reviewing our joint venture and acquisition opportunities in a disciplined manner. And we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders, both through a strong dividend and with share repurchases. 
Thanks for your attention and for your interest in Eastman Chemical. And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

As we began the quarter, we know we had a decent month in April, but month-by-month, they got better through the quarter, and June was particularly strong. So of course, as we were out in early June, we knew April was good, we thought May would be strong, but we didn't know just how strong June was going to be. I'd say the other thing the raw materials didn't move exactly the way we were expecting during the last few weeks of the month, so we didn't get any increase, in fact, probably came off the other way, it came down. And then finally, while we knew we've had a hurt from some, let's call is some overhang from the cracker outage in the first quarter and we could factor that pain into the results, we didn't realize we were going to get about $10 million of a partial insurance settlement until the very end of the quarter, so there's no way we could predict that. I mean part of it is stuff we couldn't have seen, maybe some of it is us being conservative, but when I said we'd be north of $1.60, there's no way I thought we were going to be anywhere near $2, and the quarter just came in very strong."

As usual, I'll begin on Slide 3. Now as I normally do, I'll begin with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in April. For second quarter EPS, we told you we expected to be between",2367,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll begin on Slide 3. Now as I normally do, I'll begin with an update on some of the outlook statements we made on the call back in April. 
For second quarter EPS, we told you we expected to be between $1.50 and $1.60. I updated this guidance at an Investors Conference in early June saying we expect it to be above $1.60. And of course, we did report EPS well above $1.60 last night, and I'll talk more about that in a minute.
Next, we told you that we projected our full year 2010 EPS would be between $5 and $5.25. This was updated in early June to a range of $5.25 to $5.50. I'll talk more about our expectations for 2010 EPS when I get to outlook. 
But given our strong first half, we now expect to be well above this projection. We also told you that we expect to generate between $200 million and $300 million of free cash flow in 2010. And given our strong earnings, we are on track to be at the top of this range. Curt will walk you through this in more detail in his section. 
And we told you we would be disciplined on capital allocation, and we have been. In April, we completed the acquisition of Genovique Specialties Chemicals. We expect the acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2010, despite transaction cost and will be accretive above the cost of capital in 2011. We bought back more than $50 million of stock in the first half to offset dilution, and we've held our capital expenditures this year to record lows, only now, loosening the purse strings to meet increasing demand.
Moving next to Slide 4 and a review of our financial results for second quarter 2010, our EPS of $2.05 is a quarterly record, with our next best quarter coming 15 years ago. Revenue increased 38% year-over-year. The main driver was volume, up 21% year-over-year and 9%, sequentially. We benefited from our growth initiatives and the actions we have taken over the years to improve our portfolio of businesses and reduce our cost structure. Sequentially, volume increased as demand continued to improve. We benefited from competitor outages in Asia, particularly for oxos and PCI and there were some limited inventory restocking, particularly in the more specialty product lines in CASPI. And of course, the year-over-year increase was helped by the comparison to the recessionary levels of second quarter 2009. 
Operating earnings more than doubled year-over-year and our operating margin increased to over 15% in the second quarter, up almost 500 basis points year-over-year and 350 basis points sequentially. The increased earnings reflected higher volumes, improved capacity utilization and resulting lower unit cost and higher selling prices. In addition, we recognized residual cost in the second quarter from the outage at our Longview facility that occurred in February. These costs were mostly offset by a partial insurance recovery in the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with these results, but we aren't standing still, and I'll talk more about that in a few minutes.
Turning to the segments now, starting with Fibers on Slide 5. I've said it before and I'll continue to say it: what a great business. Fibers operating earnings in the quarter were another quarterly record. And over the past six quarters, they have set records on four of them. Higher revenue reflected higher volume, and the higher volume was due to continued solid acetate tow volume and an increase in acetate yarn volume. Operating earnings increased due to the higher volume and higher acetate yarn capacity utilization. The operating margin in the quarter was just over 30% and is right at 30% for the first six months. Looking at the full year, we expect to set a new annual operating earnings record above $300 million, and this would be the sixth record year out of the last seven.
Next up is CASPI, and this is another great business. We also set a quarterly record here with $94 million of operating earnings, surpassing last year's third quarter. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year and was up 11%, sequentially. Volume, price and mix were all contributors to the revenue increase year-over-year. Volume was up due to improved customer demand with a rebound in the economy. Sequentially, volume increased 5% due to growth in all regions, and we believe some limited inventory restocking for some of our more specialty businesses are longer value chains. 
Selling prices were up to offset higher raw materials and energy cost, particularly for our commodity solvents. And the favorable shift in mix reflects higher volumes for our specialty polymer and specialty coalescence, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe. The increased operating earnings reflected a higher volume and higher capacity utilization and a favorable shift in mix. And the operating margin increased to 23%. Looking forward, we expect CASPI will set an annual earnings record with operating earnings approaching $300 million.
PCI is next on Slide 7, and we also had a terrific quarter in this business. Revenue increased substantially, up a very strong 72% year-over-year. Volume was up due to the rebound in the economy over the last 12 months. We also benefited from tightness caused by planned maintenance and outages for oxos in Asia. Selling prices increased to offset higher raw material and energy costs. Sequentially, revenue was up 13% due to higher volumes, as we recovered from the Texas outage in the first quarter. 
Operating earnings increased year-over-year due to higher selling prices, higher volume and higher capacity utilization, which led to lower cost. I'd also remind you that the second quarter 2009 results included approximately $15 million of cost related to the reconfiguration of our Longview, Texas plant. 
Looking forward, a number of the facilities experienced outages in the second quarter are now back online. However, we expect sales volume will remain solid, albeit at a slightly lower margin. As a result, we expect full year operating earnings to approach $200 million for this year.
Specialty Plastics is next. And here, our sales revenue increased 44% year-over-year due to volume, which was up 36%. We're continuing to see the benefit of growth initiatives in core copolyesters in areas such as, shrink film and handled food packaging and adoption of our new Tritan copolyester continues to be ahead of schedule due to the product properties, including a higher temperature resistance and the fact that it is BPA-free. And as Curt will discuss in his section, we have begun work on adding another 30,000 met [metric] tons of resin capacity for Tritan, which we expect will be online by the end of 2011. 
We also had a favorable shift in product mix due to higher volume for our cellulosics used in the LCD market. Sequentially, revenue was up 9% due to an 8% increase in volume, which was driven by the growth initiatives in core copolyester and increased demand for Tritan. This is the sixth quarter in a row where Specialty Plastics has had sequential volume improvement. 
Operating earnings increased substantially year-over-year due to the higher volume and higher capacity utilization. And so looking at the full year, we now expect operating earnings to approach $90 million for the year, as the momentum they have built up in the first half of the year carries through to the second half.
Turning next to Performance Polymers on Slide 9. Sales revenue increased 20% year-over-year due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs and increased volume due to the improved operations of our IntegRex-based PET manufacturing facility. Back in January, I said we could check the box on improving the operational performance of our IntegRex asset. And in the second quarter, we demonstrated that we had indeed addressed the operational issues. We're essentially running our IntegRex facility flat out, setting record production volumes and achieving debottleneck capacity, and very importantly, achieving our expected cost positions. And our Class 1 yields are greater than 98%. Primarily, because of the improved volume from IntegRex, we are in the black for the quarter. But year-over-year, operating earnings were about flat as the volume improvement was offset by continued difficult market conditions pressuring margins.
Looking forward, we expect the last three quarters of the year, when taken in aggregate, will be around breakeven. 
Lastly, a few comments about the strategic options for pursuing for this business. I'd like to say the response from the market after our announcement in April has been very strong. And I'd say the process is proceeding on schedule. We continue to expect to complete the effort by the end of the year.
Next is a look at the regions. And you can see from the slide that revenue was up significantly in all regions. Europe was a star for us this quarter with a record for operating earnings due to volumes, which increased 23% in the quarter and 25% for the first half of the year, as we benefit from capacity we've added recently. You might remember in fourth quarter 2008, we added acetate tow capacity in the U.K., and this is running at a very high utilization rate. And at the end of last year, we expanded our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity by 30% and we are now going to expand it again for 2011. We've been prudent with the capacity we've added, and we are now seeing the benefits. 
Asia was also strong, with 28% revenue growth due to equal increases in volume, price and mix. Operating earnings increased both year-over-year and sequentially in Asia. Latin America revenues were up a strong 50%, driven mainly by Performance Polymers, CASPI and PCI. And North America revenue was up 40% due to volume, which was up 24% with the strongest growth in PCI, CASPI and Specialty Plastics. 
That brings me to our guidance for the third quarter and the full year on Slide 11. Given our very strong results in the first half of the year, we have good momentum heading into the second half of the year. We expect to continue to benefit from the economic recovery we've seen and from the continued implementation of growth initiatives that I've discussed throughout my remarks. As many of you know, we do typically have a seasonal decline in our volumes in the second half of the year, and we have that seasonal decline included in our expectations. We also know there was some competitor outages in the first half that we aren't expecting in the second half, and those will be a headwind. And we're expecting raw material and energy costs to be less volatile in the second half of the year compared with the first half. 
Taking these factors into consideration, we expect our third quarter 2010 EPS to be between $1.65 and $1.75 per share, and we are raising our full year 2010 EPS guidance to between $6.20 and $6.40 per share. And I'll close with a few comments about 2011.
Back at our Investor Day in November of last year, we said we could get to greater than $6 a share in our recovery, and we thought that might be around 2012. Well, clearly a recovery has come faster than anyone expected, including us. But we have an expectation for our EPS to be better than $6 this year, we are focused on improving on this in 2011. We recognize there are many things that are outside of our control, the biggest being growth in the global economy, but we are working on things we can control. 
On this slide are just a few of the initiatives that will benefit our 2011 earnings. We've talked a lot about Genovique since we closed the transaction a few months back. We expect it will be accretive even after transaction cost this year and next year will be accretive above cost of capital, so it will be a benefit in 2011 over 2010. The Korea acetate tow facility will also be a benefit for next year as we qualify the material and work towards filling out the facility. As a reminder, this adds about 15% to our acetate tow capacity. 
On Tritan, we are ahead of schedule filling up the first 30,000 met tons of resin capacity, which is greater than $100 million in revenue. And as we make progress, we transitioned from a hurt this year to approaching neutral next year. And when additional resin capacity comes online, we expect to see positive income. 
And with demand rebounding as strongly as it has, we are taking advantage of incremental opportunities for capacity expansions and looking at other growth opportunities. This is a core competency for Eastman. And taken together, these projects are meaningful positive. 
To sum up, with reasonable economic growth, I'm confident we can grow EPS in 2011. 
Now before I turn it over to Curt, let me take one minute and highlight one of our key executives within Eastman. Ron Lindsay, Executive Vice President of Performance Polymers and Chemical Intermediates has been with Eastman for 30 years after graduating as a Chemical Engineer from Clemson University. He also went to the Harvard AMP [Advanced Management Program] program, but I don't know if he wants to admit that to everybody. I think of Ron as having particular expertise and operational excellence in understanding our acetyl, olefin and polyester streams very, very well. This quarter's numbers are evidence of the fine results he's been able to achieve in PCI, relying heavily on Heidi Barnes and Mike Humby to run the business with him. In Performance Polymers, Jennifer Stewart and Phil Begley have been instrumental in the improvement you see in that business. Also, Ron helped us reach the decision to discontinue our Beaumont gasification efforts and is in the process of winding down that program. And as if that isn't enough, he also has responsibility for the engineering and construction group, as well as leading our efforts to find more advantage feedstock opportunities around the globe. As you can see, Ron is a highly valued member of the Eastman Executive Team. 
Now let me turn it over to Curt."

In the second quarter, we generated $206 million in cash from operations. This reflects a very strong net earni",903,"All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start by reviewing our second quarter 2010 financial highlights on Slide 14. 
In the second quarter, we generated $206 million in cash from operations. This reflects a very strong net earnings in our continued working capital discipline. We did have a modest $55 million build in working capital, as we had an increase in receivables, reflecting the strong sales revenue improvement and a small rebuild in inventory, following our Texas outage in the first quarter. 
Our capital expenditures were $47 million, as our maintenance level expenditures are increasing related to our improved capacity utilization. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $129 million and is $41 million year-to-date. 
During the quarter, as Jim mentioned, we did acquire Genovique for approximately $160 million. Our integration efforts are proceeding very well, and we are on track to achieve the financial expectations with this transaction. Our net debt-to-capital ratio remained at 41% at the end of this second quarter.
Turning next on Slide 15 to update on free cash flow for the year. As provided, in our full year EPS guidance, we are expecting continued strong net earnings for the year. We also expect working capital will increase on a full year basis, but will be a source of cash in the second half of the year, consistent with seasonal changes in demand. As a reminder, we are excluding the impact of the adoption of an amended accounting guidance supplied to the company's accounts receivable securitization program during the first quarter. 
Our capital expenditures will ramp up in the second half of the year, as we work to add capacity in response to growth in customer demand and continue to support our strong operating performance. For the year, capital expenditures will be approximately $250 million, which is at the low end of the $250 million to $275 million range I'd given previously. Put this together with our continued strong dividend, we expect free cash flow for the year will be approximately $300 million on the high end of my previous guidance. 
As I just mentioned, we are working on capacity additions to meet strong customer demand we've seen in many parts of the company. First, we are expanding capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters in the Specialty Plastics segment. We plan to expand CHDM capacity by approximately 25% in two phases: The first phase will come online in mid-2011 and the second phase will be online in 2012. This capacity addition will enable us to meet our customers, as demand for copolyester continues to grow. 
Next is the continued expansion in our hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins in Middleburg, The Netherlands and in Longview, Texas. In Middleburg, we expanded capacity for our Regalite hydrocarbon resin by 30% in 2009 and have expanded capacities by 65% since 2006. We are increasing capacity in additional 20% and expect to have the expansion online in early 2011. 
We are also expanding our capacity for Eastotac hydrocarbon resins at our Longview facility and expect this increase will also be online in early 2011. Hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins are used in a variety of  hot melt adhesives and serve the packaging and hygiene markets. And work has begun on expanding the resin capacity for our Tritan copolyesters. 
You'll recall that we built a monomer facility to support 60,000 metric tons of resin capacity and then built a 30,000 metric ton resin facility. As Jim indicated in his remarks, demand has exceeded our expectations, and we are ahead of our schedule for filling this out. 
As a result, we are working on adding the second 30,000 metric tons of capacity and expect it to have it online by the end of 2011. As a reminder, each 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity is greater than $100 million in revenue. 
Moving next to joint ventures and acquisitions. As we discussed before, these four areas of emphasis are how we are targeting joint venture and acquisition opportunities as shown here on Slide 17.  Genovique is an example of an acquisition that really has achieved all four. Its asset base includes manufacturing assets in Estonia and a joint venture in China. Its non-phthalate plasticizer product lines are differentiated and viewed as green and is sustainable by the market. And the Estonia plant benefits from backward integration to benzoic acid. We will continue to pursue joint venture and acquisitions that achieve one or more of these attributes.
Turning next to Slide 18. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders. Our last dividend payment was the 65th consecutive dividend we have paid to stockholders. In addition, in the second quarter, we repurchased $33 million of shares and year-to-date, we have purchased $53 million. 
As of the end of the quarter, our remaining authorization was approximately $40 million, and we expect to continue to repurchasing shares over the coming quarters, primarily as a means to offsetting dilution. 
In conclusion, we are focused on growth for 2011 and beyond. We are expanding capacity at target product lines, where there is demonstrated demand growth. We are reviewing our joint venture and acquisition opportunities in a disciplined manner. And we remain committed to returning cash to stockholders, both through a strong dividend and with share repurchases. 
Thanks for your attention and for your interest in Eastman Chemical. And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

So if you look over 12 months, we had a pretty good increase year-over-year in raw materials. That was a healthy number. But when you look from first quarter to second quarter, first quarter as we were walking in the raws, we're still pretty strong and then they did start to come off. They didn't really behave the way we thought they would during the second quarter, so in particular, propylene, paraxylene, both were coming off. What we're saying is we have no reason to believe you're going to have extraordinary volatility going forward, so we're, kind of, looking at this as we try and predict between now and year end, saying that we don't think there's going to be a lot of volatility in the raws, but we'll just have to wait and see what happens."

I'd say the other thing the raw materials didn't move exactly the way we were expecting during the last few weeks of the month, so we didn't get any increase, in fact, probably came off the other way, it came down. And then finally, while we knew we've had a hurt from some, let's call is some overhang from the cracker outage in the first quarter and we could factor that pain into the results, we didn't realize we were going to get about $10 million of a partial insurance settlement until the very end of the quarter, so there's no way we could predict that.

On the call with me today are Jim Rogers, President and CEO, and Curt Espeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’ll cover three items.
First, during this call you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations for fourth quarter and full year 2010. Actual results could differ materially from our plans and expectations. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company’s third quarter 2010 financial results news release on our Web site and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2010 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2010.
Second, except when otherwise indicated, all financial measures referenced in the call and in the slides accompanying the call will be non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating earnings, earnings per share and cash flows from operations that exclude restructuring charges.
A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures, including a description of the restructuring-related items, are available in our third quarter 2010 financial results news release and the tables accompanying the news release.
Lastly, we have posted the slides that accompany our remarks for this morning’s call on our Web site, at www.investors.eastman.com, and you’ll find them in the Presentations and Events section.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.

We know it’s a busy week for you, so thanks for choosing to join us. As is our normal practice, I’ll begin on Slide 3 and I’ll begin with a review of the outlook statements we made on the call on July.B",1983,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We know it’s a busy week for you, so thanks for choosing to join us. As is our normal practice, I’ll begin on Slide 3 and I’ll begin with a review of the outlook statements we made on the call on July.
Back in July, we told you we expected third quarter EPS would be between $1.65 and $1.75, but then at an Investor Conference in September I updated this guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.30. There were a few reasons for the increase.
First, prices remained solid, mainly due to higher industry capacity utilization rates for some of our key products. Second, the seasonal decline in volume occurred later in the quarter than we expected, really not beginning until September, and we received partial settlement of an insurance claim worth $0.19 per share in the quarter related to the outage at our Longview, Texas facility earlier in the year.
Next, for full year 2010 EPS, we told you we expected to be between $6.20 and $6.40. I updated this guidance as well in September, saying we would approach $7 of EPS and now we expect to be above $7 for the year.
On free cash flow, we told you we would be between $200 million and $300 million for the year, and now we expect to be over $300 million, even after $135 million pension contribution.
Back in April we told you we would review our strategic actions for the Performance Polymers business, and now you’ve have seen our announcement earlier this week of a definitive agreement with DAK Americas to divest the PET business.
Moving next to Slide #4 and a review of our third quarter results, which were simply outstanding, if I can say that. Revenue was up 29%. Volume was up 18% year-over-year, largely due to improved end use demand in packaging, durable goods and other markets. While volume was up 2% sequentially, we did see a seasonal decline, but later in the quarter than we expected.
Pricing was solid. Operating earnings of $280 million were a quarterly record. The result is our second consecutive quarterly record for earnings per share. Of course, this includes a $0.19 a share from the partial insurance recovery. However, even without the partial insurance recovery in the third quarter, our EPS would still be a record.
While we are very pleased with our strong results both in the quarter and through nine months, we continue to be focused on increasing our EPS in 2011 compared to 2010. Even with a very high bar, we continue to set for ourselves here in 2010.
Turning now to the segments starting with Fibers on Slide #5, Fibers continues to demonstrate the strength of their business, as a result of solid operational performance and reliability, a very competitive cost position through coal gasification and long-standing deep customer relationships.
Both sales revenue and operating earnings were quarterly records and they set a record for acetate tow volume in the quarter as well. Acetate yarn demand is strong and we are operating at very high capacity utilization rates there.
Operating margins for the quarter and first nine months were 30% and looking at the full year, we now expect Fibers to report operating earnings of approximately $325 million, which would establish a record above their $300 million they reported in ‘09 and would be the sixth record year out of the last seven years.
Moving on to CASPI, they also delivered another very strong quarter. Sales revenue increased by 20%, reflecting both price increases and volume growth. Volume increased particularly in packaging and transportation markets in Europe and the U.S. We also continue to benefit from our growth initiatives, including the 30% expansion of our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity in 2009.
Operating earnings increased year-over-year in the third quarter when you include $9 million from the partial insurance settlement. Otherwise, the higher raw material and energy costs were mostly offset by higher selling prices and strong volumes.
For the year, we expect CASPI to report earnings of approximately $310 million. So to give you some perspective, their previous record year was $242 million back in 2006. So you could say they are on track to deliver a fantastic year.
Next up is PCI on Slide 7, in keeping with the theme, they had another outstanding quarter. Sales revenue increased 42% due to higher volumes and pricing. Higher volumes were due to a number of factors, including the growth in plasticizer product lines, which includes the Genovique specialty plasticizer acquisition, and strong demand in end-use markets such as industrial, chemicals, agriculture and health and wellness.
Selling prices were up due to higher raw material and energy cost, including propane. Operating earnings increased due to higher selling prices and volumes, higher capacity utilization and $12 million from the partial insurance settlement.
For the year we expect PCI to report operating earnings of approximately $230 million. This compares with just $54 million for last year 2009 and the record $247 million back in 2007.
Specialty Plastics is next. With their strong third quarter earnings you can clearly see the progress we’ve made on their growth initiatives. Sales revenue grew by 33%, driven primarily by increased volume. The higher volume is due to improved end-use demands in specialty packaging, consumer and durable goods markets.
They are also benefiting from growth in the shrink film market, with our Embrace copolyester, and from growth in the clear handleware market. The first 30,000 metric ton Tritan resin line is expected to be sold out before the end of the fourth quarter.
Operating earnings increased to $31 million and their operating margin increased about 500 basis points year-over-year to approximately 12%, which is in the 10% to 15% range we have for them. For the year, we now expect them to approach $100 million of operating earnings on sales revenue of our $1 billion.
Moving next to PET and the transaction we announced earlier this week. Back in April we indicated we were going to reduce strategic options for our PET business.
The definitive agreement we announced with DAK Americas to divest the PET business, related assets and the IntegRex technology begins the final phase of that process, and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the fourth quarter.
Over the last few years we’ve taken a number of no-regrets actions to improve this business and you can see the results of that effort in the revenue and volume growth and in the earnings they reported in the third quarter. In fact, their third quarter was a record volume quarter on these assets.
We firmly believe that the South Carolina PET site is the best in the world and this transaction reflects the progress that has been made in improving the performance of the Carolina asset.
So I personally want to thank the employees in Carolina that have shown tireless dedication in improving the performance of this business. I am very confident that DAK is well positioned to build on the progress that has been made.
In a few minutes Curt will speak more to the financial implications for Eastman of the transaction.
Moving next to regional performance on Slide #11; the takeaway from this slide is probably obvious. It’s the balance that we have in our revenue growth around the world.
Although North America continues to be the largest region on revenue and earnings basis, we are seeing strong growth in all regions, and this balance is also reflected in regional operating earnings growth year-over-year. We view this balance as the strength of our portfolio that results in more consistent earnings.
That brings me to our fourth quarter guidance on Slide #11. While we expect that our sales volume will increase year-over-year, we also expect it decline sequentially following the normal seasonal pattern. As I said before, we’re already starting to see that.
We also expect that raw material and energy cost, in particular paraxylene, will increase, which would put pressure on operating margins. As a result, we expect fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50, excluding the $20 million to $25 million of restructuring charges for the cost of severance programs that we announced this week.
Combining our fourth quarter guidance with EPS from the first nine months leads to an expectation for a record year, our first year ever above $7 a share. While we are on track to close a very strong year with a solid fourth quarter, we don’t feel like we’re done, which leads me to the work we’ve been doing since January to grow our earnings per share in 2011 versus 2010.
We’re not giving 2011 guidance today, but I did want to share some of the headwinds and tailwinds we see for next year. We have a number of tailwinds that will be helping us, such as the Genovique acquisition, which we completed in April this year. We’ll have the benefit of a full year results from Genovique and we are on track to retrieve all the synergies we expected from that.
We’ll also have the benefit of a full year of operation of our Korean facility in the Fibers business. As we’ve said previously, the Korean facility came online in the first half of this year and we expect to have qualified this material with all of our target customers by the end of the year.
Our first 30,000 ton Tritan copolyester resin facility should be sold out at the end of the year, about a year ahead of the schedule. This enables Tritan to approach breakeven in the fourth quarter, where at the beginning of the year they had about $7 million a quarter of fixed cost that they had to cover and fell short and are in the red. Of course, there are also headwinds. Sustainable global economic recovery is by no means guaranteed to any of us.
There’s going to be volatility in our main raw material and energy cost for propane, paraxylene, wood pulp, coal and other raw materials, that’s always a risk, and increases to our corporate cost structure, in particular, things like the pension expense due to the low interest rates, and costs related to the capacity additions we are making are also a headwind. So, recognizing these and other tailwinds and headwinds, our objective is to make 2011 EPS greater than 2010 and we take this very seriously.
Now, one of the parts I like, I get to turn to what I call the executive spotlight and I’m going to continue the practice of shining the spotlight on an area of the company that I believe had stellar performance during the quarter.
Given the announcement of signing a definitive agreement to sell our Performance Polymers business, it should come as no surprise that I want to give credit to our corporate development team.
I mentioned earlier the employees in the Performance Polymers business and their contribution to this outcome, but specific to the transaction, it was Curt Espeland’s team led by Damon Warmack and Mohit Bhalla who did an exceptional job.
Many of you know Damon from his time leading our CASPI business and our PCI business and he continues to excel in his current role of strategy and corporate development.
Mohit Bhalla had investment banking experience before he came to Eastman, and we’re now benefiting from his deal savvy as shown by this transaction. Of course, they are supported by a strong team in corporate development, finance and legal.
When I put this outcome together, the sale of our Performance Polymers business with the successful acquisition of Genovique, I have a high degree of confidence that we can execute our inorganic growth strategy to grow the company. So, thanks again to Curt’s team in corporate development.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Curt.

I’m going to start with our 2010 free cash flow expectations on Slide #14. In the third quarter, we generated $316 million in operating cash flows and $228 million in free cash flow. This continues to demonstrate",1654,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I’m going to start with our 2010 free cash flow expectations on Slide #14. In the third quarter, we generated $316 million in operating cash flows and $228 million in free cash flow. This continues to demonstrate our strong earnings performance is translating into significant cash generation.
From a working capital standpoint, we are seeing good discipline across the company. The majority of the increase in working capital to-date has been in receivables, reflecting the improved sales revenue and the change in accounts receivable securitization program that I mentioned earlier in the year. In fourth quarter, we expect to generate cash from working capital, which is our normal seasonal pattern.
Given our strong cash flow generation this year, we have decided to contribute an additional $100 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan beyond the $35 million already made.
We are, in essence, accelerating our contribution that might otherwise need to be made next year due to the anticipated low level and discount rate at the year-end. This is also that a tax efficient use of cash that will help offset some of the expected pension headwinds in 2011.
Our capital expenditures did ramp up in the third quarter, but not to the degree anticipated. Again, this reflects good stewardship of capital dollars in the halls of Eastman. We expect our capital expenditures will be approaching $100 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects our plans to expand capacity in a number of areas that I’ll speak to in a minute. Putting this together, our estimated capital expenditures will be approximately $225 million in 2010.
Even with the increase in pension contribution, we continue to expect our free cash flow will be over $300 million for the year. As a reminder, our free cash flow expectation is net of our strong dividend.
A question that we often get and I expect some of you may have this morning is how we’re going to put this cash to work? In answering that question, it is helpful to see how we have allocated cash for the first nine months of 2010 across the four buckets we’ve talked previously here on Slide 15.
In the build bucket, we have spent $133 million of capital expenditures. As I just mentioned, we expect that ramp up will occur in fourth quarter and into 2011. I’ll talk more about the capacity addition shortly.
In the joint ventures and acquisitions bucket, we completed the acquisition of Genovique back in May, and in March we started up the acetate tow facility in Korea that we had acquired from SK.
Back in January, we acquired a small specialty polymers manufacturing facility in China to support CASPI segment and our Specialty Plastics business recently entered into a small cellulose diacetate compounding joint venture with a manufacturer, who is also in China.
We are looking at several small to medium sized opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for Eastman. We need bid/ask spreads to tighten some, to ensure such transactions provide good value for our shareholders.
In addition, we anticipate better quality asset should come in the market as companies become more confident with 2011’s economic environment. Until then we’ll continue to be active, but also be patient and disciplined.
In the equity bucket, we have repurchased year-to-date $68 million in shares outstanding primarily to offset dilution. I would anticipate the level of share repurchases to increase in fourth quarter 2010 and going into 2011, in part, to offset the additional dilutive effect of stock options and the money resulting from our share price increase or the actual issuance of shares upon exercise of such options.
One other matter related to comp-related programs. For tax planning reasons we are aware that participants in our deferred comp plan are considering early withdrawal of a portion of their deferred pay as allowed under the plan. This could result in a cash payment in the fourth quarter or up to $35 million to participants including executive officers.
Any executive officers who receive early payout of the amounts in the phantom stock account of the deferred comp plan would complete a Form 4 filing even though it would not involve shares of Eastman stock.
Lastly, in the debt and long-term liabilities buckets, we will continue to opportunistic as market conditions evolve. So, going forward you would expect us to continue to be disciplined in allocating cash to the best opportunities in each of these buckets just as we demonstrated in the first nine months.
Turning next to the announced capacity additions on Slide 16, the common characteristic of each of these capacity additions is that they are driven by strong demand growth in very attractive markets where Eastman has a competitive advantage, and they all have attractive returns well above our cost of capital.
Starting with the CHDM capacity addition, CHDM is the monomer used in the manufacture of copolyester for the Specialty Plastic segment. As a reminder, Specialty Plastics’ volume has increased 37% through the first nine months and was at a record level in the second quarter after increasing sequentially for six straight quarters.
We expect the 25% increase in CHDM capacity to be online in two phases, with the first in mid 2011 and the second in 2012 to support continued strong growth expectations with copolyesters.
Next is the Tritan copolyester capacity addition. At the end of 2009, we started up a Tritan monomer facility to support two 30,000 metric ton Tritan resin facilities, and then started up the first of those resin facilities. Each resin facility supports new revenue in access for a $100 million.
We had expected to sell out the first resin facility by the end of 2011, but demand has been stronger than we expected. Thus, we expect it will be now sold out by the end of fourth quarter. As a result, we are adding the second Tritan resin facility and expect that will be online around the end of 2011.
Also in the Specialty Plastics is cellulose triacetate or CTA, which is used in LCD industry for the manufacture of polarizer films. We had plans back in 2009 to expand CTA capacity that was put on hold due to the recession.
In 2010 we have seen a nice return in demand for CTA, and it is expected to be very strong over the next several years with a compound annual growth rate of better than 10%. As a result, we are expanding our CTA capacity by approximately 70%, with the new capacity expected to be online in fourth quarter 2012.
We are also expanding our 2-EH capacity at our Longview, Texas site. This expansion supports our growth efforts in the plasticizers market, particularly with our non-phthalate plasticizers, which are expected to have about a 7% compound annual growth rate for North America and Europe over the next five years.
2-EH is also used as an additive for fuels and lube oils. We have a small bottleneck that will be completed in the fourth quarter of this year and an additional expansion expected to be online in mid-2012.
Lastly, we are once again expanding our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity. Regalite is used as a raw material for hot melt and pressure sensitive adhesives, and is also used in non-woven products such as disposable diapers. We expanded our Middleburg facility three times since 2006.
This expansion will add approximately 20% to current capacity and is expected to be online in the second half of 2011. Again, these are good uses of cash and will benefit earnings going into 2012.
Next, I’ll briefly cover the expected financial impact of the PET transaction. First, just to piggyback off Jim, I’d like to add my thanks to the corporate development team and the others who have been working on this transaction over the last several months.
As I’ve said in the past, whoever wants to be the market leader in PET in North America would want our IntegRex technology and the South Carolina facility. This has proven to be the case and should provide or be a win-win transaction for both parties.
We expect total proceeds will be $600 million before transaction costs, with the final price subject to working capital adjustments at closing. The transaction will also result in approximately $100 million of payment of taxes to be made shortly after closing.
The timing of the payment will depend on the date of the closing. So it could be in the fourth quarter, it could be in the first quarter of 2011. We still expect overall transaction to close before the end of this year. As you know, all tax payments are reflected as cash flows from operations, and therefore, will impact our free cash flow where made.
In addition, we have approved a restructuring plan to address the indirect cost associated with the Performance Polymers business segment. We expect to recognize a charge between $20 million and $25 million in fourth quarter for severance costs associated with this plan.
Regarding the potential EPS impact of the transaction on our fourth quarter results, our forecast for Performance Polymers segment results, excluding corporate cost that have been previously allocated to the business, is near breakeven.
We, therefore, expect that reporting the Performance Polymers result as discontinued operations will have a minimal impact on earnings from continuing operations for the company in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, I’m very pleased to invite you to join us for our 2011 Investor Day in New York City on March 1. We’re holding in at the Sentry Center, which is conveniently located in Midtown on Third Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets. Like our last Investor Day, there will be a presentation from our senior management and we’ll update you on our growth strategies. I look forward to seeing you there.
And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Greg.

I won’t drag you through all the buckets again, but we want to use all of them. In the owners bucket with equity, we talked about keeping up with the share creep in terms of dilution that comes from options, et cetera, and we actually were a little bit ahead of it.
And then of course, when you set a record price, basically all your options go into money. So we need to pick up the pace there on the share buyback just to offset dilution. Beyond that, we do have the flexibility to buyback beyond just offsetting dilution, if that looks like our best alternative.
Remember, I’m always comparing it to what we see in the other buckets. We’re trying to play that a bit by year and see if we’ve got better growth opportunities. You can expect our share buybacks will tick up, first of all, just to keep up with the new dilution numbers, and then if we want, we could go a little beyond that.
On the dividend, of course, I always beg off because that’s a Board decision. We pay a healthy dividend. That discussion really is not ripe at this time. I guess the next time the Board looks at it is in December. We obviously think that returning cash to shareholders is a very valid use of cash, and we look at the dividend and we look at share buybacks as our ways to do that, but we’ll just have to wait and see what comes in next quarter.

There is some inventory destocking in some Specialty Plastics markets, like in displays, but when I went back and looked at the typical seasonal drop. I looked ‘05, there was a couple of other years, and to get this kind of drop, especially when you remember to back out the insurance from the third quarter, when you’re just comparing third the fourth, it doesn’t feel that out of whack to me from a seasonal point of view.

So one other things we see is, I don’t think paraxylene moved up as much as perhaps we got in price, and now as you go into the fourth quarter with paraxylene moving up, you’ll probably give a little of that back. So I wouldn’t read any huge trends into it, it’s probably more of the timing of pricing versus raws, but I can just tell you, within Specialty Plastics everything seems to be performing very well.

Some of our businesses maybe as not so noticeable to you, but in CASPI, the solvents for example, their margins were actually noticeably higher in solvents a year ago. So they’ve already started down in the margins.
The reason I say that is, because we think there’s other ways to offset that. So, yes, you always go to pricing, but we also think there’s additional volume to be had. As I think about it, we’ve got volume on the assets we’ve already got in place, plus we’ve told you that we’ve got a number of expansions underway.

Some of the things are lower interest rates, higher pension expense, there’s just no way around that. You can just see that’s coming. Within the businesses themselves, we like the demand we’re seeing.
The biggest challenge we’ve had this year was just trying to eek enough stuff out of our pipes to meet that demand and so I expect that to continue. We’re going to need almost flawless operational performance to make sure we deliver the volumes of product that the market wants from us. Let’s see what competitors do, let’s see if they bring on much more capacity or how quickly they can get that on, how disciplined they are in recovering their costs, but overall, I can’t say enough about the portfolio of businesses that we have right now.

As we looked at that, I think that’s around 2% or 3% of the market with the guys who run that business and lady who runs that business tell me that that’s pretty much just offsetting the loss you’ve had, the loss of propylene you’ve had with world cracking lighter feedstocks, etc., refineries running less. I don’t see that trend going away.
So my guess is, you can probably count on that spread between propane and propylene, because it’s only a guess, but I think as people have to go to make more propylene on demand versus just getting it the way we’ve been getting it out of the heavier feedstocks, I think you can count on that spread being there. Will it temporarily move around as capacity comes on? Yes, probably it will.
The other thing I’d like to add is, I still feel pretty good about our position. You know we are bringing a cracker back on, it’s because we think that cracker by the way has moved from fourth quarter of first quartile position just given the low shale gas prices. So I look at our position with where we thought we are going to be shutting crackers down, here we are turning around and opening one up. I know our crackers have a higher percentage propylene. This comes not only from the fact of feedstock we buy, propane, ethane, we buy higher propane mix, but it’s also just that crackers themselves produce more propylene than say what might be normal in the industry. So, all that stuff bodes well for us.
The final thing I’d like to say when people ask me about that spread is, I think we can count on it, but it doesn’t really explain the bulk of PCI’s profit. It’s really, PCI has an acetyl stream, it’s very steady, it has the olefins and oxide derivatives piece, which of course is where a lot of the spread you’re talking about gets picked up, but even there we’ve got strong derivatives. You think about the plasticizers that are growing. So we’re making part of the profit on that spread, but we’re making probably just as much profit on the derivatives, and then on top of that you got acetyls and some other things in PCI. So I think I can count on the spread, but PCI is doing a lot better than just what that spread we’d say.

So I picked up the one place where I think people are actually destocking, which was displays. I can tell you that they are still having trouble building inventory in a lot of adhesives markets, which you would see in our resins business in CASPI.
I think frankly, Europe just had their act together, certain parts of it. I think about how Germany has handled themselves through this recession. I think about how Eastern Europe has come back. So, I don’t think it’s just us. I think we’re benefiting from some stuff, I know that our plasticizers, non-phthalate plasticizers are doing really well over there. A few other key products, the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins is doing really well over there, but overall I think, Europe, is maybe stronger than people gave me credit for.

In fact, I was just telling the guys here, I was in the hot tub last night looking at stars expecting that question on how to repeat and is this it and is there anything left. I already have a good answer for discussion because it’s being asked for quite a while. I remember back when we were going through the recession and we had cut the bottom off of the trough and we only got down to about $3.60 and that surprised people and they said, well, you must’ve given up the upside.
And then we had our Investors Day and we said, we think we can do $6 in the recovery just on the core businesses alone and people were asking then you must mean nuts to peak. And then we came out and said, it looks like we’re going to go over $7, and then we said 2012, we’re looking like $8. So, I sit back and I say, what are we missing here? I think one of the things is, I think maybe it’s not as relevant anymore to talk trough and peak when you talk Eastman. I’m not saying it’s irrelevant, but maybe it’s just not as relevant because of all the changes we’ve made in our portfolio.
Now, specifically getting to do we have any juice left, I was trying to get to that earlier when I said it’s not like we ran flat up the whole year. You can go back and look at our first quarter and see that we were lower. We’re telling you now we’re coming off again in the third quarter. We’ve been running hard, but it hasn’t been perfect. We had some outages, et cetera. We know that we typically expect capacity creep each year. We’ve announced the capacity expansions we had on. So I start by thinking I got growth opportunities just in the core businesses in the existing markets, just getting more capacity online.
And then if I try and take an even longer view than that, but we can also create new businesses. As we exit PET and we change the nature of the portfolio to where we’re starting to look more special, assuming we close by end of year, we’re going to be sitting on something between $15, $17 a share of cash, depending on what else we do with our cash between now and then. That’s the way it would look today if you did nothing else. As long as you can generate cash in a business and you’re smart about how you put it work, you can continue the growth. So I hate it when people try and produce in a box and say, well, the existing business is running high utilization rates, I guess you don’t have any more juice. As long as we can generate cash, we can.

We know it's a busy week for you, so thanks for choosing to join us. As is our normal practice, I'll begin on Slide 3 and I'll begin with a review of the outlook statements we made on the call back in July. W",1993,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We know it's a busy week for you, so thanks for choosing to join us. 
As is our normal practice, I'll begin on Slide 3 and I'll begin with a review of the outlook statements we made on the call back in July. We told you we expected the third quarter EPS would be between $1.65 and $1.75, but  then at an Investor Conference in September, I updated this guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.30. And there were a few reasons for the increase: First, prices remained solid mainly due to higher industry capacity utilization rate for some of our key products; second, the seasonal decline in volume occurred later in the quarter than we expected really not beginning until September; and we received partial settlement of an insurance claim worth $0.19 per share in the quarter related to the outage at our Longview, Texas facility earlier in the year.
Next for full year 2010 EPS, we told you we expect it to be between $6.20 and $6.40. I updated this guidance as well in September saying we would approach $7 of EPS and now we expect to be above $7 for the year. On free cash flow, we told you we would be between $200 million and $300 million for the year, and now we expect to be over $300 million even after a $135 million pension contribution. And back in April, we told you we would review our strategic actions for the Performance Polymers business, and now you've seen our announcement earlier this week of a definitive agreement with DAK Americas to divest the PET business.
Moving next to Slide 4 and a review of our third quarter results, which were simply outstanding, if I can say that. Revenue was up 29%, volume was up 18% year-over-year largely due to improved end used demand and packaging durable goods and other markets. And while volume was up 2% sequentially, we did see a seasonal decline, but later in the quarter than we expected. 
And pricing was solid. Operating earnings at $280 million were quarterly record. The result is our second consecutive quarterly record for earnings per share. Of course this includes $0.19 a share from the partial insurance recovery. However, even without the partial insurance recovery in the third quarter, our EPS would still be a record.
While we are very pleased with our strong results both in the quarter and through nine months, we continue to be focused on increasing our EPS in 2011 compared to 2010. Even with a very high bar, we continue to set for ourselves here in 2010. 
Turning now to the segment starting with Fibers on Slide 5. Fibers continues to demonstrate the strength of their business. The result of solid operational performance and reliability, a very competitive cost position through cold gasification and long-standing deep customer relationships. Both sales revenue and operating earnings were quarterly records, and they set a record for acetate tow volume in the quarter as well. 
Acetate yarn demand is strong, and we are operating at very high capacity utilization rates there. Operating margins for the quarter and first nine months were 30% and looking at the full year, we now expect Fibers to report operating earnings of approximately $325 million, which would establish a record above their $300 million they reported in '09 and would be the sixth record year out of the last seven years.
Moving on to CASPI. They also delivered another very strong quarter sales revenue increase by 20%, reflecting both price increases and volume growth. Volume increased particularly in packaging and transportation markets in Europe and the U.S. And we also continue to benefit from our growth initiatives, including the 30% expansion of our Regalite Hydrocarbon resin capacity in 2009. 
Operating earnings increased year-over-year in the third quarter when you include $9 million from the partial insurance settlement. Otherwise, the higher raw material and energy costs were mostly offset by higher selling prices and strong volumes. 
For the year, we expect CASPI to report earnings of approximately $310 million. So to give you some perspective, their previous record year was $242 million back in 2006. So you could say they are on track to deliver a fantastic year.
Next up is PCI on Slide 7. In keeping with the theme, they had another outstanding quarter. Sales revenue increased 42% due to higher volumes and pricing. Higher volumes were due to a number of factors, including the growth in plasticizer product lines, which includes the Genovique Specialties plasticizer acquisition and strong demand in end used markets, such as industrial, chemicals, agriculture and health and wellness. Selling prices were up due to higher raw material and energy costs, including propane.
Operating earnings increased due to higher selling prices in volumes, higher capacity utilization and $12 million from the partial insurance owner. For the year, we expect PCI to report operating earnings of approximately $230 million. This compares with just $54 million for last year 2009 and the record $247 million back in 2007. 
Specialty Plastics is next, and with their strong third quarter earnings, you can clearly see the progress we've made on their growth initiatives. Sales revenue grew by 33% driven primarily by increased volume. The higher volume was due to improved end-used demand from Specialty Packaging, consumer and durable goods market. They're also benefiting from growth in the shrink film market with our Embrace copolyester and from growth in the clear handleware market. And the first 30,000 metric ton Tritan resin line is expected to be sold out before the end of the fourth quarter. 
Operating earnings increased to $31 million and their operating margin increased about 500 basis points year-over year to approximately 12%, which is in the 10% to 15% range we have targeted for them. For the year, we now expect them to approach $100 million of operating earnings on sales revenue of over $1 billion.
Moving next to PET and the transaction we announced earlier this week. Back in April, we indicated we were going to review strategic options for our PET business. A definitive agreement we announced with DAK Americas to divest the PET business related assets and the IntegRex technology begins the final phase of that process, and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Over the last few years, we've taken a number of no-regrets actions to improve this business, and you can see the results of that effort in the revenue and volume growth in the earnings they reported in the third quarter. In fact, the third quarter was a record volume quarter on these assets. 
We firmly believe that the South Carolina PET site is the best in the world, and this transaction reflects the progress that has been made improving the performance of the Carolina asset. So I personally want to thank the employees in Carolina that has shown tireless dedication in improving their performance of this business. And I'm very confident that DAK is well positioned to build on the progress that has been made. In a few minutes, Curt will speak more to the financial implications for Eastman of the transaction.  
Moving next to regional performance on Slide 11. The take away from the slide is probably obvious, it's the balance that we have in our revenue growth around the world. Although North America continues to be our largest region on revenue and earnings basis, we're seeing strong growth in all regions. And this balance is also reflected in regional operating earnings growth year-over-year. We view this balance as the strength of our portfolio that results in more consistent earnings. 
And that brings me to our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 11. While we expect that our sales volume will increase year-over-year, we also expect that it will decline sequentially following the normal seasonal pattern. And as I've said before, we're already starting to see that. We also expect that raw material and energy costs, in particular paraxylene, will increase, which would put pressure on operating margins. As a result, we expect fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50, excluding the $20 million to $25 million of restructuring charges for the cost of severance programs that we announced this week. 
Combining our fourth quarter guidance with EPS from the first nine months leads to an expectation for a record year, our first year ever above $7 this year. And while we are on track to close a very strong year with a solid fourth quarter, we don't feel like we're done, which leads me to the work we've been doing since January to grow our earnings per share in 2011 versus 2010. 
We're not giving 2011 guidance today, but I did want to share some of the headwinds and tailwinds we see for next year. So we have a number of tailwinds that will be helping us, such as the Genovique acquisition, which we completed in April of this year. We'll have the benefit of our full year results from Genovique and we're on track to achieve all the synergies we expected from that. 
We'll also have the benefit of a full year of operation of our Korean facility in the Fibers business. And as we've said previously, the Korean facility came online in the first half of this year, and we expect to have qualified this material with all of our target customers by the end of the year. And our first 30,000-ton Tritan copolyester resin facility should be sold out at the end of the year, about a year ahead of the schedule, and this enables Tritan to approach breakeven in the fourth quarter, whereas in the beginning of the year, they had about $7 million a quarter of fixed costs that they had to cover. And it fell short and are in the red.
Of course, there's also headwinds. Sustainable global economic recovery is by no means guarantee to any others. There's going to be volatility in our main raw material and energy cost for propane, paraxylene, wood pulp, coal and other raw materials. That's always a risk. And increases to our corporate cost structure, in particular things like the pension expenses due to the low interest rates and costs related to the capacity additions we are making are also a headwind.
So recognizing these and other tailwinds and headwinds, our objective is to make 2011 EPS greater than 2010, and we take this very seriously.
Now one of the parts I like, I get to turn to, what I call, the executive spotlight. And I'm going to continue the practice of signing the spotlight on an of the company that I believe had stellar performance during the quarter. 
And given the announcement of signing a definitive agreement to sell our Performance Polymers business, it should come as no surprise that I want to give credit to our corporate development team. I mentioned earlier, the employees in the Performance Polymers business and their contribution to this outcome. But specific to the transaction was Curt Espeland's team led by Damon Warmack and Mohit Bhalla, who did an exceptional job. Many of you know Damon from his time leaving our CASPI business and our PCI business, and he continues to excel in his current role of Strategy and Corporate Development. Mohit Bhalla had investment banking experience before he came to Eastman, and we're now benefiting from his deal savvy as shown by this transaction. Of course, they're supported by a strong team in Corporate Development, Finance and Legal. When I put this outcome together, the sale of our Performance Polymers business with its successful acquisition at Genovique, I have a high degree of confidence that we can execute our inorganic growth strategy to grow the company. 
So thanks again to Curt's team in Corporate Development, and now I'll turn it over to Curt."
109103,113404548,83380,"Eastman Chemical Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I want to start with our 2010 free cash flow expectations on Slide 14. In the third quarter we generated $316 million in operating cash flows and $228 million in free cash flow. This continues to demonstrate our str",1653,"Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I want to start with our 2010 free cash flow expectations on Slide 14. In the third quarter we generated $316 million in operating cash flows and $228 million in free cash flow. This continues to demonstrate our strong earnings performance is translating into significant cash generation. 
From a working capital standpoint, we are seeing good discipline across the company. The majority of the increase in working capital to date has been in receivables, reflecting the improved sales revenue and the change in accounts receivable securitization program that I mentioned earlier in the year. 
In fourth quarter we expect to generate cash from working capital, which is our normal seasonal pattern. Given our strong cash flow generation this year, we have decided to contribute an additional $100 million to our U.S.-defined benefit pension plan beyond the $35 million already made. We are, in essence, accelerating a contribution that might otherwise need to be made next year due to the anticipated low level and discount rate at the year end. This is also that a tax efficient use of cash will help offset some of the expected pension headwinds in 2011. 
Our capital expenditures did ramp up in the third quarter, but not to the degree anticipated. Again, this reflects good stewardship of capital dollars in the halls of Eastman. We expect our capital expenditures will be approaching $100 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects our plans to expand capacity in a number of areas that I'll speak to in a minute.
Putting this together, our estimated capital expenditures will be approximately $225 million in 2010. Even with the increase in pension contribution, we continue to expect our free cash flow will be over $300 million for the year. And as a reminder, our free cash flow expectation is net of our strong dividend.
A question we often get, and I expect some of you may have this morning is how we're going to put this cash to work. An answer in that question, it is helpful to see how we have allocated cash in the first nine months of 2010 across the four buckets we've talked previously here on Slide 15. 
In the build bucket, we have spent $133 million of capital expenditures. And as I just mentioned, we expect that ramp-up will occur in fourth quarter and into 2011. I'll talk more about this capacity addition shortly. 
In the joint ventures and acquisitions bucket, we completed the acquisition of Genovique back in May. And in March, we started up the acetate tow facility in Korea that we had acquired from SK. Back in January, we acquired a small specialty polymers manufacturing facility in China to support CASPI segment. 
And our Specialty Plastics business recently entered into a small cellulose diacetate compounding joint venture with a manufacturer, who is also in China. We are looking at several small to medium-sized opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for Eastman. We need bid/ask spreads to tighten some to ensure such transactions provide good value for our shareholders. In addition, we anticipate better quality asset should come in the market as companies become more confident with 2011 economic environment. Until then, we'll continue to be active, but also be patient and disciplined.
In the equity bucket, we have repurchased year-to-date $68 million in shares outstanding primarily to offset dilution. I would anticipate the level of share repurchases to increase in fourth quarter 2010 and going into 2011 in part to offset the additional dilutive effect of stock options in the money resulting from our share price increase or the actual issuance of shares upon exercise of such options. 
And one other matter related to comp-related programs, for tax planning reasons, we are aware that participants in our deferred comp plan are considering early withdrawal of a portion of their deferred pay as allowed under the plan. This could result in a cash payment in the fourth quarter or up to $35 million to participants, including executive officers. Any executive officers who received early pay out of the amount in the Phantom stock account of the deferred comp plan would complete a Form 4 filing even though it would not involve shares of Eastman stock.
Lastly in the debt and long term liabilities bucket, we will continue to be opportunistic as market conditions evolve. So going forward, you would expect us to continue to be disciplined in allocating cash of both the best opportunities in each of these buckets just as we demonstrated in the first nine months.
Turning next to the announced capacity additions on Slide 16. The common characteristic of each of these capacity additions is that they are driven by strong demand growth in very attractive markets where Eastman has a competitive advantage. And they all have attractive returns well above our cost of capital. 
Starting with the CHDM capacity edition. CHDM is the monomer used in the manufacture of copolyester for the Specialty Plastics segment. As a reminder Specialty Plastics volume has increased 37% for the first nine months and was at a record level in the second quarter after increasing in sequentially for six straight quarters. We expect the 25% increase in CHDM capacity to be online in two phases with the first to mid-2011 and the second in 2012 to support continued strong growth expectations with core copolyesters.
Next is the Tritan copolyester capacity edition. At the end of 2009, we started up a Tritan monomer facility to support two 30,000 metric ton Tritan resin facilities and then started up the first of those resin facilities. Each resin facility supports new revenue in excess of the $100 million. We had expected to sell out the first resin facility by the end of 2011, but demand has been stronger than we expected, thus we expect it will be now sold out by the end of fourth quarter. As a result, we are adding the second Tritan resin facility and expect that would be online around the end of 2011. 
Also on the Specialty Plastics cellulose triacetate or CTA, which is used in the LCD industry for the manufacture of polarizer films. We had plans back in 2009 to expand CTA capacity that was put on hold due to the recession.
In 2010, we have seen a nice return in demand for CTA and it is expected to be very strong over the next several years with a compound annual growth rate of better than 10%. As a result, we are expanding our CTA capacity by approximately 70% with a new capacity expected to be online in first quarter 2012. We're also expanding our 2-EH capacity along at our Longview, Texas site. This expansion support our growth efforts in the plasticizers market, particularly with our non-phthalate plasticizers, which are expected to have about a 7% compound annual growth rate for North America and Europe for the next five years. 2-EH is also used as an additive for fuels and lube oils.
We have a small debottleneck that will be completed in the fourth quarter this year and an additional expansion expected to be online in mid-2012. 
Lastly, we're once again expanding our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity. Regalite is used as a raw material for hot melt and pressure-sensitive adhesives and was also used in non-woven products, such as disposable diapers. We expanded our Middleburg facility 3x since 2006. This expansion will add approximately 20% to current capacity and is expected to be aligned the second half of 2011. Again, these are good uses of cash and will benefit earnings going into 2012.
Next I'll briefly cover the expected financial impact of the PET transaction. First, just the piggyback off of Jim, I'd like to add my thanks to the corporate development team and the others who have been working on this transaction over the last several months. 
As I've said in the past, whoever wants to be the market leader in PET North America would want our IntegRex technology in the South Carolina facility. This has proven to be the case and should provide or be a win-win transaction for both parties. We expect total proceeds will be $600 million before transaction costs with the final price subject to working capital adjustments at closing. The transaction will also result in approximately $100 million of payment of taxes to be made shortly after closing. The timing of the payment will depend on the date of the closing so it could be the fourth quarter or could be in the first quarter of 2011. We still expect overall transaction to close before the end of this year. 
As you know, all tax payments are reflected as cash flows from operations, and therefore will impact our free cash flow where made. In addition, we have approved our restructuring plan to address the indirect cost associated with the Performance Polymers business segment. We expect to recognize a charge between $20 million and $25 million in the fourth quarter for severance cost associated with this claim. Regarding the potential EPS impact of the transaction on our fourth quarter results, our forecast for Performance Polymers segment results, excluding corporate costs that have previously allocated to the business, is near breakeven. We, therefore, expect that reporting the Performance Polymers results as discontinued operations will have a minimal impact on earnings from continuing operations for the company in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, I'm very pleased to invite you to join us for our 2011 Investment Day in New York City on March 1. We're holding it at Sentry Center, which is conveniently located in Midtown on Third Avenue between 45th and 46th streets. Like our last Investor Day, there will be a presentation from our senior management, and we'll update you on our growth strategies. I look forward to seeing you there, and with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

I mean what we've said before, I won't drag you through all the buckets again, but you know we want to use all of them. But in the owners bucket with equity, we talked about keeping up with the share creep in terms of dilution that comes from options, et cetera. And we're, actually, were a little bit ahead of it. And then of course, when you set a record price, basically all your options go in the money. And so we need to pick up the pace there on the share buyback just to offset dilution. Beyond that, we do have the flexibility to buyback beyond just offsetting dilution, if that looks like our best alternative. But remember, I'm always comparing it to what we see in the other bucket. So we're trying to play that a bit by ear and see if we got better growth opportunities. But you can expect our share buybacks will pick up, first of all, just to keep up with the new dilution numbers. And then if we want, we could go a little beyond that. On the dividend, of course, I always beg off because that's a board decision. We pay a healthy dividend and that discussion really isn't right at this time. But I guess the next time the board looks at it is in December. And we obviously think that returning cash to shareholders is a very valid use of cash and we look at the dividend and we look at share buybacks as our ways to do that.

And as we looked at that, I think that's around 2% or 3% of the market with the guys who run that business and lady who runs that business tell me that, that's pretty much just offsetting the loss you've had, the loss of propylene you've had with the world-cracking lighter feedstocks, et cetera. So refinery's running less. And I don't see that trend going away. So my guess is you can probably count on that spread between propane and propylene. Of course, it's only a guess, but I think those people have to go to make more propylene on demand versus just getting it the way we've been getting it out of the heavier feedstocks, I think. I think you can count on that spread being there. Will it temporarily move around as capacity comes on? Yes, it probably will. But the other thing I'd like to add is I still feel pretty good about our position.  I mean you know we're bringing a cracker back on, it's because we think that cracker, by the way, has moved from fourth quarter of first quartile cost position just given the low shale gas prices. So I look at our position with where we thought we were going to be shutting crackers down, here we are turning around, opening one up. I know our crackers have a higher percentage propylene, comes not only from the fact that feedstock would buy propane. Ethane would buy a higher propane mix, but it's also just the crackers themselves produced more propylene than say, what might be normal in the industry. So all that stuff bodes well for us. And the final thing I'd like to say when people asked me  about that spread is, I think we can count on it, but it doesn't really explain the bulk of PCIs profit. It's really, PCI has an acetyl stream that's very steady. It has the olefins and oxide derivatives piece, which of course is where a lot of the spread you're talking about gets picked up. But even there, we got strong derivatives. You think about the plasticizers that are growing so we're making part of the profit on that spread, but we're making probably just as much profit on the derivatives. And then on top of that, you got acetyls and some other things in PCI. So I think I can count on this spread, but PCI is doing a lot better than just what that spread would say."

So I don't think it's just us. I think we're benefiting from some stuff. I know that our plasticizers, non-phthalate plasticizers' doing really well over there.

So I'm just wondering how many more months or quarters do you think that Eastman could experience this stellar growth rates on a year-over-year basis?

In fact, I was just telling the guys here, I was in the hot tub last night looking up stars, expecting a question on have we peaked and is this it and is there anything left?

In fact, I was just telling the guys here, I was in the hot tub last night looking up stars, expecting a question on have we peaked and is this it and is there anything left? And I ought to have a good answer for this question because it's been asked for quite for quite a while. I remember back when we were going through the recession and we had cut the bottom off of the trough and we only got down about $3.60 and that surprised people. And I said, well you must have given up the upside. And then we had our Investors Day and we said we think we can do $6 in recovery just on the core businesses alone. And people were asking then, well you must mean that's the peak? And then we came out and said, it looks like we're going to go over $7 and then we said, 2012 we're looking like $8. So I sit back and I say, what are we missing here? And I think one of the things is I think maybe it's not as relevant anymore to talk trough and peak when you talk Eastman. I'm not saying it's irrelevant, but maybe it's just not as relevant because of all the changes we've made in our portfolio, specifically getting to, do we have any juice left? I was just trying to get to that earlier when I said, it's not like we ran flat out the whole year. You go back and look at our first quarter and see that we were lower. We're telling you now, we're coming off again in the third quarter. We've been running hard, but it hasn't been perfect. We had some outages, et cetera. You know that we typically expect capacity to creep each year. We've announced the capacity expansions we had on. So I start by thinking, I got growth opportunities just in the core businesses in the existing markets, just getting more capacity online. And then if I try and take an even longer view than that, I think well, but we can also create new businesses. And as we exit PET and we kind of change the nature of the portfolio to where we're starting to look more special, assuming we close by end of year, we're going to be sitting on something between $15, $17 per share of cash depending on what else we do with our cash between now and then, but that's the way it would look today if you did nothing else. And as long as you can generate cash in a business and you're smart about how you put it to work, you can continue the growth. And so I hate it when people try and put us in a box and say, well the existing businesses running high utilization rates, I guess, you don't have any more juice. As long as we can generate cash, we can."

We told you we expected third quarter EPS would be between $1.65 and $1.75, but then at an Investor Conference in September, I updated this guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.30. And there were a few reasons for the increase: first, prices remained solid mainly due to higher industry capacity utilization rates for some of our key products; second, the seasonal decline in volume occurred later in the quarter than we expected really not beginning until September; and we received partial settlement of an insurance claim worth $0.19 per share in the quarter related to the outage at our Longview, Texas facility earlier in the year.
Next for full year 2010 EPS, we told you we expect it to be between $6.20 and $6.40. I updated this guidance as well in September saying we would approach $7 of EPS and now we expect to be above $7 for the year. On free cash flow, we told you we would be between $200 million and $300 million for the year, and now we expect to be over $300 million even after a $135 million pension contribution. And back in April, we told you we would review our strategic actions for the Performance Polymers business, and now you've seen our announcement earlier this week of a definitive agreement with DAK Americas to divest the PET business.
Moving next to Slide 4 and a review of our third quarter results, which were simply outstanding, if I can say that. Revenue was up 29%, volume was up 18% year-over-year largely due to improved end-use demand and packaging durable goods and other markets. And while volume was up 2% sequentially, we did see a seasonal decline, but later in the quarter than we expected. And pricing was solid. 
Operating earnings of $280 million were a quarterly record. The result is our second consecutive quarterly record for earnings per share. Of course this includes the $0.19 a share from the partial insurance recovery. However, even without the partial insurance recovery in the third quarter, our EPS would still be a record.
While we are very pleased with our strong results both in the quarter and through nine months, we continue to be focused on increasing our EPS in 2011 compared to 2010. Even with a very high bar, we continue to set for ourselves here in 2010. 
Turning now to the segment starting with Fibers on Slide 5. Fibers continues to demonstrate the strength of their business. The result of solid operational performance and reliability, a very competitive cost position through coal gasification and long-standing deep customer relationships. Both sales revenue and operating earnings were quarterly records, and they set a record for acetate tow volume in the quarter as well. 
Acetate yarn demand is strong, and we are operating at very high capacity utilization rates there. Operating margins for the quarter and first nine months were 30% and looking at the full year, we now expect Fibers to report operating earnings of approximately $325 million, which would establish a record above their $300 million they reported in '09 and would be the sixth record year out of the last seven years.
Moving on to CASPI. They also delivered another very strong quarter, sales revenue increased by 20%, reflecting both price increases and volume growth. Volume increased particularly in packaging and transportation markets in Europe and the U.S. And we also continue to benefit from our growth initiatives, including the 30% expansion of our Regalite Hydrocarbon resin capacity in 2009. 
Operating earnings increased year-over-year in the third quarter when you include $9 million from the partial insurance settlement. Otherwise, the higher raw material and energy costs were mostly offset by higher selling prices and strong volumes. 
For the year, we expect CASPI to report earnings of approximately $310 million. So to give you some perspective, their previous record year was $242 million back in 2006. So you could say they are on track to deliver a fantastic year.
Next up is PCI on Slide 7. In keeping with the theme, they had another outstanding quarter. Sales revenue increased 42% due to higher volumes and pricing. Higher volumes were due to a number of factors, including the growth in plasticizer product lines, which includes the Genovique Specialties plasticizer acquisition and strong demand in end-use markets, such as industrial chemicals, agriculture and health and wellness. Selling prices were up due to higher raw material and energy costs, including propane.
Operating earnings increased due to higher selling prices and volumes, higher capacity utilization and $12 million from the partial insurance settlement. For the year, we expect PCI to report operating earnings of approximately $230 million. This compares with just $54 million for last year 2009 and the record $247 million back in 2007. 
Specialty Plastics is next, and with their strong third quarter earnings, you can clearly see the progress we've made on their growth initiatives. Sales revenue grew by 33% driven primarily by increased volume. The higher volume was due to improved end-use demands in specialty packaging, consumer and durable goods markets. They're also benefiting from growth in the shrink film market with our Embrace copolyester and from growth in the clear handleware market. And the first 30,000 metric ton Tritan resin line is expected to be sold out before the end of the fourth quarter. 
Operating earnings increased to $31 million and their operating margin increased about 500 basis points year-over year to approximately 12%, which is in the 10% to 15% range we have targeted for them. For the year, we now expect them to approach $100 million of operating earnings on sales revenue of over $1 billion.
Moving next to PET and the transaction we announced earlier this week. Back in April, we indicated we were going to review strategic options for our PET business. A definitive agreement we announced with DAK Americas to divest the PET business, related assets and the IntegRex technology, begins a final phase of that process, and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Over the last few years, we've taken a number of no-regrets actions to improve this business, and you can see the results of that effort in the revenue and volume growth and in the earnings they reported in the third quarter. In fact, the third quarter was a record volume quarter on these assets. 
We firmly believe that the South Carolina PET site is the best in the world, and this transaction reflects the progress that has been made improving the performance of the Carolina asset. So I personally want to thank the employees in Carolina that have shown tireless dedication in improving the performance of this business. And I'm very confident that DAK is well positioned to build on the progress that has been made. In a few minutes, Curt will speak more to the financial implications for Eastman of the transaction.  
Moving next to regional performance on Slide 11. The take away from the slide is probably obvious, it's the balance that we have in our revenue growth around the world. Although North America continues to be our largest region on revenue and earnings basis, we're seeing strong growth in all regions. And this balance is also reflected in regional operating earnings growth year-over-year. We view this balance as the strength of our portfolio that results in more consistent earnings. 
And that brings me to our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 11. While we expect that our sales volume will increase year-over-year, we also expect that it will decline sequentially following the normal seasonal pattern. And as I've said before, we're already starting to see that. We also expect that raw material and energy costs, in particular paraxylene, will increase, which would put pressure on operating margins. As a result, we expect fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50, excluding the $20 million to $25 million of restructuring charges for the cost of severance programs that we announced this week. 
Combining our fourth quarter guidance with EPS from the first nine months leads to an expectation for a record year, our first year ever above $7 this year. And while we are on track to close a very strong year with a solid fourth quarter, we don't feel like we're done, which leads me to the work we've been doing since January to grow our earnings per share in 2011 versus 2010. 
We're not giving 2011 guidance today, but I did want to share some of the headwinds and tailwinds we see for next year. So we have a number of tailwinds that will be helping us, such as the Genovique acquisition, which we completed in April of this year. We'll have the benefit of a full year results from Genovique and we're on track to achieve all the synergies we expected from that. 
We'll also have the benefit of a full year of operation of our Korean facility in the Fibers business. And as we've said previously, the Korean facility came online in the first half of this year, and we expect to have qualified this material with all of our target customers by the end of the year. And our first 30,000-ton Tritan copolyester resin facility should be sold out at the end of the year, about a year ahead of the schedule, and this enables Tritan to approach breakeven in the fourth quarter, where at the beginning of the year, they had about $7 million a quarter of fixed costs that they had to cover. And it fell short and were in the red [ph].
Of course, there's also headwinds. Sustainable global economic recovery is by no means guarantee to any others. There's going to be volatility in our main raw material and energy cost for propane, paraxylene, wood pulp, coal and other raw materials. That's always a risk. And increases to our corporate cost structure, in particular things like the pension expense due to the low interest rates and costs related to the capacity additions we are making are also a headwind. So recognizing these and other tailwinds and headwinds, our objective is to make 2011 EPS greater than 2010, and we take this very seriously.
Now one of the parts I like, I get to turn to, what I call, the executive spotlight. And I'm going to continue the practice of shining the spotlight on an area of the company that I believe had stellar performance during the quarter. 
And given the announcement of signing a definitive agreement to sell our Performance Polymers business, it should come as no surprise that I want to give credit to our Corporate Development team. I mentioned earlier, the employees in the Performance Polymers business and their contribution to this outcome. But specific to the transaction was Curt Espeland's team led by Damon Warmack and Mohit Bhalla, who did an exceptional job. 
Many of you know Damon from his time leading our CASPI business and our PCI business, and he continues to excel in his current role of Strategy and Corporate Development. Mohit Bhalla had investment banking experience before he came to Eastman, and we're now benefiting from his deal savvy as shown by this transaction. Of course, they're supported by a strong team in Corporate Development, Finance and Legal. When I put this outcome together, the sale of our Performance Polymers business with its successful acquisition of Genovique, I have a high degree of confidence that we can execute our inorganic growth strategy to grow the company. 
So thanks again to Curt's team in Corporate Development, and now I'll turn it over to Curt."
109103,113404548,83461,"Eastman Chemical Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I want to start with our 2010 free cash flow expectations on Slide 14. In the third quarter we generated $316 million in operating cash flows and $228 million in free cash flow. This continues to demonstrate our str",1655,"Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I want to start with our 2010 free cash flow expectations on Slide 14. In the third quarter we generated $316 million in operating cash flows and $228 million in free cash flow. This continues to demonstrate our strong earnings performance is translating into significant cash generation. 
From a working capital standpoint, we are seeing good discipline across the company. The majority of the increase in working capital to date has been in receivables, reflecting the improved sales revenue and the change in accounts receivable securitization program that I mentioned earlier in the year. 
In fourth quarter we expect to generate cash from working capital, which is our normal seasonal pattern. Given our strong cash flow generation this year, we have decided to contribute an additional $100 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan beyond the $35 million already made. We are, in essence, accelerating a contribution that might otherwise need to be made next year due to the anticipated low level and discount rate at the year end. This is also a tax efficient use of cash will help offset some of the expected pension headwinds in 2011. 
Our capital expenditures did ramp up in the third quarter, but not to the degree anticipated. Again, this reflects good stewardship of capital dollars in the halls of Eastman. We expect our capital expenditures will be approaching $100 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects our plans to expand capacity in a number of areas that I'll speak to in a minute.
Putting this together, our estimated capital expenditures will be approximately $225 million in 2010. Even with the increase in pension contribution, we continue to expect our free cash flow will be over $300 million for the year. And as a reminder, our free cash flow expectation is net of our strong dividend.
A question we often get, and I expect some of you may have this morning is how we're going to put this cash to work. An answer in that question, it is helpful to see how we have allocated cash in the first nine months of 2010 across the four buckets we've talked previously here on Slide 15. 
In the build bucket, we have spent $133 million of capital expenditures. And as I just mentioned, we expect that ramp-up will occur in fourth quarter and into 2011. I'll talk more about this capacity addition shortly. 
In the joint ventures and acquisitions bucket, we completed the acquisition of Genovique back in May. And in March, we started up the acetate tow facility in Korea that we had acquired from SK. Back in January, we acquired a small specialty polymers manufacturing facility in China to support CASPI segment. 
And our Specialty Plastics business recently entered into a small cellulose diacetate compounding joint venture with a manufacturer, who is also in China. We are looking at several small to medium-sized opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for Eastman. We need bid/ask spreads to tighten some to ensure such transactions provide good value for our shareholders. In addition, we anticipate better quality asset should come in the market as companies become more confident with 2011's economic environment. Until then, we'll continue to be active, but also be patient and disciplined.
In the equity bucket, we have repurchased year-to-date $68 million in shares outstanding primarily to offset dilution. I would anticipate the level of share repurchases to increase in fourth quarter 2010 and going into 2011, in part to offset the additional dilutive effect of stock options in the money resulting from our share price increase or the actual issuance of shares upon exercise of such options. 
And one other matter related to comp-related programs, for tax planning reasons, we are aware that participants in our deferred comp plan are considering early withdrawal of a portion of their deferred pay as allowed under the plan. This could result in a cash payment in the fourth quarter of up to $35 million to participants, including executive officers. Any executive officers who received early payout of the amount in the phantom stock account of the deferred comp plan would complete a Form 4 filing even though it would not involve shares of Eastman stock.
Lastly in the debt and long term liabilities bucket, we will continue to be opportunistic as market conditions evolve. So going forward, you would expect us to continue to be disciplined in allocating across [ph] of both [ph] the best opportunities in each of these buckets just as we demonstrated in the first nine months.
Turning next to the announced capacity additions on Slide 16. The common characteristic of each of these capacity additions is that they are driven by strong demand growth in very attractive markets where Eastman has a competitive advantage. And they all have attractive returns well above our cost of capital. 
Starting with the CHDM capacity addition. CHDM is the monomer used in the manufacture of copolyester for the Specialty Plastics segment. As a reminder Specialty Plastics volume has increased 37% for the first nine months and was at a record level in the second quarter after increasing in sequentially for six straight quarters. We expect the 25% increase in CHDM capacity to be online in two phases with the first in mid-2011 and the second in 2012 to support continued strong growth expectations with core copolyesters.
Next is the Tritan copolyester capacity addition. At the end of 2009, we started up a Tritan monomer facility to support two 30,000 metric ton Tritan resin facilities and then started up the first of those resin facilities. Each resin facility supports new revenue in excess of $100 million. We had expected to sell out [ph] the first resin facility by the end of 2011, but demand has been stronger than we expected, thus we expect it will be now sold out by the end of fourth quarter. As a result, we are adding the second Tritan resin facility and expect that would be online around the end of 2011. 
Also on the Specialty Plastics cellulose triacetate or CTA, which is used in the LCD industry for the manufacture of polarizer films. We had plans back in 2009 to expand CTA capacity that was put on hold due to the recession.
In 2010, we have seen a nice return in demand for CTA and it is expected to be very strong over the next several years with a compound annual growth rate of better than 10%. As a result, we are expanding our CTA capacity by approximately 70% with a new capacity expected to be online in first quarter 2012. We're also expanding our 2-EH capacity along at our Longview, Texas site. This expansion supports our growth efforts in the plasticizers market, particularly with our non-phthalate plasticizers, which are expected to have about a 7% compound annual growth rate for North America and Europe over the next five years. 2-EH is also used as an additive for fuels and lube oils. We have a small debottleneck that will be completed in the fourth quarter this year and an additional expansion expected to be online in mid-2012. 
Lastly, we're once again expanding our Regalite hydrocarbon resin capacity. Regalite is used as a raw material for hot melt and pressure-sensitive adhesives and is also used in non-woven products, such as disposable diapers. We expanded our Middleburg facility 3x since 2006. This expansion will add approximately 20% to current capacity and is expected to be aligned the second half of 2011. Again, these are good uses of cash and will benefit earnings going into 2012.
Next I'll briefly cover the expected financial impact of the PET transaction. First, just to piggyback off of Jim, I'd like to add my thanks to the Corporate Development team and the others who have been working on this transaction over the last several months. 
As I've said in the past, whoever wants to be the market leader in PET in North America would want our IntegRex technology in the South Carolina facility. This has proven to be the case and should provide or be a win-win transaction for both parties. We expect total proceeds will be $600 million before transaction costs with the final price subject to working capital adjustments at closing. 
The transaction will also result in approximately $100 million of payment of taxes to be made shortly after closing. The timing of the payment will depend on the date of the closing so it could be the fourth quarter or could be in the first quarter of 2011. We still expect overall transaction to close before the end of this year. 
As you know, all tax payments are reflected as cash flows from operations, and therefore will impact our free cash flow where made. In addition, we have approved our restructuring plan to address the indirect cost associated with the Performance Polymers business segment. We expect to recognize a charge between $20 million and $25 million in the fourth quarter for severance costs associated with this plan. 
Regarding the potential EPS impact of the transaction on our fourth quarter results, our forecast for Performance Polymers segment results, excluding corporate costs that have previously allocated to the business, is near breakeven. We, therefore, expect that reporting the Performance Polymers results as discontinued operations will have a minimal impact on earnings from continuing operations for the company in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, I'm very pleased to invite you to join us for our 2011 Investor Day in New York City on March 1. We're holding it at Sentry Center, which is conveniently located in Midtown on Third Avenue between 45th and 46th streets. Like our last Investor Day, there will be a presentation from our senior management, and we'll update you on our growth strategies. I look forward to seeing you there, and with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

And then of course, when you set a record price, basically all your options go into money. And so we need to pick up the pace there on the share buyback just to offset dilution. Beyond that, we do have the flexibility to buy back beyond just offsetting dilution, if that looks like our best alternative. But remember, I'm always comparing it to what we see in the other bucket. So we're trying to play that a bit by ear and see if we got better growth opportunities. But, yes, you can expect our share buybacks will pick up, first of all, just to keep up with the new dilution numbers. And then if we want, we could go a little beyond that. On the dividend, of course, I always beg off because that's a board decision. We pay a healthy dividend and that discussion really isn't ripe at this time. But I guess the next time the board looks at it is in December. And we obviously think that returning cash to shareholders is a very valid use of cash and we look at the dividend and we look at share buybacks as our ways to do that.

And as we looked at that, I think that's around 2% or 3% of the market, with the guys who run that business and lady who runs that business, tell me that, that's pretty much just offsetting the loss you've had, the loss of propylene you've had with the world cracking lighter feedstocks, et cetera. So refinery's running less. And I don't see that trend going away. So my guess is you can probably count on that spread between propane and propylene. Of course, it's only a guess, but I think as people have to go to make more propylene on demand versus just getting it the way we've been getting it out of the heavier feedstocks, I think you can count on that spread being there. Will it temporarily move around as capacity comes on? Yes, it probably will. But the other thing I'd like to add is I still feel pretty good about our position. I mean you know we're bringing a cracker back on, it's because we think that [ph] cracker, by the way, has moved from fourth quarter of first quartile cost position just given the low shale gas prices. So I look at our position with where we thought we were going to be shutting crackers down, here we are turning around, opening one up. I know our crackers have a higher percentage propylene comes not only from the fact that feedstock we buy, propane, ethane, we buy a higher propane mix, but it's also just the crackers themselves produced more propylene than say, what might be normal in the industry. So all that stuff bodes well for us. And the final thing I'd like to say when people ask me about that spread is, I think we can count on it, but it doesn't really explain the bulk of PCI's profit. It's really -- PCI has an acetyl stream that's very steady. It has the olefins and oxide derivatives piece, which of course is where a lot of the spread you're talking about gets picked up. But even there, we got strong derivatives. You think about the plasticizers that are growing. So we're making part of the profit on that spread, but we're making probably just as much profit on the derivatives. And then on top of that, you got acetyls and some other things in PCI. So I think I can count on this spread, but PCI is doing a lot better than just what that spread would say."

But shipments in the third quarter away from -- you take away Specialty Plastics, it would appear to me they're above normal market demand. So I'm just wondering how many more months or quarters do you think that Eastman could experience this stellar growth rates on a year-over-year basis. I mean you said that your plants are kind of full out here. You may be kind of limited in how much growth and volume you can have next year. What are your thoughts about that?"

In fact, I was just telling the guys here, I was in the hot tub last night looking up at the stars, expecting a question on have we peaked and is this it and is there anything left?

In fact, I was just telling the guys here, I was in the hot tub last night looking up at the stars, expecting a question on have we peaked and is this it and is there anything left? And I ought to have a good answer for this question because it's been asked for quite a while. I remember back when we were going through the recession and we had cut the bottom off of the trough and we only got down about $3.60 and that surprised people. And they said, well you must have given up the upside. And then we had our Investors Day and we said we think we can do $6 in recovery just on the core businesses alone. And people were asking then, well you must mean that's the peak? And then we came out and said, it looks like we're going to go over $7 and then we said, 2012 we're looking like $8. So I sit back and I say, what are we missing here? And I think one of the things is, I think maybe it's not as relevant anymore to talk trough and peak when you talk Eastman. I'm not saying it's irrelevant, but maybe it's just not as relevant because of all the changes we've made in our portfolio, specifically getting to, do we have any juice left? I was just trying to get to that earlier, when I said, it's not like we ran flat out the whole year. You can go back and look at our first quarter and see that we were lower. We're telling you now, we're coming off again in the third quarter. We've been running hard, but it hasn't been perfect. We had some outages, et cetera. You know that we typically expect capacity creep each year. We've announced the capacity expansions we had on. So I start by thinking, I got growth opportunities just in the core businesses in the existing markets, just getting more capacity online. And then if I try and take an even longer view than that, I think well, but we can also create new businesses. And as we exit PET and we kind of change the nature of the portfolio to where we're starting to look more special, assuming we close by end of year, we're going to be sitting on something between $15, $17 a share of cash depending on what else we do with our cash between now and then, but that's the way it would look today if you did nothing else. And as long as you can generate cash in a business and you're smart about how you put it to work, you can continue the growth. And so I hate it when people try and put us in a box and say, well the existing businesses, running high utilization rates, I guess, you don't have any more juice. As long as we can generate cash, we can."
