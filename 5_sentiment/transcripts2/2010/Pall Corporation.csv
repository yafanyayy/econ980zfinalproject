We appreciate you joining us today to review the second quarter. I'm sitting here with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Michelle, our Corporate Controller. We'll provide some color on the business results",1680,"Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us today to review the second quarter. I'm sitting here with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Michelle, our Corporate Controller. We'll provide some color on the business results and trends, and Lisa will review Pall's   financial performance. Following that, we'll open the line up for questions.Second quarter sales were $560 million, up about 3% on an as-reported basis and down about the same in local currency. Earnings increased almost 28%. Very positive sales mix were augmented by ongoing cost reduction and pricing improvement programs, propelled gross margins.Gross margin improvement in both the quarter and a half was led by Life Sciences with gross margins exceeding 56%. Lisa will cover this in more detail in a few moments.Pall's second quarter sales make it abundantly clear that the economy is still challenging and the pace of recovery, uneven. Life Sciences is performing well lead by Biopharmaceuticals, which is particularly strong. Recovery in Industrial is slower, but we believe that we are seeing positive trends that are indicative of growth for our second half.The most notable green shoot in this past quarter is Microelectronics, one of our most profitable industrial sectors. Power Generation was also strong. We continue to get price increases in both business segments and the markets that were hardest hit throughout 2009, each improved sharply on a sequential basis. The Asian economy outside of Japan has rebounded quite nicely. Total Asian sales increased over 7%, with all but the small eight A&T markets contributing.This return to good health follows four down quarters. Orders grew for the first time in more than a year with strong order growth in Microelectronics, Municipal Water, industrial Manufacturing and Food and Beverage. Orders continued to be strong for Life Sciences. Our book-to-bill in the last quarter was 1.1:1, supporting a growing backlog.Capital spending, which mostly affects our energy, water and process technology markets, is throttling up in many areas. System orders were particularly strong in Muni Water, Pharmaceuticals, and Food and Beverage. The latter two being submarkets where the time between order and shipment is shorter, as of the time until annuities kick in.  Quoting activity is increasing across most of the business. We're expecting a strong finish for the year.Now, let's look at the markets in a little bit more detail. Sales in Life Sciences increased 4% local currency, driven by Biopharm, which posted 8% growth. Sales in Life Sciences were up in all regions with sales in the Western Hemisphere and Asia, each growing over 7.5%. Life Sciences orders were up about 10% in the quarter. Major drivers in Life Sciences remained the same. Increased production of various filtration-dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, along with the growing demand for our single-use processing technologies. We saw the benefits of these trends with a 15% increase in base business, on top of the 16% increase in the base business in the prior quarter, a key driver of the surge in margins in the quarter. Conversely, system sales were down 54%, reflecting an industrywide slowdown in capital spending last year. This is now abating, and we expect higher system sales in the second half of this year based on the current backlog.The Asian pharma market, propelled primarily by China and India, while still relatively small, are steadily growing by double digits. An important trend is emerging. Chinese drug producers are increasingly adopting FDA manufacturing standards, which require drug companies to ensure the safety, purity and efficacy of their products. Any country that wants to export to the U.S., still the largest and most lucrative drug market, must adhere to them. This is resulting in opportunity for global leaders like Pall Corporation.Now our expectations for BioPharm sales growth is in the high-single digits for the year, as the growth rate moderates due to timing of demand within the biotechnology market. Medical sales were down slightly in the quarter. Blood filter sales were up overall, driven by increased adoption of leukocyte reduction in Asia and by modest growth in the large U.S. blood market.Western Hemisphere blood filter sales were up slightly, despite what the blood centers are reporting as decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. Now we believe the fact that we grew, albeit slightly, and despite this drop off with a good indication of market share gains.Approximately 20% of Medical sales in the quarter were from new products, and these higher-margin products made Medical a key contributor to Life Sciences' overall strong profit growth for the quarter. We expect Medical to continue its low-single digit growth for the remainder of this year.Now turning to Industrial. Sales were down 8% in local currency. Asia grew. They were up 7% for the first time after four down quarters, and account just for a little over 37% in Industrial revenues. Sales from the Western Hemisphere and Europe are still down sharply from their highs. Some of this is attributable to timing, and the balance we believe, stems from lingering sector-related softness. On a sequential basis, the signs continue to be more encouraging. Microelectronics sales jumped almost 15% after a four-quarter freefall. Sales were strong in all regions, but especially so in the large Asian and Western Hemisphere markets.The semiconductor side of the Micro-e [Microeletronics] market had rebounded strongly. Now the chip producers are operating at near capacity, they are again investing in tools, and this is triggering good activity at the OEMs as well. The Consumer Electronics side of our markets, largely centered in Asia, is also coming back, in part due to local stimulus programs designed to keep factories going. Orders were up 45% in the quarter, giving good credence to our expectations for a very strong second half.Now turning to Aerospace and Transportation, the situation is essentially unchanged from last quarter. We expect a difficult year, and it's just what we're seeing. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, particularly the regional and private jet sectors. Military Aerospace is down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the U.S. following an extended period of high growth. Sales decreased 27% in the quarter compared to 13% growth last year in Military. Our expectations for a difficult year, primarily relates to $25 million of orders in 2009 that are expected to repeat, but not until 2011.The smaller Transportation piece of the business is one of the markets where we see steadily improvements sequentially. The quarterly drop was just over 7%, as compared to a 22% drop in Q1 and 46% drop at the end of fiscal 2009. Order patterns are starting to return to pre-2009 levels.Now let's look at the Energy, Water & Process and Technologies section now. A broad swath of basic industrial production was down about 10%. Given this result in the quarter, we now expect EWPT to be down mid-single digits for the year. I'll go to the submarkets in the quarter.  Fuels and Chemical has not seen much of a recovery. Q2 sales declined almost 13% as production volumes from our customers, particularly in the refining and chemicals market, remain low. Like capital orders, our long lead time systems last year are having a dampening effect on this as well. The trend is not appreciably improving in this submarket. Several large projects have been delayed or canceled, and orders are up sharply in Europe but down elsewhere.Quoting activity, however, is reasonable. Sales in the sister small-market Power Gen [Power Generation] increased 11%. Growth in Asia was strong, and sales in Asia are being driven by increased manufacturing output and continuing development of the nuclear and wind turbine markets in China. Western Hem [Western Hemisphere] sales were up for the first time in the year.Industrial Manufacturing was down just 2% after four quarters of decline from 19% to 29%. It looks like we're almost out of the woods or bottomed out in this high-margin business. Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 8% in the quarter, but the project pipeline is stronger than it's been in a very long time. We saw a good orders growth in every region. Customers are looking for technologies to bring their production costs down, and as new urgency for productivity enhancements, it's really propelling forward order quoting activity as well as expected strength in the second half. We are winning more of the available business as a result.Municipal Water revenues were down 40%. This is a lumpy business, but one that has consistently delivered good growth over the medium term. This still, has potential. The backlog in this market is up 17% for the year. Activity level improved with orders up 13.5% in the quarter, and our hit rate based on performance is high.We've quoted about $30 million worth of projects and developing our own money, that's the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Stimulus money has the potential to impact EWPT markets more than any other, currently. As we have shared before, it's both a benefit and a source of frustration. The prospect of free money has had the effect of accelerating quoting activity and delaying project implementation today, just as it did last year. But in any case, we remain optimistic about Municipal Water over the next 12 months, and at the flow of our money into actual implementation of projects is starting slowly.Among today's greatest opportunities are Energy and Water-related quality and availability. Regardless of whether the customers need direct supplies and sure, they need quality in environmental standards for developed alternative sources of supply, Pall has an innovative solution. Opportunities to filter water pervades the business. And as capital spending and government stimulus programs move into that execution phase, Pall is well positioned.So although the economy is not yet back to full strength, conditions are improving. We've taken tremendous costs out of the business, particularly in manufacturing operations. And with what we've left in place, particularly a strong base of selling capability in customer support and technology, we are very well poised for the recovery. So with that quick review, let me turn the meeting over to Lisa."

I'll provide a review the financial results for the quarter and the first half.Net earnings in the quarter were $49.6 million or $0.42 per share compared to $38.9 million or $0.33 per share last year. On a pro",1450,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a review the financial results for the quarter and the first half.Net earnings in the quarter were $49.6 million or $0.42 per share compared to $38.9 million or $0.33 per share last year. On a pro forma basis, earnings per share in the second quarter of last year, as defined on Slide 21, was $0.38. Net earnings in the six months were $116.6 million or $0.98 per share compared to almost $82 million or $0.68 per share last year. Earnings per share on a pro forma basis, as defined on the same slide, were $0.82 per share compared to $0.78 per share a year ago. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.06 for the six months. The December 2009 strengthening of the dollar reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.02 compared to our expectation for the quarter. Sales in Pall Industrial, principally in the Energy, Water & Process technologies market fell short of our expectations.Now, I'll discuss the drivers of these results, which is displayed on Slides 15 and 16. As Eric mentioned, sales increased about 3% in the quarter and decreased 1% in the six months. Foreign currency translation added $32.5 million or 6% to our top line in the quarter, primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, pound and Japanese yen as well as the Australian dollar.In the six months, foreign currency translation added about $41 million or 4% to our top line, due again to the weakening of the dollar overall for the period, particularly against the euro. Excluding this impact, sales were down almost 3% in the quarter and 5% in the first six months compared to the same periods in fiscal year 2009. Increased pricing achieved in both the Life Sciences and Industrial segments contributed $3.7 million or 70 basis points to the overall sales change in the quarter and $6.5 million or 60 basis points in the first six months.Gross margins in the second quarter improved 350 basis points to 50.7%. This result principally reflects continued upward momentum in Life Sciences gross margin. Let's take a look at the details. Life Sciences gross margin increase of 680 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reflects the successful execution of three initiatives we have spoken about before. One, cost reductions benefited gross margins by about 350 basis points. Two, pricing, a 2.7% improvement in Biopharmaceuticals pricing added about 50 basis points to Life Sciences gross margins. And three, taking certain Biopharmaceuticals sales direct from distribution contributed approximately another 20 basis points to gross margins.And the balance of the improvement was attributable to favorable product mix. Demand for our high value-added single-use technologies and filtration products in the manufacture of vaccines and biotechnology drugs, showed through in the second quarter of approximately 15% growth in BioPharmaceuticals' consumable sales, again, with similar growth in the first quarter.The sale of fewer, albeit more profitable systems, also have the compounding effect of increasing margins. Looking to our second half, we expect the continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences' gross margins from the sustainability of the three initiatives I just covered. We do not expect to see gross margins to continue at this level. As Eric mentioned, we expect Biopharmaceuticals'  consumable sales to moderate and capital spending to substantially increase compared to the first half.Industrial gross margins increased 70 basis points to 45% in the quarter. The key drivers of the improvement in gross margins in the quarter were a change in mix, estimated to have increased gross margin by about 110 basis points, principally from the increase in Microelectronics sales and reduced capital sales. And these beneficial items were offset by the impact that decreased volume levels has had on Industrial abilities to absorb its manufacturing overheads. Slight pricing improvements and cost reductions have neutralized the impact of inflation. Here again, given significant increase in capital spend we are forecasting for the second half, we expect gross margins to drop a bit compared to the first half. Volume increase year-over-year are expected to contribute to margin improvement year-over-year. Taken together, we expect to be within the company-wide gross margin range provided in December of 48% to 49%.SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 12% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. And excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $1.7 million, SG&A increased quarter-over-quarter by 6%.The increase in SG&A expenses in local currency reflects company-wide inflationary pressures related to employee benefit costs and costs related to investments in information technology infrastructure. Life Sciences spend has also increased due to cost related to the market channel I mentioned a moment ago, acquisition-related costs, as well as money spent to establish the European Life Sciences headquarters in Switzerland.  Industrial cost reductions are mapped by the aforementioned company-wide increases, resulting in SG&A being flat quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.And our second quarter SG&A was up about 5% compared to our first quarter. In particular, this reflects the ramp up of the costs for Switzerland, acquisition cost in the quarter, and spend on our IT infrastructure. We expect spend in our second half to be at about the same level as the first half on higher sales dollars sequentially.Segment profit margins in the quarter were 16.4% compared to 15.6% in the second quarter of last year, as an improvement in Life Sciences' operating margin was offset by a decline in Industrial. For the six months, segment profit margins were 16.3% compared to 16.2%. Again, the improvement in Life Sciences are offset by a decrease in Industrial.  Consolidated operating margin in the quarter improved to 14% from 13.2% last year. But for the six months, operating margin was 14% compared to 3.5% last year. Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as-reported rate for the first half was 20.8%, reflecting a $13 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax audit in the quarter. Excluding discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the six months was 31.6%. Net interest expense in the six months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of $9 million related to the tax audit I just mentioned. Excluding this item, net interest expense decreased by about $4 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of foreign debt in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2009.Turning now to cash flows and liquidity. Operating cash flow in the six months was about $156 million compared to $62 million last year, an increase of $94 million or over 150% improvement. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness, reduced investment in inventories, and improvement in management payables. We have realized a reduction of 14 days on our full cash conversion cycle. Significant use of the cash during the six months included $63 million in capital spending, reflecting increased investment in our IT infrastructure and final costs for our headquarters' renovation, $34 million in dividends to shareholders, which is a 10-plus percent increase year-over-year, $25 million of repurchases of the company's stocks and $9 million for the acquisition of a Biotechnology company during the quarter. Our cash position was $442 million at January 31, 2010, and our net debt to net debt gross equity stood at 19%, down from up about 21.4% at the end of last fiscal year. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain solid. Now turning to earnings guidance. The range of earnings per share guidance we originally provided for your fiscal year 2010, largely rested on assumptions for timing of the recovery in the industrial market. On the low end, the recovery was timed for later in the year and at the high end, possibly as early as our second quarter. Our new earnings per share guidance has an estimated reduction in the benefit of foreign exchange from $0.17 to $0.09, some of which we saw in our second quarter. Subject to this, we have retained the low end of $1.95, and we have revised the high end to $2.05, all of this excluding discrete items. This equates to an expectation of earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.23 in the second half. This does include a $0.03 benefit from foreign exchange and strong sequential growth in Pall Industrial.I'll close by saying that overall, we are pleased with our progress, especially in light of the challenges the economy has presented. Successful execution on key initiatives is clearly showing through in our results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plans. I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

We appreciate you joining us today to review the second quarter. I'm sitting here with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Michelle, our Corporate Controller. We'll provide some color on the business results",1681,"Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us today to review the second quarter. I'm sitting here with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Michelle, our Corporate Controller. We'll provide some color on the business results and trends, and Lisa will review Pall's   financial performance. Following that, we'll open the line up for questions.Second quarter sales were $560 million, up about 3% on an as-reported basis and down about the same in local currency. Earnings increased almost 28%. Very positive sales mix were augmented by ongoing cost reduction and pricing improvement programs, propelled gross margins.Gross margin improvement in both the quarter and a half was led by Life Sciences with gross margins exceeding 56%. Lisa will cover this in more detail in a few moments.Pall's second quarter sales make it abundantly clear that the economy is still challenging and the pace of recovery, uneven. Life Sciences is performing well lead by Biopharmaceuticals, which is particularly strong. Recovery in Industrial is slower, but we believe that we are seeing positive trends that are indicative of growth for our second half.The most notable green shoot in this past quarter is Microelectronics, one of our most profitable industrial sectors. Power Generation was also strong. We continue to get price increases in both business segments and the markets that were hardest hit throughout 2009, each improved sharply on a sequential basis. The Asian economy outside of Japan has rebounded quite nicely. Total Asian sales increased over 7%, with all but the small eight A&T markets contributing.This return to good health follows four down quarters. Orders grew for the first time in more than a year with strong order growth in Microelectronics, Municipal Water, industrial Manufacturing and Food and Beverage. Orders continued to be strong for Life Sciences. Our book-to-bill in the last quarter was 1.1:1, supporting a growing backlog.Capital spending, which mostly affects our energy, water and process technology markets, is throttling up in many areas. System orders were particularly strong in Muni Water, Pharmaceuticals, and Food and Beverage. The latter two being submarkets where the time between order and shipment is shorter, as of the time until annuities kick in.  Quoting activity is increasing across most of the business. We're expecting a strong finish for the year.Now, let's look at the markets in a little bit more detail. Sales in Life Sciences increased 4% local currency, driven by Biopharm, which posted 8% growth. Sales in Life Sciences were up in all regions with sales in the Western Hemisphere and Asia, each growing over 7.5%. Life Sciences orders were up about 10% in the quarter. Major drivers in Life Sciences remained the same. Increased production of various filtration-dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, along with the growing demand for our single-use processing technologies. We saw the benefits of these trends with a 15% increase in base business, on top of the 16% increase in the base business in the prior quarter, a key driver of the surge in margins in the quarter. Conversely, system sales were down 54%, reflecting an industrywide slowdown in capital spending last year. This is now abating, and we expect higher system sales in the second half of this year based on the current backlog.The Asian pharma market, propelled primarily by China and India, while still relatively small, are steadily growing by double digits. An important trend is emerging. Chinese drug producers are increasingly adopting FDA manufacturing standards, which require drug companies to ensure the safety, purity and efficacy of their products. Any country that wants to export to the U.S., still the largest and most lucrative drug market, must adhere to them. This is resulting in opportunity for global leaders like Pall Corporation.Now our expectations for Biopharm sales growth is in the high-single digits for the year, as the growth rate moderates due to timing of demand within the biotechnology market. Medical sales were down slightly in the quarter. Blood filter sales were up overall, driven by increased adoption of leukocyte reduction in Asia and by modest growth in the large U.S. blood market.Western Hemisphere blood filter sales were up slightly, despite what the blood centers are reporting as decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. Now we believe the fact that we grew, albeit slightly, and despite this drop off with a good indication of market share gains.Approximately 20% of Medical sales in the quarter were from new products, and these higher-margin products made Medical a key contributor to Life Sciences' overall strong profit growth for the quarter. We expect Medical to continue its low-single digit growth for the remainder of this year.Now turning to Industrial. Sales were down 8% in local currency. Asia grew. They were up 7% for the first time after four down quarters, and account just for a little over 37% in Industrial revenues. Sales from the Western Hemisphere and Europe are still down sharply from their highs. Some of this is attributable to timing, and the balance we believe, stems from lingering sector-related softness. On a sequential basis, the signs continue to be more encouraging. Microelectronics sales jumped almost 15% after a four-quarter freefall. Sales were strong in all regions, but especially so in the large Asian and Western Hemisphere markets.The semiconductor side of the Micro-e [Microeletronics] market had rebounded strongly. Now the chip producers are operating at near capacity, they are again investing in tools, and this is triggering good activity at the OEMs as well. The Consumer Electronics side of our markets, largely centered in Asia, is also coming back, in part due to local stimulus programs designed to keep factories going. Orders were up 45% in the quarter, giving good credence to our expectations for a very strong second half.Now turning to Aerospace and Transportation, the situation is essentially unchanged from last quarter. We expect a difficult year, and it's just what we're seeing. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, particularly the regional and private jet sectors. Military Aerospace is down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the U.S. following an extended period of high growth. Sales decreased 27% in the quarter compared to 13% growth last year in Military. Our expectations for a difficult year, primarily relates to $25 million of orders in 2009 that are expected to repeat, but not until 2011.The smaller Transportation piece of the business is one of the markets where we see steadily improvements sequentially. The quarterly drop was just over 7%, as compared to a 22% drop in Q1 and 46% drop at the end of fiscal 2009. Order patterns are starting to return to pre-2009 levels.Now let's look at the Energy, Water & Process and Technologies section now. A broad swath of basic industrial production was down about 10%. Given this result in the quarter, we now expect EWPT to be down mid-single digits for the year. I'll go to the submarkets in the quarter.  Fuels and Chemical has not seen much of a recovery. Q2 sales declined almost 13% as production volumes from our customers, particularly in the refining and chemicals market, remain low. Like capital orders, our long lead time systems last year are having a dampening effect on this as well. The trend is not appreciably improving in this submarket. Several large projects have been delayed or canceled, and orders are up sharply in Europe but down elsewhere.Quoting activity, however, is reasonable. Sales in the sister small-market Power Gen [Power Generation] increased 11%. Growth in Asia was strong and sales in Asia are being driven by increased manufacturing output and continuing development of the nuclear and wind turbine markets in China. Western Hem [Western Hemisphere] sales were up for the first time in the year.Industrial Manufacturing was down just 2% after four quarters of decline from 19% to 29%. It looks like we're almost out of the woods or bottomed out in this high-margin business. Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 8% in the quarter, but the project pipeline is stronger than it's been in a very long time. We saw good orders growth in every region. Customers are looking for technologies to bring their production costs down, and as new urgency for productivity enhancements, it's really propelling for order quoting activity as well as expected strength in the second half. We are winning more of the available business as a result.Municipal Water revenues were down 40%. This is a lumpy business, but one that has consistently delivered good growth over the medium term. This still has potential. The backlog in this market is up 17% for the year. Activity level improved with orders up 13½% in the quarter and our hit rate, based on performance, is high.We've quoted about $30 million worth of projects and developing our own money, that's the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Stimulus money has the potential to impact EWPT markets more than any other currently. As we have shared before, it's both a benefit and a source of frustration. The prospect of free money has had the effect of accelerating quoting activity and delaying project implementation today just as it did last year. But in any case, we remain optimistic about Municipal Water over the next 12 months and at the flow of our money into actual implementation of projects is starting slowly.Among today's greatest opportunities are Energy and Water-related quality and availability. Regardless of whether the customers need direct supplies, I'm sure they need quality and environmental standards for developed alternative sources of supply, Pall has an innovative solution. Opportunities to filter water pervades the business. And as capital spending and government stimulus programs move into that execution phase, Pall is well positioned.So although the economy is not yet back to full strength, conditions are improving. We've taken tremendous costs out of the business and particularly, in manufacturing operations. And with what we've left in place and particularly, a strong base of selling capability in customer support and technology, we are very well poised for the recovery. So with that quick review, let me turn the meeting over to Lisa."
185333,98957417,53526,"Pall Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Mar 12, 2010",2010-03-12,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a review of the financial results for the quarter and first half.Net earnings in the quarter were $49.6 million or $0.42 per share compared to $38.9 million or $0.33 per share last year. On a pro f",1452,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a review of the financial results for the quarter and first half.Net earnings in the quarter were $49.6 million or $0.42 per share compared to $38.9 million or $0.33 per share last year. On a pro forma basis, earnings per share in the second quarter of last year, as defined on Slide 21, was $0.38. Net earnings in the six months were $116.6 million or $0.98 per share compared to almost $82 million or $0.68 per share last year. Earnings per share on a pro forma basis, as defined on the same slide, were $0.82 per share compared to $0.78 per share a year ago. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.06 for the six months. The December 2009 strengthening of the dollar reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.02 compared to our expectation for the quarter. Sales in Pall Industrial, principally in the Energy, Water & Process technologies market fell short of our expectations.Now I'll discuss the drivers of these results, which is displayed on Slides 15 and 16. As Eric mentioned, sales increased about 3% in the quarter and decreased 1% in the six months. Foreign currency translation added $32.5 million or 6% to our top line in the quarter, primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, pound and Japanese yen as well as the Australian dollar.In the six months, foreign currency translation added about $41 million or 4% to our top line, due again to the weakening of the dollar overall for the period, particularly against the euro. Excluding this impact, sales were down almost 3% in the quarter and 5% in the first six months compared to the same period in fiscal year 2009. Increased pricing achieved in both the Life Sciences and Industrial segments contributed $3.7 million or 70 basis points to the overall sales change in the quarter and $6.5 million or 60 basis points in the first six months.Gross margins in the second quarter improved 350 basis points to 50.7%. This result principally reflects continued upward momentum in Life Sciences gross margin. Let's take a look at the details. Life Sciences gross margin increase of 680 basis points quarter-over-quarter reflects the successful execution of three initiatives we have spoken about before. One, cost reductions benefited gross margins by about 350 basis points. Two, pricing, a 2.7% improvement in Biopharmaceuticals pricing added about 50 basis points to Life Sciences gross margins. And three, taking certain Biopharmaceutical sales direct from distribution contributed approximately another 20 basis points to gross margins.And the balance of the improvement was attributable to favorable product mix. Demand for our high value-added single-use technologies and filtration products in the manufacture of vaccines and biotechnology drugs showed through in the second quarter of approximately 15% growth in Biopharmaceuticals' consumable sales, again, with similar growth in the first quarter.The sale of fewer, albeit more profitable systems also have the compounding effect of increasing margins. Looking to our second half, we expect the continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences' gross margins from the sustainability of the three initiatives I just covered. We do not expect to see gross margins to continue at this level. As Eric mentioned, we expect Biopharmaceuticals' consumable sales to moderate and capital spending to substantially increase compared to the first half.Industrial gross margins increased 70 basis points to 45% in the quarter. The key drivers of the improvement in gross margins in the quarter were a change in mix, estimated to have increased gross margin by about 110 basis points, principally from the increase in Microelectronic sales and reduced capital sales. And these beneficial items were offset by the impact that decreased volume levels has had on Industrial abilities to absorb its manufacturing overhead. Slight pricing improvements and cost reductions have neutralized the impact of inflation. Here again, given significant increase in capital spend, we are forecasting for the second half. We expect gross margins to drop a bit compared to the first half. Volume increase year-over-year are expected to contribute to margin improvement year-over-year. Taken together, we expect to be within the company-wide gross margin range provided in December of 48% to 49%.SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 12% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. And excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $9.7 million, SG&A increased quarter-over-quarter by 6%.The increase in SG&A expenses in local currency reflects company-wide inflationary pressures related to employee benefit costs and costs related to investments in information technology infrastructure. Life Sciences spend has also increased due to cost related to the market channel I mentioned a moment ago, acquisition-related costs, as well as money spent to establish the European Life Sciences headquarters in Switzerland.  Industrial cost reductions are mapped by the aforementioned company-wide increases, resulting in SG&A being flat quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.And our second quarter SG&A was up about 5% compared to our first quarter. In particular, this reflects the ramp up of the costs for Switzerland, acquisition cost in the quarter, and the spend on our IT infrastructure. We expect spend in our second half to be at about the same level as the first half on higher sales dollars sequentially.Segment profit margins in the quarter were 16.4% compared to 15.6% in the second quarter of last year, as an improvement in Life Sciences' operating margin was offset by a decline in Industrial. For the six months, segment profit margins were 16.3% compared to 16.2%. Again, the improvement in Life Sciences are offset by a decrease in Industrial.  Consolidated operating margin in the quarter improved to 14% from 13.2% last year. But for the six months, operating margin was 14% compared to 3½% last year. Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as-reported rate for the first half was 20.8%, reflecting a $13 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax audit in the first quarter. Excluding discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the six months was 31.6%. Net interest expense in the six months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of $9 million related to the tax audit I just mentioned. Excluding this item, net interest expense decreased by about $4 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of foreign debt in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2009.Turning now to cash flows and liquidity. Operating cash flow in the six months was about $156 million compared to $62 million last year, an increase of $94 million or over 150% improvement. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness, reduced investment in inventories and improvement in management payables. We have realized a reduction of 14 days on our full cash conversion cycle. Significant use of the cash during the six months included $63 million in capital spending, reflecting increased investment in our IT infrastructure and final costs for our headquarters' renovation, $34 million in dividends to shareholders, which is a 10-plus percent increase year-over-year, $25 million of repurchases of the company's stocks and $9 million for the acquisition of a Biotechnology company during the quarter. Our cash position was $442 million at January 31, 2010, and our net debt to net debt gross equity stood at 19%, down from up about 21.4% at the end of last fiscal year. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain solid. Now turning to earnings guidance. The range of earnings per share guidance we originally provided for your fiscal year 2010, largely rested on assumptions for timing of the recovery in the industrial market. On the low end, the recovery was timed for later in the year and at the high end, possibly as early as our second quarter. Our new earnings per share guidance has an estimated reduction in the benefit of foreign exchange from $0.17 to $0.09, some of which we saw in our second quarter. Subject to this, we have retained the low end of $1.95, and we have revised the high end to $2.05, all of this excluding discrete items. This equates to an expectation of earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.23 in the second half. This does include a $0.03 benefit from foreign exchange and strong sequential growth in Pall Industrial.I'll close by saying that overall, we are pleased with our progress, especially in light of the challenges the economy has presented. Successful execution on key initiatives is clearly showing through in our results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plans. I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

Pall's strong financial position continues to improve as you've heard, including working capital on the cash conversion cycle. And Pall has a solid track record of reducing global footprint, managing expenses, and executing on lean manufacturing initiatives. Life Science continues to look solid, and while the investor recovery is slower than we would've hoped, we are seeing across those markets, with the exception of Aerospace & Transportation, many positive signs. And more importantly, the business drivers for Pall remain compelling. Filtration support lower operating costs for customers, enabling technology for innovative products and processes, the reduction of hospital-acquired infections and improved medical outcomes, environmentalism, which drive applications across our markets. And with the compelling market drivers' broad capabilities, strong customer relationships and a proven track record, we remain very confident in delivering sustainable profitable growth.

It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschel",1604,"Thank you very much, and good morning. It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 
As you saw from last evening's press release, Pall's third quarter results was a solid step toward meeting our year-end guidance. We'll review some of the details and drivers. We'll also provide our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2010. And of course, there'll be lots of time for your questions at the end. 
Third quarter sales were $616 million, and this is an increase of 11% on an as-reported basis over last year and close to 6% in local currency. Life Sciences grew over 6% in local currency. Industrial turned the corner in the third quarter, growing 5% and is delivering the strongest second half that we expected. The spreading recovery in our Industrial markets delivers well for a good close for 2010 and for a solid 2011. This was a quarter of achievement in Pall Industrial, culminating in almost $57 million in profit in the quarter, 88% more than the operating profit in the second quarter.
Our Microelectronics business shifted into high gear, with sales up 77% and order is equally strong. We also saw the recovery begin to spread in other Industrial markets, with revenues up sharply in all three Pall markets that were particularly hard hit by the recession; and they are, in addition to Microelectronics, Industrial Manufacturing and Transportation. On a geographic basis, sales grew in both the Industrial and the Life Sciences segments in all three of our geographies. Overall growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia was 7%, and sales in Europe increased 4%.
Our focus on increasing productivity and reducing costs continues to show through, with gross margin increasing all year despite earlier pressure on the top line. Increased volume and especially solid growth in our three highest margin markets provided lift in the quarter. We do expect a large fourth quarter for system shipments and for gross margins to come down a bit in response.
At the end of the second quarter, we reported that orders turned positive and were up almost 5%. Now in the third quarter, orders jumped up 27% overall. They were up sharply in all regions, including Europe, which was up 22%; the Western Hemisphere up 30%; and Asia orders up 32%. On the Industrial side of the business, orders increased 47% and reflected increasing capacity utilization in investment the customers. Orders grew double digits in all Industrial submarkets, except Aerospace. Now let's look at those markets with a little more detail.
The 6% local currency sales increase in Life Sciences was driven by BioPharm, which grew more than 12%. Sales were up in Life Sciences in all regions, led by the Western Hemisphere at 8%; Europe, up 6%; and Asia, up 5%. Many major drivers in BioPharm continue to be the increased production of filtration-dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, including for H1N1, and expanding consumption of our single-use products. The plasma market has slowed compared to last year, and that is reflected in our numbers. Even so, base business in BioPharm grew 13%, continuing the healthy double-digit trend reported all year: 15% in the second quarter; and if you remember, 16% up in the first quarter.
Increasing adoption of some of Pall's newer high-value products continues to drive Life Sciences gross margins, which increased 330 basis points in the quarter. System sales were up 6% and are expected to be about 20% in Q4, which is an unusually high amount. Within BioPharm, lab sales were strong. Some of this is restocking, but it also reflects the strengthening of the end markets worldwide. Consistent with our earlier guidance, our expectation for BioPharm sales growth, single high digits for the year.
Medical sales were down almost 2% in the quarter, as were Blood Filter sales. A reduction in blood transfusions, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., helped growth down. This is the same situation as last quarter, decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. We still grew in the Western Hemisphere, albeit slightly, in spite of the drop-off in blood collection. Sales in Asia continue to ramp up and represents the largest potential for our future growth.
Medical OEM sales in Europe grew 10% for the second quarter in a row due to increasing sales to some of the largest medical diagnostics and device manufacturers in the world. Sales in Asia were also strong.
Approximately 30% of Medical sales in the quarter and nine months are from new products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a key component of Life Sciences' strong profit growth. We expect Medical sales to be about flat for the year, consistent with Q2 guidance.
Now let's switch gears and look at Pall Industrial. This business has returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 5% in local currency. Sales were up in all regions, led by Asia, up 7%; the Western Hemisphere increased 6%; and Europe at 2%. Microelectronics took off in the quarter with sales up over 77%. The recovery was broad in all regions and key segments of this diverse market, from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics such as flat panel displays and printers, and to new opportunities, including the emerging high-bright LED market [high-brightness LED market].
Growth in MicroE shows no signs of abating based on our current order book, and we expect it would exceed earlier projections for the year, coming in at growth in excess of 15%. While MicroE was clearly the lead dog pulling the Industrial sled in the quarter, we saw evidence the recovery is spreading.
I already covered orders in some detail, but it bears repeating. Orders in Industrial were up 47%, up double digits in every market except Aerospace. Orders are up 55% in our Energy, Water & Process Technologies group. This is the most systems-intensive part of the business, so we would expect to see these orders shipped over approximately the next 18 months. Looking at the third quarter, sales in EWPT were down slightly, and our expectation for the year is a mid single-digit decline. Power Generation and Industrial Manufacturing sales grew 11% and 21%, respectively.
Most of the growth in Power Gen came from Asia, now the largest region for us in the submarket, and in particular, from the fast-growing wind turbine market in China. Orders from the Western Hemisphere have almost doubled from the third quarter of last year and include orders for two nuclear power plants planned in this country. The growth in Industrial Manufacturing was robust in all regions and largely driven by the mining and mobile equipment industries, and that had a positive impact on gross margin.
Sales in Fuels & Chemicals, which is the largest of the EWPT markets, were down 8% in the quarter. The good news is that orders increased 84%. This includes a number of capital projects, including a $25 million order for a system going in as refinery in the Middle East, and it also reflects increasing production and some restockings to support demand. 
Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 4% in the quarter as system sales were down sharply. This reflects a decreased capital spending from last year and in the first quarter of calendar year 2010. But there's also good news here. Base business was up almost 7%. This is the first quarter of growth in consumables for Food and Beverage in seven quarters and suggest increasing production levels. Q3 orders for both base and systems in Food and Beverage were strong. 
Now as we announced last evening, we are transferring our Food and Beverage group into Life Sciences effective for this fourth quarter. The Food and Beverage market is being drawn ever closer to the BioPharmaceuticals world, with growing requirements for testing to identify disease and spoilage organism and a tightening regulatory environment focused on public health and manufacturing practices.
Now finally, we'll round out our report on EWPT with Municipal Water, where sales were down 13%. This was a customer timing issue. The backlog in this market is up 58% for the year, and we're expecting a record fourth quarter. Orders are up over 200%, and we will note that some projects are being slowed down due to funding issues in Europe.
Finally, Aerospace & Transportation, which is tracking expectations. We expected a difficult year from the outset, and difficult is the right description. The Commercial and Military submarket sales decreased 24% and 18%, respectively. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, and particularly, the regional and private jet sectors. Military Aero is down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the U.S., following an extended period of high growth. Our expectations for a difficult year were also predicated on tough 2009 comps, including about $25 million of sales in '09 that are expected to repeat, but not until 2011.
The smaller Transportation submarket turned positive for the first time in over a year, with sales up 19%. Orders here were also strong in the quarter. 
And so in summary, Life Sciences continues to show its resiliency, several important Industrial markets revived in the quarter and anticipated Industrial recovery began to spread across markets and regions. Improving business trends enabled Pall's ongoing productivity and cost reduction programs to add leverage. The end result, a strong Q3. 
And so with that, Lisa will now speak and review the financial details."
185333,106629407,64809,"Pall Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2010",2010-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $44.2 million, or $0.37 per share, l",1303,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $44.2 million, or $0.37 per share, last year. Earnings per share on a pro-forma basis, as defined on Slide 20, were also $0.58 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 38%. In the nine months, net earnings were $186.3 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $126.1 million, or $1.05 per share, last year. Earnings per share on a pro-forma basis were $1.40 compared to $1.20 a year ago, an increase of almost 17%. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.10 for the nine months. Now I'll discuss the drivers of these results, which are displayed on Slides 15 and 16.
Sales increased almost 11% in the quarter and 3% in the nine months. Foreign currency translation added $28.6 million, or 5%, to our top line in the quarter and about $70 million, or 4%, in the nine months. This was primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
Excluding this impact, sales increased almost 6% in the quarter and decreased about 1% in the nine months compared to the same periods in 2009. The impact of pricing was negligible in the quarter as an improvement in Life Sciences was largely offset by a decline in the Industrial business. In the nine months, increased pricing contributed $7 million to sales overall, again, attributable to an improvement in life sciences, while pricing in Industrial was flat.
In our fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of mid single digits overall and from both businesses. With the euro at about 1.2 to the dollar, a 14% deterioration compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and with about 30% of our sales derived from the eurozone, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact the sales growth by approximately 3%.
Gross margins in the third quarter improved 340 basis points to 50.9%. So this is at about the midpoint of our 2013 goal. This result reflects continued upward momentum in both Life Sciences and in Industrial. Let's take a look at each of the businesses.
Life Sciences gross margin continued its upward momentum, up 330 basis points, reaching 56%. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margins continued this quarter. Favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead due to increased volume and the estimated benefit of cost savings initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations that outpaced inflation, contributed approximately 200 to 230 basis points in margin. Increase in pricing in BioPharmaceuticals market, as well as the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct, contributed an estimated 40 basis points in margin. And finally, mix is estimated to have increased gross margin by about 50 basis points, primarily driven by growth in higher margin pharma consumable sales.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences gross margin, given the sustainability of cost reductions. As expected, Life Sciences gross margins in the second half are coming in lower than the first half as capital sales at lower margins have a downward impact.
Turning a cornerstone were Industrial gross margins, which increased 340 basis points to 47.1% in the quarter. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margin in the quarter were volume increases, driven by sales growth, particularly in Microelectronics; and the beneficial impact attendant to this mix change, increasing gross margins by approximately 260 to 280 basis points; and the estimated benefit of cost savings, net of inflation, from Pall Industrial's Manufacturing operations, which contributed an estimated 80 to 100 basis points in margin.
In the fourth quarter, we also expect Industrial gross margins to decrease sequentially given an expected increase in systems sales. So full year gross margin on a consolidated basis is now expected to exceed the high end of our full year estimate of 49%.
SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $8 million, the increase was 6%. This increase reflects the impact of strategic and infrastructure investments we've been making to position Pall to achieve our longer-term top and bottom line targets. They include: cost of the European consolidation in Switzerland, investments in information technology, geographic expansion in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Asia and cost associated with the acquisitions of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. Approximately half, or 3%, of the increase in SG&A in the quarter relates to these investments, with the remainder attributable to inflationary items, partly offset by cost reductions.
Compared to our second quarter, SG&A spend was flat, dropping to 30.4% of sales from 33.4%. We expect full year SG&A to be at about 31% of sales. Segment profit margins grew by 280 basis points to 19.5% in the quarter compared to 16.7% in the third quarter of last year, driven by improvements in both Life Sciences and Industrial operating margins. For the nine months, segment profit margins were 17.5% compared to 16.4% as improvement in Life Sciences was partly offset by a decrease in Industrial.
Consolidated operating margin in the quarter rose to 17.4%. This represents the highest achievement spanning a number of years. For the nine months, consolidated operating margin was 15.2% compared to 13.8% last year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or as-reported rate, for the nine months was 25.2%, reflecting a $16 million benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax audits this year. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the nine months was about 31%. 
Net interest expense in the nine months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the tax audits I just mentioned. Excluding these items, net interest expense has decreased by almost $5 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of higher rate foreign debt last year and the impact of lowered interest rates.
Turning now to cash flows and liquidity, operating cash flow in the nine months was about $257 million. This is compared to about $155 million last year, an increase of over $100 million or about 66%. It reflects the increase in net earnings, including reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness and reduced investments in inventories and improvement in receivables and payables. We have realized a reduction of 24 days in our full cash conversion cycle.
Significant uses of cash during the nine months included $93.5 million in capital spending; $53 million in dividends to shareholders, a 10% increase year-over-year; $36 million to repurchase the company's common stock; and about $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and for certain distribution rights. Our cash position was $484 million at April 30, and our net debt to net debt plus equity stood at 16.6%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009.
Looking at fourth quarter earnings expectations, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.03. Including this, our updated estimate is a $0.07 full year benefit from foreign exchange, down $0.02 from our previous estimate. That said, we now expect full year earnings per share to be at the high end of the range of our previous guidance of $1.95 to $2.05, excluding discrete items.
So I'll close by saying that we are pleased with our results this quarter. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results, from the top line to the bottom line and in cash generation. Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

It’s a pleasure to share Pall’s third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I’m here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer, and Frank Mo",1606,"Thank you very much and good morning. It’s a pleasure to share Pall’s third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I’m here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer, and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
As you saw from last evening’s press release, Pall’s third quarter results were a solid step toward meeting our year-end guidance. We will review some of the details and drivers. We will also provide our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2010. And of course, there will be lots of time for your questions at the end.
Third quarter sales were $616 million, and this is an increase of 11% on an as-reported basis over last year and close to 6% in local currency. Life Sciences grew over 6% in local currency. Industrial turned the corner in the third quarter growing 5% and delivering the stronger second half that we expected. The spreading recovery in our industrial markets goes well for a good close for 2010 and for a solid 2011. This is a quarter of achievement in Pall Industrial, culminating in almost $57 million in profit in the quarter, 88% more than the operating profit in the second quarter.
Our Microelectronics business shifted into high gear with sales up 77% and orders equally strong. We also saw the recovery begin to spread in other industrial markets, with revenues up sharply in all three core markets that we are particularly hard hit by the recession. And they are, in addition to Microelectronics, Industrial Manufacturing and Transportation.
On a geographic basis, sales grew in both the Industrial and the Life Sciences segments in all three of our geographies. Overall growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia was 7%, and sales in Europe increased 4%. Our focus on increasing productivity and reducing costs continues to show through, with gross margin increasing all year despite earlier pressure on the top-line. Increased volume and especially solid growth in our three highest margin markets provided lift in the quarter. We do expect the large fourth quarter for system shipments and for gross margins to come down a bit in response.
At the end of the second quarter, we reported that orders turned positive and were up almost 5%. Now in the third quarter, orders jumped up 27% overall. They were up sharply in all regions, including Europe, which was up 22%, the Western Hemisphere up 30%, and Asia orders up 32%. On the Industrial side of the business, orders increased 47% and reflects an increasing capacity utilization and investment by customers. Orders grew double digits in all Industrial submarkets except Aerospace.
Now let’s look at those markets in little more detail. The 6% local currency sales increase in Life Sciences was driven by BioPharm, which grew more than 12%. Sales were up in Life Sciences in all regions, led by the Western Hemisphere at 8%, Europe up 6%, and Asia up 5%. Many major drivers in BioPharm continue to be the increased production of filtration dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, including for H1N1, and expanding consumption of our single-use products.
The plasma market has slowed compared to last year, and that is reflected in our numbers. Even so, base business in BioPharm grew 13%, continuing the healthy double-digit trend reported all year; 15% in the second quarter, and if you remember, 16% up in the first quarter. Increasing adoption of some of Pall’s newer high value products continues to drive Life Science gross margins, which increased 330 basis points in the quarter. System sales were up 6% and are expected to be about 20% in Q4, which is an unusually high amount.
Within BioPharm, lab sales were strong. Some of this is restocking, but it also reflects the strengthening of the end markets worldwide. Consistent with our earlier guidance, our expectation for BioPharm sales growth is single-high digits for the year. Medical sales were down almost 2% in the quarter as for blood filter sales.
A reduction in blood transfusions, particularly in the US and UK, held growth down. This is the same situation as last quarter. Decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. We still grew in the Western Hemisphere albeit slightly in spite of the drop-off in blood collection. Sales in Asia continue to ramp up and represent the largest potential for our future growth.
Medical OEM sales in Europe grew 10% for the second quarter in a row due to increasing sales to some of the largest medical diagnostics and device manufacturers in the world. Sales in Asia were also strong. Approximately 30% of Medical sales in the quarter and nine months are from new products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a key component of Life Sciences’ strong profit growth. We expect Medical sales to be about flat for the year, consistent with Q2 guidance.
I’ll switch gears and look at Pall Industrial. This business has returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 5% in local currency. Sales were up in all regions, led by Asia up 7%, the Western Hemisphere increased 6%, and Europe at 2%. Microelectronics took off in the quarter, with sales up over 77%.
The recovery was broad in all regions and key segments of this diverse market from chip production for the OEM to supply the industry, consumer electronics such as flat panel displays and printers and to new opportunities including the emerging high bright LED market. Growth in MicroE [ph] shows no signs of abating based on our current order book, and we expect it to exceed earlier projections for the year, coming in a growth in excess of 15%. MicroE was clearly the lead dog pulling the Industrial sled in the quarter. We saw evidence the recovery is spreading.
I already covered orders in some detail, but it bears repeating. Orders in Industrial were up 47%, up double digits in every market except Aerospace. Orders are up 55% in our Energy, Water & Process Technologies group. This is the most systems intensive part of the business. So we would expect to see these orders ship over approximately the next 18 months.
Looking at the third quarter, sales in EWPT were down slightly and our expectation for the year is a mid-single digit decline. Power Generation and Industrial Manufacturing sales grew 11% and 21% respectively. Most of the growth in Power Gen came from Asia, now the largest region for us in this submarket, and in particular, from the fast-growing wind turbine market in China. Orders from the Western Hemisphere have almost doubled from the third quarter of last year and include orders for two new nuclear power plants planned in this country.
The growth in Industrial Manufacturing was robust in all regions and largely driven by the mining and mobile equipment industries and that had a positive impact on gross margin. Sales in Fuels and Chemicals, which is the largest of the EWPT markets, were down 8% in the quarter. The good news is that orders increased 84%. This includes a number of capital projects, including a $25 million order for a system going as refinery in the Middle East. And it also reflects increasing production in some restocking to support demand.
Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 4% in the quarter, as system sales were down sharply. This reflects a decreased capital spending from last year and in the first quarter of calendar year 2010. But there is also good news here. Base business was up almost 7%. This is the first quarter of growth in consumables for Food and Beverage in seven quarters (inaudible) increasing production levels. Q3 orders for both base and systems in Food and Beverage were strong.
Now, as we announced last evening, we are transferring our Food and Beverage into Life Sciences effective with this fourth quarter. The food and beverage market is being drawn ever closer to the biopharmaceuticals world. With growing requirements for testing to identify disease and spoilage organisms and a tightening regulatory environment focused on public health and manufacturing practices.
Now finally, we’ll round out our report on EWPT with units above water, where sales were down 13%. This is a customer timing issue. The backlog in this market is up 58% for the year and we are expecting a record fourth quarter. Orders are up over 200%. And we will note that some projects are being slowed down due to funding issues in Europe.
Finally, Aerospace and Transportation, which is tracking expectations, we expected a difficult year from the outset and difficult is the right description. The Commercial and Military submarket sales decreased 24% and 18% respectively. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, particularly the regional and private jet sectors.
Military aero was down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the US, following an extended period of high growth. Our expectations for a difficult year were also predicated on tough 2009 comps, including about $25 million of sales in ’09 that are expected to repeat but not until 2011. The smaller Transportation submarket turned positive for the first time in over a year, with sales up 19%. Orders here were also strong this quarter.
And so in summary, Life Sciences continues to show its resiliency, several important industrial markets revived in the quarter, and we anticipate an industrial recovery began to spread across markets and regions. Improving business trends enabled Pall’s ongoing productivity and cost reduction programs to add leverage. The end result, a strong Q3.
And so with that, Lisa will now speak and review the financial details.

185333,106629407,64812,"Pall Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2010",2010-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let’s review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million or $0.58 per share compared to $44.2 million or $0.37 per share last",1305,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let’s review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million or $0.58 per share compared to $44.2 million or $0.37 per share last year. Earnings per share on a pro forma basis, as defined on slide 20, were also $0.58 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 38%.
In the nine months, net earnings were $186.3 million or $1.56 per share compared to $126.1 million or $1.05 per share last year. Earnings per share on a pro forma basis were $1.40 compared to $1.20 a year ago, an increase of almost 17%. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.10 for the nine months.
Now I’ll discuss the drivers of these results, which are displayed on slides 15 and 16. Sales increased almost 11% in the quarter and 3% in the nine months. Foreign currency translation added $28.6 million or 5% to our top line in the quarter and about $70 million or 4% in the nine months. This was primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.
Excluding this impact, sales increased almost 6% in the quarter and decreased about 1% in the nine months compared to the same periods in 2009. The impact of pricing was negligible in the quarter, as an improvement in Life Sciences was largely offset by a decline in the Industrial business. In the nine months, increased pricing contributed $7 million to sales overall, again attributable to an improvement in Life Sciences while pricing in Industrial was flat.
In our fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-single digits overall and from both businesses. With the euro at about 1.2 to the dollar, a 14% deterioration compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and with about 30% of our sales derived from the Euro zone, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact the sales growth by approximately 3%.
Gross margins in the third quarter improved 340 basis points to 50.9%. So this is at about the midpoint of our 2013 goal. This result reflects continued upward momentum in both Life Sciences and in Industrial.
Let’s take a look at each of the businesses. Life Sciences gross margin continued its upward momentum of 330 basis points, reaching 56%. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margins continued this quarter. Favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead due to increased volume and the estimated benefit of cost savings initiatives, including improved deficiency and manufacturing operations that outpaced inflation, contributed approximately 200 to 230 basis points in margin.
Increase in pricing in biopharmaceuticals market as well as the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct contributed an estimated 40 basis points in margin and finally mixed as estimated to have increased gross margin by about 50 basis points, primarily driven by growth in higher margin pharma consumable sales.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences gross margin, given the sustainability of cost reductions. As expected, Life Sciences gross margins in the second half are coming in lower than the first half as capital sale at lower margins has a downward impact, turning a cornerstone with Industrial gross margin, which increased 340 basis points to 47.1% in the quarter.
Key drivers of the improvement in gross margin in the quarter were volume increases driven by sales growth, particularly in Microelectronics and the beneficial impact attended to this mix change, increasing gross margin by approximately 260 to 280 basis points and the estimated benefit of cost savings, net of inflation from Pall Industrial’s manufacturing operations, which contributed an estimated 80 to 100 basis points in margin.
In the fourth quarter, we also expect Industrial gross margin to decrease sequentially, given an expected increase in system sales. So full year gross margin on a consolidated basis is now expected to exceed the high end of our full year estimate of 49%.
SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $8 million, the increase was 6%. This increase reflects the impact of strategic and infrastructure investments we’ve been making to position Pall to achieve our longer term top and bottom line targets.
They include cost of the European consolidation in Switzerland, investments in information technology, geographic expansion in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Asia, and cost associated with the acquisition of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. Approximately half or 3% of the increase in SG&A in the quarter relates to these investments, with the remainder attributable to inflationary items, partly offset by cost reductions. Compared to our second quarter, SG&A spend was flat, dropping to 30.4% of sales from 33.4%. We expect full year SG&A to be at about 31% of sales.
Segment profit margins grew by 280 basis points to 19.5% in the quarter compared to 16.7% in the third quarter of last year, driven by improvements in both Life Sciences and Industrial operating margins. For the nine months, segment profit margins were 17.5% compared to 16.4%, as improvement in Life Sciences was partly offset by a decrease in Industrial.
Consolidated operating margin in the quarter rose to 17.4%. This represents the highest achievement, spanning a number of years. For the nine months, consolidated operating margin was 15.2% compared to 13.8% last year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the nine months was 25.2%, reflecting a $16 million benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax audits this year. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the nine months was about 31%.
Net interest expense in the nine months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the tax audits I just mentioned. Excluding these items, net interest expense has decreased by almost $5 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of higher rate foreign debt last year and the impact of lowered interest rates.
Turning now to cash flows and liquidity, operating cash flow in the nine months was about $257 million. This is compared to about $155 million last year, an increase of over $100 million or about 66%. It reflects the increase in net earnings, including reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness and reduced investments in inventories and improvement in receivables and payables. We have realized a reduction of 24 days in our full cash conversion cycle.
Significant uses of cash during the nine months included $93.5 million in capital spending; $53 million in dividends to shareholders, a 10% increase year-over-year; $36 million to repurchase the company’s common stock; and about $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and for certain distribution rights. Our cash position was $484 million at April 30, and our net debt to net debt plus equity stood at 16.6%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009.
Looking at fourth quarter earnings expectations, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.03. Including this, our updated estimate is a $0.07 full year benefit from foreign exchange, down $0.02 from our previous estimate. That said, we now expect full year earnings per share to be at the high end of the range of our previous guidance of $1.95 to $2.05, excluding discrete items.
I’ll close by saying that we are pleased with our results this quarter. We see this successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results from the top-line to the bottom line and in cash generation.
Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I’ll hand this back to Eric.

It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschel",1604,"Thank you very much, and good morning. It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 
As you saw from last evening's press release, Pall's third quarter results was a solid step toward meeting our year-end guidance. We'll review some of the details and drivers. We'll also provide our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2010. And of course, there'll be lots of time for your questions at the end. 
Third quarter sales were $616 million, and this is an increase of 11% on an as-reported basis over last year and close to 6% in local currency. Life Sciences grew over 6% in local currency. Industrial turned the corner in the third quarter, growing 5% and is delivering the strongest second half that we expected. The spreading recovery in our Industrial markets delivers well for a good close for 2010 and for a solid 2011. This was a quarter of achievement in Pall Industrial, culminating in almost $57 million in profit in the quarter, 88% more than the operating profit in the second quarter.
Our Microelectronics business shifted into high gear, with sales up 77% and order is equally strong. We also saw the recovery begin to spread in other Industrial markets, with revenues up sharply in all three Pall markets that were particularly hard hit by the recession; and they are, in addition to Microelectronics, Industrial Manufacturing and Transportation. On a geographic basis, sales grew in both the Industrial and the Life Sciences segments in all three of our geographies. Overall growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia was 7%, and sales in Europe increased 4%.
Our focus on increasing productivity and reducing costs continues to show through, with gross margin increasing all year despite earlier pressure on the top line. Increased volume and especially solid growth in our three highest margin markets provided lift in the quarter. We do expect a large fourth quarter for system shipments and for gross margins to come down a bit in response.
At the end of the second quarter, we reported that orders turned positive and were up almost 5%. Now in the third quarter, orders jumped up 27% overall. They were up sharply in all regions, including Europe, which was up 22%; the Western Hemisphere up 30%; and Asia orders up 32%. On the Industrial side of the business, orders increased 47% and reflected increasing capacity utilization in investment the customers. Orders grew double digits in all Industrial submarkets, except Aerospace. Now let's look at those markets with a little more detail.
The 6% local currency sales increase in Life Sciences was driven by BioPharm, which grew more than 12%. Sales were up in Life Sciences in all regions, led by the Western Hemisphere at 8%; Europe, up 6%; and Asia, up 5%. Many major drivers in BioPharm continue to be the increased production of filtration-dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, including for H1N1, and expanding consumption of our single-use products. The plasma market has slowed compared to last year, and that is reflected in our numbers. Even so, base business in BioPharm grew 13%, continuing the healthy double-digit trend reported all year: 15% in the second quarter; and if you remember, 16% up in the first quarter.
Increasing adoption of some of Pall's newer high-value products continues to drive Life Sciences gross margins, which increased 330 basis points in the quarter. System sales were up 6% and are expected to be about 20% in Q4, which is an unusually high amount. Within BioPharm, lab sales were strong. Some of this is restocking, but it also reflects the strengthening of the end markets worldwide. Consistent with our earlier guidance, our expectation for BioPharm sales growth, single high digits for the year.
Medical sales were down almost 2% in the quarter, as were Blood Filter sales. A reduction in blood transfusions, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., helped growth down. This is the same situation as last quarter, decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. We still grew in the Western Hemisphere, albeit slightly, in spite of the drop-off in blood collection. Sales in Asia continue to ramp up and represents the largest potential for our future growth.
Medical OEM sales in Europe grew 10% for the second quarter in a row due to increasing sales to some of the largest medical diagnostics and device manufacturers in the world. Sales in Asia were also strong.
Approximately 30% of Medical sales in the quarter and nine months are from new products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a key component of Life Sciences' strong profit growth. We expect Medical sales to be about flat for the year, consistent with Q2 guidance.
Now let's switch gears and look at Pall Industrial. This business has returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 5% in local currency. Sales were up in all regions, led by Asia, up 7%; the Western Hemisphere increased 6%; and Europe at 2%. Microelectronics took off in the quarter with sales up over 77%. The recovery was broad in all regions and key segments of this diverse market, from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics such as flat panel displays and printers, and to new opportunities, including the emerging high-bright LED market [high-brightness LED market].
Growth in MicroE shows no signs of abating based on our current order book, and we expect it would exceed earlier projections for the year, coming in at growth in excess of 15%. While MicroE was clearly the lead dog pulling the Industrial sled in the quarter, we saw evidence the recovery is spreading.
I already covered orders in some detail, but it bears repeating. Orders in Industrial were up 47%, up double digits in every market except Aerospace. Orders are up 55% in our Energy, Water & Process Technologies group. This is the most systems-intensive part of the business, so we would expect to see these orders shipped over approximately the next 18 months. Looking at the third quarter, sales in EWPT were down slightly, and our expectation for the year is a mid single-digit decline. Power Generation and Industrial Manufacturing sales grew 11% and 21%, respectively.
Most of the growth in Power Gen came from Asia, now the largest region for us in the submarket, and in particular, from the fast-growing wind turbine market in China. Orders from the Western Hemisphere have almost doubled from the third quarter of last year and include orders for two nuclear power plants planned in this country. The growth in Industrial Manufacturing was robust in all regions and largely driven by the mining and mobile equipment industries, and that had a positive impact on gross margin.
Sales in Fuels & Chemicals, which is the largest of the EWPT markets, were down 8% in the quarter. The good news is that orders increased 84%. This includes a number of capital projects, including a $25 million order for a system going in as refinery in the Middle East, and it also reflects increasing production and some restockings to support demand. 
Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 4% in the quarter as system sales were down sharply. This reflects a decreased capital spending from last year and in the first quarter of calendar year 2010. But there's also good news here. Base business was up almost 7%. This is the first quarter of growth in consumables for Food and Beverage in seven quarters and suggest increasing production levels. Q3 orders for both base and systems in Food and Beverage were strong. 
Now as we announced last evening, we are transferring our Food and Beverage group into Life Sciences effective for this fourth quarter. The Food and Beverage market is being drawn ever closer to the BioPharmaceuticals world, with growing requirements for testing to identify disease and spoilage organism and a tightening regulatory environment focused on public health and manufacturing practices.
Now finally, we'll round out our report on EWPT with Municipal Water, where sales were down 13%. This was a customer timing issue. The backlog in this market is up 58% for the year, and we're expecting a record fourth quarter. Orders are up over 200%, and we will note that some projects are being slowed down due to funding issues in Europe.
Finally, Aerospace & Transportation, which is tracking expectations. We expected a difficult year from the outset, and difficult is the right description. The Commercial and Military submarket sales decreased 24% and 18%, respectively. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, and particularly, the regional and private jet sectors. Military Aero is down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the U.S., following an extended period of high growth. Our expectations for a difficult year were also predicated on tough 2009 comps, including about $25 million of sales in '09 that are expected to repeat, but not until 2011.
The smaller Transportation submarket turned positive for the first time in over a year, with sales up 19%. Orders here were also strong in the quarter. 
And so in summary, Life Sciences continues to show its resiliency, several important Industrial markets revived in the quarter and anticipated Industrial recovery began to spread across markets and regions. Improving business trends enabled Pall's ongoing productivity and cost reduction programs to add leverage. The end result, a strong Q3. 
And so with that, Lisa will now speak and review the financial details."
185333,106629407,64814,"Pall Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2010",2010-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $44.2 million, or $0.37 per share, l",1303,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $44.2 million, or $0.37 per share, last year. Earnings per share on a pro-forma basis, as defined on Slide 20, were also $0.58 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 38%. In the nine months, net earnings were $186.3 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $126.1 million, or $1.05 per share, last year. Earnings per share on a pro-forma basis were $1.40 compared to $1.20 a year ago, an increase of almost 17%. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.10 for the nine months. Now I'll discuss the drivers of these results, which are displayed on Slides 15 and 16.
Sales increased almost 11% in the quarter and 3% in the nine months. Foreign currency translation added $28.6 million, or 5%, to our top line in the quarter and about $70 million, or 4%, in the nine months. This was primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
Excluding this impact, sales increased almost 6% in the quarter and decreased about 1% in the nine months compared to the same periods in 2009. The impact of pricing was negligible in the quarter as an improvement in Life Sciences was largely offset by a decline in the Industrial business. In the nine months, increased pricing contributed $7 million to sales overall, again, attributable to an improvement in life sciences, while pricing in Industrial was flat.
In our fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of mid single digits overall and from both businesses. With the euro at about 1.2 to the dollar, a 14% deterioration compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and with about 30% of our sales derived from the eurozone, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact the sales growth by approximately 3%.
Gross margins in the third quarter improved 340 basis points to 50.9%. So this is at about the midpoint of our 2013 goal. This result reflects continued upward momentum in both Life Sciences and in Industrial. Let's take a look at each of the businesses.
Life Sciences gross margin continued its upward momentum, up 330 basis points, reaching 56%. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margins continued this quarter. Favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead due to increased volume and the estimated benefit of cost savings initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations that outpaced inflation, contributed approximately 200 to 230 basis points in margin. Increase in pricing in BioPharmaceuticals market, as well as the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct, contributed an estimated 40 basis points in margin. And finally, mix is estimated to have increased gross margin by about 50 basis points, primarily driven by growth in higher margin pharma consumable sales.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences gross margin, given the sustainability of cost reductions. As expected, Life Sciences gross margins in the second half are coming in lower than the first half as capital sales at lower margins have a downward impact.
Turning a cornerstone were Industrial gross margins, which increased 340 basis points to 47.1% in the quarter. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margin in the quarter were volume increases, driven by sales growth, particularly in Microelectronics; and the beneficial impact attendant to this mix change, increasing gross margins by approximately 260 to 280 basis points; and the estimated benefit of cost savings, net of inflation, from Pall Industrial's Manufacturing operations, which contributed an estimated 80 to 100 basis points in margin.
In the fourth quarter, we also expect Industrial gross margins to decrease sequentially given an expected increase in systems sales. So full year gross margin on a consolidated basis is now expected to exceed the high end of our full year estimate of 49%.
SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $8 million, the increase was 6%. This increase reflects the impact of strategic and infrastructure investments we've been making to position Pall to achieve our longer-term top and bottom line targets. They include: cost of the European consolidation in Switzerland, investments in information technology, geographic expansion in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Asia and cost associated with the acquisitions of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. Approximately half, or 3%, of the increase in SG&A in the quarter relates to these investments, with the remainder attributable to inflationary items, partly offset by cost reductions.
Compared to our second quarter, SG&A spend was flat, dropping to 30.4% of sales from 33.4%. We expect full year SG&A to be at about 31% of sales. Segment profit margins grew by 280 basis points to 19.5% in the quarter compared to 16.7% in the third quarter of last year, driven by improvements in both Life Sciences and Industrial operating margins. For the nine months, segment profit margins were 17.5% compared to 16.4% as improvement in Life Sciences was partly offset by a decrease in Industrial.
Consolidated operating margin in the quarter rose to 17.4%. This represents the highest achievement spanning a number of years. For the nine months, consolidated operating margin was 15.2% compared to 13.8% last year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or as-reported rate, for the nine months was 25.2%, reflecting a $16 million benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax audits this year. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the nine months was about 31%. 
Net interest expense in the nine months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the tax audits I just mentioned. Excluding these items, net interest expense has decreased by almost $5 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of higher rate foreign debt last year and the impact of lowered interest rates.
Turning now to cash flows and liquidity, operating cash flow in the nine months was about $257 million. This is compared to about $155 million last year, an increase of over $100 million or about 66%. It reflects the increase in net earnings, including reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness and reduced investments in inventories and improvement in receivables and payables. We have realized a reduction of 24 days in our full cash conversion cycle.
Significant uses of cash during the nine months included $93.5 million in capital spending; $53 million in dividends to shareholders, a 10% increase year-over-year; $36 million to repurchase the company's common stock; and about $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and for certain distribution rights. Our cash position was $484 million at April 30, and our net debt to net debt plus equity stood at 16.6%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009.
Looking at fourth quarter earnings expectations, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.03. Including this, our updated estimate is a $0.07 full year benefit from foreign exchange, down $0.02 from our previous estimate. That said, we now expect full year earnings per share to be at the high end of the range of our previous guidance of $1.95 to $2.05, excluding discrete items.
So I'll close by saying that we are pleased with our results this quarter. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results, from the top line to the bottom line and in cash generation. Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschel",1604,"Thank you very much, and good morning. It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 
As you saw from last evening's press release, Pall's third quarter results was a solid step toward meeting our year-end guidance. We'll review some of the details and drivers. We'll also provide our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2010. And of course, there'll be lots of time for your questions at the end. 
Third quarter sales were $616 million, and this is an increase of 11% on an as-reported basis over last year and close to 6% in local currency. Life Sciences grew over 6% in local currency. Industrial turned the corner in the third quarter, growing 5% and is delivering the strongest second half that we expected. The spreading recovery in our Industrial markets delivers well for a good close for 2010 and for a solid 2011. This was a quarter of achievement in Pall Industrial, culminating in almost $57 million in profit in the quarter, 88% more than the operating profit in the second quarter.
Our Microelectronics business shifted into high gear, with sales up 77% and order is equally strong. We also saw the recovery begin to spread in other Industrial markets, with revenues up sharply in all three Pall markets that were particularly hard hit by the recession; and they are, in addition to Microelectronics, Industrial Manufacturing and Transportation. On a geographic basis, sales grew in both the Industrial and the Life Sciences segments in all three of our geographies. Overall growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia was 7%, and sales in Europe increased 4%.
Our focus on increasing productivity and reducing costs continues to show through, with gross margin increasing all year despite earlier pressure on the top line. Increased volume and especially solid growth in our three highest margin markets provided lift in the quarter. We do expect a large fourth quarter for system shipments and for gross margins to come down a bit in response.
At the end of the second quarter, we reported that orders turned positive and were up almost 5%. Now in the third quarter, orders jumped up 27% overall. They were up sharply in all regions, including Europe, which was up 22%; the Western Hemisphere up 30%; and Asia orders up 32%. On the Industrial side of the business, orders increased 47% and reflected increasing capacity utilization in investment the customers. Orders grew double digits in all Industrial submarkets, except Aerospace. Now let's look at those markets with a little more detail.
The 6% local currency sales increase in Life Sciences was driven by BioPharm, which grew more than 12%. Sales were up in Life Sciences in all regions, led by the Western Hemisphere at 8%; Europe, up 6%; and Asia, up 5%. Many major drivers in BioPharm continue to be the increased production of filtration-dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, including for H1N1, and expanding consumption of our single-use products. The plasma market has slowed compared to last year, and that is reflected in our numbers. Even so, base business in BioPharm grew 13%, continuing the healthy double-digit trend reported all year: 15% in the second quarter; and if you remember, 16% up in the first quarter.
Increasing adoption of some of Pall's newer high-value products continues to drive Life Sciences gross margins, which increased 330 basis points in the quarter. System sales were up 6% and are expected to be about 20% in Q4, which is an unusually high amount. Within BioPharm, lab sales were strong. Some of this is restocking, but it also reflects the strengthening of the end markets worldwide. Consistent with our earlier guidance, our expectation for BioPharm sales growth, single high digits for the year.
Medical sales were down almost 2% in the quarter, as were Blood Filter sales. A reduction in blood transfusions, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., helped growth down. This is the same situation as last quarter, decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. We still grew in the Western Hemisphere, albeit slightly, in spite of the drop-off in blood collection. Sales in Asia continue to ramp up and represents the largest potential for our future growth.
Medical OEM sales in Europe grew 10% for the second quarter in a row due to increasing sales to some of the largest medical diagnostics and device manufacturers in the world. Sales in Asia were also strong.
Approximately 30% of Medical sales in the quarter and nine months are from new products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a key component of Life Sciences' strong profit growth. We expect Medical sales to be about flat for the year, consistent with Q2 guidance.
Now let's switch gears and look at Pall Industrial. This business has returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 5% in local currency. Sales were up in all regions, led by Asia, up 7%; the Western Hemisphere increased 6%; and Europe at 2%. Microelectronics took off in the quarter with sales up over 77%. The recovery was broad in all regions and key segments of this diverse market, from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics such as flat panel displays and printers, and to new opportunities, including the emerging high-bright LED market [high-brightness LED market].
Growth in MicroE shows no signs of abating based on our current order book, and we expect it would exceed earlier projections for the year, coming in at growth in excess of 15%. While MicroE was clearly the lead dog pulling the Industrial sled in the quarter, we saw evidence the recovery is spreading.
I already covered orders in some detail, but it bears repeating. Orders in Industrial were up 47%, up double digits in every market except Aerospace. Orders are up 55% in our Energy, Water & Process Technologies group. This is the most systems-intensive part of the business, so we would expect to see these orders shipped over approximately the next 18 months. Looking at the third quarter, sales in EWPT were down slightly, and our expectation for the year is a mid single-digit decline. Power Generation and Industrial Manufacturing sales grew 11% and 21%, respectively.
Most of the growth in Power Gen came from Asia, now the largest region for us in the submarket, and in particular, from the fast-growing wind turbine market in China. Orders from the Western Hemisphere have almost doubled from the third quarter of last year and include orders for two nuclear power plants planned in this country. The growth in Industrial Manufacturing was robust in all regions and largely driven by the mining and mobile equipment industries, and that had a positive impact on gross margin.
Sales in Fuels & Chemicals, which is the largest of the EWPT markets, were down 8% in the quarter. The good news is that orders increased 84%. This includes a number of capital projects, including a $25 million order for a system going in as refinery in the Middle East, and it also reflects increasing production and some restockings to support demand. 
Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 4% in the quarter as system sales were down sharply. This reflects a decreased capital spending from last year and in the first quarter of calendar year 2010. But there's also good news here. Base business was up almost 7%. This is the first quarter of growth in consumables for Food and Beverage in seven quarters and suggest increasing production levels. Q3 orders for both base and systems in Food and Beverage were strong. 
Now as we announced last evening, we are transferring our Food and Beverage group into Life Sciences effective for this fourth quarter. The Food and Beverage market is being drawn ever closer to the BioPharmaceuticals world, with growing requirements for testing to identify disease and spoilage organism and a tightening regulatory environment focused on public health and manufacturing practices.
Now finally, we'll round out our report on EWPT with Municipal Water, where sales were down 13%. This is a customer timing issue. The backlog in this market is up 58% for the year, and we're expecting a record fourth quarter. Orders are up over 200%, and we will note that some projects are being slowed down due to funding issues in Europe.
Finally, Aerospace & Transportation, which is tracking expectations. We expected a difficult year from the outset, and difficult is the right description. The Commercial and Military submarket sales decreased 24% and 18%, respectively. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, and particularly, the regional and private jet sectors. Military Aero is down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the U.S., following an extended period of high growth. 
Our expectations for a difficult year were also predicated on tough 2009 comps, including about $25 million of sales in '09 that are expected to repeat, but not until 2011. The smaller Transportation submarket turned positive for the first time in over a year, with sales up 19%. Orders here were also strong in the quarter. 
And so in summary, Life Sciences continues to show its resiliency, several important Industrial markets revived in the quarter and anticipated Industrial recovery began to spread across markets and regions. Improving business trends enabled Pall's ongoing productivity and cost reduction programs to add leverage. The end result, a strong Q3. 
And so with that, Lisa will now speak and review the financial details."
185333,106629407,65805,"Pall Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2010",2010-06-09,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $44.2 million, or $0.37 per share, l",1303,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financial results for the quarter and nine months, starting with earnings. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $69.7 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to $44.2 million, or $0.37 per share, last year. Earnings per share on a pro-forma basis, as defined on Slide 20, were also $0.58 compared to $0.42 per share, an increase of 38%. In the nine months, net earnings were $186.3 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $126.1 million, or $1.05 per share, last year. 
Earnings per share on a pro-forma basis were $1.40 compared to $1.20 a year ago, an increase of almost 17%. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.10 for the nine months. Now I'll discuss the drivers of these results, which are displayed on Slides 15 and 16.
Sales increased almost 11% in the quarter and 3% in the nine months. Foreign currency translation added $28.6 million, or 5%, to our top line in the quarter and about $70 million, or 4%, in the nine months. This was primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
Excluding this impact, sales increased almost 6% in the quarter and decreased about 1% in the nine months compared to the same periods in 2009. The impact of pricing was negligible in the quarter as an improvement in Life Sciences was largely offset by a decline in the Industrial business. In the nine months, increased pricing contributed $7 million to sales overall, again, attributable to an improvement in Life Sciences, while pricing in Industrial was flat.
In our fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of mid single digits overall and from both businesses. With the euro at about 1.2 to the dollar, a 14% deterioration compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and with about 30% of our sales derived from the eurozone, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact the sales growth by approximately 3%.
Gross margins in the third quarter improved 340 basis points to 50.9%. So this is at about the midpoint of our 2013 goal. This result reflects continued upward momentum in both Life Sciences and in Industrial. Let's take a look at each of the businesses.
Life Sciences gross margin continued its upward momentum, up 330 basis points, reaching 56%. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margins continued this quarter. Favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead due to increased volume and the estimated benefit of cost savings initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations that outpaced inflation, contributed approximately 200 to 230 basis points in margin. 
Increase in pricing in BioPharmaceuticals market, as well as the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct, contributed an estimated 40 basis points in margin. And finally, mix is estimated to have increased gross margin by about 50 basis points, primarily driven by growth in higher margin pharma consumable sales.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences gross margin, given the sustainability of cost reductions. As expected, Life Sciences gross margins in the second half are coming in lower than the first half as capital sales at lower margins have a downward impact.
Turning a cornerstone were Industrial gross margins, which increased 340 basis points to 47.1% in the quarter. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margin in the quarter were volume increases, driven by sales growth, particularly in Microelectronics; and the beneficial impact attendant to this mix change, increasing gross margins by approximately 260 to 280 basis points; and the estimated benefit of cost savings, net of inflation, from Pall Industrial's Manufacturing operations, which contributed an estimated 80 to 100 basis points in margin.
In the fourth quarter, we also expect Industrial gross margins to decrease sequentially given an expected increase in systems sales. So full year gross margin on a consolidated basis is now expected to exceed the high end of our full year estimate of 49%.
SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $8 million, the increase was 6%. This increase reflects the impact of strategic and infrastructure investments we've been making to position Pall to achieve our longer-term top and bottom line targets. 
They include: cost of the European consolidation in Switzerland, investments in information technology, geographic expansion in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Asia and cost associated with the acquisitions of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. Approximately half, or 3%, of the increase in SG&A in the quarter relates to these investments, with the remainder attributable to inflationary items, partly offset by cost reductions.
Compared to our second quarter, SG&A spend was flat, dropping to 30.4% of sales from 33.4%. We expect full year SG&A to be at about 31% of sales. Segment profit margins grew by 280 basis points to 19.5% in the quarter compared to 16.7% in the third quarter of last year, driven by improvements in both Life Sciences and Industrial operating margins. For the nine months, segment profit margins were 17.5% compared to 16.4% as improvement in Life Sciences was partly offset by a decrease in Industrial.
Consolidated operating margin in the quarter rose to 17.4%. This represents the highest achievement spanning a number of years. For the nine months, consolidated operating margin was 15.2% compared to 13.8% last year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or as-reported rate, for the nine months was 25.2%, reflecting a $16 million benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax audits this year. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the nine months was about 31%. 
Net interest expense in the nine months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the tax audits I just mentioned. Excluding these items, net interest expense has decreased by almost $5 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of higher rate foreign debt last year and the impact of lowered interest rates.
Turning now to cash flows and liquidity, operating cash flow in the nine months was about $257 million. This is compared to about $155 million last year, an increase of over $100 million or about 66%. It reflects the increase in net earnings, including reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness and reduced investments in inventories and improvement in receivables and payables. We have realized a reduction of 24 days in our full cash conversion cycle.
Significant uses of cash during the nine months included $93.5 million in capital spending; $53 million in dividends to shareholders, a 10% increase year-over-year; $36 million to repurchase the company's common stock; and about $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and for certain distribution rights. Our cash position was $484 million at April 30, and our net debt to net debt plus equity stood at 16.6%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009.
Looking at fourth quarter earnings expectations, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.03. Including this, our updated estimate is a $0.07 full year benefit from foreign exchange, down $0.02 from our previous estimate. That said, we now expect full year earnings per share to be at the high end of the range of our previous guidance of $1.95 to $2.05, excluding discrete items.
So I'll close by saying that we are pleased with our results this quarter. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results, from the top line to the bottom line and in cash generation. Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschel",1604,"Thank you very much, and good morning. It's a pleasure to share Pall's third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook with you today, and thank you for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller. 
As you saw from last evening's press release, Pall's third quarter results was a solid step toward meeting our year-end guidance. We'll review some of the details and drivers. We'll also provide our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2010. And of course, there'll be lots of time for your questions at the end. 
Third quarter sales were $616 million, and this is an increase of 11% on an as-reported basis over last year and close to 6% in local currency. Life Sciences grew over 6% in local currency. Industrial turned the corner in the third quarter, growing 5% and is delivering the strongest second half that we expected. The spreading recovery in our Industrial markets delivers well for a good close for 2010 and for a solid 2011. This was a quarter of achievement in Pall Industrial, culminating in almost $57 million in profit in the quarter, 88% more than the operating profit in the second quarter.
Our Microelectronics business shifted into high gear, with sales up 77% and order is equally strong. We also saw the recovery begin to spread in other Industrial markets, with revenues up sharply in all three Pall markets that were particularly hard hit by the recession; and they are, in addition to Microelectronics, Industrial Manufacturing and Transportation. On a geographic basis, sales grew in both the Industrial and the Life Sciences segments in all three of our geographies. Overall growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia was 7%, and sales in Europe increased 4%.
Our focus on increasing productivity and reducing costs continues to show through, with gross margin increasing all year despite earlier pressure on the top line. Increased volume and especially solid growth in our three highest margin markets provided lift in the quarter. We do expect a large fourth quarter for system shipments and for gross margins to come down a bit in response.
At the end of the second quarter, we reported that orders turned positive and were up almost 5%. Now in the third quarter, orders jumped up 27% overall. They were up sharply in all regions, including Europe, which was up 22%; the Western Hemisphere up 30%; and Asia orders up 32%. On the Industrial side of the business, orders increased 47% and reflected increasing capacity utilization in investment the customers. Orders grew double digits in all Industrial submarkets, except Aerospace. Now let's look at those markets with a little more detail.
The 6% local currency sales increase in Life Sciences was driven by BioPharm, which grew more than 12%. Sales were up in Life Sciences in all regions, led by the Western Hemisphere at 8%; Europe, up 6%; and Asia, up 5%. Many major drivers in BioPharm continue to be the increased production of filtration-dependent biotech drugs and vaccines, including for H1N1, and expanding consumption of our single-use products. The plasma market has slowed compared to last year, and that is reflected in our numbers. Even so, base business in BioPharm grew 13%, continuing the healthy double-digit trend reported all year: 15% in the second quarter; and if you remember, 16% up in the first quarter.
Increasing adoption of some of Pall's newer high-value products continues to drive Life Sciences gross margins, which increased 330 basis points in the quarter. System sales were up 6% and are expected to be about 20% in Q4, which is an unusually high amount. Within BioPharm, lab sales were strong. Some of this is restocking, but it also reflects the strengthening of the end markets worldwide. Consistent with our earlier guidance, our expectation for BioPharm sales growth, single high digits for the year.
Medical sales were down almost 2% in the quarter, as were Blood Filter sales. A reduction in blood transfusions, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., helped growth down. This is the same situation as last quarter, decreased demand for blood attributable to declines in areas such as elective surgery. We still grew in the Western Hemisphere, albeit slightly, in spite of the drop-off in blood collection. Sales in Asia continue to ramp up and represents the largest potential for our future growth.
Medical OEM sales in Europe grew 10% for the second quarter in a row due to increasing sales to some of the largest medical diagnostics and device manufacturers in the world. Sales in Asia were also strong.
Approximately 30% of Medical sales in the quarter and nine months are from new products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a key component of Life Sciences' strong profit growth. We expect Medical sales to be about flat for the year, consistent with Q2 guidance.
Now let's switch gears and look at Pall Industrial. This business has returned to growth in the quarter, with sales up 5% in local currency. Sales were up in all regions, led by Asia, up 7%; the Western Hemisphere increased 6%; and Europe at 2%. Microelectronics took off in the quarter with sales up over 77%. The recovery was broad in all regions and key segments of this diverse market, from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics such as flat panel displays and printers, and to new opportunities, including the emerging high-bright LED market [high-brightness LED market].
Growth in MicroE shows no signs of abating based on our current order book, and we expect it would exceed earlier projections for the year, coming in at growth in excess of 15%. While MicroE was clearly the lead dog pulling the Industrial sled in the quarter, we saw evidence the recovery is spreading.
I already covered orders in some detail, but it bears repeating. Orders in Industrial were up 47%, up double digits in every market except Aerospace. Orders are up 55% in our Energy, Water & Process Technologies group. This is the most systems-intensive part of the business, so we would expect to see these orders shipped over approximately the next 18 months. Looking at the third quarter, sales in EWPT were down slightly, and our expectation for the year is a mid single-digit decline. Power Generation and Industrial Manufacturing sales grew 11% and 21%, respectively.
Most of the growth in Power Gen came from Asia, now the largest region for us in the submarket, and in particular, from the fast-growing wind turbine market in China. Orders from the Western Hemisphere have almost doubled from the third quarter of last year and include orders for two nuclear power plants planned in this country. The growth in Industrial Manufacturing was robust in all regions and largely driven by the mining and mobile equipment industries, and that had a positive impact on gross margin.
Sales in Fuels & Chemicals, which is the largest of the EWPT markets, were down 8% in the quarter. The good news is that orders increased 84%. This includes a number of capital projects, including a $25 million order for a system going in as refinery in the Middle East, and it also reflects increasing production and some restockings to support demand. 
Sales in Food and Beverage decreased 4% in the quarter as system sales were down sharply. This reflects a decreased capital spending from last year and in the first quarter of calendar year 2010. But there's also good news here. Base business was up almost 7%. This is the first quarter of growth in consumables for Food and Beverage in seven quarters and suggest increasing production levels. Q3 orders for both base and systems in Food and Beverage were strong. 
Now as we announced last evening, we are transferring our Food and Beverage group into Life Sciences effective for this fourth quarter. The Food and Beverage market is being drawn ever closer to the BioPharmaceuticals world, with growing requirements for testing to identify disease and spoilage organism and a tightening regulatory environment focused on public health and manufacturing practices.
Now finally, we'll round out our report on EWPT with Municipal Water, where sales were down 13%. This is a customer timing issue. The backlog in this market is up 58% for the year, and we're expecting a record fourth quarter. Orders are up over 200%, and we will note that some projects are being slowed down due to funding issues in Europe.
Finally, Aerospace & Transportation, which is tracking expectations. We expected a difficult year from the outset, and difficult is the right description. The Commercial and Military submarket sales decreased 24% and 18%, respectively. Airlines are under clear pressure from the economy, and particularly, the regional and private jet sectors. Military Aero is down with the deferral of military spending, particularly in the U.S., following an extended period of high growth. 
Our expectations for a difficult year were also predicated on tough 2009 comps, including about $25 million of sales in '09 that are expected to repeat, but not until 2011. The smaller Transportation submarket turned positive for the first time in over a year, with sales up 19%. Orders here were also strong in the quarter. 
And so in summary, Life Sciences continues to show its resiliency, several important Industrial markets revived in the quarter and anticipated Industrial recovery began to spread across markets and regions. Improving business trends enabled Pall's ongoing productivity and cost reduction programs to add leverage. The end result, a strong Q3. 
And so with that, Lisa will now speak and review the financial details."

This was primarily due to the dollar weakening against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
Excluding this impact, sales increased almost 6% in the quarter and decreased about 1% in the nine months compared to the same periods in 2009. The impact of pricing was negligible in the quarter as an improvement in Life Sciences was largely offset by a decline in the Industrial business. In the nine months, increased pricing contributed $7 million to sales overall, again, attributable to an improvement in Life Sciences, while pricing in Industrial was flat.
In our fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of mid single digits overall and from both businesses. With the euro at about 1.2 to the dollar, a 14% deterioration compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and with about 30% of our sales derived from the eurozone, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact the sales growth by approximately 3%.
Gross margins in the third quarter improved 340 basis points to 50.9%. So this is at about the midpoint of our 2013 goal. This result reflects continued upward momentum in both Life Sciences and in Industrial. Let's take a look at each of the businesses.
Life Sciences gross margin continued its upward momentum, up 330 basis points, reaching 56%. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margins continued this quarter. Favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead due to increased volume and the estimated benefit of cost savings initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations that outpaced inflation, contributed approximately 200 to 230 basis points in margin. 
Increase in pricing in BioPharmaceuticals market, as well as the benefit of sales channel changes from distribution to direct, contributed an estimated 40 basis points in margin. And finally, mix is estimated to have increased gross margin by about 50 basis points, primarily driven by growth in higher margin pharma consumable sales.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in Life Sciences gross margin, given the sustainability of cost reductions. As expected, Life Sciences gross margins in the second half are coming in lower than the first half as capital sales at lower margins have a downward impact.
Turning a cornerstone were Industrial gross margins, which increased 340 basis points to 47.1% in the quarter. Key drivers of the improvement in gross margin in the quarter were volume increases, driven by sales growth, particularly in Microelectronics; and the beneficial impact attendant to this mix change, increasing gross margins by approximately 260 to 280 basis points; and the estimated benefit of cost savings, net of inflation, from Pall Industrial's Manufacturing operations, which contributed an estimated 80 to 100 basis points in margin.
In the fourth quarter, we also expect Industrial gross margins to decrease sequentially given an expected increase in systems sales. So full year gross margin on a consolidated basis is now expected to exceed the high end of our full year estimate of 49%.
SG&A, including corporate expenses, increased 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. Excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange, which increased SG&A by about $8 million, the increase was 6%. This increase reflects the impact of strategic and infrastructure investments we've been making to position Pall to achieve our longer-term top and bottom line targets. 
They include: cost of the European consolidation in Switzerland, investments in information technology, geographic expansion in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Asia and cost associated with the acquisitions of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. Approximately half, or 3%, of the increase in SG&A in the quarter relates to these investments, with the remainder attributable to inflationary items, partly offset by cost reductions.
Compared to our second quarter, SG&A spend was flat, dropping to 30.4% of sales from 33.4%. We expect full year SG&A to be at about 31% of sales. Segment profit margins grew by 280 basis points to 19.5% in the quarter compared to 16.7% in the third quarter of last year, driven by improvements in both Life Sciences and Industrial operating margins. For the nine months, segment profit margins were 17.5% compared to 16.4% as improvement in Life Sciences was partly offset by a decrease in Industrial.
Consolidated operating margin in the quarter rose to 17.4%. This represents the highest achievement spanning a number of years. For the nine months, consolidated operating margin was 15.2% compared to 13.8% last year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or as-reported rate, for the nine months was 25.2%, reflecting a $16 million benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax audits this year. Excluding these discrete items, the underlying tax rate for the nine months was about 31%. 
Net interest expense in the nine months reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the tax audits I just mentioned. Excluding these items, net interest expense has decreased by almost $5 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of higher rate foreign debt last year and the impact of lowered interest rates.
Turning now to cash flows and liquidity, operating cash flow in the nine months was about $257 million. This is compared to about $155 million last year, an increase of over $100 million or about 66%. It reflects the increase in net earnings, including reduced outlays for interest on indebtedness and reduced investments in inventories and improvement in receivables and payables. We have realized a reduction of 24 days in our full cash conversion cycle.
Significant uses of cash during the nine months included $93.5 million in capital spending; $53 million in dividends to shareholders, a 10% increase year-over-year; $36 million to repurchase the company's common stock; and about $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and for certain distribution rights. Our cash position was $484 million at April 30, and our net debt to net debt plus equity stood at 16.6%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009.
Looking at fourth quarter earnings expectations, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.03. Including this, our updated estimate is a $0.07 full year benefit from foreign exchange, down $0.02 from our previous estimate. That said, we now expect full year earnings per share to be at the high end of the range of our previous guidance of $1.95 to $2.05, excluding discrete items.
So I'll close by saying that we are pleased with our results this quarter. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results, from the top line to the bottom line and in cash generation. Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

And it's just an ongoing effort of slogging through and trying to get the best pricing we can in each market. When we talk about price, the formula we use is comparing part numbers, and that can be a bit misleading. So for instance, in Asia, with the ramp-up in sales to very large volume OEM customers, they may receive a lower price, say, than a smaller end user. So the same part number, while we may actually be getting price increases, it would not show up that way in the formula.

We appreciate you joining us today as we report our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me this morning are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller.In",1710,"Thank you very much. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us today as we report our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me this morning are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller.
In addition to reviewing the fourth quarter's performance and recapping the year, we will also be providing guidance for fiscal year 2011. We look forward to your questions at the end of our prepared remarks.
As reported last evening, Pall posted a solid fourth quarter and saw an upturn in momentum for the second half of the fiscal year. Through judicious cost management, we position Pall to benefit as business conditions improved and we continued to invest and focus on our growth strategies, new products, markets, applications and regions.
Pall announced ambitious performance goals for fiscal '10 last December. Lisa will discuss key drivers in detail a little later. The bottom line, pro forma EPS of $2.12 was within our original guidance of $2.02 to $2.19 and it was the high end excluding foreign exchange.
Given better than expected performance in the fourth quarter, principally in BioPharmaceuticals, Microelectronics and Machinery and Equipment, EPS exceeded the high end of the guidance we provided after the second quarter. Operating cash flows came in at $378 million compared to our high end estimate of $365 million.
Life Sciences performed well all year, particularly in the key BioPharmaceuticals market which grew over 10% in local currency. Our Industrial business finished the year with sales down 3%. The global recession and consequent drop in Industrial Manufacturing activity slowly abated as our year progressed.
The effect of capital spending is still being felt in our systems business where the order to shipment cycle can be as long as two years. At mid-year, Microelectronics rebounded and Other sectors began to stir. Industrial turned positive again beginning in the third quarter on the strength of a handful of markets and the remaining markets are now also setting up to grow again.
Total orders grew 19% in the fourth quarter. Focusing in on Pall Industrial, their orders grew 26% over last year's Q4 with all Industrial markets contributing. This follows a 54% increase in orders for Industrial in the third quarter. Now, staying with Industrial, orders for consumables grew 38%, following on 42% increase in Q3. This reflects increasing customer capacity utilization, some inventory restocking and a revival of customer appetite for capital expenditure.
Positive for the year was the improvement in gross margin. It came in at just above 50%. Those of you who have following us know that we’ve been shipping away at cost of sales.
We were gratified to see this heavy lifting of reducing our manufacturing footprint and showing a lean culture, improving margins on systems and implementing our pricing excellence program, not just to offset the effects of the weak economy as they did in 2009 but enabled us to leverage in improving top line in the second half of fiscal '10.
Before I hand off to Lisa, I'll run down Q4 results by market and give an indication of what we're seeing as we enter our new year. As you saw in the press release last evening, we’ve made several organizational changes to better manage the business. These changes are illustrated on slide six.
Pall year-over-year comparisons are on a restated basis and the discussion on sales and orders is in local currency unless otherwise stated. Fourth quarter sales came in at $679 million and this is up 4% over last year on an as reported basis. Currency turned from favorable for much of the year to a headwind.
Sales grew 6% overall with Life Science up over 7.5% and Industrial positive for the second quarter in a row, growing 4%. Sales in the Western hemisphere increased 14% with Industrial markets leading at a 20% growth. Europe was down close to 3% on weakness of several Industrial markets and Asia overall grew 10%.
Let's look at the details starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals now represents a quarter of Pall's total sales. It's been a steady contributor. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 10% increase in both consumables and system sales as all regions grew. Some of the key drivers, increased production of filtration intensive biotech drugs, the vaccine market is remaining strong, the market for single use technologies is expanding and emerging markets are beginning to move the needle.
In short order, China has become the third largest market for drugs in the world. Consumables sales in Asia grew 10% in the year even though Japan Pall's largest Asian country was flat. Q4 orders increased over 17% and systems orders increased over 100% as capital spending has come back in this market. We enter fiscal year '11 with a strong backlog, up almost 30%.
Turning to medical, they had a very good closing quarter with sales up 3.6%. The blood and critical care markets performed. Blood filter sales increased over 3% despite the continuing trend of reduced collections in the U.S. New products here are playing a key role.
Hospital critical care had a good quarter with sales up 8%. Sales in Europe were also up about 8% with a market for water filters since lodging. And sales in Asia were up sharply. New products, as I mentioned before, are key to medical's growth and about 30% of our sales for the year came from recently introduced products. These higher margin products continue to make medical a strong contributor to Life Science's profit growth in the quarter. Q4 orders increased almost 6%.
Looking now at Food and Beverage which has moved from Industrial and was integrated within the Life Sciences business, in the quarter it also returned to growth. Sales were up over 8% in all regions - with all regions contributing, that is, consumable sales, a reflection of increasing production, increased about 5.5%.
System sales nearly doubled in Food and Beverage from the third quarter to the fourth, reflecting improving orders starting in the second quarter. Q4 orders for both consumables and systems increased double digits and we enter fiscal '11 with a backlog that's up 34% over fiscal '09.
Now let's switch gears for a review of Pall Industrial which after a challenging start began to grow in the second half, much of this growth driven by the return of Microelectronics. Other markets remain spotty with pockets of market and geographic strength.
Orders increased 26% in the quarter and became widespread and the entering backlog for Industrial is $465 million, an increase of 28% again over fiscal '09.
Now, looking at the markets, Energy and Water which was 20% of Pall sales in 2010 now consists of three submarkets, fuels and chemicals, the largest of the three, power generation and municipal water. These markets share common imperatives for high yields for protecting assets worth hundreds of millions of dollar in each plant and meeting increasingly stringent environmental regs.
Total sales with capital equipment in these markets can be large, lumpy and long term. Results today can reflect orders as long as two years ago. Such is the case in fuels and chemicals where sales decreased 11% in the quarter, reflecting reduced capital orders earlier.
Good news here is that the base business has grown 5% after four quarters of double-digit declines. This reflects increasing production particularly in Asia and the Middle East. Orders increased 6% in Q4 on top of 84% growth in Q3. The large increase in the third quarter includes Tecnimont job we recently announced.
The backlog in fuels and chemicals currently exceeds $100 million, an increase of more than 24% over last year. Power generation was down 13% in the quarter, but a bright spot of late has been the rapid expansion of the wind turbine market in China and Pall's share has been growing dramatically.
Looking ahead, Q4 orders in Power Gen picked up over 40% with base orders including housing increasing 50%. Systems orders increased 7% and these orders for housing and systems forecast a growing customer confidence and future demand for energy. Overall, the backlog in Pall Energy exceeds $165 million, which is up 28% over fiscal '09.
Let's move on to municipal Water. This market grew 7% in the quarter driven by 57% increase in the Western hemisphere. The municipal water market is for now a U.S. centric although the opportunity is decidedly global.
U.S. market remains strong as municipalities continue to upgrade membrane filtrations until membrane filtrations comply with EPA regulations. U.S. orders almost doubled compared to this time last year and project activity is accelerating in Asia.
We entered fiscal 2011 with $100 million backlog in muni water, which is more than 30% over 2009. This is our highest ever in this market.
Aeropower now comprised of Aerospace and Machinery and Equipment markets represents 17% of total Pall sales in 2010. Aerospace and Machinery and Equipment are roughly the same size. And overall this Aeropower market grew 4% in the quarter as M&A grew 28% and is now approaching 2008 levels.
Mining, steel and automotive productions are good examples of markets driving current results. Aerospace was down 14% compared to Q4 '09. It did improve sequentially. Commercial aero was up slightly after four down quarters and military aero was down as expected.
Aeropower orders increased almost 50% with both markets, that is Aerospace and Machinery and Equipment growing above 50%. All submarkets and regions also contributed and the backlog in Aeropower is up 18% over the fiscal '09 numbers.
Now, finally, let's go to Microelectronics. Microelectronics finished the fourth quarter, up over 35% in sales and 20% for the year, outperforming our full year expectations. The market is being driven by near full utilization rates at chip manufacturers and improving consumer appetite for electronic products.
Recovery is in full swing here and all regions in key segments of this diverse market are participating from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics such as flat panel display, printers and new opportunities including the emerging high bright LED market.
Growth in MicroE shows no signs of abating based on our current order book and Q4 orders increased 33%. Now with that, let me have Lisa review the financial details.

I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and the year and end with our current expectations for fiscal year 2011. Net earnings in the quarter were $55 million or $0.46 per share, compared",1607,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and the year and end with our current expectations for fiscal year 2011. Net earnings in the quarter were $55 million or $0.46 per share, compared to $69.5 million or $0.58 per share last year.
Pro forma earnings per share as defined on slide 22 were $0.72 compared to $0.57 per share, an increase of 26%. Net earnings for the full year were $241.2 million or $2.03 per share, compared to $195.6 million or $1.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share were $2.12, compared to $1.77 a year ago, an increase of 20%.
Foreign currency translation did not impact earnings per share in the quarter, while an increased earnings per share by $0.10 for the full year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $12 million or 2%. This was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and to a lesser extent the British pound against the dollar.
The strength of the Japanese yen and several other Asian currencies probably offset this. Excluding this impact, sales were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, reflecting an 8% increase in consumables and a 6% decrease in systems.
Sales increased 3% for the year. Foreign currency translation added about $58 million or 2.5% to our top line. This was primarily the result of a weakening dollar against most Asian currencies, the Euro and Canadian dollar. Excluding this impact, sales were up slightly in the year compared to fiscal year 2009. This reflects a 3% increase in consumables with a 15% decrease in systems.
Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $5 million in the quarter and approximately $12 million in Life Sciences partly offset by decline in Industrial for the full year. Gross margins in the fourth quarter improved 370 basis points to 49.8% with contributions from both businesses. Pall Industrial's gross margins came - excuse me - in at 47.8% up 570 basis points year-over-year.
Key drivers noted in our third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Volume increases in high margin markets positively impacting mix and overhead absorption, as well as cost savings outpacing inflationary items. Life Sciences gross margins also improved year-over-year coming in at 59.1% up 160 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement and manufacturing cost reductions. The decline from the third quarter is principally attributable to mix.
SG&A was 27.8% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 30% in the third quarter. Year-over-year SG&A increased 5% excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. And for the year, SG&A increased by 3.5% excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. Majority of this increase relates to investments we're making to drive sales up and SG&A down. These include the costs of the European management center, the implementation of our global ERP system and investments in selling and marketing costs principally in emerging region. The remainder is attributable to inflation being largely offset by cost reductions.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported tax rate for the year was 26.4%. Excluding items that we do not consider to be recurring and therefore do not include in the calculation of pro-forma earnings per share, Pall's underlying tax rate for the year was 31% favorable to the 31.3% forecasted for the year. Net interest expense in Europe reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the resolution of certain foreign tax audits, excluding these items net interest expense decreased by $2 million.
Turning now to cash flow, operating cash flow in the year was $378 million, compared to $327 million last year, an increase of over 50 million or about 15%. This reflects improvements in working capital management, particularly accounts payable terms, resulting in a reduction of our cash conversion cycle of about 13 days. This was offset by increased taxes paid and pension funding.
Other significant uses of cash during the year included $136 million in capital spending reflecting increased investment in our IT infrastructure and wrapping up our headquarters renovation, $100 million to purchase 2.7 million shares of the company's common stock, leaving approximately $350 million on our current authorization. This represents the repurchase of $345 million cumulatively for the three years ended July 31st, 2010 decreasing our shares outstanding by over 10 million. $71million in dividends to shareholders, a 10% increase year-over-year and $18.5 million for the acquisition of biotechnology company and certain distribution rights.
The cash position stood at just under $500 million at July 31st, 2010 and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 19.4, down from 21.4 at July 31st, 2009. Indebtedness at July 31st, 2010 reflects the previously disclosed public offering of $375, 5% senior notes due June 15th, 2010 as well as outstandings on our new five year revolving credit facility of about $250 million. These transactions further secure Pall's liquidity for years to come and enhance our operational flexibility.
The timing was optimal, given historically low interest rates and the abundance of credit. We just closed the books on a year of achievement and the second year of Pall's 2013 strategic plan. For those of you who are new to Pall, we updated this plan last December. You can find the plan details on the IR branch of our website. While this plan has many elements, the ultimate measure of success will be in two numbers, Pall's earnings per share and cash flow generation by the end of fiscal 2013.
I'm pleased to report that Pall's results for 2010 in these two critical measures put us on track to meeting our goals under the strategic plan. Let's look at the significant drivers. Sales were slightly below the low single digit growth in local currency expectation for the year. Sales growth in Life Sciences was on plan, while Industrial sales decline of 3% for the year was below. Obtaining price increases in the Industrial economic environment was challenging, although we hired plan there the Pall Industrial sales organization is very focused on this.
As Eric mentioned, crossing the 50% gross margin milestone was significant. This was a 290 basis point step-up and was ahead of plan. Beneficial mix from the outperforming growth of pharmaceuticals and microelectronics consumable sales, as well as cost savings and manufacturing are the highlights for the year. SG&A as at 30.8% of sales is slightly behind plan reflecting the strategic investments we're making.
Life Sciences operating margin of 22.6% is on plan, while Industrial's operating margin of 14.1% is ahead of plan on higher than expected gross margins in the back half of the year mitigating the shortfall. Overall EBIT margin of 16.3% is ahead of plan and earnings per share of $2.12 were at the high end of our expectations, excluding the headwind of foreign currency translation. We are on track with our cash flow and working capital management objective.
Looking at 2011, we expect local currency sales growth of mid to high single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. This is tracking to the plan. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% negative to revenue. By market we expect medical to improve to low single digit growth. We expect high single digit growth in biopharmaceuticals and for phoned beverage to grow mid-single-digits.
In Industrial, we expect the energy market to grow at mid-single-digit and water which will be primarily systems to grow double digits for overall growth in energy and water of mid single digits. We expect Aerospace to deliver high single to low double-digit growth and machinery and equipment to grow by mid single digits, for overall Aeropower translates to mid to high single digit growth.
And finally, we expect microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single digit growth for the year. Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51% which continues to be ahead of plan. Pricing, volume and continued manufacturing efficiencies should be partly offset by mix headwinds as systems and lower margin markets are expected to recover.
SG&A is forecasted to be about 30.5% of sales and although this is behind plan we expect the investments we're making in the early years of the plan to drive SG&A as well as operational costs down in the out years. That said expected EBIT margins of 16% to 17% are on track for the plan. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2011 is approximately 27%, which is a 4% reduction in the rate year-over-year as we achieved the August 1st go live for our European headquarters on schedule.
Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.35 and $2.55 and includes an approximate $0.03 headwind from foreign currency translation compared to 2010, this is a $0.10 reduction compared to the December 2009 exchange rate used for the plan.
Excluding this, earnings per share is tracking to the plan. Operating cash flow was expected to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million and capital expenditures are expected to increase to $165 million to $175 million, as we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities. We have many levers to employ to achieve our earnings per share and cash flow goals for 2013. The bottom line is this. Pall's 2010 results have us on track to achieve them and our expectations for 2011 keep us there.
Thank you for your attention this morning. And with that I'll hand this back to Eric.

We're looking of course at easy comps but for Aeropower overall to recover very nicely this year and the whole energy and in Water area we see a good order trend there and not just stability but reinvestment again in new energy sources, alternative energy. Geographically, the out-liar has been Europe. Europe is particularly weak and especially weak in Industrial for 2010. There, we do see some good signs of life in Germany and I think overall for the European economies. And again, it's been borne out by our August results where orders were quite strong.

We appreciate you joining us today as we report our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me this morning are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Cont",1727,"Well, thank you very much. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us today as we report our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me this morning are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
Now in addition to reviewing the fourth quarter's performance and recapping the year, we will also be providing guidance for our fiscal year 2011. We look forward to your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. As reported last evening, Pall posted a solid fourth quarter and so an upturn in momentum for the second half of the fiscal year. 
Through a judicious cost management, we position Pall to benefit as business conditions improve and we continue to invest and focus on our growth strategy, new products, market applications and regions. Pall announced the ambitious performance goals for fiscal '10 last December. Lisa will discuss key drivers with some detail a little later. The bottom line, pro forma EPS of $2.12 was within our original guidance of $2.02 to $2.19 and was at the high end, excluding foreign exchange. 
Given better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter, principally in BioPharmaceuticals, Microelectronics and Machinery & Equipment, EPS exceeded the high end of the guidance we provided after the second quarter. Operating cash flows came in at $378 million compared to our high-end estimate of $365 million. 
Life Sciences performed well all year, particularly in the key BioPharmaceuticals market, which grew over 10% in local currency. Our Industrial business finished the year with sales down 3%. The global recession and consequent drop in industrial manufacturing activity slowly abated as our year progressed. The effect of scant capital spending is still being felt in our Systems business where the order-to-shipment cycle can be as long as two years. At midyear, Microelectronics rebounded and other sectors began to stir. Industrial turned positive again beginning in the third quarter on the strength of a handful of markets and the remaining markets are now also setting up to grow again.
Total orders grew 19% on the fourth quarter, our focusing in on Pall Industrial, their orders grew 26% over last year's Q4, with all Industrial markets contributing. This follows a 54% increase in orders for Industrial in the third quarter. 
Now staying with Industrial, orders for consumables grew 38% following on a 42% increase in Q3. This reflects increase in customer capacity utilization, some inventory restocking and a revival of customer advertisement capital expenditure. 
A positive for the year was the improvement in gross margin that came in at just above 50%. Those of you who have been following us know that we've been chipping away our cost of sales. We were gratified to see this heavy lifting of reducing our manufacturing footprint and instilling a lean culture, improving margins on systems and implementing our pricing excellence program not just to offset the effects of a weak economy as they did in 2009 but enable us to leverage improving top line in the second half of fiscal '10. 
Before I hand off to Lisa, I'll run down Q4 results by market and give an indication of what we're seeing as we enter our new year. As you saw in the press release last evening, we've made several organizational changes to better manage the business. These changes are illustrated on Slide 6. All year-over-year comparisons are on a restated basis and the discussion on sales and orders with the local currency unless otherwise stated.
Fourth quarter sales came at $679 million and this is up 4% over last year on an as-reported basis. Currency turned from favorable for months of the year to a headwind. Sales grew 6% overall with Life Science, up over 7.5% and Industrial, positive for the second quarter in a row, growing 4%. Sales in the Western Hemisphere increased 14%, with Industrial markets leading at a 20% growth. Europe was down close to 3%, on weakness in several Industrial markets, and Asia overall grew 10%. 
Let's look at the details starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals now represent a quarter of Pall's total sales. It's been a steady contributor. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 10% increase in both consumables and system sales and all regions grew. Some of the key drivers: increased production and filtration of in terms of biotech drugs, the vaccine remarket is remaining strong market, the market for single-use technologies is expanding and emerging markets are beginning to move the needle. 
In short order, China has become the third largest market for drugs in the world. Consumable sales in Asia grew 10% in the year, even though Japan, the most largest Asian country, was flat. Q4 orders increased over 17% and systems orders increased over 100% as capital spending has come back in this market. We entered fiscal year '11 with a strong backlog, up almost 30%.
Turning to Medical. They had a very good closing quarter with sales up 3.6%. The Blood in critical care markets performed. Blood filter sales increased over 3% despite the continuing trend of reduced collections in the U.S. New products here are playing a key role. Hospital critical care had a good quarter with sales up 8%. Sales in Europe were also up about 8%, with the market for water filters as largest and sales in Asia were up sharply. 
New products, as I mentioned before, are key to Medical's growth and about 30% of our sales for the year came from recently introduced products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a strong contributor to Life Sciences profit growth in the quarter. Q4 orders increased almost 6%.
Now at Food and Beverage, which has moved from Industrial and was integrated within the Life Science business, in the quarter, it had also returned to growth. Sales were up over 8% in all regions, with all regions contributing, that is. Consumable sales, a reflection of increasing production increased about 5.5%. System sales nearly doubled in Food and Beverage from the third quarter to the fourth, reflecting improving orders starting in the second quarter. Q4 orders for both consumables and systems increased double digits, and we enter fiscal '11 with a backlog that's up 34% over fiscal '09.
Now I'll swith gears for a review of Pall Industrial, which after a challenging start began to grow in the second half. Much of this growth was driven by the return of Microelectronics. Other markets remain spotty with the pockets of market in geographic strength. Orders increased 26% in the quarter and became widespread. And the entry backlog for Industrial is $465 million, an increase of 28%, again over fiscal '09. 
Now looking at the markets, Energy & Water, which was 20% of Pall's sales in 2010, now consists of three submarkets: Fuels and Chemicals, the largest of the three; Power Generation; and Municipal Water. These market share common imperatives for high yields for protecting assets worth hundreds of million of dollars in each plant and meeting increasingly stringent environmental regs. Pall sales of capital equipments for these markets can be large, lumpy and long term. 
Results today can reflect orders that's as long as two years ago, such as the case in Fuels and Chemicals, where sales decreased 11% in the quarter, reflecting reduced capital orders earlier. Good news here is that the base business has grown 5% after four quarters of double-digit declines. This reflects increasing production particularly in Asia and the Middle East.
Orders increased 6% in Q4 on top of 84% growth in Q3. The large increase in the third quarter includes the Tecnimont job we recently announced. The backlog in Fuels and Chemicals currently exceeds $100 million, an increase of more than 24% over last year.
Power Generation was down 13% in the quarter, but a bright spot of late has been the rapid expansion of the wind turbine market in China and Pall's share has been growing dramatically. Looking ahead, Q4 orders in Power Gen picked up over 40% with base orders, including housings, increasing 50%. Systems orders increased 7%. And these orders for housing and systems work has the growing customer confidence in future demand for Energy. Overall, the backlog in Pall Energy exceeds $165 million, which is up 28% over fiscal '09. 
Let's move on to Municipal Water. This market group's 7% in the quarter, driven by a 57% increase in the Western Hemisphere. The Municipal Water market is, for now, a U.S. centric, although the opportunity is decidedly global. The U.S. market remains strong as municipalities continue to upgrade member infiltration -- to member infiltrations to comply with EPA regulations. U.S. orders almost doubled compared to this time last year, and project activity is accelerating in Asia. We entered fiscal 2011 with $100 million backlog in Muni Water, which is more than a 30% over 2009. This is our highest ever in this market.
Aeropower, now comprised of Aerospace and Machinery & Equipment markets represent 17% of total Pall sales in 2010. Aerospace and Machinery & Equipment are roughly the same size, and overall this Aeropower market grew 4% in the quarter, as M&A grew 28% and is now approaching 2008 levels. Mining, steel and automotive production are good examples of markets driving current results. 
Aerospace was down 14% compared to Q4 '09. It did improve sequentially. Commercial Aero was up slightly after four down quarters, and Military Aero was down as expected. Aeropower orders increased almost 60% with both markets, and in Aerospace and Machinery & Equipment, growing above 50%. All submarkets and regions also contributed. And the backlog in Aeropower is up 18% over the fiscal '09 numbers. 
Now finally, let's go to Microelectronics. Microelectronics finished the fourth quarter up over 35% in sales and 20% for the year, outperforming our full year expectations. The market is being driven by near full utilization rates and chip manufacturers and an improving consumer appetite for electronic products. Recovery is in full swing here at all regions and key segments of this diverse market are participating from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics, such as flat-panel displays, printers and new opportunities, including the emerging High Bright LED market. Growth in MicroE shows no signs abating based on our current order of book and Q4 orders increased 33%. Now with that, let me have Lisa review the financial details."

I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and the year and end with our current expectations for fiscal year 2011.Net earnings in the quarter were $55 million or $0.46 per share compared",1609,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and the year and end with our current expectations for fiscal year 2011.
Net earnings in the quarter were $55 million or $0.46 per share compared to $69.5 million or $0.58 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 22 were $0.72 compared to $0.57 per share, an increase of 26%. Net earnings for the full year was $241.2 million or $2.03 per share compared to $195.6 million or $1.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share were $2.12 compared to $1.77 a year ago, an increase of 20%. Foreign currency translation did not impact earnings per share on the quarter, while an increased earnings per share by $0.10 for the full year.
Sale increased 4% in the quarter. Foreign currency translations decreased the top line by about $12 million or 2%. This was primarily due to the weakening of the euro and to a lesser extent, the British pound against the dollar. The strength of the Japanese yen and several other Asian currencies partly offset this. Excluding this impact, sales were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, reflecting an 8% increase in consumables and a 6% decrease in systems.
Sales increased 3% for the year. Foreign currency translation added about $58 million or 2.5% to our top line. This was primarily the result of the weakening dollar against most Asian currencies, the euro and Canadian dollar. Excluding this impact, sales were up slightly in the year compared to fiscal year 2009. This reflects a 3% increase in consumables, with a 15% decrease in systems.
Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $5 million in the quarter and approximately $12 million in Life Sciences, partly offset by a decline in Industrial for the full year. Gross margins in the fourth quarter improved 370 basis points to 49.8%, with contributions from both businesses. Pall Industrial's gross margins came in at 47.8%, up 570 basis points year-over-year. Key drivers noted in our third quarter continued into the fourth quarter, volume increases at high-margin markets positively impacting mix and overhead absorption, as well as cost savings outpacing inflationary items.
Life Sciences gross margins also improved the year-over-year, coming in at 51.9%, up 160 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement and manufacturing cost reductions. The decline from the third quarter is principally attributable to mix. SG&A was 27.8% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 30% in the third quarter. Year-over-year, SG&A increased 5%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. And for the year, SG&A increased by 3.5%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. The majority of this increase relates to investments we're making to drive sales up and SG&A down. These include the costs of the European management center, the implementation of our global ERP systems and investments in selling and marketing costs, principally in emerging regions. The remainder is attributable to inflation being largely offset by cost reductions. 
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate, or the as-reported tax rate, for the year was 26.4%. Excluding items that we do not consider to be recurring and therefore did not include in the calculation of pro forma earnings per share, Pall's underlying tax rate for the year was 31% favorable to the 31.3% forecasted for the year.
Net interest expense in the year reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million primarily related to the resolution of certain foreign tax audits. Excluding these items, net interest expense decreased by $2 million.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year was $378 million compared to $327 million last year, an increase of over $50 million or about 15%. This reflects improvements in working capital management, particularly accounts payable terms, resulting in a reduction of our cash conversion cycle of about 13 days. This was offset by increased taxes paid and pension funding. 
Other significant uses of cash during the year included $136 million in capital spending, reflecting increased investment in our IT infrastructure and wrapping up our headquarters renovation; $100 million to purchase 2.7 million shares of the company's common stock, leaving approximately $350 million on our current authorizations, and this represents the repurchase of $345 million, cumulatively, for the three years ended July 31, 2010, decreasing our shares outstanding by over 10 million, $71 million in dividends to shareholders, the 10% increase year-over-year and $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. 
The cash position stood at just under $500 million at July 31, 2010, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 19.4%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009. Indebtedness at July 31, 2010, reflects the previously disclosed public offering of $375 million, 5% senior notes due June 15, 2010, as well as outstandings on our new five-year revolving credit facility of about $250 million. These transactions further secure Pall's liquidity for years to come and enhance our operational flexibility. The timing was optimal given historically low interest rates and the abundance of credit.
We just closed the books on a year of achievement and the second year of Pall's 2013 strategic plan. For those of you who are new to Pall, we updated this plan last December. You can find the plan details on the IR branch of our website. While this plan has many elements, the ultimate measure of success will be in two numbers: Pall's earnings per share; and cash flow generation by the end of fiscal 2013. I'm pleased to report that Pall's results for 2010 in these two critical measures put us on track to meeting our goals under the strategic plan. 
And let's look at the significant drivers. Sales were slightly below with the low-single digit growth in local currency expectation for the year. Sales growth in Life Sciences was on plan, while Industrial sales decline of 3% for the year was below. Obtaining price increases in the Industrial economic environment was challenging. Although we are behind plan there, the Pall Industrial sales organization is very focused on this. As Eric mentioned, crossing the 50% gross margin milestone was significant. This was a 290 basis point step up and was ahead of plan, beneficial mix from the outperforming growth of Pharmaceuticals and BioPharmaceuticals and Microelectronics consumable sales, as well as cost savings in manufacturing, are the highlights for the year.
SG&A at 30.8% of sales is slightly behind plan, reflecting the strategic investments we're making. Life Sciences operating margin of 22.6% is on plan, while Industrial's operating margin of 14.1% is ahead of plan on higher-than-expected gross margins in the back half of the year, mitigating the shortfall. Overall EBIT margin of 16.3% is ahead of plan, and earnings per share of $2.12 were at the high end of our expectations, excluding the headwind of foreign currency translation. We are on track with our cash flow and working capital management objectives.
Looking at 2011, we expect local currency sales growth of mid- to high-single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. This is tracking to plan. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% negative to revenue. 
By market, we expect Medical to improve to low-single digit growth. We expect high-single digit growth in BioPharmaceuticals and for Food and Beverage to grow mid-single digits. In Industrial, we expect the Energy markets to grow at mid-single digits and Water, which will be primarily Systems, to grow double digits for overall growth in Energy & Water of mid single digits. 
We expect the Aerospace to deliver high single to low double-digit growth and Machinery & Equipment to grow by mid single digits. For overall Aeropower, this translates to mid to high single-digit growth. And finally, we expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single-digit growth for the year. 
Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51%, which continues to be ahead of the plan. Pricing, volume and continuing manufacturing efficiencies should be partly offset by mixed headwinds as systems and lower-margin markets are expected to recover. SG&A is forecasted to be about 30.5% of sales, and although this is behind plan, we expect the investments we're making the early years of plan to drive SG&A as well as operational costs down in the out years.
That said, expected EBIT margins of 16% to 17% are on track for the plan. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2011 is approximately 27%, which is a 4% reduction in the rate year-over-year as we achieve the August 1 go live for our European headquarters on schedule. 
Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $2.35 and $2.55 and includes an approximate $0.03 headwind from foreign currency translation compared to 2010. This is a $0.10 reduction compared to the December 2009 exchange rate used for the plan. Excluding this, earnings per share is tracking to the plan. Operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of $435 million to $460 million, and capital expenditures are expected to increase to $165 million to $175 million as we continue to invest in our IT, infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities.
We have many levers to employ to achieve our earnings per share and cash flow goals for 2013. The bottom line is that Pall's 2010 results have us on track to achieve them, and our expectations for 2011 keep us there. 
Thank you for your attention this morning, and with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

We appreciate you joining us today as we report our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me this morning are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Cont",1725,"Well, thank you very much. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us today as we report our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me this morning are Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
Now in addition to reviewing the fourth quarter's performance and recapping the year, we will also be providing guidance for our fiscal year 2011. We look forward to your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. As reported last evening, Pall posted a solid fourth quarter and so an upturn in momentum for the second half of the fiscal year. 
Through a judicious cost management, we position Pall to benefit as business conditions improve and we continue to invest and focus on our growth strategy, new products, market applications and regions. Pall announced the ambitious performance goals for fiscal '10 last December. Lisa will discuss key drivers with some detail a little later. The bottom line, pro forma EPS of $2.12 was within our original guidance of $2.02 to $2.19 and was at the high end, excluding foreign exchange. 
Given better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter, principally in BioPharmaceuticals, Microelectronics and Machinery & Equipment, EPS exceeded the high end of the guidance we provided after the second quarter. Operating cash flows came in at $378 million compared to our high-end estimate of $365 million. 
Life Sciences performed well all year, particularly in the key BioPharmaceuticals market, which grew over 10% in local currency. Our Industrial business finished the year with sales down 3%. The global recession and consequent drop in industrial manufacturing activity slowly abated as our year progressed. The effect of scant capital spending is still being felt in our Systems business where the order-to-shipment cycle can be as long as two years. At midyear, Microelectronics rebounded and other sectors began to stir. Industrial turned positive again beginning in the third quarter on the strength of a handful of markets and the remaining markets are now also setting up to grow again.
Total orders grew 19% on the fourth quarter, our focusing in on Pall Industrial, their orders grew 26% over last year's Q4, with all Industrial markets contributing. This follows a 54% increase in orders for Industrial in the third quarter. 
Now staying with Industrial, orders for consumables grew 38% following on a 42% increase in Q3. This reflects increase in customer capacity utilization, some inventory restocking and a revival of customer advertisement capital expenditure. 
A positive for the year was the improvement in gross margin that came in at just above 50%. Those of you who have been following us know that we've been chipping away our cost of sales. We were gratified to see this heavy lifting of reducing our manufacturing footprint and instilling a lean culture, improving margins on systems and implementing our pricing excellence program, not just to offset the effects of a weak economy as they did in 2009 but enable us to leverage improving top line in the second half of fiscal '10. 
Before I hand off to Lisa, I'll run down Q4 results by market and give an indication of what we're seeing as we enter our new year. As you saw in the press release last evening, we've made several organizational changes to better manage the business. These changes are illustrated on Slide 6. All year-over-year comparisons are on a restated basis and the discussion on sales and orders with the local currency unless otherwise stated.
Fourth quarter sales came at $679 million and this is up 4% over last year on an as-reported basis. Currency turned from favorable for months of the year to a headwind. Sales grew 6% overall with Life Science, up over 7.5% and Industrial, positive for the second quarter in a row, growing 4%. Sales in the Western Hemisphere increased 14%, with Industrial markets leading at a 20% growth. Europe was down close to 3%, on weakness in several Industrial markets, and Asia overall grew 10%. 
Let's look at the details starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals now represent a quarter of Pall's total sales. It's been a steady contributor. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 10% increase in both consumables and system sales and all regions grew. Some of the key drivers: increased production and filtration in terms of biotech drugs, the vaccine remarket is remaining strong market, the market for single-use technologies is expanding and emerging markets are beginning to move the needle. 
In short order, China has become the third largest market for drugs in the world. Consumable sales in Asia grew 10% in the year, even though Japan, Pall's largest Asian country, was flat. Q4 orders increased over 17% and systems orders increased over 100% as capital spending has come back in this market. We entered fiscal year '11 with a strong backlog, up almost 30%.
Turning to Medical. They had a very good closing quarter with sales up 3.6%. The Blood in critical care markets performed. Blood filter sales increased over 3% despite the continuing trend of reduced collections in the U.S. New products here are playing a key role. Hospital critical care had a good quarter with sales up 8%. Sales in Europe were also up about 8%, where the market for water filters is largest and sales in Asia were up sharply. 
New products, as I mentioned before, are key to Medical's growth and about 30% of our sales for the year came from recently introduced products. These higher margin products continue to make Medical a strong contributor to Life Sciences profit growth in the quarter. Q4 orders increased almost 6%.
Looking now at Food and Beverage, which has moved from Industrial and was integrated within the Life Science business. In the quarter, it had also returned to growth. Sales were up over 8% in all regions, with all regions contributing, that is. Consumable sales, a reflection of increasing production increased about 5.5%. System sales nearly doubled in Food and Beverage from the third quarter to the fourth, reflecting improving orders starting in the second quarter. Q4 orders for both consumables and systems increased double digits, and we enter fiscal '11 with a backlog that's up 34% over fiscal '09.
Now I'll switch gears for a review of Pall Industrial, which after a challenging start began to grow in the second half. Much of this growth was driven by the return of Microelectronics. Other markets remain spotty with pockets of market in geographic strength. Orders increased 26% in the quarter and became widespread. And the entry backlog for Industrial is $465 million, an increase of 28%, again over fiscal '09. 
Now looking at the markets, Energy & Water, which was 20% of Pall's sales in 2010, now consists of three submarkets: Fuels and Chemicals, the largest of the three; Power Generation; and Municipal Water. These market share common imperatives for high yields for protecting assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars in each plant and meeting increasingly stringent environmental regs. Pall sales of capital equipments to these markets can be large, lumpy and long term. 
Results today can reflect orders that's as long as two years ago, such as the case in Fuels and Chemicals, where sales decreased 11% in the quarter, reflecting reduced capital orders earlier. Good news here is that the base business has grown 5% after four quarters of double-digit declines. This reflects increasing production particularly in Asia and the Middle East.
Orders increased 6% in Q4 on top of 84% growth in Q3. The large increase in the third quarter includes the Tecnimont job we recently announced. The backlog in Fuels and Chemicals currently exceeds $100 million, an increase of more than 24% over last year.
Power Generation was down 13% in the quarter, but a bright spot of late has been the rapid expansion of the wind turbine market in China and Pall's share has been growing dramatically. Looking ahead, Q4 orders in Power Gen picked up over 40% with base orders, including housings, increasing 50%. Systems orders increased 7%. And these orders for housing and systems work has the growing customer confidence in future demand for Energy. Overall, the backlog in Pall Energy exceeds $165 million, which is up 28% over fiscal '09. 
Let's move on to Municipal Water. This market group's 7% in the quarter, driven by a 57% increase in the Western Hemisphere. The Municipal Water market is, for now, a U.S. centric, although the opportunity is decidedly global. The U.S. market remains strong as municipalities continue to upgrade member infiltration -- to member infiltrations to comply with EPA regulations. U.S. orders almost doubled compared to this time last year, and project activity is accelerating in Asia. We entered fiscal 2011 with $100 million backlog in Muni Water, which is more than a 30% over 2009. This is our highest ever in this market.
Aeropower, now comprised of Aerospace and Machinery & Equipment markets represent 17% of total Pall sales in 2010. Aerospace and Machinery & Equipment are roughly the same size, and overall this Aeropower market grew 4% in the quarter, as M&A grew 28% and is now approaching 2008 levels. Mining, steel and automotive production are good examples of markets driving current results. 
Aerospace was down 14% compared to Q4 '09. It did improve sequentially. Commercial Aero was up slightly after four down quarters, and Military Aero was down as expected. Aeropower orders increased almost 60% with both markets, and in Aerospace and Machinery & Equipment, growing above 50%. All submarkets and regions also contributed. And the backlog in Aeropower is up 18% over the fiscal '09 numbers. 
Now finally, let's go to Microelectronics. Microelectronics finished the fourth quarter up over 35% in sales and 20% for the year, outperforming our full year expectations. The market is being driven by near full utilization rates and chip manufacturers and an improving consumer appetite for electronic products. Recovery is in full swing here at all regions and key segments of this diverse market are participating from chip production to the OEMs that supply the industry, consumer electronics, such as flat-panel displays, printers and new opportunities, including the emerging High Bright LED market. Growth in MicroE shows no signs abating based on our current order of book and Q4 orders increased 33%. Now with that, let me have Lisa review the financial details."
185333,112866344,78587,"Pall Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 15, 2010",2010-09-15,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and the year and end with our current expectations for fiscal year 2011.Net earnings in the quarter were $55 million or $0.46 per share compared",1611,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter and the year and end with our current expectations for fiscal year 2011.
Net earnings in the quarter were $55 million or $0.46 per share compared to $69.5 million or $0.58 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 22 were $0.72 compared to $0.57 per share, an increase of 26%. Net earnings for the full year was $241.2 million or $2.03 per share compared to $195.6 million or $1.64 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share were $2.12 compared to $1.77 a year ago, an increase of 20%. Foreign currency translation did not impact earnings per share on the quarter, while an increased earnings per share by $0.10 for the full year.
Sale increased 4% in the quarter. Foreign currency translations decreased the top line by about $12 million or 2%. This was primarily due to the weakening of the euro and to a lesser extent, the British pound against the dollar. The strength of the Japanese yen and several other Asian currencies partly offset this. Excluding this impact, sales were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, reflecting an 8% increase in consumables and a 6% decrease in systems.
Sales increased 3% for the year. Foreign currency translation added about $58 million or 2.5% to our top line. This was primarily the result of the weakening dollar against most Asian currencies, the euro and Canadian dollar. Excluding this impact, sales were up slightly in the year compared to fiscal year 2009. This reflects a 3% increase in consumables, with a 15% decrease in systems.
Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $5 million in the quarter and approximately $12 million in Life Sciences, partly offset by a decline in Industrial for the full year. Gross margins in the fourth quarter improved 370 basis points to 49.8%, with contributions from both businesses. Pall Industrial's gross margins came in at 47.8%, up 570 basis points year-over-year. Key drivers noted in our third quarter continued into the fourth quarter, volume increases at high-margin markets positively impacting mix and overhead absorption, as well as cost savings outpacing inflationary items.
Life Sciences gross margins also improved the year-over-year, coming in at 51.9%, up 160 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement and manufacturing cost reductions. The decline from the third quarter is principally attributable to mix. SG&A was 27.8% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 30% in the third quarter. Year-over-year, SG&A increased 5%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. And for the year, SG&A increased by 3.5%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. The majority of this increase relates to investments we're making to drive sales up and SG&A down. These include the costs of the European management center, the implementation of our global ERP systems and investments in selling and marketing costs, principally in emerging regions. The remainder is attributable to inflation being largely offset by cost reductions. 
Turning to income taxes. The effective tax rate, or the as-reported tax rate for the year was 26.4%. Excluding items that we do not consider to be recurring and therefore did not include in the calculation of pro forma earnings per share, Pall's underlying tax rate for the year was 31% favorable to the 31.3% forecasted for the year. Net interest expense in the year reflects the benefit of reversing interest accrued of approximately $11 million primarily related to the resolution of certain foreign tax audits. Excluding these items, net interest expense decreased by $2 million.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the year was $378 million compared to $327 million last year, an increase of over $50 million or about 15%. This reflects improvements in working capital management, particularly accounts payable terms, resulting in a reduction of our cash conversion cycle of about 13 days. This was offset by increased taxes paid and pension funding. 
Other significant uses of cash during the year included $136 million in capital spending, reflecting increased investment in our IT infrastructure and wrapping up our headquarters renovation; $100 million to purchase 2.7 million shares of the company's common stock, leaving approximately $350 million on our current authorizations, and this represents the repurchase of $345 million, cumulatively, for the three years ended July 31, 2010, decreasing our shares outstanding by over 10 million, $71 million in dividends to shareholders, the 10% increase year-over-year and $18.5 million for the acquisition of a biotechnology company and certain distribution rights. 
The cash position stood at just under $500 million at July 31, 2010, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 19.4%, down from 21.4% at July 31, 2009. Indebtedness at July 31, 2010, reflects the previously disclosed public offering of $375 million, 5% senior notes due June 15, 2010, as well as outstandings on our new five-year revolving credit facility of about $250 million. These transactions further secure Pall's liquidity for years to come and enhance our operational flexibility. The timing was optimal given historically low interest rates and the abundance of credit.
We just closed the books on a year of achievement and the second year of Pall's 2013 strategic plan. For those of you who are new to Pall, we updated this plan last December. You can find the plan details on the IR branch of our website. While this plan has many elements, the ultimate measure of success will be in two numbers: Pall's earnings per share and cash flow generation by the end of fiscal 2013. I'm pleased to report that Pall's results for 2010 in these two critical measures put us on track to meeting our goals under the strategic plan. 
And let's look at the significant drivers. Sales were slightly below with a low-single digit growth in local currency expectation for the year. Sales growth in Life Sciences was on plan, while Industrial sales decline of 3% for the year was below. Obtaining price increases in the Industrial economic environment was challenging. Although we are behind plan there, the Pall Industrial sales organization is very focused on this. As Eric mentioned, crossing the 50% gross margin milestone was significant. This was a 290 basis point step up and was ahead of plan. Beneficial mix from the outperforming growth of Pharmaceuticals and BioPharmaceuticals and Microelectronics consumable sales, as well as cost savings in manufacturing, are the highlights for the year.
SG&A at 30.8% of sales is slightly behind plan, reflecting the strategic investments we're making. Life Sciences operating margin of 22.6% is on plan, while Industrial's operating margin of 14.1% is ahead of plan on higher-than-expected gross margins in the back half of the year, mitigating the shortfall. Overall EBIT margin of 16.3% is ahead of plan, and earnings per share of $2.12 were at the high end of our expectations, excluding the headwind of foreign currency translation. We are on track with our cash flow and working capital management objectives.
Looking at 2011, we expect local currency sales growth of mid- to high-single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. This is tracking to plan. At current rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be about 1% negative to revenue. 
By market, we expect Medical to improve to low-single digit growth. We expect high-single digit growth in BioPharmaceuticals and for Food and Beverage to grow mid-single digits. In Industrial, we expect the Energy markets to grow at mid-single digits and Water, which will be primarily Systems, to grow double digits for overall growth in Energy & Water of mid single digits. 
We expect the Aerospace to deliver high single to low double-digit growth and Machinery & Equipment to grow by mid single digits. For overall Aeropower, this translates to mid to high single-digit growth. And finally, we expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single-digit growth for the year. 
Gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 50% to 51%, which continues to be ahead of the plan. Pricing, volume and continuing manufacturing efficiencies should be partly offset by mixed headwinds as systems and lower-margin markets are expected to recover. SG&A is forecasted to be about 30.5% of sales, and although this is behind plan, we expect the investments we're making in the early years of the plan to drive SG&A as well as operational costs down in the out years.
That said, expected EBIT margins of 16% to 17% are on track for the plan. The forecasted underlying income tax rate for 2011 is approximately 27%, which is a 4% reduction in the rate year-over-year as we achieve the August 1 go live for our European headquarters on schedule. 
Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $2.35 and $2.55 and includes an approximate $0.03 headwind from foreign currency translation compared to 2010. This is a $0.10 reduction compared to the December 2009 exchange rate used for the plan. Excluding this, earnings per share is tracking to the plan. Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million, and capital expenditures are expected to increase to $165 million to $175 million as we continue to invest in our IT, infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities.
We have many levers to employ to achieve our earnings per share and cash flow goals for 2013. The bottom line is that Pall's 2010 results have us on track to achieve them, and our expectations for 2011 keep us there. 
Thank you for your attention this morning, and with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter and following that, we will forward to questions. The first quarter provided a good start to the year. Sales were $605 million, a 12% increase in local currency. Negative exchange rates reduced of this by 1.5%. Revenues increased by double digits in both businesses with sales growth broad-based by market and geography.
Overall orders increased 7%, with consumables growing with just over 8% in the backlog is up over 20% in both consumables and systems. Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew 10% and margins improved. The lead story this quarter is the reemergence of Industrial. Sales grew 14% with healthy contribution from just about every sector. 
Industrials gross margin jumped 300 basis points 247.2%. Operating profit almost doubled from a year ago. On a geographic basis, sales grew both Industrial and Life Science in all regions. 
The Western Hemisphere grew over 25% led by Industrial with sales increased 39%. Europe and Asia grew 5% and 8% respectively. The emerging regions including Latin America, Mainland China, India and Southeast Asia which represent a 10% of total sales grew over 20% as well. The strong top line coupled with Pall's deeply productivity in the gross margin up to 51%, and operating margins over 17%. This is a significant achievement.
With that, let's look at the details starting Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals which represents about 25% of Pall's total sales, had another strong quarter. Revenues increased about 15%, with Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory growing at similar rates. 
Consumable sales were up almost 14% and system sales increased 30%. The bio plasma markets remain strong while the vaccine market was flat even without a separate vaccine for H1N1 this year. Demand for pulse also continues to drive growth. 
All regions advanced the Western Hemisphere nation particularly robust at about 25% growth each. Sales in Europe grew 5%. Sales in the emerging regions while smaller growing quickly, driven by increasing demand and higher level of standards from medical care. Orders remained strong in BioPharmaceuticals with bookings plasma Pharma consumables up over 25%.
Medical also had a good quarter with sales up 5% in all regions contributing. Blood Filtration sales grew slightly despite modest reductions in blood collections in the Western Hemisphere. The OEM submarket grew 19% as reflect increased medical device production in new business for our proprietary materials. The hospital critical care market also grew slightly. Cell therapy of small revenue base was exciting for the future continue to grow by double digits.
Sales into the beverage grew almost 9%. Let's note however, this comparison of Q1 is the lowest point in fiscal 2010 where Food & Beverage sales dropped 18%. All regions of now return to positive territory, led by the Western Hemisphere 25% and Asia at 14%. 
Europe, the largest product in Food and Beverage for Pall grew over the 4% as a continued to recover. Consumable sales grew over 11% reflecting increased production and the success of Pall's system strategy. We are now about Pall's Systems quotation and wine clarification in the field. And we are currently working on the biggest pipeline of systems projects in several years.
Pending legislation currently awaiting House approval to provide an additional boost to palls Food and Beverage business over time. The U.S. Senate recently approved the biggest overhaul to the nation's food-safety logs since the 1930s. The bill has the greater responsibility on manufacturers and farmers to prevent contamination during production. The bill also has powers to the FDA, which recognizes develop filtration, and preventing contamination and a benefit of minority infrastructure quality before final QC.
Now let's move on to Industrial which had quite a good quarter. Sales overall increased 14%. Aeropower came back stronger 24% growth, and two of the three Energy & Water submarkets could double digits. Yet we still saw weakness in capital spending in the larger Fuels and Chemicals submarket. Microelectronics grew over 29%. Let's look at the details starting with Aeropower which grew 24% in Q1.
Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the third quarter in a row. This time, increasing 32%. Sales almost doubled in the Western Hemisphere increased about 15% in Europe, and almost 19% in Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets are in high gear. Q1 orders were also strong. Aerospace grew over 50% after the fourth quarter of double-digit declines. Both submarkets at all regions contributed. 
Military Aerospace up 6%, was driven by Western Hemisphere demand and was about 10%. Shipments were for multiple military programs, including the joint strike fighter as well as U.S. government.
Despite the lack of CH-47 orders which we have expected, we are maintaining our full year outlook for aerospace with other opportunities filling the gap. Commercial Aerospace made a nice comeback in the quarter were 27% growth on contributions from a legion. This affects of inventory stocking by pol distributors to the airline, as well as modest increase in aircraft build rates. 
With Energy & Water Municipal Water and Power Generation performed low the quarter, we saw 11% growth each. Fuels and Chemicals was down 13%, reflecting the have over effect of scant capital orders during the economic downturn. This was exacerbated by challenging comps from some very large system what is the chip a year ago. 
Importantly, increased activity in the sector should consumable sales increasing over by 10%. This was the second quarter in a row of consumables growth after fourth quarter of double-digit declines.  This was driven by the Western Hemisphere 35% growth in Europe at 17%, and reflects increase production of all gas chemicals and polymers. 
Power Generation saw a strong growth in the Western Hemisphere in Asia. Key drivers of their water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak through the ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tightened Industrial production. 
Municipal order sales grew 11% with the help of the Western Hemisphere up 25%. The U.S. market remain strong, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane infiltrations to comply with EPA order quality mandates.
Europe has been weak but orders over the last quarters increased double-digit. The backlog is up to $150 million in Municipal Water which is a 25% increase over last year. So overall, we have mixed been in Energy & Water both my marketing region. The Energy hit as hard as many of the other Industrial markets that back as quickly. 
And finally, say the best for last, microelectronic. Microelectronics remain strong in the operating quarter, with sales up over 29%. All regions in key markets grew. How utilization rate of two producers and how the consumer demand for advanced micro electronic, such as LED display technology. We do not expect this rate of growth to continue, as production catches up with underlying demand and the comps get tougher. The flat panel display market makes down due to well-publicized oversupplied but that was not our Q1 experience.
Orders which have been up sharply for 12 quarters this time, increased 22%. In any case, we continue to expect a good year from Microelectronics. Now with that, Lisa McDermott will review the financial the pills. Lisa?"
185333,116178204,90384,"Pall Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 10, 2010",2010-12-10,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.4 million or $0.61 per share compared to $67 million, or $0.56 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per",1225,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.4 million or $0.61 per share compared to $67 million, or $0.56 per share last year. 
Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 18 was 60 so cents compared to $0.40 per share, an increase of 55%. Foreign currency translation had no material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. 
Quarter one sales increased by 10.7%, foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $8 million, or 1.4%. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro British pound and Korean won, partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Australian dollar.
Including this impact sales were up 12.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year '10, reflecting a 13.6% increase in consumable sales, with contributions from both Life Sciences and Industrial. System sales were essentially flat, as double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Industrial. 
Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $3.2 million to the top line. 
For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-to high-single digits in both life sciences and Industrial. The outlook for some markets have improved a bit since the beginning of the fiscal year. It now looks like medical could grow low to mid-single digits for the year. And BioPharmaceuticals is off to a strong start, and our regional high single-digit outlook, now looks like it could be slightly conservative. 
Our outlook for Food and Beverage still permits single digit growth. Aeropower may also have a better year than we had originally expected. And I believe Aeropower can deliver a high single to low double-digit sales growth with Machinery & Equipment growing by high single to low double-digit, and aerospace growing by low double-digit. 
Our outlook for Energy & Water is unchanged. We continue to expect the Energy market to grow at mid-single digits and water, which will be primarily systems to grow double digits for overall growth in the Energy & Water market of mid-single digits.
Finally, we continue to expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single digits for the year. This contemplates maintaining sales at levels similar to this quarter throughout the fiscal year. 
Gross margin in the first quarter improved 160 basis points compared to last year to 51% with contributions from both businesses. Sequentially, gross margin improved by 120 basis points and it's principally reflects the change in mix from the fourth quarter of 2010 when systems comprised 50% of sales versus about 9% in the first quarter. 
Pall Industrial grow margin they might 47.2% of the branded basis points compared to last year as Eric mentioned.  The improvement in margins is primarily due to continued improvement in factory utilization and overhead absorption driven by volume growth. Also, the estimated benefit of cost-savings initiatives including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations, outpaced inflation.
Life Sciences gross margins also increased, coming in at 54.5%, up 40 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement, and the benefit of sales channel changes, as well as manufacturing cost reductions on a net basis. We continue to project gross margin for the full year to be in the range of 50% to 51%, pricing volume and continued manufacturing efficiency, should be partly offset by mixed headwinds as systems sales surge in the latter part of the year and lower margin markets continue to recover.
SG&A was 30.1% of sales in the first quarter, down from 32.3% in the comparable quarter. SG&A expense increased 4.7% excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 60% of this increase relates to investment related to drive sales up and SG&A down in the future. These includes the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our global ERP system and investments in emerging regions such as Mina where we opened our new office in Dubai in this past quarter. The remainder is attributable to inflationary items. 
Our improved revenue outlook combined with some spending deferred until later in the year, which reduces the fiscal year's spend, should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales at or below 30%. R&D spending rose about 17%, and we expect it'll just under 3.5% of sales for the year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate were as reported rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 10.5% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of foreign tax orders during the first quarter of last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year in the tax rate of about 4% as forecasted. The reduction has contributed about $4 million from the bottom line so far. The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects the tax benefit associated with the establishment of our European headquarters.
Net interest expense in the first quarter of last year reflects the benefit of reversing accrued interest of approximately $9 million, primarily related to the resolution of the foreign tax. 
Including this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million driven by an increase in debt level compared to the same period of last year. Earlier this week, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our revolver which are being repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $58.7 million compared to $73 million last year, a decrease from $14.5 million, or about 20%. This reflected an increase in certain payments tied to fiscal 2010 earnings per share performance, which was considerably stronger than 2009, such as income taxes and variable-based compensation. This was partially offset by continued improvement in working capital management.
Significant uses of cash during the quarter included $62 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $25 million to repurchase approximately 580,000 shares of the company's common stock. And this leads to approximately $328 million of our current authorization.  $25 million in capital spending and $17 million in repayment of debt, net of new borrowing. Our cash position stood at $479 million at October 31, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 18.7%, down from 19.4% at the end of fiscal year 2010.
For the full year, we expect operating cash flows to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million capital expenditures to be in the range of $165 million to $175 million. 
Now as Eric said, this quarter has guided a good start of the year. This see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly, showing through in our results from the top to bottom line. Based upon the first quarter results and outlook, we now expect projected pro EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 for fiscal 2011. This reflects the neutral  impact  foreign currency translation compared to last year to earnings per share based upon our current rates 10, including a euro euro-U.S. exchange rate of 1.3 for the last nine months. Thank you for your attention this market with that, I'll hand this back to Eric."

It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.Lisa and I will review",1303,"Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter, and following that, we look forward to your questions. The first quarter provided a good start to the year. Sales were $605 million, a 12% increase in local currency. Negative exchange rates reduced this by 1.5%. Revenues increased by double digits in both businesses with sales growth broad-based by market and geography.
Overall orders increased 7%, with consumables growing just over 8%, and the backlog is up over 20% in both consumables and systems. Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew over 10% and margins improved. The lead story this quarter is the reemergence of Industrial. Sales grew 14% with healthy contribution from just about every sector. 
Industrials gross margins jumped 300 basis points to 47.2%. Operating profit almost doubled from a year ago. 
On a geographic basis, sales grew in both Industrial and Life Sciences in all regions. The Western Hemisphere grew over 25% led by Industrial with sales increased 39%. Europe and Asia grew 5% and 8%, respectively. The emerging regions we've been focusing on, including Latin America, MENA, China, India and Southeast Asia, which represent about 20% of total sales, grew over 20% as well. The strong top line, coupled with Pall's deeply ingrained productivity improvement culture, drove gross margins up to 51% and operating margins over 17%. This is a significant achievement.
With that, let's look at the details, starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, which represents about 25% of Pall's total sales, had another strong quarter. Revenues increased about 15%, with Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory growing at similar rates. 
Consumable sales were up almost 14%, and system sales increased 30%. The biotech and plasma markets remain strong, while the vaccine market was flat even without a separate vaccine for H1N1 this year. Demand for Pall's single-use technologies also continues to drive growth. 
All regions advanced, with the Western Hemisphere and Asia particularly robust, at about 25% growth each. Sales in Europe grew 5%. Sales in the emerging regions while small are growing quickly, driven by increasing demand and higher level of standards for medical care. Orders remained strong in BioPharmaceuticals with bookings for Pharma consumables up over 25%.
Medical also had a good quarter, with sales up 5% in all regions contributing. Blood Filtration sales grew slightly despite modest reductions in blood collections in the Western Hemisphere. The OEM submarket grew 19%. This reflects increased medical device production in new business for our proprietary materials. The hospital critical care market also grew slightly. Cell therapy of small revenue base today both exciting for the future continued to grow by double digits.
Sales in Food and Beverage grew almost 9%. Let's note, however, this comparison of Q1 is the lowest point in fiscal 2010 where Food and Beverage sales dropped 18%. All regions have now returned to positive territory, led by the Western Hemisphere at 25% and Asia at 14%. 
Europe, the largest part of the Food and Beverage for Pall, grew with 4% as the region continues to recover. Consumable sales grew over 11%, reflecting increased production and the success of Pall's system strategy. There are now about 800 Pall's systems for cold beer filtration and wine clarification in the field. And we are currently working on the biggest pipeline of systems project in several years.
Pending legislation currently awaiting House approval could provide an additional boost to Pall's Food and Beverage business over time. The U.S. Senate recently approved the biggest overhaul to the nation's food safety laws since the 1930s. The bill plays this greater responsibility on manufacturers and farmers to prevent contamination during production. The bill also gives vesting powers to the FDA, which recognizes the role of filtration and preventing contamination, and a benefit of process monitoring to ensure quality before final QC.
Now let's move on to Industrial which had quite a good quarter. Sales overall increased 14%. Aeropower came back strong at 24% growth, and two of the three Energy & Water submarkets grew double digits. Yet we still saw a weakness in capital spending in the larger Fuels and Chemicals submarket. Microelectronics grew over 29%. 
So let's look at the details starting with Aeropower, which grew 24% in Q1. Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the third quarter in a row. This time, increasing 32%. Sales almost doubled in the Western Hemisphere, increased about 15% in Europe and almost 19% in Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets are in high gear. Q1 orders were also strong. Aerospace grew over 15% after four quarters of double-digit declines. Both submarkets in all regions contributed. 
Military Aerospace, up 6%, was driven by Western Hemisphere demand and -- which was up 10%. Shipments were for multiple military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter, as well as spares for the U.S. government.
Despite the lack of CH-47 orders, which we have expected, we are maintaining our full year outlook for aerospace as other opportunities fill in the gaps. Commercial Aerospace made a nice comeback in the quarter with 27% growth on contributions from all regions. This reflects some inventory restocking by Pall distributors to the airline, as well as a modest increase in aircraft build rates. 
With Energy & Water Municipal Water and Power Generation performing well within the quarter, we saw 11% growth each. Fuels and Chemicals was down 13%, reflecting the hangover effect of scant capital orders during the economic downturn. This was exacerbated by challenging comps from some very large systems orders that shipped a year ago. 
Importantly, increased activity in the sector showed true with consumable sales increasing by over 10%. This was the second quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit declines.  This was driven by the Western Hemisphere with 35% growth and Europe at 17%, and reflects increased production of oil, gas, chemicals and polymers. 
Power Generation saw a strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key drivers there were water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak through the ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied industrial production. 
Municipal Water sales grew 11% in the quarter with the Western Hemisphere up 25%. The U.S. market remained strong, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with EPA water quality standards.
Europe has been weak but orders for the last two quarters increased double digits. The backlog is up to $115 million in Municipal Water, which is a 25% increase over last year. So overall, we have a mixed bag in Energy & Water both by market and region. The Energy & Water markets were not hit as hard as many of the other industrial markets nor were they bouncing back as quickly. 
And finally, save the best for last, Microelectronics. Microelectronics remained strong in the opening quarter, with sales up over 29%. All regions and key markets grew, while continues to reflect high utilization rate of chip producers and healthy consumer demand for advanced Microelectronics, such as LED display technology. We do not expect this rate of growth to continue, as production catches up with underlying demand and the comps get tougher. The flat panel display market may slow down due to well-publicized oversupply, but that was not our Q1 experience.
Orders, which have been up sharply for four quarters, this time, increased 22%. In any case, we continue to expect a good year from Microelectronics. 
Now with that, Lisa McDermott will review the financial details. Lisa?"
185333,116178204,90407,"Pall Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 10, 2010",2010-12-10,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone.

Pro forma earnings per",1227,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.4 million or $0.61 per share compared to $67 million or $0.56 per share last year. 
Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 18 was $0.62 compared to $0.40 per share, an increase of 55%. Foreign currency translation had no material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. 
Quarter one sales increased by 10.7%, foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $8 million or 1.4%. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Korean won, partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Australian dollar.
Excluding this impact, sales were up 12.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year '10, reflecting a 13.6% increase in consumable sales, with contributions from both Life Sciences and Industrial. System sales were essentially flat, as double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Industrial. Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $3.2 million to the top line. 
For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth of mid- to high-single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. The outlook for some markets has improved a bit since the beginning of the fiscal year. It now looks like medical could grow low to mid-single digits for the year. And BioPharmaceuticals is off to a strong start, and our regional high single-digit outlook now looks like it could be slightly conservative. 
Our outlook for Food and Beverage still permits single-digit growth. Aeropower may also have a better year than we originally expected. We now believe Aeropower can deliver high single to low double-digit sales growth, with Machinery & Equipment growing by high single to low double-digit, and aerospace growing by low double-digit. 
Our outlook for Energy & Water is unchanged. We continue to expect the Energy market to grow at mid-single digits, and water, which will be primarily systems, to grow double digits, for overall growth in the Energy & Water market of mid-single digits.
Finally, we continue to expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single digits for the year. This contemplates maintaining sales at levels similar to this quarter throughout the fiscal year. 
Gross margin in the first quarter improved 160 basis points compared to last year to 51% with contributions from both businesses. Sequentially, gross margins improved by 120 basis points and this principally reflects the change in mix from the fourth quarter of 2010 when systems comprised 15% of sales versus about 9% in the first quarter. 
Pall Industrial's gross margins came in at 47.2%, up 300 basis points compared to last year, as Eric mentioned.  The improvement in margins was primarily due to continued improvement in factory utilization and overhead absorption driven by volume growth. Also, the estimated benefit of cost-saving initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations, outpaced inflation.
Life Sciences gross margins also increased, coming in at 54.5%, up 40 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement, and the benefit of sales channel changes, as well as manufacturing cost reductions on a net basis. We continue to project gross margins for the full year to be in a range of 50% to 51%. Pricing, volume and continued manufacturing efficiency should be partly offset by mix headwinds as system sales surge in the latter part of the year, and lower margin markets continued to recover.
SG&A was 30.1% of sales in the first quarter, down from 32.3% in the comparable quarter. SG&A expense increased 4.7%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 60% of this increase relates to investments we're making to drive sales up and SG&A down in the future. These include the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our global ERP system and the investments in emerging regions, such as MENA where we opened our new office in Dubai in this past quarter. The remainder is attributable to inflationary items. 
Our improved revenue outlook combined with some spending deferred until later in the year, which reduces the fiscal year's spend, should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales at or below 30%. R&D spending rose about 17%, and we expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter, was 26.8% as compared to 10.5% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of foreign tax orders during the first quarter of last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year and a tax rate of about 4% as forecasted. The reduction has contributed about $4 million to the bottom line so far. The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects the tax benefit associated with the establishment of our European headquarters.
Net interest expense in the first quarter of last year reflects the benefit of reversing accrued interest of approximately $9 million, primarily related to the resolution of this foreign tax audit. Excluding this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million driven by an increase in debt levels compared to the same period of last year. 
Earlier this week, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our revolver, which are being repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $58.7 million compared to $73 million last year, a decrease from $14.5 million or about 20%. This reflects an increase in certain payments tied to fiscal 2010 earnings performance, which was considerably stronger than 2009, such as income taxes and variable-based compensation. This was partially offset by continued improvement in working capital management.
Significant uses of cash during the quarter included $62 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $25 million to repurchase approximately 580,000 shares of the company's common stock. And this leaves approximately $328 million of our current authorization, $25 million in capital spending and $17 million in repayments of debt, net of new borrowing. Our cash position stood at $479 million at October 31, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 18.7%, down from 19.4% at the end of fiscal year 2010.
For the full year, we expect operating cash flows to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million, and capital expenditures to be in the range of $165 million to $175 million. 
Now as Eric said, this quarter provided a good start to the year. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results from the top to the bottom line. Based upon the first quarter results and outlook, we now expect projected pro forma EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 for fiscal 2011. This reflects the neutral  impact from foreign currency translation compared to last year to earnings per share based upon where our current rate stands, including the euro-U.S. exchange rate of $1.3 for the last nine months. 
Thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I will hand this back to Eric."

It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.Lisa and I will review",1303,"Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter, and following that, we look forward to your questions. The first quarter provided a good start to the year. Sales were $605 million, a 12% increase in local currency. Negative exchange rates reduced this by 1.5%. Revenues increased by double digits in both businesses with sales growth broad-based by market and geography.
Overall orders increased 7%, with consumables growing just over 8%, and the backlog is up over 20% in both consumables and systems. Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew over 10% and margins improved. The lead story this quarter is the reemergence of Industrial. Sales grew 14% with healthy contribution from just about every sector. 
Industrials gross margins jumped 300 basis points to 47.2%. Operating profit almost doubled from a year ago. 
On a geographic basis, sales grew in both Industrial and Life Sciences in all regions. The Western Hemisphere grew over 25% led by Industrial with sales increased 39%. Europe and Asia grew 5% and 8%, respectively. The emerging regions we've been focusing on, including Latin America, MENA, China, India and Southeast Asia, which represent about 20% of total sales, grew over 20% as well. The strong top line, coupled with Pall's deeply ingrained productivity improvement culture, drove gross margins up to 51% and operating margins over 17%. This is a significant achievement.
With that, let's look at the details, starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, which represents about 25% of Pall's total sales, had another strong quarter. Revenues increased about 15%, with Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory growing at similar rates. 
Consumable sales were up almost 14%, and system sales increased 30%. The biotech and plasma markets remain strong, while the vaccine market was flat even without a separate vaccine for H1N1 this year. Demand for Pall's single-use technologies also continues to drive growth. 
All regions advanced, with the Western Hemisphere and Asia particularly robust, at about 25% growth each. Sales in Europe grew 5%. Sales in the emerging regions while small are growing quickly, driven by increasing demand and higher level of standards for medical care. Orders remained strong in BioPharmaceuticals with bookings for Pharma consumables up over 25%.
Medical also had a good quarter, with sales up 5% in all regions contributing. Blood Filtration sales grew slightly despite modest reductions in blood collections in the Western Hemisphere. The OEM submarket grew 19%. This reflects increased medical device production in new business for our proprietary materials. The hospital critical care market also grew slightly. Cell therapy of small revenue base today both exciting for the future continued to grow by double digits.
Sales in Food and Beverage grew almost 9%. Let's note, however, this comparison of Q1 is the lowest point in fiscal 2010 where Food and Beverage sales dropped 18%. All regions have now returned to positive territory, led by the Western Hemisphere at 25% and Asia at 14%. 
Europe, the largest part of the Food and Beverage for Pall, grew with 4% as the region continues to recover. Consumable sales grew over 11%, reflecting increased production and the success of Pall's system strategy. There are now about 800 Pall's systems for cold beer filtration and wine clarification in the field. And we are currently working on the biggest pipeline of systems project in several years.
Pending legislation currently awaiting House approval could provide an additional boost to Pall's Food and Beverage business over time. The U.S. Senate recently approved the biggest overhaul to the nation's food safety laws since the 1930s. The bill plays this greater responsibility on manufacturers and farmers to prevent contamination during production. The bill also gives vesting powers to the FDA, which recognizes the role of filtration and preventing contamination, and a benefit of process monitoring to ensure quality before final QC.
Now let's move on to Industrial which had quite a good quarter. Sales overall increased 14%. Aeropower came back strong at 24% growth, and two of the three Energy & Water submarkets grew double digits. Yet we still saw a weakness in capital spending in the larger Fuels and Chemicals submarket. Microelectronics grew over 29%. 
So let's look at the details starting with Aeropower, which grew 24% in Q1. Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the third quarter in a row. This time, increasing 32%. Sales almost doubled in the Western Hemisphere, increased about 15% in Europe and almost 19% in Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets are in high gear. Q1 orders were also strong. Aerospace grew over 15% after four quarters of double-digit declines. Both submarkets in all regions contributed. 
Military Aerospace, up 6%, was driven by Western Hemisphere demand and -- which was up 10%. Shipments were for multiple military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter, as well as spares for the U.S. government.
Despite the lack of CH-47 orders, which we have expected, we are maintaining our full year outlook for aerospace as other opportunities fill in the gaps. Commercial Aerospace made a nice comeback in the quarter with 27% growth on contributions from all regions. This reflects some inventory restocking by Pall distributors to the airline, as well as a modest increase in aircraft build rates. 
With Energy & Water Municipal Water and Power Generation performing well within the quarter, we saw 11% growth each. Fuels and Chemicals was down 13%, reflecting the hangover effect of scant capital orders during the economic downturn. This was exacerbated by challenging comps from some very large systems orders that shipped a year ago. 
Importantly, increased activity in the sector showed true with consumable sales increasing by over 10%. This was the second quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit declines.  This was driven by the Western Hemisphere with 35% growth and Europe at 17%, and reflects increased production of oil, gas, chemicals and polymers. 
Power Generation saw a strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key drivers there were water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak through the ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied industrial production. 
Municipal Water sales grew 11% in the quarter with the Western Hemisphere up 25%. The U.S. market remained strong, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with EPA water quality standards.
Europe has been weak but orders for the last two quarters increased double digits. The backlog is up to $115 million in Municipal Water, which is a 25% increase over last year. So overall, we have a mixed bag in Energy & Water both by market and region. The Energy & Water markets were not hit as hard as many of the other industrial markets nor were they bouncing back as quickly. 
And finally, save the best for last, Microelectronics. Microelectronics remained strong in the opening quarter, with sales up over 29%. All regions and key markets grew, while continues to reflect high utilization rate of chip producers and healthy consumer demand for advanced Microelectronics, such as LED display technology. We do not expect this rate of growth to continue, as production catches up with underlying demand and the comps get tougher. The flat panel display market may slow down due to well-publicized oversupply, but that was not our Q1 experience.
Orders, which have been up sharply for four quarters, this time, increased 22%. In any case, we continue to expect a good year from Microelectronics. 
Now with that, Lisa McDermott will review the financial details. Lisa?"

Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 18 was $0.62 compared to $0.40 per share, an increase of 55%. Foreign currency translation had no material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. 
Quarter one sales increased by 10.7%, foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $8 million or 1.4%. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Korean won, partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Australian dollar.
Excluding this impact, sales were up 12.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year '10, reflecting a 13.6% increase in consumable sales, with contributions from both Life Sciences and Industrial. System sales were essentially flat, as double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Industrial. Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $3.2 million to the top line. 
For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth of mid- to high-single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. The outlook for some markets has improved a bit since the beginning of the fiscal year. It now looks like medical could grow low to mid-single digits for the year. And BioPharmaceuticals is off to a strong start, and our regional high single-digit outlook now looks like it could be slightly conservative. 
Our outlook for Food and Beverage still permits single-digit growth. Aeropower may also have a better year than we originally expected. We now believe Aeropower can deliver high single to low double-digit sales growth, with Machinery & Equipment growing by high single to low double-digit, and aerospace growing by low double-digit. 
Our outlook for Energy & Water is unchanged. We continue to expect the Energy market to grow at mid-single digits, and water, which will be primarily systems, to grow double digits, for overall growth in the Energy & Water market of mid-single digits.
Finally, we continue to expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single digits for the year. This contemplates maintaining sales at levels similar to this quarter throughout the fiscal year. 
Gross margin in the first quarter improved 160 basis points compared to last year to 51% with contributions from both businesses. Sequentially, gross margins improved by 120 basis points and this principally reflects the change in mix from the fourth quarter of 2010 when systems comprised 15% of sales versus about 9% in the first quarter. 
Pall Industrial's gross margins came in at 47.2%, up 300 basis points compared to last year, as Eric mentioned.  The improvement in margins was primarily due to continued improvement in factory utilization and overhead absorption driven by volume growth. Also, the estimated benefit of cost-saving initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations, outpaced inflation.
Life Sciences gross margins also increased, coming in at 54.5%, up 40 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement, and the benefit of sales channel changes, as well as manufacturing cost reductions on a net basis. We continue to project gross margins for the full year to be in a range of 50% to 51%. Pricing, volume and continued manufacturing efficiency should be partly offset by mix headwinds as system sales surge in the latter part of the year, and lower margin markets continued to recover.
SG&A was 30.1% of sales in the first quarter, down from 32.3% in the comparable quarter. SG&A expense increased 4.7%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 60% of this increase relates to investments we're making to drive sales up and SG&A down in the future. These include the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our global ERP system and the investments in emerging regions, such as MENA where we opened our new office in Dubai in this past quarter. The remainder is attributable to inflationary items. 
Our improved revenue outlook combined with some spending deferred until later in the year, which reduces the fiscal year's spend, should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales at or below 30%. R&D spending rose about 17%, and we expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter, was 26.8% as compared to 10.5% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of foreign tax orders during the first quarter of last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year and a tax rate of about 4% as forecasted. The reduction has contributed about $4 million to the bottom line so far. The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects the tax benefit associated with the establishment of our European headquarters.
Net interest expense in the first quarter of last year reflects the benefit of reversing accrued interest of approximately $9 million, primarily related to the resolution of this foreign tax audit. Excluding this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million driven by an increase in debt levels compared to the same period of last year. 
Earlier this week, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our revolver, which are being repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $58.7 million compared to $73 million last year, a decrease from $14.5 million or about 20%. This reflects an increase in certain payments tied to fiscal 2010 earnings performance, which was considerably stronger than 2009, such as income taxes and variable-based compensation. This was partially offset by continued improvement in working capital management.
Significant uses of cash during the quarter included $62 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $25 million to repurchase approximately 580,000 shares of the company's common stock. And this leaves approximately $328 million of our current authorization, $25 million in capital spending and $17 million in repayments of debt, net of new borrowing. Our cash position stood at $479 million at October 31, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 18.7%, down from 19.4% at the end of fiscal year 2010.
For the full year, we expect operating cash flows to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million, and capital expenditures to be in the range of $165 million to $175 million. 
Now as Eric said, this quarter provided a good start to the year. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results from the top to the bottom line. Based upon the first quarter results and outlook, we now expect projected pro forma EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 for fiscal 2011. This reflects the neutral  impact from foreign currency translation compared to last year to earnings per share based upon where our current rate stands, including the euro-U.S. exchange rate of $1.3 for the last nine months. 
Thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I will hand this back to Eric."

And then, the last key leg of that tax forecast is Asia. And we are centralizing our Asian leadership into Singapore. And so, both Switzerland and Singapore are both places that we've negotiated favorable tax position. And in both places, we're putting our leadership managing our supply chain, demand planning. And we're on track with all those things, so working quite diligently through fiscal year '11 to see it come into effect in 2012."

It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I am here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. Lisa and I will review some",1303,"Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I am here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer and Frank Moschella, Corporate Controller. Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter and following that we look forward to your questions.
The first quarter provided a good start to the year. Sales were $605 million, a 12% increase in local currency. Negative exchange rates reduced this by 1.5%. Revenues increased by double digits in both businesses with sales growth broad-based by market and geography. Overall orders increased 7% with consumables growing just over 8% and the backlog is up over 20% in both consumables and systems.
Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew over 10% and margins improved. The lead story this quarter was the reemergence of Industrial, sales grew 14% with healthy contributions from just about every sector. Industrial's gross margins jumped 300 basis points to 47.2%. Operating profit almost doubled from a year ago. On a geographic basis, sales grew in both Industrial and Life Sciences in all regions.
The Western Hemisphere grew over 25% led by Industrial, where sales increased 39%. Europe and Asia grew 5% and 8% respectively. The emerging regions we have been focusing on including Latin America, MENA, China, India and Southeast Asia, which represent about 20% of total sales, grew over 20% as well. The strong top line coupled with Pall’s steeply growing [ph] productivity improvement culture drove gross margins up to 51% and operating margins over 17%, which was a significant achievement.
With that, let’s look at the details starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, which represents about 25% of Pall’s total sales, had another strong quarter. Revenues increased about 15% with pharmaceuticals and laboratory growing at similar rates. Consumable sales were up almost 14% and system sales increased 30%. The biotech and plasma markets remained strong while the vaccine market was flat even without a separate vaccine for H1N1 this year.
Demand for Pall’s single-use technologies also continues to drive growth. All regions advanced with the Western Hemisphere and Asia particularly robust at about 25% growth each. Sales in Europe grew 5%. Sales in the emerging regions while small are growing quickly driven by increasing demand and higher local standards from medical care.
Orders remained strong in BioPharmaceuticals with booking for Pharma consumables up over 25%. Medical also had a good quarter with sales up 5% and all regions contributing. Blood Filtration sales grew slightly despite modest reductions in blood collections in the Western Hemisphere.
The OEM sub-market grew 19%. This reflects increased medical device production and new business for our proprietary materials. The hospital critical care market also grew slightly. Self therapy, a small revenue base today but exciting for the future continued to grow by double digits.
Sales in Food & Beverage grew almost 9%. Let's note, however, the comparison of Q1 is to the lowest point in fiscal 2010 where Food & Beverage sales dropped 18%. All regions have now returned to positive territory led by the Western Hemisphere at 25% and Asia at 14%.
Europe, the largest part of the food and beverage market for Pall grew at 4% as the region continues to recover. Consumable sales grew over 11% reflecting increased production and the success of Pall Systems strategy.
There are now about 800 Pall Systems for (inaudible) diafiltration and wine clarification in the field and we're currently working on the biggest pipeline of Systems projects in several years.
Pending legislation currently awaiting House approval could provide an additional boost to Pall's Food & Beverage business over time. The U.S. Senate recently approved the biggest overhaul to the nation's food safety laws since the 1930s. The bill places greater responsibility on manufacturers and farmers to prevent contamination during production. The bill also gives vast new powers to the FDA, which recognize that developed filtration and protecting or preventing contamination and the benefit of process monitoring to ensure quality before final QC.
Now, let's move on to Industrial, which had quite a good quarter. Sales overall increased 14%. Aeropower came back strong at 24% growth, and two of the three Energy and Water submarkets grew double digits. We still saw a weakness in capital spending in the larger fields in chemical submarket. Microelectronics grew over 29%.
So let's look at the details starting with Aeropower, which grew 24% in Q1. Machinery and Equipment posted double-digit growth for the third quarter in a row; this time increasing 32%. Sales almost doubled in the Western Hemisphere, increased about 15% in Europe and almost 19% in Asia. The global mining and primary metals markets are in high gear. Q1 orders were also strong.
Aerospace grew over 15% after four quarters of double-digit declines, both submarkets and all regions contributed. Military Aerospace, up 6%, was driven by Western Hemisphere demand, which was up 10%. Shipments were for multiple military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter as well as spares for U.S. government. Despite the lack of CH-47 orders, which we had expected, we are maintaining our full-year outlook for aerospace as other opportunities fill in the gaps. Commercial aerospace made a nice comeback in the quarter with 27% growth on contributions from all regions. This reflects some inventory restocking by Pall distributors to the airlines as well as a modest increase in aircraft build rates.
With Energy and Water, Municipal Water and Power Generation performing well within the quarter, we saw 11% growth each. Fuels and Chemicals was down 13%, reflecting the hangover effect of scant capital orders during the economic downturn. This was exacerbated by challenging comps from some very large systems orders that shipped a year ago. Importantly, increased activity in the sector stayed true with consumable sales increasing by over 10%. This is the second quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit declines. This was driven by the Western Hemisphere at 35% growth and Europe at 17% and reflects increased production of oil, gas, chemicals, and polymers.
Power Generation saw a strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key drivers there were water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak due to ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied to industrial production.
Municipal Water sales grew 11% in the quarter with sales in the Western Hemisphere up 25%. The U.S. market remained strong as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with EPA Water Quality Standards. Europe has been weak, but orders through the last two quarters increased double-digits. The backlog is up to 115 million in municipal water, which is a 25% increase over last year. So overall, we have a mixed bag in Energy and Water booked by market and region. The Energy and Water markets were not hit as hard as many of the other industrial markets, nor are they bouncing back as quickly.
Finally, to save the best for last, Microelectronics; Microelectronics remained strong in the opening quarter with sales up over 29%. All regions and key customer markets grew. Growth continues to reflect high utilization rates of chip producers and healthy consumer demand for advanced Microelectronics, such as LED display technology. We do not expect this rate of growth to continue as production catches up with underlying demand and the comps get tougher. The flat panel display market mix were down due to well-publicized oversupply, but that was not our Q1 experience. Orders, which have been up sharply for four quarters, this time increased 22%. In any case we continue to expect a good year for Microelectronics.
Now with that, Lisa McDermott will review the financial details. Lisa?

185333,116178204,90424,"Pall Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 10, 2010",2010-12-10,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone.

Pro forma earnings per sh",1217,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.4 million or $0.61 per share compared to $57 million or $0.56 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per share, as defined on slide 18, was $0.62 compared to $0.40 per share, an increase of 55%.
Foreign currency translation had no material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. Quarter one sales increased by 10.7%, foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $8 million or 1.4%. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, and Korean won, partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Australian dollar.
Excluding this impact, sales were up 12.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year '10 reflecting a 13.6% increase in consumable sales with contributions from both Life Sciences and Industrial. System sales were essentially flat as double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a mid-single digit decline in Industrial.
Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $3.2 million to the top line. For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth of mid-to-high single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. The outlook for some markets has improved a bit since the beginning of the fiscal year.
It now looks like Medical could growth low-to-mid single digits for the year. Biopharmaceuticals is off to a strong start and our original high-single digit outlook now looks like it could be slightly conservative. Our outlook for food and beverage is still for mid-single digit growth.
Aeropower may also have a better year than we originally expected. We now believe Aeropower can deliver a high-single to low-double digit sales growth with Machinery and Equipment growing by high-single to low-double digits and Aerospace growing by low-double digits. Our outlook for Energy and Water is unchanged. We continue to expect the energy markets to grow at mid single-digits, and water, which will be primarily systems, to grow double-digits, for overall growth in the energy and water markets of mid single-digits.
Finally, we continue to expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single-digit for the year. This contemplates maintaining sales at levels similar to this quarter throughout the fiscal year.
Gross margin in the first quarter improved 160 basis points compared to last year, to 51%, with contributions from both businesses. Sequentially, gross margins improved by 120 basis points, and this principally reflects the changing mix from the fourth quarter of 2010 when systems comprised 15% of sales versus about 9% in the first quarter.
Pall Industrial's gross margins came in at 47.2%, up 300 basis points compared to last year, as Eric mentioned. The improvement in margins was primarily due to continued improvement in factory utilization and overhead absorption driven by volume growth. Also, the estimated benefit of cost saving initiatives, including improved efficiency in manufacturing operations, outpaced inflation.
Life Sciences' gross margins also increased, coming in at 54.5%, up 40 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement and the benefit of sales channel changes as well as manufacturing cost reductions on a net basis.
We continue to project gross margins for the full year to be in the range of 50% to 51%. Pricing, volume, and continued manufacturing efficiencies should be partly offset by mix headwinds as system sales surge in the later part of the year and lower-margin markets continued to recover.
SG&A was 30.1% of sales in the first quarter, down from 32.3% in the comparable quarter. SG&A expense increased 4.7% excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 60% of this increase relates to investments drive sales up and SG&A down in the future. These include the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our Global ERP system and investments in emerging regions such as MENA where we opened our new office in Dubai in this past quarter.
The remainder is attributable to inflationary items. Our improved revenue outlook combined with some spending deferred into later in the year which reduces the fiscal year's spend should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales at or below 30%.
R&D spending rose about 17% and we expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year. Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter was 26.8% as compared to 10.5% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of foreign tax audits during the first quarter of last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year in the tax rate of about 4% as forecasted. The reduction has contributed about $4 million for the bottom line so far.
The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters. Net interest expense in the first quarter of last year reflects the benefit of reversing accrued interest of approximately $9 million primarily related to the resolution of the foreign tax audit. Excluding this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million driven by an increase in debt levels compared to the same period of last year.
Earlier this week, we issued $205 million of commercial paper, at just about 1.2% including support cost. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our revolver which are being repaid with proceeds from the commercial paper issuance.
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow on the quarter was $58.7 million, compared to $73 million last year, a decrease of $14.5 million or about 20%. This reflects an increase in certain payments tied to fiscal 2010 earnings performance, which was considerably stronger than 2009 such as income taxes and variable base compensation. This was partially offset by continued improvement in working capital management.
Significant uses of cash during the quarter included $62 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $25 million to repurchase approximately 580,000 shares of the company's common stock. This leaves approximately $328 million of our current authorization. $25 million in capital spending and $17 million in repayments of debt net of new borrowings.
Our cash position stood at $479 million at October 31st, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 18.7%, down from 19.4% at the end of fiscal year 2010.
For the full year, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million, and capital expenditures to be in the range of $165 million to $175 million.
Now, as Eric said this quarter provided a good start to the year. We see the successful execution of key initiatives clearly show improvement in our results from the top to the bottom line. Based upon the first quarter results and outlook, we now expect projected pro forma EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 for fiscal 2011.
This reflects the neutral impact from foreign currency translation compared to last year to earnings per share based upon where current rate stands, including a euro-U.S. exchange rate of 1.3 through the last nine months.
Thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I will hand this back to Eric.

You should note that our updated outlook provides some caution that the year-over-year EPS growth is expected to lessen as we move through fiscal 2011. The first quarter included inventory replenishments. One major variable in our guidance is Microelectronics. Our forward visibility in this highly cyclical market is only about three months. We are currently projecting Microelectronics revenues to show no growth in the second half of the year, we’ll see.
Now, we’ve covered a lot ground this morning and appreciate your patience. Now, with the help of the conference operator we are ready for your questions.

It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.Lisa and I will review",1306,"Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here to review Pall's first quarter results with you. Thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Lisa McDermott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Moschella, our Corporate Controller.
Lisa and I will review some of the details and drivers of the quarter, and following that, we look forward to your questions. The first quarter provided a good start to the year. Sales were $605 million, a 12% increase in local currency. Negative exchange rates reduced this by 1.5%. Revenues increased by double digits in both businesses with sales growth broad-based by market and geography.
Overall orders increased 7%, with consumables growing just over 8%, and the backlog is up over 20% in both consumables and systems. Life Sciences continued to perform well. The top line grew over 10% and margins improved. The lead story this quarter is the reemergence of Industrial. Sales grew 14% with healthy contribution from just about every sector. 
Industrial’s gross margins jumped 300 basis points to 47.2%. Operating profit almost doubled from a year ago. 
On a geographic basis, sales grew in both Industrial and Life Sciences in all regions. The Western Hemisphere grew over 25% led by Industrial with sales increased 39%. Europe and Asia grew 5% and 8%, respectively. The emerging regions we've been focusing on, including Latin America, MENA, China, India and Southeast Asia, which represent about 20% of total sales, grew over 20% as well. The strong top line, coupled with Pall's deeply ingrained productivity improvement culture, drove gross margins up to 51% and operating margins over 17%. This is a significant achievement.
With that, let's look at the details, starting with Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals, which represents about 25% of Pall's total sales, had another strong quarter. Revenues increased about 15%, with Pharmaceuticals and Laboratory growing at similar rates. 
Consumable sales were up almost 14%, and system sales increased 30%. The biotech and plasma markets remain strong, while the vaccine market was flat even without a separate vaccine for H1N1 this year. Demand for Pall's single-use technologies also continues to drive growth. 
All regions advanced, with the Western Hemisphere and Asia particularly robust, at about 25% growth each. Sales in Europe grew 5%. Sales in the emerging regions while small are growing quickly, driven by increasing demand and higher level of standards for medical care. Orders remained strong in BioPharmaceuticals with bookings for Pharma consumables up over 25%.
Medical also had a good quarter, with sales up 5% in all regions contributing. Blood Filtration sales grew slightly despite modest reductions in blood collections in the Western Hemisphere. The OEM submarket grew 19%. This reflects increased medical device production in new business for our proprietary materials. The hospital critical care market also grew slightly. Cell therapy, a small revenue base today but exciting for the future, continued to grow by double digits.
Sales in Food and Beverage grew almost 9%. Let's note, however, this comparison of Q1 is the lowest point in fiscal 2010 where Food and Beverage sales dropped 18%. All regions have now returned to positive territory, led by the Western Hemisphere at 25% and Asia at 14%. 
Europe, the largest part of the Food and Beverage market for Pall, grew with 4% as the region continues to recover. Consumable sales grew over 11%, reflecting increased production and the success of Pall's system strategy. There are now about 800 Pall's systems for cold beer filtration and wine clarification in the field. And we are currently working on the biggest pipeline of systems projects in several years.
Pending legislation currently awaiting House approval could provide an additional boost to Pall's Food and Beverage business over time. The U.S. Senate recently approved the biggest overhaul to the nation's food safety laws since the 1930s. The bill places this greater responsibility on manufacturers and farmers to prevent contamination during production. The bill also gives vast new powers to the FDA, which recognizes the role of filtration and preventing contamination, and a benefit of process monitoring to ensure quality before final QC.
Now let's move on to Industrial which had quite a good quarter. Sales overall increased 14%. Aeropower came back strong at 24% growth, and two of the three Energy & Water submarkets grew double digits. Yet we still saw a weakness in capital spending in the larger Fuels and Chemicals submarket. Microelectronics grew over 29%. 
So let's look at the details starting with Aeropower, which grew 24% in Q1. Machinery & Equipment posted double-digit growth for the third quarter in a row. This time, increasing 32%. Sales almost doubled in the Western Hemisphere, increased about 15% in Europe and almost 19% in Asia. The global mining in primary metals markets are in high gear. Q1 orders were also strong. Aerospace grew over 15% after four quarters of double-digit declines. Both submarkets in all regions contributed. 
Military Aerospace, up 6%, was driven by Western Hemisphere demand and -- which was up 10%. Shipments were for multiple military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter, as well as spares for the U.S. government.
Despite the lack of CH-47 orders, which we had expected, we are maintaining our full year outlook for aerospace as other opportunities fill in the gaps. Commercial Aerospace made a nice comeback in the quarter with 27% growth on contributions from all regions. This reflects some inventory restocking by Pall distributors to the airline, as well as a modest increase in aircraft build rates. 
With Energy & Water, Municipal Water and Power Generation performing well within the quarter, we saw 11% growth each. Fuels and Chemicals was down 13%, reflecting the hangover effect of scant capital orders during the economic downturn. This was exacerbated by challenging comps from some very large systems orders that shipped a year ago. 
Importantly, increased activity in the sector showed true with consumable sales increasing by over 10%. This was the second quarter in a row of consumables growth after four quarters of double-digit declines.  This was driven by the Western Hemisphere with 35% growth and Europe at 17%, and reflects increased production of oil, gas, chemicals and polymers. 
Power Generation saw a strong growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Key drivers there were water treatment systems for U.S. power generation stations and continued expansion of the wind turbine market in China. Europe remained weak through the ongoing challenges in the turbomachinery market and from reduced demand for power tied industrial production. 
Municipal Water sales grew 11% in the quarter with the Western Hemisphere up 25%. The U.S. market remained strong, as municipalities continue to upgrade to membrane filtration to comply with EPA water quality standards.
Europe has been weak, but orders for the last two quarters increased double digits. The backlog is up to $115 million in Municipal Water, which is a 25% increase over last year. So overall, we have a mixed bag in Energy & Water both by market and region. The Energy & Water markets were not hit as hard as many of the other industrial markets nor were they bouncing back as quickly. 
And finally, save the best for last, Microelectronics. Microelectronics remained strong in the opening quarter, with sales up over 29%. All regions and key customer markets grew, while continues to reflect high utilization rate of chip producers and healthy consumer demand for advanced Microelectronics, such as LED display technology. We do not expect this rate of growth to continue, as production catches up with underlying demand and the comps get tougher. The flat panel display market may slow down due to well-publicized oversupply, but that was not our Q1 experience.
Orders, which have been up sharply for four quarters, this time, increased 22%. In any case, we continue to expect a good year from Microelectronics. 
Now with that, Lisa McDermott will review the financial details. Lisa?"
185333,116178204,90428,"Pall Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 10, 2010",2010-12-10,"Earnings Calls","Pall Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.4 million or $0.61 per share compared to $67 million or $0.56 per share last year. Pro forma earnings per",1227,"Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Pall's financial results for the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter were $71.4 million or $0.61 per share compared to $67 million or $0.56 per share last year. 
Pro forma earnings per share as defined on Slide 18 was $0.62 compared to $0.40 per share, an increase of 55%. Foreign currency translation had no material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. 
Quarter one sales increased by 10.7%, foreign currency translation decreased the top line by about $8 million or 1.4%. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Korean won, partly offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Australian dollar.
Excluding this impact, sales were up 12.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year '10, reflecting a 13.6% increase in consumable sales, with contributions from both Life Sciences and Industrial. System sales were essentially flat, as double-digit growth in Life Sciences was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Industrial. Pricing gains in Life Sciences and Industrial contributed approximately $3.2 million to the top line. 
For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth of mid- to high-single digits in both Life Sciences and Industrial. The outlook for some markets has improved a bit since the beginning of the fiscal year. It now looks like medical could grow low to mid-single digits for the year. And BioPharmaceuticals is off to a strong start, and our original high single-digit outlook now looks like it could be slightly conservative. 
Our outlook for Food and Beverage still permits single-digit growth. Aeropower may also have a better year than we originally expected. We now believe Aeropower can deliver high single to low double-digit sales growth, with Machinery & Equipment growing by high single to low double-digit, and aerospace growing by low double-digit. 
Our outlook for Energy & Water is unchanged. We continue to expect the Energy market to grow at mid-single digits, and water, which will be primarily systems, to grow double digits, for overall growth in the Energy & Water market of mid-single digits.
Finally, we continue to expect Microelectronics growth to stabilize at high single digits for the year. This contemplates maintaining sales at levels similar to this quarter throughout the fiscal year. 
Gross margin in the first quarter improved 160 basis points compared to last year to 51% with contributions from both businesses. Sequentially, gross margins improved by 120 basis points and this principally reflects the change in mix from the fourth quarter of 2010 when systems comprised 15% of sales versus about 9% in the first quarter. 
Pall Industrial's gross margins came in at 47.2%, up 300 basis points compared to last year, as Eric mentioned.  The improvement in margins was primarily due to continued improvement in factory utilization and overhead absorption driven by volume growth. Also, the estimated benefit of cost-saving initiatives, including improved efficiency and manufacturing operations, outpaced inflation.
Life Sciences gross margins also increased, coming in at 54.5%, up 40 basis points. This reflects continued pricing improvement, and the benefit of sales channel changes, as well as manufacturing cost reductions on a net basis. We continue to project gross margins for the full year to be in a range of 50% to 51%. Pricing, volume and continued manufacturing efficiency should be partly offset by mix headwinds as system sales surge in the latter part of the year, and lower margin markets continued to recover.
SG&A was 30.1% of sales in the first quarter, down from 32.3% in the comparable quarter. SG&A expense increased 4.7%, excluding the estimated impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 60% of this increase relates to investments we're making to drive sales up and SG&A down in the future. These include the cost of building up our European and Asian headquarters, the implementation of our global ERP system and the investments in emerging regions, such as MENA where we opened our new office in Dubai in this past quarter. The remainder is attributable to inflationary items. 
Our improved revenue outlook combined with some spending deferred until later in the year, which reduces the fiscal year's spend, should result in full year SG&A as a percentage of sales at or below 30%. R&D spending rose about 17%, and we expect it will be just under 3.5% of sales for the year.
Turning to income taxes, the effective tax rate or as reported rate for the quarter, was 26.8% as compared to 10.5% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Excluding the benefit from the favorable resolution of foreign tax audits during the first quarter of last year, this represents a sustainable reduction year-over-year and a tax rate of about 4% as forecasted. The reduction has contributed about $4 million to the bottom line so far. The full year forecasted rate of about 27% reflects the tax benefits associated with the establishment of our European headquarters.
Net interest expense in the first quarter of last year reflects the benefit of reversing accrued interest of approximately $9 million, primarily related to the resolution of this foreign tax audit. Excluding this item, net interest expense increased by approximately $1 million driven by an increase in debt levels compared to the same period of last year. 
Earlier this week, we issued $205 million of commercial paper at just about 1.2%, including support costs. This is about 1% lower than the borrowings under our revolver, which are being repaid with the proceeds from the commercial paper issuance. 
Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $58.7 million compared to $73 million last year, a decrease from $14.5 million or about 20%. This reflects an increase in certain payments tied to fiscal 2010 earnings performance, which was considerably stronger than 2009, such as income taxes and variable-based compensation. This was partially offset by continued improvement in working capital management.
Significant uses of cash during the quarter included $62 million return to shareholders, with dividends of $37 million and $25 million to repurchase approximately 580,000 shares of the company's common stock. And this leaves approximately $328 million of our current authorization, $25 million in capital spending and $17 million in repayments of debt, net of new borrowing. Our cash position stood at $479 million at October 31, and our net debt to net debt plus equity was 18.7%, down from 19.4% at the end of fiscal year 2010.
For the full year, we expect operating cash flows to be in the range of $435 million to $460 million, and capital expenditures to be in the range of $165 million to $175 million. 
Now as Eric said, this quarter provided a good start to the year. We see the successful execution on key initiatives clearly showing through in our results from the top to the bottom line. Based upon the first quarter results and outlook, we now expect projected pro forma EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 for fiscal 2011. This reflects the neutral impact from foreign currency translation compared to last year to earnings per share based upon where our current rate stands, including the euro-U.S. exchange rate of $1.3 for the last nine months. 
Thank you for your attention this morning. With that, I will hand this back to Eric."

The first quarter included inventory replenishments. 
One major variable in our guidance is Microelectronics. Our forward visibility in this highly cyclical market is only about three months. We are currently projecting Microelectronics revenue to show no growth in the second half of the year. We'll see.
