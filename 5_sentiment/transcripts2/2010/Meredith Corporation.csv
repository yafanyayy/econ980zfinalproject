Today, I will start with some thoughts on the current business environment and the trends that we are experiencing, followed by a discussion of a series of strategic initiatives to improve our market position and of course to grow revenue.
Joe Ceryanec, our Chief Financial Officer, will go into greater depth on our financials and provide our earnings outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Joining us for the Q&A is Jack Griffin, our National Media Group President; and Paul Karpowicz, the President of our Local Media Group.
Let me start this morning with a very brief financial overview. Earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, including a special charge of $0.07 related to the repositioning of our Special Interest Media business as we announced earlier. Excluding special charges in both periods, earnings per share were $0.49, even with the prior year and slightly ahead of our previously stated expectation.
Revenues were $337 million compared to $360 million a year ago. We recorded $14 million or $0.19 per share less in net political advertising revenues during the second quarter of fiscal ’10, a non-political year compared to last year of fiscal ’09. Looking broadly across our businesses, we are continuing to see improving trends in advertising. However, advertising revenues are still weak compared to historic levels and our visibility is increasingly limited. This of course makes forecasting future results more difficult.
I would like to spend just a minute or two reviewing our calendar 2009 advertising performance. Our National Media Group delivered sequential quarterly improvement in advertising revenues, by far the best performance in our peer group and much better than the industry taken as a whole. Five Meredith titles, Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, More, Fitness along with Ladies’ Home Journal increased ad revenues as measured by Publishers Information Bureau. That’s a remarkable achievement when you consider that just 14 titles among the more than 200 measured magazines across the industry had growth in calendar 2009.
Additionally, Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens finished Number 1 and Number 2 in advertising pages in the highly competitive women’s lifestyle category. Both titles were named to Advertising Age’s A-list of the nation’s top magazines, while Fitness was named the most improved publication by the Media Industry Newsletter. Our Local Media Group also delivered sequential quarterly improvement in non-political advertising revenue, gaining market share in the process. We finished the calendar year, particularly strong, delivering a 4% gain in non-political advertising revenues in the fourth calendar quarter.
Clearly, the performance improvement plan we formulated 18 months ago has helped us navigate what was a very difficult calendar 2009 across the media industry. The four key elements of that plan include gaining market share in our national magazine and local television operations, increasing our already strong connection to the American consumer, growing new streams of revenue, particularly those not dependent on traditional advertising, along with exercising disciplined expense control and aggressive cash management. I will detail the progress we are making on those initiatives as we take a closer look at operating group performance in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal ’10, starting with our National Media Group.
During the second quarter, we continued to see National Media Group advertising revenues improve. While off 2% from a year ago, advertising revenue performance has improved in each of the last four quarters. At the same time, the National Media Group operating expenses declined 10%, driving a 25% increase in group operating profit in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. Better Homes and Gardens grew advertising revenues by 7%. More and Fitness magazines also grew ad revenue in the quarter.
Our share of overall magazine industry advertising revenues increased to 11.7% in the second quarter of fiscal ’10, up from 9.4% in the prior year, once again according to the latest data from the Publishers Information Bureau. Additionally, our market share grew by about 2 points to 37% as measured against our 28-title competitive set. The market share gains we are delivering are driven by several factors. First of all, our branded editorial content focuses on the subjects that matter most to women. That emphasis is more important than ever as consumers look for sound practical advice.
Second, our advertisers are seeking the most value for their advertising dollars. The reach and the efficiency of our portfolio particularly among our largest brands continue to work in our favor. Third, we have a sales organization that can create and also deliver multi-platform marketing campaigns that help our customers sell more products at retail. These programs now represent approximately 20% of our overall advertising revenues. During the second quarter, Family Circle partnered with IKEA to launch an experiential cooking program, featuring seminars taught by celebrity chefs.
The Better Homes and Gardens’ 2010 Best New Products Award attracted more than 50 brands to participate. More magazines signed Wells Fargo as the presenting sponsor for its three reinvention conventions that are scheduled in 2010, and also one new advertising business from Cadillac, Lincoln, and Ford. Finally, during the quarter, we were ranked Number 1 among all media companies by the Advertiser Intelligence Report in terms of advertiser perception. We were ahead of both our publishing peers as well as other media companies, including Google, ESPN, and Disney.
Turning now to circulation, revenues rose slightly in the period. Profit and related margin increased during the quarter compared to the prior period as well. Our performance was assisted by efficiencies in our subscription operation. Total readership across our magazines increased in the most recent report from Mediamark Research & Intelligence and we gained market share of the newsstand as well. Average monthly unique visitors to Meredith nationally branded Website increased more than 35% to over 20 million and page views per month averaged over 260 million, both were record levels.
These gains were driven by a wide variety of content created for the holiday season along with new social media capabilities. Visitors viewed more than 6 million videos during the quarter, four times the number seen a year ago. During the quarter, we announced our investment in a new venture with Time Inc, Conde Nast, Hearst, and News Corp to create open standards for a new digital store front, allowing consumers to enjoy their favorite media content on portable digital devices.
It will also include a rich array of innovative advertising opportunities. We will derive revenue from content creation, advertising, along with sales of traditional print subscription. At Meredith Integrated Marketing, we are seeing a strong pipeline of new business activity and have been successful in turning some of those proposals into significant new business. In December, Meredith Integrated Marketing won new business, developing and managing Chrysler Group’s customer relationship management initiative in both the United States and in Canada. The assignment covers the full vehicle ownership life cycle from welcome packages through off-lease marketing. It includes communicating with in-market and prospective customers via direct mail and email marketing along with social media initiatives as well.
In addition, Wells Fargo commissioned integrated marketing to complete an analysis of its digital space and helped develop a customer relationship management program for that company as well. Our brand licensing revenues grew 25% in the quarter primarily as a result of our ongoing relationship with Walmart. The number of SKUs at Walmart tripled to over 1,500 compared to the year-ago period. During the quarter, we announced a new bedding program called Seasonal Harvest, a line of custom paint and a number of new holiday décor items.
To summarize the National Media Group discussions, while the advertising environment remains challenging, we are encouraged by the market share gains and improving quarter-over-quarter revenue trends. Our consumer connection is strong. We continue to develop businesses that are not dependent on advertising, and we are prudently managing our expenses.
Now, turning to our Local Media Group, as I mentioned a few moments ago, fiscal 2010 second quarter non-political advertising revenues grew 4%. Stations in 9 of our 10 television markets posted growth in non-political ad revenues. The Local Media Group also outperformed the industry as a whole by approximately 3 percentage points in non-political advertising revenues during the quarter according to the most recently available data from the Television Bureau of Advertising. These gains were aided by stronger ratings posted by many of our television stations during the November suite period.
Our CBS affiliate in Atlanta made significant rating gains across all key newscast. We more than doubled our ratings in morning news and late news by nearly 30%. Our stations in Hartford, Nashville and Las Vegas captured a larger share of morning news viewers while Harford and Portland maintained their Number 1 position. In the evening and late news periods where advertising rates are the highest, we grew viewership and ratings in Kansas City, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Hartford maintained its # 1 position across all of its newscast.
Looking at new revenue streams, re-transmission fees nearly doubled in the second quarter and we expect those fees will be more than $20 million as we close fiscal 2010. Meredith Video Studios also posted strong revenue growth in the quarter. The gains were driven primarily by growth in custom video projects for corporate clients as well as the continued expansion of the daily Better television show. Better is now in 55 markets and reaches more than 45% of the US households. During the quarter, Video Studios formed distribution agreements with YouTube, Google, Sprint TV, Grab Network and others that will include carriage of our branded video content across more than 150,000 new Websites.
To summarize our Local Media Group discussion, the television industry has been experiencing one of the most difficult advertising environments in its history, but we are driving improved non-political advertising revenue performance and continue to believe that television is the most powerful and efficient way for advertisers to reach the American consumer. Additionally, we are encouraged by our ability to grow new revenue streams, including re-transmission fees and video content creation.
Now, I will turn the discussion over to our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Ceryanec.

As Steve noted, earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, and that included a special charge of $0.07 per share, that’s $0.49 without the special charge. During the fiscal second quarter, we recorded a special charge of approximately $5 million or $3 million after-tax. The charge includes the cost of repositioning our Special Interest Media business. Additional information on the special charge is available in tables 1 through 4 in today’s earnings release and in our press release dated January 14th, 2010. As we have discussed, key elements of our performance improvement plan focus on operating efficiencies, managing our cash and aggressively reducing debt,
Companywide operating expenses declined 8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. They were down 10% in our National Media Group and down 6% in our Local Media Group, 2% without last year’s charge. Corporate unallocated expenses rose approximately $2 million as we expected due primarily to higher retirement plan costs and third-party consulting fees. As we mentioned during our last conference call, we have engaged consultants to help us be more efficient in the areas of creating and distributing our branded content, sourcing the materials we purchase, providing support functions across our organization, particularly in the IT area, and at managing our employee benefits. Our repositioning of the Special Interest Media operation is one example of the deliverable from this initiative.
We generated approximately $76 million in cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2010 and reduced debt by $30 million so far in fiscal ’10. Our total debt was $350 million at the end of the second quarter and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7 to 1, well under covenants and appropriately conservative. We had a $175 million of debt flip from long-term to current from our prior year-end due to a $75 million term payment due July 1st 2010, and $100 million outstanding on our revolver, which expires in October of 2010.
We are in the early stages of working with our bank group to renew the revolver. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and are well positioned to continue to weather the softness in advertising space. We are also well poised to capitalize on opportunities as they arrive.
Turning to our outlook, looking at the third quarter of fiscal 2010, with two of the three magazine issues closed and National Media Group advertising, we are expecting to be flat to up slightly. Local Media Group non-political advertising pacings, which are a snapshot in time and change frequently, are currently up in the mid teens.
We expect fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings per share to range from $0.55 to $0.60. Looking at the remainder of the fiscal 2010, with limited visibility into customers’ ad budgets, we are currently expecting full-year earnings per share to range from $1.90 to $2.05, excluding the special items that were reported in the first half of fiscal 2010.
A number of uncertainties remain that may affect our outlook for the third fiscal quarter and full year of 2010. These are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement in today’s press release and in our SEC filings.
With that, I will turn it back to Steve for some closing comments.

However taking a bit of a longer-term view, the alarm of chatter can sometime obscure the more entire story. Without a doubt, the media industry was and remains in need of consolidation. Simply, the number of outlet continues to exceed both consumer and marketer demand. Thus, the weaker channels are following by the wayside and they will continue to do so.
But this is hardly the death knell for all traditional media, rather as an opportunity for the stronger players to reenergize and to gain share. Additionally, companies with a sound strategic vision such as Meredith continue to work diligently to expand beyond traditional advertising and develop new sources of revenue. In our case, it’s through expansion of our integrated marketing, digital, video, licensing and mobile initiatives.
Throughout today’s discussion, I pointed out examples where Meredith is, exceeding industry metrics in our core businesses, repositioning those businesses to meet new market demand, strengthening our consumer connection across channels, growing new sources of revenue and efficiently utilizing capital. We call it our performance improvement plan, but obviously it’s much more than that.
We believe it’s the blueprint for success in a rapidly-changing media and marketing landscape. In the early goings of calendar 2010, we continue to look for ways to refine and expand these strategies. I am extremely confident that Meredith is emerging in a stronger competitive position and that we are well positioned to build shareholder value overtime.
Now, we would be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

In calendar 2010, we continue to experience very, very strong pricing pressure, and if you were to look at it on an overall basis and kind of say, you know, where is it year-over-year, depending on title and depending on the month, it will bounce somewhere in kind of down in sort of the low to kind of a mid-single digit range for pricing compared with where we would have been a year or 18 months ago. Personally, I don’t feel that, that pricing will abate in the near term, although I don’t think there is dramatic decline that we will feel in pricing as we move through 2010. So -

In the current environment, you know, there is a combination of activities inside that revenue number where our subscription revenue is actually up a couple of points due to some, I think very innovative pricing strategies that Jack and his team have put in place, but the newsstand is still quite weak from an industry perspective, and so our newsstand revenue, which is a smaller component is actually down about 5%. And once again, I would ask Jack to comment, but I would probably think that, that sort of a trend is probably at least what we will see persist over the relative near term. So, when you add the two together, you are going to see, you know, a little difference quarter-to-quarter. It might be up a little or down a little, but it’s really the newsstand drags the overall number down. Jack, do you have any other thoughts on that circulation revenue component?

Today, I'll start with some thoughts on the current business environment and the trends that we're experiencing, followed by a discussion of a series of strategic initiatives to improve our market position and of course, to grow revenue. Joe Ceryanec, our Chief Financial Officer, will go into greater depth on our financials and provide our earnings outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Joining us for the Q&A is Jack Griffin, our National Media Group President; and Paul Karpowicz, the President of our Local Media Group.Let me start this morning with a very brief financial overview. Earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, including a special charge of $0.07 related to the repositioning of our Special Interest Media business as we announced earlier. Excluding special charges in both periods, earnings per share were $0.49, even with the prior year and slightly ahead of our previously stated expectations. Revenues were $337 million compared to $360 million a year ago. We recorded $14 million or $0.19 per share less in net political advertising revenues during the second quarter of fiscal '10, a nonpolitical year, compared to last year fiscal '09. Looking broadly across our businesses, we're continuing to see improving trends in advertising. However, advertising revenues are still weak compared to historic levels and our visibility is increasingly limited. This, of course, makes forecasting future results more difficult.I'd like to spend just a minute or two reviewing our calendar 2009 advertising performance. Our National Media Group delivered sequential quarterly improvement in advertising revenues, by far, the best performance in our peer group and much better than the industry taken as a whole. Five Meredith titles: Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, More, Fitness, along with Ladies' Home Journal, increased ad revenues as measured by Publishers Information Bureau. That's a remarkable achievement when you consider that just 14 titles among the more than 200 measured magazines across the industry had growth in calendar 2009. Additionally, Family Circle and Better Homes & Gardens finished number one and number two in advertising pages in the highly competitive Women's Lifestyle category. Both titles were named to Advertising Age's A-list of the nation's top magazines, while Fitness was named the most improved publication by the Media Industry Newsletter.Our Local Media Group also delivered sequential quarterly improvement in nonpolitical advertising revenue, gaining market share in the process. We finished the calendar year particularly strong, delivering a 4% gain in nonpolitical advertising revenues in the fourth calendar quarter. Clearly, the performance improvement plan we formulated 18 months ago has helped us navigate what was a very difficult calendar 2009 across the media industry. The four key elements of that plan include: gaining market share in our national magazines and local television operations; increasing our already strong connection to the American consumer; growing new streams of revenue, particularly those not dependent on traditional advertising along with exercising disciplined expense control and aggressive cash management. I'll detail the progress we're making on those initiatives as we take a closer look at operating group performance in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal '10 starting with our National Media Group.During the second quarter, we continued to see National Media Group advertising revenues improve. While off 2% from a year ago, advertising revenue performance has improved in each of the last four quarters. At the same time, the National Media Group operating expenses declined 10%, driving a 25% increase in group operating profit in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. Better Homes & Gardens grew advertising revenues by 7%. More and Fitness Magazines also grew ad revenue in the quarter.Our share of overall magazine industry advertising revenues increased to 11.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '10, up from 9.4% in the prior year, once again, according to the latest data from the Publishers Information Bureau. Additionally, our market share grew by about two points to 37% as measured against our 28 title competitive set.The market share gains we're delivering are driven by several factors. First of all, our branded editorial content focuses on the subjects that matter most to women. That emphasis is more important than ever as consumers look for sound, practical advice. Second, our advertisers are seeking the most value for their advertising dollars. The reach and the efficiency of our portfolio, particularly among our largest brands, continues to work in our favor. Third, we have a sales organization that can create and also deliver multi-platform marketing campaigns that help our customers sell more products at retail. These programs now represent approximately 20% of our overall advertising revenues.During the second quarter, Family Circle partnered with IKEA to launch an experiential cooking program, featuring seminars taught by celebrity chefs. The Better Homes & Gardens' 2010 Best New Products Awards attracted more than 50 brands to participate. More magazines signed Wells Fargo as the presenting sponsor for its three reinvention conventions that are scheduled in 2010, and also won new advertising business from Cadillac, Lincoln and Ford. Finally, during the quarter, we were ranked number one among all media companies by the Advertiser Intelligence Report in terms of advertiser perception. We were ahead of both our publishing peers, as well as other media companies including Google, ESPN and Disney.Turning now to circulation. Revenues rose slightly in the period. Profit and related margin increased during the quarter compared to the prior period as well. Our performance was assisted by efficiencies in our subscription operation. Total readership across our magazines increased in the most recent report from Mediamark Research and Intelligence, and we gained market share at the newsstand as well.Average monthly unique visitors to Meredith's nationally branded websites increased more than 35% to over 20 million, and page views per month averaged over 260 million, both were record levels. These gains were driven by a wide variety of content created for the holiday season, along with new social media capabilities. Visitors viewed more than 6 million videos during the quarter, four times the number seen a year ago.During the quarter, we announced our investments in a new venture with Time Inc., Condé Nast, Hearst and News Corp. to create open standards for a new digital storefront, allowing consumers to enjoy their favorite media content on portable, digital devices. It will also include a rich array of innovative advertising opportunity. We'll drive revenue from content creation, advertising, along with sales of traditional print subscriptions.At Meredith Integrated Marketing, we're seeing a strong pipeline of new business activity, and have been successful in turning some of those proposals into significant new business. In December, Meredith Integrated Marketing won new business, developing and managing Chrysler Group's customer relationship management initiatives in both the United States and in Canada. The assignment covers the full vehicle ownership life cycle, from welcome packages through off-lease marketing. It includes communicating with end markets and perspective customers via direct mail and e-mail marketing, along with social media initiatives as well.In addition, Wells Fargo commissioned Integrated Marketing to complete an analysis of its digital space and help develop a customer relationship management program for that company as well. Our Brand Licensing revenues grew 25% in the quarter, primarily as a result of our ongoing relationship with Wal-Mart. The number of SKUs at Wal-Mart tripled to over 1,500 compared to the year-ago period. During the quarter, we announced a new bedding program called Seasonal Harvest, a line of custom paint and a number of new holiday decor items. To summarize the National Media Group discussion, while the advertising environment remains challenging, we are encouraged by the market share gains and improving quarter-over-quarter revenue trends. Our consumer connection is strong. We continue to develop businesses that are not dependent on advertising, and we're prudently managing our expenses.Now turning to our Local Media Group. As I mentioned a few moments ago, fiscal 2010 second quarter nonpolitical advertising revenues grew 4%. Stations in nine of our 10 television markets posted growth in nonpolitical ad revenue. The Local Media Group also outperformed the industry as a whole by approximately three percentage points in nonpolitical advertising revenues during the quarter, according to the most recently available data from the Television Bureau of Advertising.  These gains were aided by stronger ratings posted by many of our television stations during the November sweeps period. Our CBS affiliate in Atlanta made significant rating gains across all key newscasts. We more than doubled our ratings in morning news and late news by nearly 30%.  Our stations in Hartford, Nashville and Las Vegas captured a larger share of morning news viewers, while Hartford and Portland maintained their number one position. In the evening and late news periods, where advertising rates are the highest, we grew viewership and rating in Kansas City, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Hartford maintained its number one position across all its newscasts.Looking at new revenue streams, retransmission fees nearly doubled in the second quarter. And we expect those fees will be more than $20 million as we close fiscal 2010. Meredith Video Studios also posted strong revenue growth in the quarter. The gains were driven primarily by growth in custom video projects for corporate clients, as well as the continued expansion of the daily Better television show. Better is now in 55 markets, and reaches more than 45% of the U.S. households.During the quarter, Video Studios formed distribution agreements with YouTube, Google, Sprint TV, Grab Network and others that will include carriage of our branded video content across more than 150,000 new websites.To summarize our Local Media Group discussion, the television industry has [ph] been experiencing one of the most difficult advertising environments in its history. But we're driving improved, nonpolitical advertising revenue performance, and continue to believe that television is the most powerful and efficient way for advertisers to reach the American consumer. Additionally, we're encouraged by our ability to grow new revenue streams, including retransmission fees and video content creation. Now I'll turn the discussion over to our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Ceryanec."

As Steve noted, the earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, and that included a special charge of $0.07 per share, thus $0.49 without the special charge. During the fiscal second quarter, we recorded a special charge of approximately $5 million or $3 million after tax. The charge includes the cost of repositioning our Special Interest Media business. Additional information on the special charge is available in Tables 1 through 4 in today's earnings release, and in our press release dated January 14, 2010.As we have discussed, key elements of our performance improvement plan focused on operating efficiencies, managing our cash and aggressively reducing debt. Company wide operating expenses declined 8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. They were down 10% in our National Media Group, and down 6% in our Local Media Group, 2% without last year's charge.Corporate unallocated expenses rose approximately $2 million as we expected, due primarily to higher retirement plan cost and third-party consulting fees. As we mentioned during our last conference call, we have engaged consultants to help us be more efficient in the areas of creating and distributing our branded content, sourcing the materials we purchase, providing the support functions across our organization, particularly in the IT area and at managing our employee benefits. Our repositioning of the Special Interest Media operation is one example of the deliverable from this initiative.We generated approximately $76 million in cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2010, and reduced debt by $30 million so far in fiscal '10. Our total debt was $350 million at the end of the second quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7:1, well under covenants and appropriately conservative. We had $175 million of debt flipped from long-term to current from our prior year end due to a $75 million term payment due July 1, 2010, and $100 million outstanding on our revolver, which expires in October of 2010. We are in the early stages of working with our bank group to renew the revolver.We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and are well positioned to continue to weather the softness in advertising space. We are also well poised to capitalize on opportunities as they arrive.Turning to our outlook. Looking at the third quarter of fiscal 2010, with two of the three magazine issues closed and National Media Group advertising, we are expecting to be flat to up slightly. Local Media Group nonpolitical advertising pacings, which are a snapshot in time and change frequently, are currently up in the mid-teens. We expect fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings per share to range from $0.55 to $0.60. Looking at the remainder of fiscal 2010 with limited visibility into customer ad budgets, we are currently expecting full year earnings per share to range from $1.90 to $2.05, excluding the special items that were reported in the first half of fiscal 2010.A number of uncertainties remain that may affect our outlook for the third fiscal quarter and full year 2010. These are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement, today's press release and in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing comments."

However taking a bit of a longer-term view, the alarmist chatter can sometimes obscure the more entire story. Without a doubt, the media industry was and remains in need of consolidation. Simply the number of outlets continues to exceed both consumer and marketer demand. Thus, the weaker channels are falling by the way side and they will continue to do so. But this is hardly the death now for all traditional media. Rather, it's an opportunity for the stronger players to re-energize and to gain share. Additionally, companies with a sound, strategic vision, such as Meredith, continue to work diligently to expand beyond traditional advertising and develop new sources of revenue. In our case, it's through expansion of our integrated marketing, digital, video, licensing and mobile initiative. Throughout today's discussion, I pointed out examples where Meredith is exceeding industry metrics in our core businesses, repositioning those businesses to meet new market demand, strengthening our consumer connection across channels, growing new sources of revenue and efficiently utilizing capital.We call it our performance improvement plan, but obviously it's much more than that. We believe it's the blueprint for success in a rapidly changing media and marketing landscape. In the early goings of calendar 2010, we continue to look for ways to refine and expand these strategies. I'm extremely confident that Meredith is emerging in a stronger competitive position, and that we're well positioned to build shareholder value over time. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have."

In calendar 2010, we continue to experience very, very strong pricing pressure. And if you were to look at it on a overall basis and kind of say, where is it year-over-year.

In the current environment, there is a combination of activities inside that revenue number, where our subscription revenue is actually up a couple of points due to some, I think, very innovative pricing strategies that Jack and his team have put in place. But the news stand is still quite weak from an industry perspective. And so our newsstand revenue, which is a smaller component, is actually down about 5%. And once again, I would ask Jack to comment, but I would probably think that, that sort of a trend is probably at least what we will see persist over the relative near term.

Today, I'll start with some thoughts on the current business environment and the trends that we're experiencing, followed by a discussion of a series of strategic initiatives to improve our market position and of course, to grow revenue. Joe Ceryanec, our Chief Financial Officer, will go into greater depth on our financials and provide our earnings outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Joining us for the Q&A is Jack Griffin, our National Media Group President; and Paul Karpowicz, the President of our Local Media Group.Let me start this morning with a very brief financial overview. Earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, including a special charge of $0.07 related to the repositioning of our Special Interest Media business as we announced earlier. Excluding special charges in both periods, earnings per share were $0.49, even with the prior year and slightly ahead of our previously stated expectations. Revenues were $337 million compared to $360 million a year ago. We recorded $14 million or $0.19 per share less in net political advertising revenues during the second quarter of fiscal '10, a nonpolitical year, compared to last year fiscal '09. Looking broadly across our businesses, we're continuing to see improving trends in advertising. However, advertising revenues are still weak compared to historic levels and our visibility is increasingly limited. This, of course, makes forecasting future results more difficult.I'd like to spend just a minute or two reviewing our calendar 2009 advertising performance. Our National Media Group delivered sequential quarterly improvement in advertising revenues, by far, the best performance in our peer group and much better than the industry taken as a whole. Five Meredith titles: Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, More, Fitness, along with Ladies' Home Journal, increased ad revenues as measured by Publishers Information Bureau. That's a remarkable achievement when you consider that just 14 titles among the more than 200 measured magazines across the industry had growth in calendar 2009. Additionally, Family Circle and Better Homes & Gardens finished number one and number two in advertising pages in the highly competitive Women's Lifestyle category. Both titles were named to Advertising Age's A-list of the nation's top magazines, while Fitness was named the most improved publication by the Media Industry Newsletter.Our Local Media Group also delivered sequential quarterly improvement in nonpolitical advertising revenue, gaining market share in the process. We finished the calendar year particularly strong, delivering a 4% gain in nonpolitical advertising revenues in the fourth calendar quarter. Clearly, the performance improvement plan we formulated 18 months ago has helped us navigate what was a very difficult calendar 2009 across the media industry. The four key elements of that plan include: gaining market share in our national magazines and local television operations; increasing our already strong connection to the American consumer; growing new streams of revenue, particularly those not dependent on traditional advertising along with exercising disciplined expense control and aggressive cash management. I'll detail the progress we're making on those initiatives as we take a closer look at operating group performance in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal '10 starting with our National Media Group.During the second quarter, we continued to see National Media Group advertising revenues improve. While off 2% from a year ago, advertising revenue performance has improved in each of the last four quarters. At the same time, the National Media Group operating expenses declined 10%, driving a 25% increase in group operating profit in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. Better Homes & Gardens grew advertising revenues by 7%. More and Fitness Magazines also grew ad revenue in the quarter.Our share of overall magazine industry advertising revenues increased to 11.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '10, up from 9.4% in the prior year, once again, according to the latest data from the Publishers Information Bureau. Additionally, our market share grew by about two points to 37% as measured against our 28 title competitive set.The market share gains we're delivering are driven by several factors. First of all, our branded editorial content focuses on the subjects that matter most to women. That emphasis is more important than ever as consumers look for sound, practical advice. Second, our advertisers are seeking the most value for their advertising dollars. The reach and the efficiency of our portfolio, particularly among our largest brands, continues to work in our favor. Third, we have a sales organization that can create and also deliver multi-platform marketing campaigns that help our customers sell more products at retail. These programs now represent approximately 20% of our overall advertising revenues.During the second quarter, Family Circle partnered with IKEA to launch an experiential cooking program, featuring seminars taught by celebrity chefs. The Better Homes & Gardens' 2010 Best New Products Awards attracted more than 50 brands to participate. More magazines signed Wells Fargo as the presenting sponsor for its three reinvention conventions that are scheduled in 2010, and also won new advertising business from Cadillac, Lincoln and Ford. Finally, during the quarter, we were ranked number one among all media companies by the Advertiser Intelligence Report in terms of advertiser perception. We were ahead of both our publishing peers, as well as other media companies including Google, ESPN and Disney.Turning now to circulation. Revenues rose slightly in the period. Profit and related margin increased during the quarter compared to the prior period as well. Our performance was assisted by efficiencies in our subscription operation. Total readership across our magazines increased in the most recent report from Mediamark Research and Intelligence, and we gained market share at the newsstand as well.Average monthly unique visitors to Meredith's nationally branded websites increased more than 35% to over 20 million, and page views per month averaged over 260 million, both were record levels. These gains were driven by a wide variety of content created for the holiday season, along with new social media capabilities. Visitors viewed more than 6 million videos during the quarter, four times the number seen a year ago.During the quarter, we announced our investments in a new venture with Time Inc., Condé Nast, Hearst and News Corp. to create open standards for a new digital storefront, allowing consumers to enjoy their favorite media content on portable, digital devices. It will also include a rich array of innovative advertising opportunity. We'll drive revenue from content creation, advertising, along with sales of traditional print subscriptions.At Meredith Integrated Marketing, we're seeing a strong pipeline of new business activity, and have been successful in turning some of those proposals into significant new business. In December, Meredith Integrated Marketing won new business, developing and managing Chrysler Group's customer relationship management initiatives in both the United States and in Canada. The assignment covers the full vehicle ownership life cycle, from welcome packages through off-lease marketing. It includes communicating with end markets and perspective customers via direct mail and e-mail marketing, along with social media initiatives as well.In addition, Wells Fargo commissioned Integrated Marketing to complete an analysis of its digital space and help develop a customer relationship management program for that company as well. Our Brand Licensing revenues grew 25% in the quarter, primarily as a result of our ongoing relationship with Wal-Mart. The number of SKUs at Wal-Mart tripled to over 1,500 compared to the year-ago period. During the quarter, we announced a new bedding program called Seasonal Harvest, a line of custom paint and a number of new holiday decor items. To summarize the National Media Group discussion, while the advertising environment remains challenging, we are encouraged by the market share gains and improving quarter-over-quarter revenue trends. Our consumer connection is strong. We continue to develop businesses that are not dependent on advertising, and we're prudently managing our expenses.Now turning to our Local Media Group. As I mentioned a few moments ago, fiscal 2010 second quarter nonpolitical advertising revenues grew 4%. Stations in nine of our 10 television markets posted growth in nonpolitical ad revenue. The Local Media Group also outperformed the industry as a whole by approximately three percentage points in nonpolitical advertising revenues during the quarter, according to the most recently available data from the Television Bureau of Advertising.  These gains were aided by stronger ratings posted by many of our television stations during the November sweeps period. Our CBS affiliate in Atlanta made significant rating gains across all key newscasts. We more than doubled our ratings in morning news and late news by nearly 30%.  Our stations in Hartford, Nashville and Las Vegas captured a larger share of morning news viewers, while Hartford and Portland maintained their number one position. In the evening and late news periods, where advertising rates are the highest, we grew viewership and rating in Kansas City, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Hartford maintained its number one position across all its newscasts.Looking at new revenue streams, retransmission fees nearly doubled in the second quarter. And we expect those fees will be more than $20 million as we close fiscal 2010. Meredith Video Studios also posted strong revenue growth in the quarter. The gains were driven primarily by growth in custom video projects for corporate clients, as well as the continued expansion of the daily Better television show. Better is now in 55 markets, and reaches more than 45% of the U.S. households. During the quarter, Video Studios formed distribution agreements with YouTube, Google, Sprint TV, Grab Network and others that will include carriage of our branded video content across more than 150,000 new websites.To summarize our Local Media Group discussion, the television industry has [ph] been experiencing one of the most difficult advertising environments in its history. But we're driving improved, nonpolitical advertising revenue performance, and continue to believe that television is the most powerful and efficient way for advertisers to reach the American consumer. Additionally, we're encouraged by our ability to grow new revenue streams, including retransmission fees and video content creation. Now I'll turn the discussion over to our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Ceryanec."

As Steve noted, the earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, and that included a special charge of $0.07 per share, thus $0.49 without the special charge. During the fiscal second quarter, we recorded a special charge of approximately $5 million or $3 million after tax. The charge includes the cost of repositioning our Special Interest Media business. Additional information on the special charge is available in Tables 1 through 4 in today's earnings release, and in our press release dated January 14, 2010.As we have discussed, key elements of our performance improvement plan focused on operating efficiencies, managing our cash and aggressively reducing debt. Company wide operating expenses declined 8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. They were down 10% in our National Media Group, and down 6% in our Local Media Group, 2% without last year's charge.Corporate unallocated expenses rose approximately $2 million as we expected, due primarily to higher retirement plan cost and third-party consulting fees. As we mentioned during our last conference call, we have engaged consultants to help us be more efficient in the areas of creating and distributing our branded content, sourcing the materials we purchase, providing the support functions across our organization, particularly in the IT area and at managing our employee benefits. Our repositioning of the Special Interest Media operation is one example of the deliverable from this initiative.We generated approximately $76 million in cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2010, and reduced debt by $30 million so far in fiscal '10. Our total debt was $350 million at the end of the second quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7:1, well under covenants and appropriately conservative. We had $175 million of debt flipped from long-term to current from our prior year end due to a $75 million term payment due July 1, 2010, and $100 million outstanding on our revolver, which expires in October of 2010. We are in the early stages of working with our bank group to renew the revolver. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and are well positioned to continue to weather the softness in advertising space. We are also well poised to capitalize on opportunities as they arrive.Turning to our outlook. Looking at the third quarter of fiscal 2010, with two of the three magazine issues closed and National Media Group advertising, we are expecting to be flat to up slightly. Local Media Group nonpolitical advertising pacings, which are a snapshot in time and change frequently, are currently up in the mid-teens. We expect fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings per share to range from $0.55 to $0.60. Looking at the remainder of fiscal 2010 with limited visibility into customer ad budgets, we are currently expecting full year earnings per share to range from $1.90 to $2.05, excluding the special items that were reported in the first half of fiscal 2010.A number of uncertainties remain that may affect our outlook for the third fiscal quarter and full year 2010. These are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement, today's press release and in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing comments."

However taking a bit of a longer-term view, the alarmist chatter can sometimes obscure the more entire story. Without a doubt, the media industry was and remains in need of consolidation. Simply the number of outlets continues to exceed both consumer and marketer demand. Thus, the weaker channels are falling by the way side and they will continue to do so. But this is hardly the death now for all traditional media. Rather, it's an opportunity for the stronger players to re-energize and to gain share. Additionally, companies with a sound, strategic vision, such as Meredith, continue to work diligently to expand beyond traditional advertising and develop new sources of revenue. In our case, it's through expansion of our integrated marketing, digital, video, licensing and mobile initiative. Throughout today's discussion, I pointed out examples where Meredith is exceeding industry metrics in our core businesses, repositioning those businesses to meet new market demand, strengthening our consumer connection across channels, growing new sources of revenue and efficiently utilizing capital.We call it our performance improvement plan, but obviously it's much more than that. We believe it's the blueprint for success in a rapidly changing media and marketing landscape. In the early goings of calendar 2010, we continue to look for ways to refine and expand these strategies. I'm extremely confident that Meredith is emerging in a stronger competitive position, and that we're well positioned to build shareholder value over time. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have."

In the current environment, there is a combination of activities inside that revenue number, where our subscription revenue is actually up a couple of points due to some, I think, very innovative pricing strategies that Jack and his team have put in place. But the news stand is still quite weak from an industry perspective. And so our newsstand revenue, which is a smaller component, is actually down about 5%. And once again, I would ask Jack to comment, but I would probably think that, that sort of a trend is probably at least what we will see persist over the relative near term. So when you add the two together, you're going to see a little different quarter-over-quarter, it might be up a little or down a little. But it's really the newsstand drags the overall number down.

Today, I'll start with some thoughts on the current business environment and the trends that we're experiencing, followed by a discussion of a series of strategic initiatives to improve our market position and of course, to grow revenue. Joe Ceryanec, our Chief Financial Officer, will go into greater depth on our financials and provide our earnings outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Joining us for the Q&A is Jack Griffin, our National Media Group President; and Paul Karpowicz, the President of our Local Media Group.Let me start this morning with a very brief financial overview. Earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, including a special charge of $0.07 related to the repositioning of our Special Interest Media business as we announced earlier. Excluding special charges in both periods, earnings per share were $0.49, even with the prior year and slightly ahead of our previously stated expectations. Revenues were $337 million compared to $360 million a year ago. We recorded $14 million or $0.19 per share less in net political advertising revenues during the second quarter of fiscal '10, a non-political year, compared to last year fiscal '09. Looking broadly across our businesses, we're continuing to see improving trends in advertising. However, advertising revenues are still weak compared to historic levels and our visibility is increasingly limited. This, of course, makes forecasting future results more difficult.I'd like to spend just a minute or two reviewing our calendar 2009 advertising performance. Our National Media Group delivered sequential quarterly improvement in advertising revenues, by far, the best performance in our peer group and much better than the industry taken as a whole. Five Meredith titles: Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, More, Fitness, along with Ladies' Home Journal, increased ad revenues as measured by Publishers Information Bureau. That's a remarkable achievement when you consider that just 14 titles among the more than 200 measured magazines across the industry had growth in calendar 2009. Additionally, Family Circle and Better Homes & Gardens finished number one and number two in advertising pages in the highly competitive Women's Lifestyle category. Both titles were named to Advertising Age's A-list of the nation's top magazines, while Fitness was named the most improved publication by the Media Industry Newsletter.Our Local Media Group also delivered sequential quarterly improvement in nonpolitical advertising revenue, gaining market share in the process. We finished the calendar year particularly strong, delivering a 4% gain in nonpolitical advertising revenues in the fourth calendar quarter. Clearly, the performance improvement plan we formulated 18 months ago has helped us navigate what was a very difficult calendar 2009 across the media industry. The four key elements of that plan include: gaining market share in our national magazine and local television operations; increasing our already strong connection to the American consumer; growing new streams of revenue, particularly those not dependent on traditional advertising along with exercising disciplined expense control and aggressive cash management. I'll detail the progress we're making on those initiatives as we take a closer look at operating group performance in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal '10 starting with our National Media Group.During the second quarter, we continued to see National Media Group advertising revenues improve. While off 2% from a year ago, advertising revenue performance has improved in each of the last four quarters. At the same time, the National Media Group operating expenses declined 10%, driving a 25% increase in group operating profit in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. Better Homes & Gardens grew advertising revenues by 7%. More and Fitness magazines also grew ad revenue in the quarter. Our share of overall magazine industry advertising revenues increased to 11.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '10, up from 9.4% in the prior year, once again, according to the latest data from the Publishers Information Bureau. Additionally, our market share grew by about two points to 37% as measured against our 28 title competitive set.The market share gains we're delivering are driven by several factors. First of all, our branded editorial content focuses on the subjects that matter most to women. That emphasis is more important than ever as consumers look for sound, practical advice. Second, our advertisers are seeking the most value for their advertising dollars. The reach and the efficiency of our portfolio, particularly among our largest brands, continues to work in our favor. Third, we have a sales organization that can create and also deliver multi-platform marketing campaigns that help our customers sell more products at retail. These programs now represent approximately 20% of our overall advertising revenues.During the second quarter, Family Circle partnered with IKEA to launch an experiential cooking program, featuring seminars taught by celebrity chefs. The Better Homes & Gardens' 2010 Best New Products Awards attracted more than 50 brands to participate. More magazines signed Wells Fargo as the presenting sponsor for its three reinvention conventions that are scheduled in 2010, and also won new advertising business from Cadillac, Lincoln and Ford. Finally, during the quarter, we were ranked number one among all media companies by the Advertiser Intelligence Report in terms of advertiser perception. We were ahead of both our publishing peers, as well as other media companies including Google, ESPN and Disney.Turning now to circulation. Revenues rose slightly in the period. Profit and related margin increased during the quarter compared to the prior period as well. Our performance was assisted by efficiencies in our subscription operation. Total readership across our magazines increased in the most recent report from Mediamark Research and Intelligence, and we gained market share at the newsstand as well.Average monthly unique visitors to Meredith's nationally branded websites increased more than 35% to over 20 million, and page views per month averaged over 260 million, both were record levels. These gains were driven by a wide variety of content created for the holiday season, along with new social media capabilities. Visitors viewed more than six million videos during the quarter, four times the number seen a year ago.During the quarter, we announced our investments in a new venture with Time Inc., Condé Nast, Hearst and News Corp. to create open standards for a new digital storefront, allowing consumers to enjoy their favorite media content on portable, digital devices. It will also include a rich array of innovative advertising opportunity. We'll drive revenue from content creation, advertising, along with sales of traditional print subscriptions.At Meredith Integrated Marketing, we're seeing a strong pipeline of new business activity, and have been successful in turning some of those proposals into significant new business. In December, Meredith Integrated Marketing won new business, developing and managing Chrysler Group's customer relationship management initiative in both the United States and in Canada. The assignment covers the full vehicle ownership life cycle, from welcome packages through off-lease marketing. It includes communicating with end markets and perspective customers via direct mail and e-mail marketing, along with social media initiative as well.In addition, Wells Fargo commissioned Integrated Marketing to complete an analysis of its digital space and help develop a customer relationship management program for that company as well. Our Brand Licensing revenues grew 25% in the quarter, primarily as a result of our ongoing relationship with Wal-Mart. The number of SKUs at Wal-Mart tripled to over 1,500 compared to the year-ago period. During the quarter, we announced a new bedding program called Seasonal Harvest, a line of custom paint and a number of new holiday decor items. To summarize the National Media Group discussion, while the advertising environment remains challenging, we are encouraged by the market share gains and improving quarter-over-quarter revenue trends. Our consumer connection is strong. We continue to develop businesses that are not dependent on advertising, and we're prudently managing our expenses.Now turning to our Local Media Group. As I mentioned a few moments ago, fiscal 2010 second quarter nonpolitical advertising revenues grew 4%. Stations in nine of our 10 television markets posted growth in nonpolitical ad revenue. The Local Media Group also outperformed the industry as a whole by approximately three percentage points in nonpolitical advertising revenues during the quarter, according to the most recently available data from the Television Bureau of Advertising.  These gains were aided by stronger ratings posted by many of our television stations during the November sweeps period. Our CBS affiliate in Atlanta made significant rating gains across all key newscasts. We more than doubled our ratings in morning news and late news by nearly 30%.  Our stations in Hartford, Nashville and Las Vegas captured a larger share of morning news viewers, while Hartford and Portland maintained their number one position. In the evening and late news periods, where advertising rates are the highest, we grew viewership and rating in Kansas City, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Hartford maintained its number one position across all its newscasts.Looking at new revenue streams, retransmission fees nearly doubled in the second quarter. And we expect those fees will be more than $20 million as we close fiscal 2010. Meredith Video Studios also posted strong revenue growth in the quarter. The gains were driven primarily by growth in custom video projects for corporate clients, as well as the continued expansion of the daily Better television show. Better is now in 55 markets, and reaches more than 45% of the U.S. households.During the quarter, Video Studios formed distribution agreements with YouTube, Google, Sprint TV, Grab Network and others that will include carriage of our branded video content across more than 150,000 new websites.To summarize our Local Media Group discussion, the television industry has been experiencing one of the most difficult advertising environments in its history. But we're driving improved, nonpolitical advertising revenue performance, and continue to believe that television is the most powerful and efficient way for advertisers to reach the American consumer. Additionally, we're encouraged by our ability to grow new revenue streams, including retransmission fees and video content creation. Now I'll turn the discussion over to our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Ceryanec."

As Steve noted, the earnings per share were $0.42 in the second quarter, and that included a special charge of $0.07 per share, thus $0.49 without the special charge. During the fiscal second quarter, we recorded a special charge of approximately $5 million or $3 million after tax. The charge includes the cost of repositioning our Special Interest Media business. Additional information on the special charge is available in Tables 1 through 4 in today's earnings release, and in our press release dated January 14, 2010.As we have discussed, key elements of our performance improvement plan focused on operating efficiencies, managing our cash and aggressively reducing debt. Company wide operating expenses declined 8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. They were down 10% in our National Media Group, and down 6% in our Local Media Group, 2% without last year's charge.Corporate unallocated expenses rose approximately $2 million as we expected, due primarily to higher retirement plan cost and third-party consulting fees. As we mentioned during our last conference call, we have engaged consultants to help us be more efficient in the areas of creating and distributing our branded content, sourcing the materials we purchase, providing the support functions across our organization, particularly in the IT area and at managing our employee benefits. Our repositioning of the Special Interest Media operation is one example of the deliverable from this initiative.We generated approximately $76 million in cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2010, and reduced debt by $30 million so far in fiscal '10. Our total debt was $350 million at the end of the second quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7:1, well under covenants and appropriately conservative. We had $175 million of debt flipped from long-term to current from our prior year end due to a $75 million term payment due July 1, 2010, and $100 million outstanding on our revolver, which expires in October of 2010. We are in the early stages of working with our bank group to renew the revolver. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and are well positioned to continue to weather the softness in advertising space. We are also well poised to capitalize on opportunities as they arrive.Turning to our outlook. Looking at the third quarter of fiscal 2010, with two of the three magazine issues closed and National Media Group advertising, we are expecting to be flat to up slightly. Local Media Group nonpolitical advertising pacings, which are a snapshot in time and change frequently, are currently up in the mid-teens. We expect fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings per share to range from $0.55 to $0.60. Looking at the remainder of fiscal 2010 with limited visibility into customer ad budgets, we are currently expecting full year earnings per share to range from $1.90 to $2.05, excluding the special items that were reported in the first half of fiscal 2010. A number of uncertainties remain that may affect our outlook for the third fiscal quarter and full year 2010. These are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement, today's press release and in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it back to Steve for some closing comments."

However taking a bit of a longer-term view, the alarmist chatter can sometimes obscure the more entire story. Without a doubt, the media industry was and remains in need of consolidation. Simply the number of outlets continues to exceed both consumer and marketer demand. Thus, the weaker channels are falling by the way side and they will continue to do so. But this is hardly the death now for all traditional media. Rather, it's an opportunity for the stronger players to re-energize and to gain share. Additionally, companies with a sound, strategic vision, such as Meredith, continue to work diligently to expand beyond traditional advertising and develop new sources of revenue. In our case, it's through expansion of our integrated marketing, digital, video, licensing and mobile initiative. Throughout today's discussion, I pointed out examples where Meredith is exceeding industry metrics in our core businesses, repositioning those businesses to meet new market demand, strengthening our consumer connection across channels, growing new sources of revenue and efficiently utilizing capital.We call it our performance improvement plan, but obviously it's much more than that. We believe it's the blueprint for success in a rapidly changing media and marketing landscape. In the early goings of calendar 2010, we continue to look for ways to refine and expand these strategies. I'm extremely confident that Meredith is emerging in a stronger competitive position, and that we're well positioned to build shareholder value over time. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have."

In the current environment, there is a combination of activities inside that revenue number, where our subscription revenue is actually up a couple of points due to some, I think, very innovative pricing strategies that Jack and his team have put in place. But the newsstand is still quite weak from an industry perspective. And so our newsstand revenue, which is a smaller component, is actually down about 5%. And once again, I would ask Jack to comment, but I would probably think that, that sort of a trend is probably at least what we will see persist over the relative near term. So when you add the two together, you're going to see a little different quarter-to-quarter, it might be up a little or down a little. But it's really the newsstand drags the overall number down.

I’ll begin with an overview of the current environment, discuss how execution against our strategic initiative is strengthening our market position while delivering revenue and profit growth. Joe Ceryanec our Chief Financial Officer will go into greater detail on our financial and provide our earnings outlook.
Following our prepared comments this morning we’ll be joined by Jack Griffin, Paul Karpowicz, our Local Media Group President. Questions you might have at that time. I’m pleased to report; we grew third quarter earnings per share more than 30% to $0.73 a share including a $0.04 per share tax benefit. Total revenues grew 5% to $353 million. The improvement was broad based across the company from an advertising perspective; we deliver growth in both our National and Local media groups. Beyond advertising, we deliver double digit revenue growth in Meredith’s integrated marketing, brand licensing, retransmission fees and at Meredith's video studio. While our advertising performance is encouraging we are still well below historic levels established prior to the recession in both our national and our local businesses.
The place remains very volatile on both a month to month and a client by client basis. Before I go into detail about our business unit results, I’d like to briefly review the actions that Meredith has taken to drive performance in what has been a difficult economic time particularly for those of us in the media and marketing industries. We recognized early on with the country was entering an extended economic downturn took a series of decisive action. In the last two years we have executed against clearly defined strategic initiative specifically designed whether the challenges and emerge in a stronger competitive position. These include first of all gaining market share.
Our national magazine business currently has an advertising revenue market share of 12.4% third of fiscal, (Audio Gap) second increasing our connection to the American consumer, leadership of our magazines and viewerships at our local television stations, news programming remains quite strong. Over the same period Unique visitors to our website had grown 30% and paged use have grown over 50%. In addition our better daily television program now airs in nearly half of all U.S. households.
Third, growing new revenue streams not dependant on traditional advertising. Revenues in operating profit at Meredith integrated marketing are not more than 10% over two years ago. Our brand licensing business had grown revenue nearly 50% and today we have 2000 SKUs at Wal-Mart stores across the U.S. and in Canada. Fees from retransmission agreements had nearly tripled, recreated Meredith video studios would take advantage of our video content creation capabilities.
Our fourth initiative that’s reduced expenses and aggressively paid down debt. Over the two year period companywide operating expenses are down approximately 8% and 10% lower before acquisitions. We also eliminated a third of our debt while increasing dividends to our shareholders by 7% and finally we continue to invest in our businesses. We have enhanced the quality of magazine editorial, increased news programming in our local television market and added a variety of features and functionality to our interactive property.
At the same time we increased our digital marketing capabilities through the acquisition of big communication and an investment in mobile marketing leader the Hyperfactory. Most recently, we joined other major media companies to help create next issue media to develop a new digital store front and related technology that will allow consumers to enjoy content on portable digital devices including the iPad.
In short we took advantage of the economic weakness to strengthen our competitive position. While the market place remains challenging and particularly encouraged by the progress being made across the company. Now turning to fiscal 2010 third quarter operating performance. Our national media group operating profit rose 6% on a 2% increase in revenue. Total ad revenues grew 4% including an increase of more than 20% at our online property. From an advertising category standpoint we saw growth in toiletries and cosmetics direct response and retail related advertising. 
Additional the home category which has suffered during the housing driven down turn stabilized during the third quarter. Our share of overall magazine industry advertising revenues increased to 12.4% during the quarter up from 11.2% in the prior year according to the latest data available from Publisher’s Information Bureau.
Additionally our market share grew to 40.6% as measured against our 28 title competitive set. Our advertising gains continue to be driven by three main factors, our branded editorial content focuses on subjects that matter most to women. The reach and the efficiency of our magazine portfolio is unparalleled in the industry and is appealing to advertisers speaking the most value for their investments.
And our sales organization is adept at delivering multi platform marketing campaign that helps our customers sell more products at retail. These programs now represent about 20% of our advertising revenue and the capabilities we have built give us a competitive advantage in the market place.
Recent examples of these multi platform programs include just last weekend when we hosted the sold-out More Fitness Women's Half-Marathon in New York City. More than 10,000 women participated in the three day event and sponsors included Lady Speedstick, Oakley, and Silk soy.
Our corporate sales group recently created and integrated programs for Johnson and Johnson’s allergy brand Zyrtec, targeted to pet owners, gardeners and those who love do-it-yourself projects. It launched with a series of flip books on the back cover of six Meredith titles. The program also included a custom designed website, custom videos and a retail element that will reach a thousand Petco stores on a nationwide basis.
Next month we’ll launch a program during women’s health week for general electric health imagination campaign that will inspire women to live healthier lives. The program includes ads in 9 Meredith titles and custom video segments that will appear on the daily Better Show. It also includes a custom website that allows participants to post their progress on Facebook and on Twitter. Our success in the market place was recently recognized by ad week when it named family circle and more to its list of the nation’s top ten magazines.
Readymade one of our newer brands was named to its up and comer list. Additionally the sales group that executes our multi-platform program with honored with when Meredith 360 head Jeannine Shao Collins was named Adweek's publishing executive of the year.
We continued to strengthen our connection to the consumer during the third quarter. For example an increase in news stand sales contributed to 2% growth in overall circulation revenue. Also traffic to our nationally branded website increased including a 30% jump in unique visitors to a fiscal third quarter record of 20 million.
Additionally consumers continue to embrace our brands at retail. Brand licensing revenues grew nearly 50% in the quarter primarily as a result of growth in the Wal-Mart program. The number of Better Homes and Gardens branded SKUs are Wal-Mart doubled to approximately 2000 over the prior year. We added a variety of new products including vast furniture, clocks and flatware as well as the new seasonal outdoor program.
Also during the quarter we announced a new relationship with FTD for a line of Better Homes and Gardens branded floral arrangement. They will be available across the FTD network in time from other states. Integrated marketing revenues grew 10% in the third quarter of fiscal 10 over the year ago period led by growth in digital program particularly in the pharmaceutical space.
As an example Big communications was recently named agency of record for several brands at the Novo, Nordisk and Takeda entity. Finally we are encouraged with the progress that’s being made by next issue media our joint venture with several other major media companies. Next month, next issue media will unveil a digital consumer store front for existing and soon to be developed digital contents and apps. Now turning to our local media group, where we delivered 16% growth in non-political advertising revenue in the fiscal third quarter. 
Our growth was broad based at stations and all 10 of our markets posted gain. Nine of our top 10 ad categories also grew from the year ago period. Our stronger than industry performance reflects the aggressive sales and marketing initiatives we developed and launched during the economic downturn, along with overall improving market condition. This includes the series of new programs called one service aimed at converting traditional newspaper clients to television advertisers.
Going forward we believe our advertising gains will continue to aided by stronger rating achieved by many of our television stations during the February sweeps period. For example, in morning news our CBS affiliate in Atlanta doubled its ratings while Hartford and Greenville each posted double-digit growth.
In evening news our stations in Hartford, Kansas City, Greenville, and Atlanta all grew ratings. Stations in Nashville and Phoenix each grew ratings sign-on to sign-off. Additionally our daily better television show produced by Meredith Video Solutions, will be seen this fall in more than 60 markets reaching nearly half of the nations television household.
The success of the Better show, along with growth in custom video projects for corporate clients lead Meredith Video Studios to double its revenue in the quarter. Retransmission fees also rose nearly 15% in the third quarter from a year ago. We expect retransmission fees will finish over $20 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 10. Rounding out our discussion of our Local Media Group we recently join Pearl Mobile DTV. A joint venture with 11 other leading television broadcast groups to develop a new national mobile content service. Using the existing broadcast spectrum, the service will allow member companies to provide content to mobile devices including live and on-demand video, local and national programming and sports and entertainment.
Now, our CFO, Joe Ceryanec will discuss our financial performance and give our earnings outlook.

As Steve noted, we posted earnings per share growth of 30% over the prior year and revenue growth of 5%. And we delivered revenue growth across all of our major businesses. At the same time, we held expenses essentially fla",430,"Thanks, Steve and good morning. As Steve noted, we posted earnings per share growth of 30% over the prior year and revenue growth of 5%. And we delivered revenue growth across all of our major businesses. At the same time, we held expenses essentially flat across the organization. As a result, fiscal third quarter 2010 operating margin was 16% an improvement of more than 300 basis points from the prior year and our highest margin percentage in a year and a half.
And as we’ve discussed on our recent calls, we’ve taken action across all our businesses to streamline operations. For example, our operating costs for the first nine months of fiscal year are down over 5%. Further, if you look at our efficiency initiatives over two year period, operating expenses are down 8% compared to the first nine months of fiscal ’08. If you exclude acquisitions, operating expenses are actually down 10% over that same time period and since March of 2008, our headcount is down by more than 10%.
The first nine months of fiscal 10 cash flow from operations was $140 million. We reduced our debt by $65 million so far in fiscal 10, our total debt was $315 million at the end of the third quarter. Debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.4 to 1 and our average cost of borrowing was 4.8%. We had $140 million of debt slip to long term, some long term to current from a prior year end due to a $75 million term payment, which is due July 1, 2010 and $65 million outstanding on our revolver, which expires in October of 2010 and we currently working at with our bank groups to renew the revolver. 
Now as return to our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal 10 we expect total company advertising revenue to increase 7% to 8% over to prior year. This includes Local Media Group, non-political advertising revenue, which is currently pacing up in the high teens and national media group advertising revenue, which were two of the three magazine issues closed as expected to flat to up slightly. Currently expect fiscal 2010 fourth quarter earnings per share to range from $0.61 to $0.66 both fiscal 2010 earnings per share to range from $2.13 to $2.18 excluding all special items 
A number of uncertainties remained that may effect our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2010 these are referenced in the Safe Harbors section on today’s press release and a certain of our SEC filings.
With that, I will now turn it back to Steve for closing comments.

So far this year and what I would say is encouraging is that we are seeing as Steve mentioned in this script, a bottoming out of the home category, which has been in steep descent for at least two years now, and we’re seeing an up tick in the direct response category which I think speaks to again that consumer willingness to take out the pocket book. So with respect to food, I gave you a specific answer, and that is a general comment about the environment and if you have more questions I would be happy to take them as well.

So I continue to believe that when we look back over a ten year period it will look a lot like it did over the last ten years where we had the ability to take the free cash flow that we had of about $2 billion and reinvest about half of that in our businesses and we returned about half of that through dividend and through the share repurchase program and obviously should we get to a point that you know we find it very, very difficult to find those investments you know I am sure we might reconsider opening the share repurchase program, but we have been as you know very focused on paying our debt down as aggressively as we could because we believe that there going to be appropriate investment opportunities to broaden our footprint although we just haven’t made any of those transactions yet.

97953,109559725,70536,"Meredith Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Meredith Corporation","Executives","Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2010 marked the return to earnings growth for the Meredith Corporation. As detailed in today's earnings release, we increased earnings per share by 10% for the year before special items highlighted",2194,"Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2010 marked the return to earnings growth for the Meredith Corporation. As detailed in today's earnings release, we increased earnings per share by 10% for the year before special items highlighted by a 27% growth in earnings per share in the fourth quarter. 
Total company revenues were approximately flat with the prior year, even with about $15 million less in net political advertising revenue. Total company operating expenses declined 3% before special items and we reduced our debts by 20%.
At the same, we continue to invest in new media platforms including mobile and e-Tablet. Additionally, we increased our dividend to shareholders for the 17th consecutive year. Given the weak climate, I'm both proud and encouraged by our performance. Central to our strong results, more performance improvement initiatives put in place in fiscal 2008, when the early signs of the economic downturn appeared and expanded upon in both fiscal 2009 and 2010. 
We've established a strategic plan called Vision 2013. It's a detailed road map designed to position Meredith for both near and longer term growth. I'd like to take a moment to provide a quick overview. I think it's crucial to understanding why we believe Meredith is uniquely positioned to prosper and grow in an evolving competitive media market place. 
At its core, Vision 2013 contains fixed key strategies. I'll briefly highlight each noting progress achieved during our fiscal 2010. First of all to exploit the economic recovery, this strategy revolves around the beliefs that gaining market share should be a primary focus during the time of economic weakness.
Over the last two years, we've increased our share of magazine advertising revenue by nearly three full percentage points to 12.3%. That represents the highest share in our history. Our television stations outperformed the industry as well. 
Secondly to optimize our core businesses. We've made significant progress against reengineering initiatives inside both our national and our local media groups, including content creation sales and consumer marketing. These initiatives resulted in efficiencies and improved products as well as cost savings overtime.
Third, to expand our digital businesses. We enhanced the online consumer experience and have taken steps to better monetize our growing online traffic leading to an 11% increase in online advertising revenue in our fiscal 2010. We launched mobile platforms for three key brands, better homes and gardens, parents and fitness and just completed the acquisition of the hyper factory, one of the world's leading mobile marketing company. At the same time, we joined publishing and broadcasting industry consortium to further develop the mobile and e-Tablets platforms for consumers and advertisers alike. 
Fourth, to significantly grow Meredith's integrated marketing. In the last four years, we've doubled revenues and acquired six firms to provide sought after expertise in digital, Vierl, social, mobile, healthcare along with database marketing. In fiscal 2010, these new services helped to partially offset market driven weakness in core customer publishing activities. 
Fifth, to enhance and extend our key brands. We built better homes and gardens into one of the most successful media brands in the industry. Among our many licensing relationships, I'll single out our ongoing program with Wal-Mart, where we doubled the number of SKU's over the prior year to approximately 2,000.
And finally, to build shareholder value overtime. While we obviously have no direct control over our share size, we're pleased to see it increase 25% during fiscal 2010 and in an environment where many media companies are slashing or eliminating dividend. We increased our dividend again in January of '10.
We clearly have improved our competitive position across the business. However, while fiscal 2010 was a better year for Meredith in most respects, I should note that our performance as it relates to advertising, is still below the historic ties we reached before the recession. The market place remains volatile both month-to-month and across our client base. 
With persistent high unemployment, I think the economy will continue to be choppy over the relative near term. As we enter fiscal 2011, we expect strong growth in non political television advertising revenues, to continue for at least the first half of the fiscal year and we anticipate a good political advertising season. We expect that magazine advertising will be flat to down slightly on higher nets per page in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as we cycle against our strongest quarter of industry out performance last year.
Now I'll review our operating group performance. National Media Group operating profit increased 11% in fiscal '10 over the prior year. We achieved this growth in part like run revenues and high margin activities such as brand licensing and through strong, discipline on expenses, which were down about 5% for the year. National Media Group advertising revenues were approximately flat with the prior year and stronger second half performance in categories such as household supplies, prescription drug and direct response off set decline in the first half.
Meredith Interactive Media advertising revenues grew sharply, up 17% for the year. Our advertising performance continued to exceed the industry in fiscal '10. For example, 11 of our 14 measured magazine titles gained share in the fiscal year according to PIB. All told, we've gained share in the magazine industry for five consecutive years and most recently, have outperformed the industry for seventeen months. 
As a result, we closed fiscal 2010 with the market share of 12.3%, which is an all-time fiscal year-end high. Part of the reason our advertising has outperformed the industry is that we overindecked in categories that have performed relatively well during the recession. 
As an example, our three largest categories in fiscal '10 - food and beverage, toiletries and cosmetics and prescription drugs were among the best performing categories in the industry. We generate twice as many dollars from the food and beverage and prescription drug categories as the industry overall.
Conversely, our under exposure to lower performing categories such as apparel and automotive worked in our favor. We have one quarter of the exposure to apparel and one third of the exposure to automotive compared to the industry taken as a whole.
Also helping our performance of course is our very strong brand and strong sales execution across multiple media platforms, including in book, online, mobile and video. As an example of our multi platform success, in the August issues of many of our largest titles, we debuted a large new program, aimed at moms called the Mother Board. We're launching it on an exclusive year long basis for Wal-Mart.
At the heart of the program is the private community of moms, who will generate consumer insight that will be used throughout the program. We've also identified a larger group of a million women, who will receive a weekly e-newsletter with Mother Board findings and Wal-Mart messages.
We advanced our strategic initiatives to raise our profile in the beauty category during fiscal 2010. Our prime example is an integrated program created for skin cream Tribeca. It leverages social media such as Facebook, YouTube and blogs. It also includes elements with more magazines reinvention conventions, product placement on the syndicated better show and the digital presence on both the Meredith women's network and broadband channels that are TV.
Looking at early fiscal 2011, our industry out performance is moderating when compared to our peers. This is mainly because we have much stronger year ago comparable and because there is an industry we're seeing some recovery in categories where Meredith under indexes the industry taken as a whole. 
As the overall ad environment improved, we expect total industry performance will exceed Meredith to some degree through the balance of calendar 2010. However, we're working diligently to maintain the market share gains achieved over the last couple of years.
As I touched on in my opening remarks, we continue to grow and enhance our strong connection to the American consumer. Looking at the National Media Group in particular in fiscal 2010, magazine readership grew to a 113 million, up from a 110 million a year ago and up 13% from a decade ago. 
Revenues and profits related to our circulation activities increased including a revenue gain of 4% at newsstands. The number of monthly online unique visitors and page use grows more than 25%. 
Sales of our branded retail products continue to grow. Beyond the very strong reception our brands have received at Wal-Mart, we also experience growth from our real estate franchise partner [Realogy]. Today the Better Homes and Gardens real estate franchise is represented by 5,000 sales associates in the 16 states.
Meredith's integrated marketing were down about 7% in fiscal '10 compared to the prior year, primarily related to the soft custom publishing environment I mentioned a few moments ago. However, revenues rose 5% in the second half of the fiscal year due primarily due to strong new business development. This included interesting applications such as the new iPad, application for Kraft foods called Big Pork, Little Pork. It's targeted at parents with young children in the household. It launched a few weeks ago with more than 300 recipes, custom videos and games. 
It follows the very successful iFood assistance that we build for Kraft and launched in the fall of 2008. Big Pork, Little Pork is designed to help Kraft connect with consumers in different and powerful ways and recipes can be shared via Facebook or email.
We continue to expand our relationship with the Chrysler group. As you remember, we regained this business last December. Our scope of work began with development and management of Chrysler's customer relationship management initiatives in both the United States and Canada. It's grown since then to include social media related works and is today approximately 50% larger than our prior program.
As a closing note on integrated marketing, our strategy of digital acquisitions is certainly proving beneficial. Our digital agencies are attracting more integrated opportunities involving multiple discipline and traditional discipline including direct mail, content creation and analytics, Examples of this work that we recently won from Wells Fargo and SunTrust. Our digital capabilities are helping our top line as well where revenues grew nearly 10% in fiscal 2010 now make up half of total Meredith's integrated marketing revenue.
Turning now to our local media group, fiscal 2010 operating profits grew nearly 25% excluding special items, thanks to 5% growth in non political advertising and a slight decline in expenses before special items. We grew total revenues in fiscal '10, quite an accomplishment for a non political year. 
From an advertising standpoint, it's clearly a tale of two halves. After declining in the first half of the fiscal year, we rebounded to growing non political advertising revenues 15% in the second half over the prior year period. Our improving performance was driven largely by automated related advertising which grew 65% in the second half of the year.
Interestingly though, automotive advertising was not the only highlight. Seven of our ten largest categories grew in the fiscal year including professional services and restaurants which are our number two and our number three categories. We created several new sales strategies during the year that helped drive revenue growth. 
We're aggressively recording newspaper advertising clients with a program called “Print to Motion” where we turn static newspaper ads into video. We're focusing on large national and institutional companies in our markets that don't traditionally advertise in local media. We sold significant new programs to Hartford financial and [Wellstar Gallop] in Atlanta.
And lastly, we launched one service, a program that features a series of non traditional television advertising opportunities. These programs demonstrate the creativity and the competitive drive we're bringing to the market place and they help to make Meredith one of the broadcast industries best performers for the year.
The other fact driving our success is a very strong connection that we build to the local consumers. This is exemplified by the most recent May ratings book, where in the important adult, aged 25 to 54 demo, our CBS affiliate and Hartford continue to lead the market, finishing first in every news cash for the seventh consecutive rating's book.
Nashville was number one in every evening news period for the sixth consecutive book and Portland with number one in late news. Atlanta continued to gain reaching the number two position in late news while Las Vegas, Phoenix and Kansas City were all strong number two late news catch as well.
We also grew non advertising revenues in fiscal 2010. Retransmission fees grew more than 40% and we delivered strong revenue growth at Meredith's video studio, led by custom video projects for corporate clients and continued expansion of the daily better show. 
This fall, better will be in more than 80 markets, reaching more than 50% of the United States. We've consistently maintained at local broadcast television, is the most powerful and efficient way for advertisers to reach the local American consumer. I'm pleased to see that that belief is reflected in our performance.
Now I'll turn the discussion over to Joe Ceryanec, our Chief Financial Officer for financial updates and the fiscal 2011 outlook.

For the year we generate a 192 million in cash flow from operations, which was up from a 181 million a year ago. We generate 52 million in the fourth quarter, which was up 42 million or $10 million from the prior year. For the year, company operating expenses declined 3% excluding special items.
We reduced our total debt balance by 80 million to 300 million at the end of the year or a 20% reduction from the prior year. At the end of the year, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, which was down from 1.8 times at the beginning of the fiscal and over the two year period, our deleveraged story is even more powerful as we eliminated about 40% of our debt or a 185 million over the two year period. 
Also during June, we renewed our $150 million revolving credit facility or a three year term and terms very consistent with the prior facility. We continue to return cash to our shareholders during fiscal '10, increasing our dividend by 2% and that was on top of a 5% increase in fiscal 2009.
We remain one of the few media and marketing companies with the financial strengths and confidence to continue to increase our dividend even as difficult economic environment. So even in these difficult times have continued to strengthen our balance sheet and as we look to the year ahead, we're going to continue to aggressively manage our cash and expenses and be in a very good position to capitalize on opportunities as they arise for us to invest in and grow our business. 
Now we turn to our outlook. We expect fiscal 2011, full year, earnings per share to range from $2.40 to $2.75. As we look more closely at fiscal 2011, we expect to continue to fact a bottle of advertising environment, impacted by a continuing difficult economic climate. 
We expect high single digit increases in both paper prices and post-it rates. We expect to spend and approximately $5 million to $6 million related to the development of our e-Tablet platform, including our investment in the next issue media industry consortium.
We also expect to benefit from an estimated 25 to 30 million of net political advertising revenues in our television stations. With the majority of that being booked in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, last year we generated about 9 million of net political advertising. 
As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we expect earnings per share to range from $0.47 to $0.52. Again looking more closely at the first quarter of '011, we expect the total company advertising revenue to increase 6% to 7% over the prior year. 
Local media grew non political advertising pacings which are a snap shot in time and changed frequently, are currently up in the mid to high teens. However, depending on the strength of political advertising and its related impact on total advertising inventory, these non-political patients may moderate as we move through the quarter. National media group adverting revenues are expected to be flat to down slightly and higher nets per page as Steve mentioned as we cycle against our strongest quarter over quarter, industry over performance. With that, I'll turn it back to Steven for closing comments.

On the magazine side, we anticipate that the performance will improve a bit as we move through the balance of the year, from where we are now when we're up against less strong industry out performance but as you are aware, we have very, very, very limited visibility.

And I think if you've been following the trade press and the popular press in our industry you are seeing more and more discussion and more and more emphasis on improving the relationship with the consumer, both in terms of the product and the economic relationship. And it's central to what our mobile and tablet initiatives are about. And as we look at consumer pricing in our core magazine business we see both the opportunity and the imperative to get more revenue from the consumer as we deliver more value. So, a case in point in 2010 we raised the new stand price on better homes and gardens from 350 to 399, saw virtually no fall off in sale. 
We have rolled out a price increase on family circle, and it seemed very favorable results relative to our expectations. And we think it goes back to what I just said earlier, the opportunity and the imperative to get more revenue from the consumer as we invest more in our products and deliver more value. So we are very committed to that, and its working.
On the second front, rate basis, I think that you've seen Meredith a history of judicious behavior in that respect, and what we do all the time is calibrate the level of consumer demand with the number of copies that we're putting out in the marketplace. And our ability to generate contribution and profit on the margin is a function of that. So, from time to time we will look at our magazines and their levels of rate base, and make decisions based on our judgment and what the economics tell us about what the level of circulation should be relative to the consumer demand and also the advertiser positioning in the marketplace. So we did it with Ladies' Home Journal, we did it with Traditional Home, we absolutely made the right decision and believe that it's going well on both the consumer side and the advertising side.

And in calendar 2009, a very interesting thing happened where Meredith with a 12.3% share in PIB revenue moved into third place in the magazine business from fourth, and many years ago we were fifth or sixth. And our emphasis on share has been deliberate and has been successful. Steve talked about the market share gains. To marry it with pricing, I'll sort of give you this kind of framework to think about. As we took a full two points of share on pricing overall, we made modest concessions in the low-to-mid single-digit range on our realized CPMs on the income statement.
We knew that would happen. It was part of the plan. We actually did a little bit better than we had hoped on the respect, and in totality you see the results that ad revenue in fiscal '10, our business was flat versus the prior year. And you don't see that happening anywhere else in the industry.
So, we calibrate this just like we calibrate the consumer equation, and as we go into fiscal '11, understanding that the physical cost environment is changing with paper and postage, we are seeing now in fiscal '11 a nice uptick in our realized pricing in the mid single-digit range. And overall volume is a little bit down, but revenue is just about flat and we do that deliberately and we are generally successful in executing on the goal that we set for ourselves. So as we go into fiscal '11, we have an emphasis on share, but I don't think it's realistic to think that we are going to gain two points of share, where our focus on holding our share and improving our pricing and so far that's occurred.

We have a Chief Revenue Officer Tom Hardy, who defines how we put all of our assets together into these programs and he is in the pivot position to make the critical decisions. And we do that deliberately and I think with good judgment and great skill and it has been central to the share gains that we talked about earlier. Specifically with respect to your question, Steve told you in the script that our interactive ad revenue was up in the mid teens in fiscal '10. That is not the case for display in the online environment overall, and a big piece of that is our ability and our decision to package our big online branded inventory with our print and other assets into integrated programs, and it's roughly now representing 25% to 30% of all of our interactive ad revenue in that activity.

Your point is correct as that we continue to mature, some of these expenses are going to start being treated as development and get hung up on the balance sheet. Right now it's hard for us to understand that. So we've got $5 million to $6 million sitting in our P&L for next year.

And you know we always certain markets where we'd like to either expand our presence through a duopoly or enter, and you know, we have our hit list of magazine properties.

Mike Lovell: Hi, good morning everyone; thanks for joining us. We’ll begin the call this morning with comments from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Lacy and our Chief Financial Officer Joe Ceryanec. Then we’ll turn the call over to questions. Also on the line with us this morning is Paul Karpowicz, President of our Local Media Group and Tom Harty, who is joining this call for the first time as President of our National Media Group. Tom was the primary architect of our very successful efforts to gain market share in his most recent role here at Meredith as President of Consumer Magazine.
An archive of today’s discussion will be available later this afternoon on our investor website and a transcript will follow.
Let me remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ from our forecasts. Some of the reasons why are described at the end of our press release issued earlier this morning and in some of our SEC filings.

I am pleased to report a strong first quarter and start to our fiscal 2011. Some highlights detailed in today’s earnings release: we increased earnings per share by 40%, total company revenues by 4% and total advertising revenues by 7% in the quarter. We grew television spot advertising revenues 27% including a record $12 million in net political advertising along with an 8% increase in non-political advertising. We achieved higher rates for National Media Group Magazine advertising pages and advertising to our national website increased more than 20%.
We generated strong revenue growth from businesses not dependent on traditional advertising including Meredith integrated marketing, where revenue was up 7% and brand licensing, where revenue was up 17%. We reduced total company expenses 1%, while continuing to invest in emerging media platforms including mobiles and e-tablet. Over a two-year period, our operating expenses are down 9%.
Stepping back for a moment to look at the current media and marketing environment, we are encouraged by the strengthening revenue picture across our businesses. We anticipated a strong television political advertising season and it’s meeting our expectation. Non-political television advertising continues to be strong as well even with less available inventory. On the national scene, magazine advertising for the remainder of calendar 2010 is also strengthening and we are very encouraged by the growing market demands for our digital platforms including mobile.
Still on a month-to-month and client-by-client basis, we continue to experience an advertising marketplace characterized by volatility and very low visibility on both the national and the local levels. This makes forecasting demand be on the end of calendar 2010 very difficult and as a result, we don’t have any solid reject reach yet on early calendar 2011 advertising revenues.
Our strategy to concurrently develop revenue sources not dependent on traditional advertising continues to yield results particularly in custom marketing and in brand licensing. Demand for Meredith’s integrated marketing services is intensifying, no doubt as a result of the combination of content development, CRM, digital and social capabilities we can now deliver across the marketplace. And we continue to be very pleased with the enthusiastic consumer response to our branded products at retail.
Finally, in connection - our connection to the consumer, which is the bedrock of our advertising and marketing activities, continues to strengthen as we add new platforms. Enhancing consumer relevance for our brands in a fragmented media landscape continues to be a top priority.
Now let’s take a closer look at our two major business operations beginning with the Local Media Group. As I mentioned, fiscal 2011 first quarter operating profit increased significantly due primarily to 27% growth in television spot advertising revenues. Political advertising was strong across the board in part due to very competitive primary races in several of our markets, including Hartford and Kansas City, where there are open seats for Governor and in the US Senate; Las Vegas, where incumbents are facing strong challenges; and in Nashville, where there are open seats for Governor and in the US House.
In addition, we’ve made special efforts to educate campaign about our increased news presence, particularly our FOX affiliates and we’ve successfully increased our share of political advertising dollars as a result. Non-political advertising revenue increases were broad-based as eight of our Top 10 categories grew, including automotive, retail, media, and professional services. Automotive advertising was up nearly 40%. We continue to aggressively pursue innovative sales strategies to increase revenue in the local marketplace. This includes targeting advertisers that have been traditionally been newspaper clients only.
Additionally, we’ve developed special advertising opportunities aimed at large national companies that are headquartered in our market that have not advertised on local television. Another factor in our success is our continued strong connection to the local consumer. During the most recent July ratings book, our CBS affiliate in Hartford continued its Number 1 position in all new day parts as well as sign-on to sign-off. Our NBC affiliate in Nashville is Number 2 in both late news and sign-on to sign-off and also posted growth in the morning news.
Our CBS affiliates in Atlanta and Phoenix and FOX affiliates in Greenville and Las Vegas, all grew evening news viewership. Our newscasts that our CBS affiliate in (inaudible) grew as well. Our daily Better syndicated television show increased its carriage to approximately 80 markets, now reaching nearly 60% of household across the US.
In November, Better will launch on KCAL in Los Angeles, the nation’s Number 2 market. As a result, Better will be airing in four of the nation’s five largest markets.
Now turning to our National Media Group. Advertising revenues were approximately even with the prior year, a little stronger than where we thought they’d finish on higher net advertising revenue per magazine page. Remember in Q1, we were cycling against our strongest quarter of industry outperformance in the year-ago period when our advertising revenues outperformed the overall magazine industry by almost 30 percentage points, according to Publishers Information Bureau.
Looking at our top magazine advertising categories, we saw increases in prescription drugs, retail, household supplies and apparels. The toiletries and cosmetics, home, and food and beverage categories were weaker.
Online advertising revenue at our National Digital Properties surged 21% compared to the year-ago period, driven by growth in pharmaceutical, consumer packaged goods and the retail categories.
We continue to expand our 360 degree multi-platform marketing approach to the national marketplace. As examples, we renewed our successful program with Church & Dwight positioning Arm & Hammer products as the top choice for budget and time-conscious family. The [Well Spent] program brought together in-magazine elements including editorial tips that ran in Better Homes and Gardens, Parents, Family Circle and others. We also developed a sweepstakes program and showcased three families in custom Arm & Hammer branded videos. These videos were distributed online via the Better show and Meredith’s broadband syndicated network.
For Yoplait, we created across platform campaign called the Perfect Fit to promote several of its weight management brands. We developed content focused on readers who are working to manage their ways with Yoplait products.
The first story debut in the October issues of Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle and More. We also developed custom video content for yoplait.com and aired segments on the Better show and across the Meredith’s broadband syndicated network.
We continue to develop our capabilities and expertise in the beauty category for Eucerin through a campaign called Skin First. This program which helps consumers take better care of their skin includes social-media platform such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogs as well as sponsorships of More’s Reinvention Convention and custom video contents aired on the Better show.
Finally, we are receiving strong reception to an exciting new program for moms called the Motherboard which we launched on an exclusive year-long basis for Wal-Mart. At the heart of the program is a private community of moms who are generating consumer insights used throughout the program. So far in just its first quarter of operation 700,000 women have joined the motherboard and are receiving weekly e-news letters with motherboard findings and Wal-Mart messaging.
Turning now to circulation, revenues declined 4% in the quarter as expected due primarily to the strategic decision in January of 2010 to reposition our special interest media business. However, special interest media profit increased significantly in the quarter as a result of this well executed repositioning. We continue to pursue initiatives to increase online subscriptions and migrate other consumer circulation transactions online.
During the quarter we launched enhanced consumer website for many of our magazine brands. These sites are designed to simplify the online subscription renewal and billing process as well as increased opportunities to cross-sell our products. We continue to enhance a very strong and growing connection our brands have with the consumer, specifically readership for our measured magazines is up 3% from the year-ago period and currently stands at 113 million according to the recent data from Media Market Research and Intelligence. We attracted 16 million monthly online unique visitors and 200 million page views through our National Media Group website in the quarter.
Sales of our branded retail products continue to grow, thanks largely to the ongoing success of the Better Homes and Gardens line of product at Wal-Mart stores across the country. Today that program includes 2500 SKUs, up from 1500 in the year-ago period. Earlier this month we launched a line of branded top quality cookware products and small appliances at Wal-Mart stores across the country.
During the quarter our real estate partner Realogy signed its largest franchisee to date to the network. The addition of the California-based Mason-McDuffie is one of the nation’s largest real estate brokerage firms brings the Better Homes and Gardens real estate network to approximately 7000 sales professionals in 180 offices across 20 states.
In addition, we recently signed agreements to launch local version of our magazine and online brands in several countries including India and Russia.
Finally, consumer demand is growing strongly for mobile related sites that we launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 for Better Homes and Gardens, Parents and Fitness. Monthly unique visitors and page views to these new sites averaged about a million and six million respectively in the first quarter of operation.
Meredith Integrated marketing revenues rose 7% in the first quarter of fiscal ‘11. Growth was driven by our cross platform approach, incorporating content development, CRM, digital and social capability. Examples include a new assignment for Lowe’s to publish the Home Improvement retailer’s creative ideas custom magazine program as well as an expanded role associated with Lowe’s creative ideas consumer website.
The new work builds off a longer term relationship with Lowe’s providing content for inspirational Home Improvement Projects. We also won additional work for the Sun Trust bank providing editorial content to populate its website which was initially redesigned by GenX, one of our digital agencies.
Our SunTrust relationship is a good example of a client that began as a digital only account and has now expanded to include our custom publishing capability as well.
Finally we continue to expand our relationship with Chrysler Group that began in early calendar 2010. We’re directing its customer relationship management initiatives in both the United States and Canada. This assignment covers the full vehicle ownership lifecycle from welcome packages through off lease marketing. It crosses many of our marketing disciplines including direct mail and email marketing along with social media. Today, narrative integrated marketing is attracting more opportunities than ever before as a result of our multiplatform integrated service offering.
Our revenue is well balanced too as digital revenue accounts for about half of the overall integrated marketing revenue stream.
Now I’ll turn the discussion over to Joe Ceryanec, our Chief Financial Officer for a financial update and our earnings outlook.

As Steve mentioned we grew revenues 4% and earnings per share 40% in our first quarter. And while the macro environment has truly improved from a year ago, another key factor contributing to our earnings growth is and has consistently been our ability to hold the line on operating expenses. They were down 1% from the prior year and down 9% on a two-year basis.
We generated $27 million in cash flow from operations and reduced our debt by 5% to $285 million resulting in a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.1 times at September 30, 2010. During the quarter we also invested approximately $25 million in acquisitions, which included our purchase of the mobile marketing specialist the hyper factory and the final contingent payment for social medial agency, new media strategies.
We continue to aggressively manage our cash and expenses and continue to be in a very good position to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
Now turning to our outlook, we expect fiscal 2011 second quarter earnings to range from $0.75 to $0.80 per share. Looking more closely at the second quarter fiscal of 2011 compared to a year ago period, we expect total advertising revenues to increase in the low double digits. Local media group non-political advertising revenues are expected to increase in the low to mid-single digits and we expect net political advertising revenues to range from $15 million to $18 million.
Now depending on the strength of political advertising and its related impact on total advertising inventory, non-political advertising results may differ from our current expectations.
National Media Group advertising revenues are expected to increase in the low to mid-single digits as well. With full fiscal 2011, we expect earnings per share to range from $2.50 to $2.75 and as we look more closely at full fiscal 2011, we continue to face a volatile ad environment impacted by continued economic uncertainty. We expect high single digit increases in paper and modest increases in postal rates and we continue to expect investment spending of approximately $5 million to $6 million related to the development of our e-tablet platform.
To conclude our prepared comments, we continue to experience a marketplace that is volatile on a month-to-month and client-by-client basis at both the national and local levels. We have a lot of work ahead of us to regain and surpass the performance we achieved prior to the recession. However, we made strong progress during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and are committed to building shareholder value over time.
With that we’ll be happy to open it up for questions.

First of all, I think we have two very distinct points of difference from some of those other large holding companies that you might have mentioned and in one case and an important distinction is that across the work we do in our custom marketing operations we don’t place media, and that’s an important distinction because of the media that we work together with those businesses on for our traditional both national and local activities.
But on the flip side of that what we bring to the party that is much, much more difficult for those organizations is once the design of the program is completed, we then also have the ability to develop and execute the content because that’s what we do for a living and in most cases the work that we do on behalf of these individual companies and brands is not radically dissimilar from the work we do to extend our own businesses and brands whether that be information on cooking or gardening or a home remodeling and improvement the content development capability that we have through traditional Meredith is really the major point of distinction in the marketplace and then as you know over the last four or five years we have really taken what was traditionally a pretty industrial strength custom publishing business and built around that capabilities that include not only the creation of digital applications but content for those social, mobile, etc. So we don’t place media and we can create content in a much better way than most of our traditional agency competitors.

Call it 1% to 2% for the year and probably a similar trend next quarter on the magazine side.
On the local media broadcast side, we did see a little bit of a tick up this quarter. We had some programming expenses that came through. I think on our last call I said we expected the broadcast group to be relatively flat and we still expect that for the year. And then on the corporate side, we were down from last year partly because our spending on, as I mentioned the e-reader platform, which includes the next issue media investment, for the year they expect to be 5 to 6 million but the first quarter was a little light, it was about a half a million.
So we would expect on the corporate side that number to tick up kind of for the remainder of the year about a million bucks or million to a million and a half a quarter going forward. As we ramp up that e-reader investment.

We have quite an aggressive development function here. Every media asset that moves we are very, very well aware of and we have looked in the last probably 24 months at six or eight different television opportunities. What we would be the most interested in would be a property that because of its geographic nature would allow us to really aggressively execute a cost play using one of our two large and well developed technology hubs that we have built in the last 18 months in both Atlanta and Phoenix and that really allows for a lot of what I think of as behind the scenes functions to be taken out and have them an aggressive news gathering function and a sales and marketing function on the street, but without a lot of once again behind the scenes costs.
So if we have the opportunity, especially in one of our markets or nearby as an example if we could acquire station in Tucson because we’ve got a large CBS affiliate in Phoenix that would be a very good play for us. So we would love the opportunity to provide Paul another property to run.

How much of that you think comes from advertising that actually stems out of the Supreme court decision to allow wider group of people to show ads as opposed to just to your candidates.

Now some of that has moved out, some of it quite frankly has been displaced by political which came in generally at higher rates. So there is no doubt that that didn’t take place.
In terms of the Supreme court ruling, I would have to say United for America some of the other organizations that are out there, I think those would have come in regardless of the Supreme court decisions. And I think what we found historically is that regardless of what the political rules may or may not be generally groups find a way to spend the money.
And what it speaks to really is just how effective television advertising can be for candidates that they know that if they really want to get their message out and they’ve got to get it out there quickly and they’ve got to get it out there aggressively, I think they’ve discovered and they certainly know that spot television is the way to go. So I don’t think the Supreme court decision hurts at all, it will be interesting to see if after this election Congress decides to take a look at that again and revisit that in some fashion but my experience has been that generally the groups will figure out a way to spend the money for the candidates or causes that they want to support.

First of all, at the highest level we are very excited about the opportunity really I think for our consumer to bring together what historically has been sort of a lean back a print activity with lean forward activity on like better-homes-and-gardens.com and then the ability to infuse video into that same consumer experience. Having said all of that, the prices of these devices are still quite high to be a mass reach consumer vehicle, although if we look 36 or 48 months downstream the research that we have had would say that we believe about a third of our consumers will in fact have such a device when the price comes down in the $250 to $300 range.
So we think there is a great opportunity. I think you’re also well aware that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on paper and postage in printing. And even if we were able over time to move a modest 10% to 15% of our file to this sort of a digital delivery mechanism, there would be a very, very positive financial results for the company. Having said all that, we believe that in the early goings of this and especially if you look at information that has come out on all sorts of applications that have been downloaded and also on the numbers of downloads of the tablet available magazines that are in the marketplace today, the numbers are very, very small.
So there is going to be a lot of testing and learning but at the highest level, we think this will be very good for the industry overall but it’s a downstream activity probably at least 36 months before you’re going to see any meaningful industry wide traction.
