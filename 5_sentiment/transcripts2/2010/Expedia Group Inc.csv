I'm happy to tip things off today with a couple of significant developments on a capital structure side of things. First, we closed on a new three-year $750 million revolver, which affords us well over $1 billion dollars in liquidity even at the seasonal low point on our cash cycle. And combined with our ongoing cash generation, this ensures more than adequate capital to address Expedia's internal investment opportunities, as well as value-add, bolt-on acquisitions. Second, today we're unveiling the company's first ever quarterly cash dividend, which is part of Expedia's ongoing commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Now turning to results, Q4 cap is a successful year for the company. Expedia delivered 2009 free cash flow of nearly $600 million despite the worst economic conditions many of us have lived through, and despite our cutting over $150 million in gross annualized fee revenue.On the advertising side of the house, TripAdvisors'  revenue growth accelerated to 29% on sustained traffic and quick growth, as well as improved CDCs. Trip recently launched its Business Listings product allowing hotels to directly merchandise their websites and its way, telephone numbers and e-mail. And if you'll forgive me on the shameless plug, first year listing subscriptions are starting as low as $300 through the end of February. Overall, our Advertising businesses now constitute about 11% of our revenues representing a significant differentiator versus our competition, as well as the growing hedge against media rate inflation.CDC's international businesses hit a record 41% of revenue in Q4, with Hotels.com now operating over 70 sites around the globe, and our Expedia brand launching its 20th site in Mexico. Our managed travel provider, Egencia, meaningfully outpaced competitor growth in Q4 while adding nine additional countries to relocalize partnerships. Looking forward in the first half of 2010, Expedia will open a new office in Switzerland that will serve as a global headquarters for our lodging supply group, bolstering Expedia's presence in the heart of our most competitive battleground.In closing, I'd like to comment on a frequent topic of investor discussion, which is the notion of Expedia as a countercyclical play. I want to reiterate that we are not concerned about our hotel inventory availability in an upturn. We made significant investments in PSG to ensure that we maintain industry leading access to inventory in all environments. As importantly, we have a history of doing well in a rising ADR environments. To illustrate, take a look at Page 10 of the updated investor deck on our IR site, where you'll see some of our strongest growth which came during peak ADR periods. And here in Q4 '09, we delivered the best hotel revenue growth in nearly two years despite an improving ADR environment. To be clear, we're not seeing Expedia as a cyclical play either, but we are saying, we've demonstrated we can deliver growth in both downturns and upturns. And we don't expect that to change going forward. Mike?"

Q4 revenue margin declined primarily due to our fee actions in the first half of the year. Q4's decline was greater than Q3's primarily due to air fares. Variances and fares meaningfully impact gross bookings but have little impact on our revenues. Holding all else constant, had airfares declined as much year-over-year in Q4 as they did in Q3, our revenue margins would've actually decreased less than the 98 bps we experienced in Q3. As we've said before, we continue to think that once we lapped the bulk of our fee cuts in Q3 2010, and assuming that airfares don't rise more than low single digits, revenue margins will be flat to up in the back half of 2010. Q4 '09's rev margin decline is a great illustration that rev margin by itself is not a particularly useful metric with which to evaluate Expedia, as there are so many factors that can influence one quarter's rev margin from product mix to FX, to chain hotel to advertising mix, and on and on.It's our position that if we continue to drive meaningful revenue and cash flow growth over the long term, quarterly revenue margin gyrations aren't terribly important. And bear in mind, the most important driver of rev margin over the long-term is supplier margins, which have been stable.Turning to OIBA margins, we drove 127 bps of leverage in Q4 due to continued efficiencies in COGS and marketing. To the downside, G&A and technical content [ph] grew faster than revenue due to higher bonus accruals, depreciation from prior investments and higher legal fees and settlements, which together made up roughly 70% of the total increase in these two expense categories combined. We expect to lever both G&A and technic content [ph] in 2010 on more normalized comps and over the longer term.On taxes, our A&I rate was lower than anticipated primarily due to a reduction in some tax reserves. In addition, we began to see some modest improvement in our effective tax rate in late 2009 due to certain changes in our business structure, which will continue in 2010. And we think these activities, combined with the relative earnings growth in our international businesses, should help decrease our effective cash tax rate by a few hundred basis points below our typical A&I rate of 38% to 39% in 2010 and beyond. Turning to 2010, although there is still significant uncertainty in the economy generally, and travel specifically, we feel comfortable enough with the operational and financial improvements we've made in our businesses that we expect our 2010 OIBA growth rate to exceed our 9% growth in 2009. This assumes that FX rates don't vary very markedly from what we're seeing today.Before questions, some quick points on the first half of 2010. Keep in mind, we ratcheted marketing spend down sharply in Q1 '09 in response to the economic environment. In 2010, we're returning to a much more typical seasonal spend pattern, which means Q1 '10 marketing spend will increase significantly from Q4 '09, consistent with seasonality we observed in prior years. Therefore, we do expect to see selling and marketing grow in excess of revenue in Q1.In addition, we're making some investments in cost of sales that we are confident will deliver leverage in the second half of the year, but that will require a ramp-up of certain expenses leading to slight COGS deleverage in the front half of the year. Lastly, we do expect to see full year free cash flow grow in line with or better than OIBA growth and 2010, with CapEx coming in around $100 million. With that, let's turn to Q&A. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

The room night growth, the air ticket growth that you saw for the quarter was fairly stable throughout the quarter. There wasn't any significant kind of upward movements or downward movements there. The ADR environment certainly improved as the quarter went along. So ADRs got better. And so from a revenue standpoint, the hotel, the Merchant Hotel business looked better as the quarter proceeded. And certainly in January, we think those ADR trends are continuing. And so the ADR kind of headwind that we had all of last year should be easing up on a go forward basis. As far as inventory on the European side, we've got about 16,000 agency hotels. We added 9,000 in Europe. And we think we're in a very good position from an inventory standpoint in 2010 to really start pushing more demand to the hotels from multiple channels, search engine optimization, SEM, brand channels, et cetera. So we think, going on, was a good year for setting the infrastructure of the company, et cetera, and gaining inventory. And we think in 2010 it promptly execute and we're pretty confident on where we are right now."

As far as sales and marketing, we are continuing to gain leverage and that's very good news. It's indicative of a couple of trends. One is, we are getting much better at improving profitability on a channel basis and our data collection is better. I think the teams are more effective. And so we are pushing out unprofitable spend and efficient spend, I'd say more effectively than we have in the past. CDC trends have been quite friendly to us since the beginning of the year. Although I do believe though that the CDC trends are going to get a little more difficult as 2010 progresses. But they certainly, for 2009, they have been quite positive. The other benefit that we saw on the marketing side is that we were able to cut brand spend because we decreased fees. Transaction growth was still very strong. So the consumer value proposition of the product is better. And we also have been able to shift some of our channels to cheaper channels, search engine again, search engine optimization, the email channels, et cetera, have been pretty effective. We think the advertising comps going into 2010 are going to be a bit tougher. Certainly in Q1, we were very conservative on brand spend in Q1 '09. And as we feel better about the business now and in 2010, and we certainly do, we do think that it's time reinvest in the brand, which is why we'll get some early marketing deleverage that Mike talked about. But in general, from a long-term perspective, we think that we can manage our advertising and marketing costs generally in line with revenue. Although again the market will determine that to some extent. We do have a great hedge and a great growth engine as far as TripAdvisor, to add a media business really accelerating in Q4. And that was a reflection of very, very strong traffic growth, the TripAdvisor, some new products that we are introducing. And also CDCs for TripAdvisor getting better on a relative basis. They were still down in Q4 but they were down less in Q4 than they had been early in the year. And we think that 2010 is just going to be a great year for TripAdvisor."

And there's a number of things that go into that. And I point out that the comps will get more difficult for us on the top line for transactions as we the compo the fee actions that began in Q1 '09. We also, as I think, I indicated earlier there will be a tough marketing comp earlier in the year. As we return to the normal seasonality at that spend, we will get some COGS leveraged in the second half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year. The flattening of ADR declines that we've seen will put a little bit less pressure on revenue per room night. And to your question about the environment, obviously expect some level of volume impact as the ADRs start to shift. But as we indicated on Dara's comments, we expect to have strong inventory really in the environments. On the second question, on whether there's any abnormal pressure on room nights, the answer is no. The room nights grew very similar levels in Q4 in the U.S. as they did in Q3. And similar to Q3, we did that in an environment where overall demand, reported by Smith Travel, was actually down. And so we continue to take a significant amount of share in this environment."

We also have a number of items that we discussed really last quarter that still apply. We began consolidating CruiseShipCenters. I think at the end of the Q2 CruiseShipCenters has a much lower revenue margin actually has a higher OIBA margin. So that's a very profitable business for us. But when you just look at the revenue margin, it does have a negative impact. We also are recording welcome rewards as a contra revenue. And that is having an impact on the numbers as well. We are making some changes to that program that will improve the efficiency of that going forward. So we'll have less headwind from welcome rewards going forward. There is a chain hotel mix shift, which is hard to predict how that will react moving forward. It really depends upon who's most aggressive on pricing.

Comps were certainly easier and you would see our movement in ADR, we kind of, in Q4 last year, we moved down a bit ahead of the industry. So I think the comps for us were probably easier than industry comps as well. But the fundamentals we do think are getting a bit better, especially on the business travel side. So when you look at Egencia, for example, which is our business travel group, it's really showing nice strength. It's combination of same-store sales getting better, businesses starting to travel again and also very strong sales on the kind of new account front. So Egencia revenue in Q4 was up 17%, which is a pretty significant turnaround from earlier in the year. And that's fundamental strength as well as easy comps. So it's really a combination of both. I wouldn't say that things are super. But it's a heck of a lot better than last year. And I think everyone's feeling more stable and it's back to kind of managing the business. As far as Hotwire's performance, Hotwire continues to perform very, very well. We are seeing a little bit of weakness on the car side as fleets are lower percentage of our sales or on the opaque fronts. And opaque is an incredible deal for consumers. And as a result more opaque we sell, the better for Hotwire. And of course the Toyota recall in this first quarter hasn't helped any because it brings down fleets sizes. It'll help on the pricing front but won't help on the volume front. On the hotel side, Hotwire continues to be very, very strong room nights up over 30%. So on balance, we think Hotwire is good. The car side is going to be a little bit difficult in '09 and in 2010."

So other than the fee cuts, which were a negative as far as revenue on the air side, we don't expect to see very significant changes in air revenue per ticket. Overall, air revenue, on a go-forward basis, and certainly, in 2010 is going to improve because of the lapping of the fee cuts. So we feel pretty good about where the air business is, and certainly, air revenue looks much better in 2010 than it has for a while. As far as the new campaign for Expedia, I'd say it's a bit too soon to tell. Where You Book Matters campaign we're seeing searches for Expedia on Google, up significantly. We're seeing those searches kind of out-index the searches we see from our competition. But I think it's really early. I think the campaign is not as much of a price promotion campaign as we have had in the past, it's been more of a campaign of ,""Hey, here are the many, many things that Expedia can do for you."" And we think that as a campaign that we can work with and build over a long-term of time. So I think it's too soon to tell, but we're pleased with what we're seeing. It's also a campaign that we can take international. So we're taking that campaign, and for example, we're running spots in Scandinavia, et cetera. So I think so far, so good.

And we think that we are winning share amongst online travel agencies as well. But other than that, it's difficult to tell where it's coming from. Specifically in Q4, for example, in the U.S,  we grew Room Nights, 23%. And based on Smith Travel Research rooms sold or demand in Q4 was down 1%. So we know we're gaining share. And in general, as long as we're gaining share, we're happy. And that's our job, and it's something that we feel that we can execute on. Going forward, we're certainly gaining share on the air side as well. Fees help, and we think, as long as we keep building our great consumer value proposition, and I think in 2009, we made huge strides in improving our consumer value proposition, we think we're going to be just fine on a go-forward basis. You put that together with some of the loyalty programs and just better execution across the board, we feel pretty good about our share prospects on a go-forward basis. As far as dividends go, really, the thinking was pretty simple. We told you and our investors for some time that to the extent that we had excess capital, we would start to return it to our shareholders. One of the issues that we wanted to take care of was the renewal of our revolver. Our revolver was up, I believe in August of this year. We renewed it at $750 million over three years. We have over $600 million of cash in the books. The first half of the year, we are going to see very significant cash flows coming in. And we think free cash flow growth in 2010 is going to be very healthy, higher than OIBA growth. So we expect to have a fair amount of excess capital in 2010. So we felt those dividends   was a start of giving it back to our shareholders. It's a start, it's not the finish. And our goal over the long-term is to maximize shareholder value, and that will be through dividends; it'll be through acquisitions; it'll be through buybacks. And we'll allocate capital to the best part of that. And in the long term, we want to make our shareholders do well. And all of this is going to be in keeping with investment grade, and we have some really good news along that, because the fundamental liquidity of the company is pretty important to us. So we think this is just a start."

I think that Trip -- I'd say the fundamental reason to take TripAdvisor public is it is suffering as the result of being inside of Expedia. And right now, what I would argue is that it isn't. Trip is operated very much on an independent basis. Steve Kaufer and his team are running Trip as they would essentially a stand-alone business. It has friends at Expedia, which is -- it knows that Expedia and Hotels.com and Hotwire are buyers of its advertising all the time and essentially make a market. And it can very aggressively sell to third parties and it does. And frankly, Stephen and their team don't have to be distracted by calls like this. They can worry about executing, and they're executing incredibly effectively. And I think the opportunity at Trip is greater than it ever has been. So for now, as long as Trip is executing well, I think it'll remain inside the company. And as far as valuation issues and as Trip being valued at a high enough multiple, my experience in looking at companies being spun off is that the market is pretty smart. And whenever people spin off subsidiaries, and they think that magically all of a sudden multiples are going to change, lo and behold, they don't. And there's a reason why the market is valuing a company at that particular valuation; I think multiple changes based on long-term performance, and we're hoping that our long-term performance proves that the market is undervaluing the stock at least from a short-term perspective. And it will be up to us to allocate capital to take advantage of short term market back and forth. We don't think a spin off is the solution, at least near term. So that's a long a way of saying [ph], as long as TripAdvisor continues to execute, and I think it's going to continue to execute, we're very happy where it is. The second issue for Trip just being inside the company is it provides us a great hedge against our most significant expense. Our biggest expense is sales and marketing; to some extent, it is the least in our control. We're really happy about where G&A is and where it's going forward and cost of goods are and where they're going forward. Sales and marketing are based on external conditions, and TripAdvisor provides us a terrific hedge. The revenue that we get from Trip is over 50% of the CPM and CPC marketing costs that we have. So we love having Trip inside here. And we would be very happy and expect it to only increase as a percentage of the company as a whole. As far as M&A and Asia goes, we think it's a great opportunity. We've been focused on,  first, we've gone into the market, so that we know who the best players are. We will tend to put small money against acquisitions in areas like Asia, because they are high-return, high-risk. We don't want to bet the farm. And we're very happy with our newest addition in China on the meta-search front. And we're going to invest on it on an appropriate basis. So we'll look in Asia, but to the extent that we make that, there are going to be smaller bets because again, there's a fair amount of uncertainty there along with the potential that comes with it."

As Dara indicated earlier, our economics on air have been stable, absent the fee. All things being equal, we would expect to return to some growth in air revenue next year. Q1, I should say, our most difficult comps. So we will probably have a very modest increase in air revenue. On the question about air bookings by phone, perhaps it's precipitated by our removal of the booking fee by phone. I believe we're the only online travel agency not to charge a fee for booking on the phone. So we think that makes us very customer-friendly.

Our adjusted earnings per share grew at a healthy 24% due to our OIBA growth, combined with the lower tax rate. We expect earnings per share to continue increasing faster than OIBA in 2010. 
On capital structures, as part of Expedia's long-standing discipline of returning excess cash to shareholders, we completed the distribution of our inaugural dividend of $20 million in March and we also repurchased $188 million worth of our stock. Over the long term, we plan to continue both programmatic and opportunistic returns of shareholder capital, all consistent with Expedia's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.
Now diving in a bit more on our results, our advertising and media businesses had a strong quarter, with top line growth accelerating to 34% for the business, which now contributes 14% of our revenue, and generating run rate revenues of nearly $400 million. TripAdvisor delivered 33% of revenue growth on very strong traffic and click growth across its global media network. TripAdvisor signed over 12,000 subscribers for its new service listings products so we are encouraged by the early adoption on that front.
Our transaction-based sites generated a solid 18% and 22% growth in room nights and air tickets despite tougher comps and less favorable pricing environments. And our international businesses delivered their highest rate of FX neutral revenue growth in over two years, with our APAC region exceeding the $1 billion trailing four-quarter bookings threshold for the first time in Expedia's history.
A significant driver of international strength continues to be our Hotels business. We saw an acceleration in room night growth from 24% to 27%. On the other hand, U.S. room night growth deaccelerated in Q1 due to lower growth of Hotwire and Hotels.com on tougher comps. Hotels.com is comping the ramp of our very successful Welcome Rewards program last year, which we believe significantly accelerated volume growth. We also completed the integration of our Hotels.com U.S. and international platforms into one global platform, which we do think cost us some volume in Q1 and here early in Q2.  For the balance of the year, growth on Hotels.com will largely depend on driving conversion increases through site optimizations, which will require strong execution going forward, but we have a very solid product plan in place and that's exactly what the common platform is suited for.
Now we told you last year that we expected Egencia to show both top and bottom line growth in 2010. And we're off to a solid start on that accord with Q1 bookings growth of 47% and OIBA of $6 million. Some of that profitability was driven by timing of investments that we're making to benefit our clients in support of their needs. So we don't expect that level of OIBA going forward for Egencia, but we do expect a nicely profitable year in 2010.
All in all, a solid start to the year amidst an improving travel environment. And with that, over to Mike."

I'll briefly step through some Q1 analytics before updating our 2010 expectations. Starting with transaction growth, we continued to benefit for most of Q1 from the various fee actions we took last year. We just started comping over the e.com air fee elimination the last few weeks of the quarter and comps since then have been muddied a bit by the volcano, year-on-year differences in Easter timing and rising airfares. And we have even less data on hotel as we reduced fees last April 21, but as expected air ticket and room night growth rates are moderate. That said, we believe we are still taking meaningful share in the travel market as a whole.
Revenue margin was down 134 basis points year-on-year in Q1, due largely to our various fee cuts. This is a modest improvement from Q4, but was approximately 40 bps below our forecast due largely to the 9% increase in airfares compared with the low single digit increases we had expected. We continue to expect an easier comp on rev margin in Q3 and beyond as we fully anniversary our larger fee cuts.
Turning to expenses. As expected, Q1 selling and marketing was closer to our more typical seasonal pattern, with spend up nearly 20% sequentially. And we anticipate a similar sequential uptick here in Q2. As a reminder, Q2 selling and marketing will include roughly half the $20 million in relocation and other costs we'll incur in 2010 related to the opening of our lodging supply headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
On taxes, our 34% ANI rate reflects changes to our business operations we mentioned last call, as well as relative growth in our international businesses. We believe 34% is an appropriate tax rate for modeling purposes for the remainder of 2010, and we anticipate our ANI tax rate in 2011 will be a few additional points lower.
I know many of you are interested in the impact of the volcanic ash episode which recently disrupted European travel patterns. Keep in mind that Expedia's business is fairly sensitive to events impacting air travel on the continent since we tend to have a disproportionate share of airlift-driven travel within Europe compared to some travel companies in the region. In short, we clearly saw a meaningful increase in cancellations and a decrease in bookings related to Europe for a good two-week period, some of which we may call back later in Q2 and some we may not. But our best estimate is that Q2 OIBA growth will be several percentage points lower than it would've been otherwise. So overall, we're now expecting roughly flat Q2 OIBA growth due to our currently assumed volcano impact, COGS deleverage and Geneva-related expenses.
Even with Q2, we expect full-year 2010 OIBA will grow in the low double digits compared with 2009. As always, this assumes FX rates don't vary markedly from what we see today. Given our outlook for single-digit OIBA growth in the front half of the year, it's a fair question as to why we think we can deliver higher growth for the full year. Fundamentally, we believe we can continue driving healthy room-night growth, with a more favorable revenue for room night profile as we anniversary our fee cuts and enjoy some tailwind from rising ADRs.  And while air ticket growth may be harder to come by in light of higher ticket prices, we will enjoy more stable revenue per ticket economics as we progress through the year. In addition, we're looking for continued strong growth from our highly accretive Advertising businesses, which are showing nice acceleration against some favorable comps given the CPM and CPC deflation we experienced in 2009.
On the cost side, we're looking for COGS leverage in the back half from several areas, including improved contract rates negotiated with third-party providers, consolidation of our call center footprint and some operational improvements, including intelligent call routing. We'll also have much more normalized marketing comps as we get into the back half. And finally, we expect to see meaningful leverage in G&A in the second half, particularly in Q4 when we lap some nonrecurring legal and professional expenses and we'll likely experience a more typical year-on-year bonus pattern.

As far as Liberty Media share buying prospect, Liberty has been a great shareholder, long-term shareholder of ours. They continue to be supporters of ours and they're very value-add board members for us and everything that we've heard from them is that they want to be long-term shareholders. So at this point, we have not had any kind of discussions with them about buying in their shares one way or the other. We hope to have them as shareholders for a long time and make them lots of money on a go-forward basis. I'd say that our view on buying shares to some extent, we don't care who we buy the shares from. This quarter, we felt that there was delta between what we thought the economic value of the shares was and what they were trading for in the market. And we went into the market and we took advantage of what we thought was that delta and hopefully will prove to be a good investment on a go-forward basis. So what I'd focus on in is the desire for us to buy in shares which we did in this quarter and kind of add value over a long term for shareholders in addition to dividend payments, et cetera.

We're also seeing nice success at hotels.com in the Latin American region. In Mexico, Brazil, we're seeing very encouraging results there off of a small base. And then Canada's doing really well for Expedia and hotels.com. The team up there is executing really, really well.

We do expect CapEx to be a bit higher than we had expected, probably using our Q1 rate on an annualized basis, we'll get you close to where we think we will end up.

If you look at hotel occupancies in Q1, for example, I think the average occupancy based on the Smith Travel data that we saw was 52%, which is significantly lower than called the historical average occupancy that we've seen. So the hoteliers still need help. The environment is getting a lot better, but I think hoteliers are still looking to move volume and are still putting promotional inventory out there, and we'll continue to on a go-forward basis. Now I don't think that the promotional inventory is going to be quite as deep discounts as it was last year. Last year, you had a once-in-a-lifetime, hopefully, event last year where business travel just disappeared. Group travel was nonexistent and really, the hoteliers have to lean very heavily on leisure inventory and leisure discounted inventory in order to drive volume. To expect that to happen again this year, I think, would be foolish. But what we are seeing is that hoteliers are in the market. They are pushing promotions and the nature of those promotions might change. Instead of buy two nights get one free, it might be buy three nights get one free. Instead of a 40% off, it might be 30% off. Some hoteliers we're seeing who were driving aggressive retail promotions are dipping more into the opaque channel into, for example, package inventory and to our Hotwire opaque channels, et cetera. So the nature of the promotion, the promotional activity is going to change, but we absolutely think that lots of promotional activity will remain, will go on a go-forward basis. And we think that hoteliers who are smart about using our marketplace can have real upside as well as far as room night growth and RevPAR growth, which is something that both ourselves and the hoteliers are aiming for."

On Q1 the leisure business OIBA being down, that frankly was something that was not a surprise and was also driven by the year-on-year increases in marketing that we talked about coming out of Q4. If you remember in Q1 of '09, really, none of us had any idea what was going on or what was going to happen so we essentially put a stop on almost all nonessential, especially off-line marketing. So in Q1 of '10, we've started marketing again on a sequential basis and call it a more normal seasonal pattern that what we typically see from going Q4 into Q1 of next year. So sales and marketing, there was a significant amount of sales and marketing deleverage for our leisure businesses. It was something that was planned. Typically that kind of sales and marketing specially when you come back in off-line media, you don't get immediate call it bookings benefit, et cetera. You can't put a dollar of marketing and expect x dollars in return. So we thought there was going to be some deleverage. We saw it. Q2 is going to be mixed because of Geneva, volcano, et cetera.

I think all we said, Justin, was that the amount from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year looks more like the sequential increase that we typically have seen in other years, aside from last year. So similar amount, but we didn't talk about a specific about. As far as the transaction growth rates, the future state, we're not going to give you a specific number because, frankly, we don't know. But we think that we are pretty well positioned on a go forward basis. If you think about the quality of our service, as far as taking away air booking fees, lowering hotel booking fees, no change/cancel fees, in general, the marketing out there, et cetera, we feel much more confident about the value that we are bringing consumers now, than I'd say we have in the last five years. And if you look in the last five years, if you look '05, '06, '07 periods in which the economy was in a strong recovery, I think we are able to deliver very solid unit growth. Typically, revenue per units was growing as well, and we showed nice revenue growth. And my expectation is to see that on a go-forward basis as well. So we might see some pressure, Q3, Q4, because we're not getting the unit benefit of booking cuts, but our revenue per unit should be in much, much better shape. And as Mike said, we are pretty confident that in the second half, we're going to be delivering pretty good growth, in order to get a full year at low double digits. So I think that's kind of the best I can do for you. Anything to add, Mike, to that?"

I think on the inventory side, one thing to keep in mind is that we have very strong relationships and contracts with our hotel partners. And I'd say, in general, to the extent that they're selling inventory on the Web, they're making that inventory",625,"Sure. I think on the inventory side, one thing to keep in mind is that we have very strong relationships and contracts with our hotel partners. And I'd say, in general, to the extent that they're selling inventory on the Web, they're making that inventory, that pricing, et cetera, available to us as well. So it's not an issue of quality, of inventory or our getting access to inventory. I do think that if you look at where we were last year versus this year, some of those hotel partners are not going to, call it, go in with promotional inventory as aggressively as they were last year, because the market's improving, because the consumer's coming back to some extent. That said, again, because of where occupancies are now, we do think that there is going to be plenty of promotional inventory. There are going to be good deals on a go-forward basis. And we do think that hoteliers, to the extent that they are too aggressive on the ADR side, will be leaving money on the table, as far as RevPAR goes. So we think we're going to have to work hard on getting the promotional inventory. But we're confident this year now, when we look at the summer, on a go-forward basis, that we'll have nice access to promotional inventory. I think the one area that I am a bit worried about is actually on the air side. Then if you look at the air ticket prices out there and the growth in air ticket prices, our average ticket price, I think, was up around 9%, and we see those numbers only going up for the summer. So to the extent that I worry about inventory, it's the effect that air ticket prices are going to have on the summer traveler and the leisure traveler. I'd say, in general, we don't see a direct effect on air ticket prices and room night growth, but we do see an effect on air ticket prices and air ticket growth. And also, air ticket prices could have an effect on the pricing in our packages and the attractiveness of our package inventory in general. So on an inventory basis or on a price basis, I'm actually quite confident of our hotel inventory. It's on the air side that I'd be a little bit more worried. As far as ITA and Google, that rumor has been going around for a while. And so we're not particularly inclined to speculate on what could happen or what could not happen there. ITA is a very strong technology company in the travel business. Most of the major part of the technology that they have is an air search engine or an air pricing engine called QPX. And we are fortunate enough to have built similar technology in-house. We have our own technology, BFS, which we call Best Fare Search, and we've got a group of brilliant engineers, a couple floors down from here, working on that. So we actually -- from our standpoint, we don't feel too exposed. I think if I were another OTA and there are others out there, for example, Orbitz, who depends on ITA for their pricing, you become awfully dependent on Google, not only for your, let's say, your leads, but also for the pricing of those leads. Your dependency on Google is pretty high. Now Google has been a great company. They've been fair with their partners, et cetera, but I think we're lucky enough where we don't have a dependency there. So we don't think it's going to have a particular effect on us, one way or the other. We will watch with interest and we will read the article like everyone else."

I think on conversion and customer retention, it's difficult to be general with all the various sites that we have out there. I'd say, in general, we are happy with conversion trends. Conversion trends tend to be positive. They are certainly positive on the Expedia side, and we expect kind of healthy conversion on a go-forward basis. Hotels.com conversion in the first quarter took a little bit of a hit because of the platform, kind of the platform merging that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So on that basis, Hotels.com took a bit of a hit on conversion. But we're already seeing the team kind of move their way back there. And actually, conversion on Hotels.com is moving in the right direction, on a daily basis, or more recently, which gives us nice confidence for that team in kind of Q3, Q4. And Hotwire conversion, I'd say, is flat to down a bit on decent growth. And again, that conversion, we think, can be moved up as well. So overall, I'd say, conversion is stable to up, if I put everything together. Certainly, on TripAdvisor, to some extent, conversion is the number of clicks they get. And that team continues to execute very, very well on the conversion front there. As far as rental cars go, I think it's a tale of two cities. The retail part of our Rental Car business continues to do very, very well. We're seeing transaction growth. We're seeing nice revenue growth there. But we are selling a higher portion of our rental car sales, retail versus opaque. So as our mix goes more to retail versus opaque, our revenue per transaction comes down a bit. So overall, transactions are doing nicely, opaque transaction mix coming down, which hurts our revenue per transaction a bit. And I wouldn't expect to see that change unless, to the extent that, call it, fleet strategies change, going forward. And that's not something that we anticipate, at least, call it, in the near and the midterm."

Obviously, our Package business is one in which the consumer decides to buy air and hotel together and get a discount for it. And we think that in these kinds of environments, it's a great opportunity to push packages. And if you see some of our off-line advertising for Expedia, the ad that we have on is a package ad, which appeals to that kind of leisure traveler, looking for a deal. And I think the deals on packages are terrific, but that is somewhat modified by air ticket prices. And as far as the number of consumers who come in, buying air ticket, and then come back and buy a hotel, that's actually a fairly small percentage. And that's an area where e-mail marketing teams were building kind of much more sophisticated e-mail technology, et cetera.

So I talked about our international room night growth accelerating because of the Asia-Pacific region, because of Latin America, because of Canada, et cetera. We are getting people out there, and we are seeing benefits for us. If you look at our rooms, kind of hotels available, we've got 123,000 hotels now available in the marketplace.

We are trying to actively lower the cost of hotels doing business with us, lower the cost of our doing business with hoteliers, getting them their cash faster, et cetera. And for example, one area that we're pretty interested in and pretty excited about is kind of matching up supply and demand, working on short order and making sure that when a consumer comes to our site, we show them and does a search, let's say, in New York or L.A., we show them the appropriate hotel at the right time.

Our adjusted earnings per share grew at a healthy 24% due to our OIBA growth, combined with the lower tax rate. We expect earnings per share to continue increasing faster than OIBA in 2010. 
On capital structures, as part of Expedia's long-standing discipline of returning excess cash to shareholders, we completed the distribution of our inaugural dividend of $20 million in March and we also repurchased $188 million worth of our stock. Over the long term, we plan to continue both programmatic and opportunistic returns of shareholder capital, all consistent with Expedia's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.
Now diving in a bit more on our results, our advertising and media businesses had a strong quarter, with top line growth accelerating to 34% for the business, which now contributes 14% of our revenue, and generating run rate revenues of nearly $400 million. TripAdvisor delivered 33% of revenue growth on very strong traffic and click growth across its global media network. TripAdvisor signed over 12,000 subscribers for its new service listings products so we are encouraged by the early adoption on that front.
Our transaction-based sites generated a solid 18% and 22% growth in room nights and air tickets despite tougher comps and less favorable pricing environments. And our international businesses delivered their highest rate of FX neutral revenue growth in over two years, with our APAC region exceeding the $1 billion trailing four-quarter bookings threshold for the first time in Expedia's history.
A significant driver of international strength continues to be our Hotels business. We saw an acceleration in room night growth from 24% to 27%. On the other hand, U.S. room night growth deaccelerated in Q1 due to lower growth of Hotwire and Hotels.com on tougher comps. Hotels.com is comping the ramp of our very successful Welcome Rewards program last year, which we believe significantly accelerated volume growth. We also completed the integration of our Hotels.com U.S. and international platforms into one global platform, which we do think cost us some volume in Q1 and here early in Q2.  For the balance of the year, growth on Hotels.com will largely depend on driving conversion increases through site optimizations, which will require strong execution going forward, but we have a very solid product plan in place and that's exactly what the common platform is suited for.
Now we told you last year that we expected Egencia to show both top and bottom line growth in 2010. And we're off to a solid start on that accord with Q1 bookings growth of 47% and OIBA of $6 million. Some of that profitability was driven by timing of investments that we're making to benefit our clients in support of their needs. So we don't expect that level of OIBA going forward for Egencia, but we do expect a nicely profitable year in 2010.
All in all, a solid start to the year amidst an improving travel environment. And with that, over to Mike.

I'll briefly step through some Q1 analytics before updating our 2010 expectations. Starting with transaction growth, we continued to benefit for most of Q1 from the various fee actions we took last year. We just started comping over the e.com air fee elimination the last few weeks of the quarter and comps since then have been muddied a bit by the volcano, year-on-year differences in Easter timing and rising airfares. And we have even less data on hotel as we reduced fees last April 21, but as expected air ticket and room night growth rates are moderate. That said, we believe we are still taking meaningful share in the travel market as a whole.
Revenue margin was down 134 basis points year-on-year in Q1, due largely to our various fee cuts. This is a modest improvement from Q4, but was approximately 40 bps below our forecast due largely to the 9% increase in airfares compared with the low single digit increases we had expected. We continue to expect an easier comp on rev margin in Q3 and beyond as we fully anniversary our larger fee cuts.
Turning to expenses. As expected, Q1 selling and marketing was closer to our more typical seasonal pattern, with spend up nearly 20% sequentially. And we anticipate a similar sequential uptick here in Q2. As a reminder, Q2 selling and marketing will include roughly half the $20 million in relocation and other costs we'll incur in 2010 related to the opening of our lodging supply headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
On taxes, our 34% ANI rate reflects changes to our business operations we mentioned last call, as well as relative growth in our international businesses. We believe 34% is an appropriate tax rate for modeling purposes for the remainder of 2010, and we anticipate our ANI tax rate in 2011 will be a few additional points lower.
I know many of you are interested in the impact of the volcanic ash episode which recently disrupted European travel patterns. Keep in mind that Expedia's business is fairly sensitive to events impacting air travel on the continent since we tend to have a disproportionate share of airlift-driven travel within Europe compared to some travel companies in the region. In short, we clearly saw a meaningful increase in cancellations and a decrease in bookings related to Europe for a good two-week period, some of which we may call back later in Q2 and some we may not. But our best estimate is that Q2 OIBA growth will be several percentage points lower than it would've been otherwise. So overall, we're now expecting roughly flat Q2 OIBA growth due to our currently assumed volcano impact, COGS deleverage and Geneva-related expenses.
Even with Q2, we expect full-year 2010 OIBA will grow in the low double digits compared with 2009. As always, this assumes FX rates don't vary markedly from what we see today. Given our outlook for single-digit OIBA growth in the front half of the year, it's a fair question as to why we think we can deliver higher growth for the full year. Fundamentally, we believe we can continue driving healthy room-night growth, with a more favorable revenue for room night profile as we anniversary our fee cuts and enjoy some tailwind from rising ADRs.  And while air ticket growth may be harder to come by in light of higher ticket prices, we will enjoy more stable revenue per ticket economics as we progress through the year. In addition, we're looking for continued strong growth from our highly accretive Advertising businesses, which are showing nice acceleration against some favorable comps given the CPM and CPC deflation we experienced in 2009.
On the cost side, we're looking for COGS leverage in the back half from several areas, including improved contract rates negotiated with third-party providers, consolidation of our call center footprint and some operational improvements, including intelligent call routing. We'll also have much more normalized marketing comps as we get into the back half. And finally, we expect to see meaningful leverage in G&A in the second half, particularly in Q4 when we lap some nonrecurring legal and professional expenses and we'll likely experience a more typical year-on-year bonus pattern.
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?

As far as Liberty Media share buying prospect, Liberty has been a great shareholder, long-term shareholder of ours. They continue to be supporters of ours and they're very value-add board members for us and everything that we've heard from them is that they want to be long-term shareholders. So at this point, we have not had any kind of discussions with them about buying in their shares one way or the other. We hope to have them as shareholders for a long time and make them lots of money on a go-forward basis. I'd say that our view on buying shares to some extent, we don't care who we buy the shares from. This quarter, we felt that there was delta between what we thought the economic value of the shares was and what they were trading for in the market. And we went into the market and we took advantage of what we thought was that delta and hopefully will prove to be a good investment on a go-forward basis. So what I'd focus on in is the desire for us to buy in shares which we did in this quarter and kind of add value over a long term for shareholders in addition to dividend payments, et cetera.

We're also seeing nice success at hotels.com in the Latin American region. In Mexico, Brazil, we're seeing very encouraging results there off of a small base. And then Canada's doing really well for Expedia and hotels.com. The team up there is executing really, really well. So most of the acceleration, the growth that you're seeing is APAC, LatAm, Canada and some of these regions that we feel have huge potential for us and are really strong emerging markets.

If you look at hotel occupancies in Q1, for example, I think the average occupancy based on the Smith Travel data that we saw was 52%, which is significantly lower than called the historical average occupancy that we've seen. So the hoteliers still need help. The environment is getting a lot better, but I think hoteliers are still looking to move volume and are still putting promotional inventory out there, and we'll continue to on a go-forward basis. Now I don't think that the promotional inventory is going to be quite as deep discounts as it was last year. Last year, you had a once-in-a-lifetime, hopefully, event last year where business travel just disappeared. Group travel was nonexistent and really, the hoteliers have to lean very heavily on leisure inventory and leisure discounted inventory in order to drive volume. To expect that to happen again this year, I think, would be foolish. But what we are seeing is that hoteliers are in the market. They are pushing promotions and the nature of those promotions might change. Instead of buy two nights get one free, it might be buy three nights get one free. Instead of a 40% off, it might be 30% off. Some hoteliers we're seeing who were driving aggressive retail promotions are dipping more into the opaque channel into, for example, package inventory and to our Hotwire opaque channels, et cetera. So the nature of the promotion, the promotional activity is going to change, but we absolutely think that lots of promotional activity will remain, will go on a go-forward basis. And we think that hoteliers who are smart about using our marketplace can have real upside as well as far as room night growth and RevPAR growth, which is something that both ourselves and the hoteliers are aiming for.

If you remember in Q1 of '09, really, none of us had any idea what was going on or what was going to happen so we essentially put a stop on almost all nonessential, especially off-line marketing. So in Q1 of '10, we've started marketing again on a sequential basis and call it a more normal seasonal pattern that what we typically see from going Q4 into Q1 of next year. So sales and marketing, there was a significant amount of sales and marketing deleverage for our leisure businesses. It was something that was planned. Typically that kind of sales and marketing specially when you come back in off-line media, you don't get immediate call it bookings benefit, et cetera. You can't put a dollar of marketing and expect x dollars in return. So we thought there was going to be some deleverage. We saw it. Q2 is going to be mixed because of Geneva, volcano, et cetera.

On the second question, we saw an impact, really, across Air and Hotel. Obviously, specifically on gross bookings, we expect to be more impacted on the Air side. In terms of whether or not we will recover some of that in the quarter, that remains to be seen and is a bit difficult to predict. As I called out in my comments, we do expect several points of OIBA degradation as a result of volcano, but it's a short-term thing for us and, obviously, it doesn't impact the long run of the business.

I think all we said, Justin, was that the amount from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year looks more like the sequential increase that we typically have seen in other years, aside from last year. So similar amount, but we didn't talk about a specific about. As far as the transaction growth rates, the future state, we're not going to give you a specific number because, frankly, we don't know. But we think that we are pretty well positioned on a go forward basis. If you think about the quality of our service, as far as taking away air booking fees, lowering hotel booking fees, no change/cancel fees, in general, the marketing out there, et cetera, we feel much more confident about the value that we are bringing consumers now, than I'd say we have in the last five years. And if you look in the last five years, if you look '05, '06, '07 periods in which the economy was in a strong recovery, I think we are able to deliver very solid unit growth. Typically, revenue per units was growing as well, and we showed nice revenue growth. And my expectation is to see that on a go-forward basis as well. So we might see some pressure, Q3, Q4, because we're not getting the unit benefit of booking cuts, but our revenue per unit should be in much, much better shape. And as Mike said, we are pretty confident that in the second half, we're going to be delivering pretty good growth, in order to get a full year at low double digits. So I think that's kind of the best I can do for you. Anything to add, Mike, to that?

I think on the inventory side, one thing to keep in mind is that we have very strong relationships and contracts with our hotel partners. And I'd say, in general, to the extent that they're selling inventory on the Web, they're making that inventory",625,"Sure. I think on the inventory side, one thing to keep in mind is that we have very strong relationships and contracts with our hotel partners. And I'd say, in general, to the extent that they're selling inventory on the Web, they're making that inventory, that pricing, et cetera, available to us as well. So it's not an issue of quality, of inventory or our getting access to inventory. I do think that if you look at where we were last year versus this year, some of those hotel partners are not going to, call it, go in with promotional inventory as aggressively as they were last year, because the market's improving, because the consumer's coming back to some extent. That said, again, because of where occupancies are now, we do think that there is going to be plenty of promotional inventory. There are going to be good deals on a go-forward basis. And we do think that hoteliers, to the extent that they are too aggressive on the ADR side, will be leaving money on the table, as far as RevPAR goes. So we think we're going to have to work hard on getting the promotional inventory. But we're confident this year now, when we look at the summer, on a go-forward basis, that we'll have nice access to promotional inventory. I think the one area that I am a bit worried about is actually on the air side. Then if you look at the air ticket prices out there and the growth in air ticket prices, our average ticket price, I think, was up around 9%, and we see those numbers only going up for the summer. So to the extent that I worry about inventory, it's the effect that air ticket prices are going to have on the summer traveler and the leisure traveler. I'd say, in general, we don't see a direct effect on air ticket prices and room night growth, but we do see an effect on air ticket prices and air ticket growth. And also, air ticket prices could have an effect on the pricing in our packages and the attractiveness of our package inventory in general. So on an inventory basis or on a price basis, I'm actually quite confident of our hotel inventory. It's on the air side that I'd be a little bit more worried. As far as ITA and Google, that rumor has been going around for a while. And so we're not particularly inclined to speculate on what could happen or what could not happen there. ITA is a very strong technology company in the travel business. Most of the major part of the technology that they have is an air search engine or an air pricing engine called QPX. And we are fortunate enough to have built similar technology in-house. We have our own technology, BFS, which we call Best Fare Search, and we've got a group of brilliant engineers, a couple floors down from here, working on that. So we actually -- from our standpoint, we don't feel too exposed. I think if I were another OTA and there are others out there, for example, Orbitz, who depends on ITA for their pricing, you become awfully dependent on Google, not only for your, let's say, your leads, but also for the pricing of those leads. Your dependency on Google is pretty high. Now Google has been a great company. They've been fair with their partners, et cetera, but I think we're lucky enough where we don't have a dependency there. So we don't think it's going to have a particular effect on us, one way or the other. We will watch with interest and we will read the article like everyone else.

And the Hotwire team did an incredibly good job of finding kind of, every year, new avenues of profitable marketing spend. And they would drive that profitable marketing spend, drive conversion rates. And together, when you have kind of more UVs, more conversion, you kind of get the magic of unit growth there. And at some point, it's going to slow down. And I think the team right now is very focused on kind of on conversion and on finding more profitable spend out there.

I think on conversion and customer retention, it's difficult to be general with all the various sites that we have out there. I'd say, in general, we are happy with conversion trends. Conversion trends tend to be positive. They are certainly positive on the Expedia side, and we expect kind of healthy conversion on a go-forward basis. Hotels.com conversion in the first quarter took a little bit of a hit because of the platform, kind of the platform merging that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So on that basis, Hotels.com took a bit of a hit on conversion. But we're already seeing the team kind of move their way back there. And actually, conversion on Hotels.com is moving in the right direction, on a daily basis, or more recently, which gives us nice confidence for that team in kind of Q3, Q4. And Hotwire conversion, I'd say, is flat to down a bit on decent growth. And again, that conversion, we think, can be moved up as well. So overall, I'd say, conversion is stable to up, if I put everything together. Certainly, on TripAdvisor, to some extent, conversion is the number of clicks they get. And that team continues to execute very, very well on the conversion front there. As far as rental cars go, I think it's a tale of two cities. The retail part of our Rental Car business continues to do very, very well. We're seeing transaction growth. We're seeing nice revenue growth there. But we are selling a higher portion of our rental car sales, retail versus opaque. So as our mix goes more to retail versus opaque, our revenue per transaction comes down a bit. So overall, transactions are doing nicely, opaque transaction mix coming down, which hurts our revenue per transaction a bit. And I wouldn't expect to see that change unless, to the extent that, call it, fleet strategies change, going forward. And that's not something that we anticipate, at least, call it, in the near and the midterm.

Obviously, our Package business is one in which the consumer decides to buy air and hotel together and get a discount for it. And we think that in these kinds of environments, it's a great opportunity to push packages. And if you see some of our off-line advertising for Expedia, the ad that we have on is a package ad, which appeals to that kind of leisure traveler, looking for a deal. And I think the deals on packages are terrific, but that is somewhat modified by air ticket prices. And as far as the number of consumers who come in, buying air ticket, and then come back and buy a hotel, that's actually a fairly small percentage. And that's an area where e-mail marketing teams were building kind of much more sophisticated e-mail technology, et cetera. So that when we know that you're going to a particular destination, we will try to upsell you a hotel card, et cetera. We have some success there, but I have to tell you, it's not a lot of success.

And the way that we look at it is that it's in the interest of the airlines to build up their load factors any way they can.

You should -- a person who comes to our site and does a weekday search should see a different list of hotels, because that's probably a business person than a person doing a weekend search. So those kinds of technologies are also being worked through on the PSG front, which we think are great for hoteliers, and we think can be additive for us on a kind of revenue-per-unique [ph] (1:06:01) basis.

Our adjusted earnings per share grew at a healthy 24% due to our OIBA growth, combined with the lower tax rate. We expect earnings per share to continue increasing faster than OIBA in 2010. 
On capital structures, as part of Expedia's long-standing discipline of returning excess cash to shareholders, we completed the distribution of our inaugural dividend of $20 million in March and we also repurchased $188 million worth of our stock. Over the long term, we plan to continue both programmatic and opportunistic returns of shareholder capital, all consistent with Expedia's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.
Now diving in a bit more on our results, our advertising and media businesses had a strong quarter, with top line growth accelerating to 34% for the business, which now contributes 14% of our revenue, and generating run rate revenues of nearly $400 million. TripAdvisor delivered 33% of revenue growth on very strong traffic and click growth across its global media network. TripAdvisor signed over 12,000 subscribers for its new service listings products so we are encouraged by the early adoption on that front.
Our transaction-based sites generated a solid 18% and 22% growth in room nights and air tickets despite tougher comps and less favorable pricing environments. And our international businesses delivered their highest rate of FX neutral revenue growth in over two years, with our APAC region exceeding the $1 billion trailing four-quarter bookings threshold for the first time in Expedia's history.
A significant driver of international strength continues to be our Hotels business. We saw an acceleration in room night growth from 24% to 27%. On the other hand, U.S. room night growth de-accelerated in Q1 due to lower growth of Hotwire and Hotels.com on tougher comps. Hotels.com is comping the ramp of our very successful Welcome Rewards program last year, which we believe significantly accelerated volume growth. We also completed the integration of our Hotels.com U.S. and international platforms into one global platform, which we do think cost us some volume in Q1 and here early in Q2.  For the balance of the year, growth on Hotels.com will largely depend on driving conversion increases through site optimizations, which will require strong execution going forward, but we have a very solid product plan in place and that's exactly what the common platform is suited for.
Now we told you last year that we expected Egencia to show both top and bottom line growth in 2010. And we're off to a solid start on that accord with Q1 bookings growth of 47% and OIBA of $6 million. Some of that profitability was driven by timing of investments that we're making to benefit our clients in support of their needs. So we don't expect that level of OIBA going forward for Egencia, but we do expect a nicely profitable year in 2010.
All in all, a solid start to the year amidst an improving travel environment. And with that, over to Mike."

I'll briefly step through some Q1 analytics before updating our 2010 expectations. Starting with transaction growth, we continued to benefit for most of Q1 from the various fee actions we took last year. We just started comping over the e.com air fee elimination the last few weeks of the quarter, and comps since then, have been muddied a bit by the volcano, year-on-year differences in Easter timing and rising airfares. And we have even less data on hotel as we reduced fees last April 21, but as expected, air ticket and room night growth rates are moderate. That said, we believe we are still taking meaningful share in the travel market as a whole.
Revenue margin was down 134 basis points year-on-year in Q1, due largely to our various fee cuts. This is a modest improvement from Q4, but was approximately 40 bps below our forecast, due largely to the 9% increase in airfares compared with the low single-digit increases we had expected. We continue to expect an easier comp on rev margin in Q3 and beyond, as we fully anniversary our larger fee cuts.
Turning to expenses. As expected, Q1 selling and marketing was closer to our more typical seasonal pattern, with spend up nearly 20% sequentially. And we anticipate a similar sequential uptick here in Q2. As a reminder, Q2 selling and marketing will include roughly half the $20 million in relocation and other costs we'll incur in 2010 related to the opening of our lodging supply headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
On taxes, our 34% ANI rate reflects changes to our business operations we mentioned last call, as well as relative growth in our international businesses. We believe 34% is an appropriate tax rate for modeling purposes for the remainder of 2010, and we anticipate our ANI tax rate in 2011 will be a few additional points lower.
I know many of you are interested in the impact of the volcanic ash episode which recently disrupted European travel patterns. Keep in mind that Expedia's business is fairly sensitive to events impacting air travel on the continent, since we tend to have a disproportionate share of airlift-driven travel within Europe, compared to some travel companies in the region. In short, we clearly saw a meaningful increase in cancellations and a decrease in bookings related to Europe for a good two-week period, some of which we may call back later in Q2 and some we may not. But our best estimate is that Q2 OIBA growth will be several percentage points lower than it would have been otherwise. So overall, we're now expecting roughly flat Q2 OIBA growth due to our currently assumed volcano impact, COGS deleverage and Geneva-related expenses.
Even with Q2, we expect full-year 2010 OIBA will grow in the low double-digits compared with 2009. As always, this assumes FX rates don't vary markedly from what we see today. Given our outlook for single-digit OIBA growth in the front half of the year, it's a fair question as to why we think we can deliver higher growth for the full year. Fundamentally, we believe we can continue driving healthy room night growth, with a more favorable revenue per room night profile, as we anniversary our fee cuts and enjoy some tailwind from rising ADRs. And while air ticket growth may be harder to come by, in light of higher ticket prices, we will enjoy more stable revenue per ticket economics as we progress through the year. In addition, we're looking for continued strong growth from our highly accretive Advertising businesses, which are showing nice acceleration against some favorable comps, given the CPM and CPC deflation we experienced in 2009.
On the cost side, we're looking for COGS leverage in the back half from several areas, including improved contract rates negotiated with third-party providers, consolidation of our call center footprint and some operational improvements, including intelligent call routing. We'll also have much more normalized marketing comps as we get into the back half. And finally, we expect to see meaningful leverage in G&A in the second half, particularly in Q4 when we lap some nonrecurring legal and professional expenses, and we'll likely experience a more typical year-on-year bonus pattern.
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

They continue to be supporters of ours and they're very kind of value-add board members for us. And everything that we've heard from them is that they want to be long-term shareholders. So at this point, we have not had any kind of discussions with them about buying in their shares one way or the other. We hope to have them as shareholders for a long time and make them lots of money on a go-forward basis. I'd say that our view on buying shares, to some extent, we don't care who we buy the shares from. This quarter, we felt that there was delta between what we thought the economic value of the shares was and what they were trading for in the market. And we went into the market, and we took advantage of what we thought was that delta, and hopefully, will prove to be a good investment on a go-forward basis. So what I'd focus on is the desire for us to buy-in shares, which we did in this quarter, and kind of add value over a long term for shareholders, in addition to dividend payments, et cetera.

We're also seeing nice success at hotels.com in the Latin American region. In Mexico, Brazil, we're seeing very encouraging results there, off of the small base. And then Canada's doing really well for Expedia and hotels.com. The team up there is executing really, really well.

We do expect CapEx to be a bit higher than we had expected, probably using our Q1 rate on an annualized basis, we'll get you close to where we think we will end up. We have decided to do further build outs in our data center and as TripAdvisor continues to grow, we're increasing CapEx spend there both in terms of product development as well as just real estate.

If you look at hotel occupancies in Q1, for example, I think the average occupancy based on the Smith Travel data that we saw was 52%, which is significantly lower than called the historical average occupancy that we've seen. So the hoteliers still need help. The environment is getting a lot better, but I think hoteliers are still looking to move volume and are still putting promotional inventory out there, and we'll continue to on a go-forward basis. Now I don't think that the promotional inventory is going to be quite as deep discounts as it was last year. Last year, you had a once-in-a-lifetime, hopefully, event last year where business travel just disappeared. Group travel was nonexistent and really, the hoteliers have to lean very heavily on leisure inventory and leisure discounted inventory in order to drive volume. To expect that to happen again this year, I think, would be foolish. But what we are seeing is that hoteliers are in the market. They are pushing promotions and the nature of those promotions might change. Instead of buy two nights get one free, it might be buy three nights get one free. Instead of a 40% off, it might be 30% off. Some hoteliers we're seeing who were driving aggressive retail promotions are dipping more into the opaque channel into, for example, package inventory and to our Hotwire opaque channels, et cetera. So the nature of the promotion, the promotional activity is going to change, but we absolutely think that lots of promotional activity will remain, will go on a go-forward basis. And we think that hoteliers who are smart about using our marketplace can have real upside as well as far as room night growth and RevPAR growth, which is something that both ourselves and the hoteliers are aiming for."

On Q1 the leisure business OIBA being down, that frankly was something that was not a surprise and was also driven by the year-on-year increases in marketing that we talked about coming out of Q4. If you remember in Q1 of '09, really, none of us had any idea what was going on or what was going to happen so we essentially put a stop on almost all nonessential, especially off-line marketing. So in Q1 of '10, we've started marketing again on a sequential basis and call it a more normal seasonal pattern that what we typically see from going Q4 into Q1 of next year. So sales and marketing, there was a significant amount of sales and marketing deleverage for our leisure businesses. It was something that was planned. Typically that kind of sales and marketing specially when you come back in off-line media, you don't get immediate call it bookings benefit, et cetera. You can't put a dollar of marketing and expect x dollars in return. So we thought there was going to be some deleverage. We saw it. Q2 is going to be mixed because of Geneva, volcano, et cetera. But then Q3, Q4, we think that you'll see the leisure business growing as we expect it to do."

In terms of whether or not we will recover some of that in the quarter, that remains to be seen and is a bit difficult to predict. As I called out in my comments, we do expect several points of OIBA degradation as a result of volcano, but it's a short-term thing for us and, obviously, it doesn't impact the long run of the business."

I think all we said, Justin, was that the amount from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year looks more like the sequential increase that we typically have seen in other years, aside from last year. So similar amount, but we didn't talk about a specific about. As far as the transaction growth rates, the future state, we're not going to give you a specific number because, frankly, we don't know. But we think that we are pretty well positioned on a go forward basis. If you think about the quality of our service, as far as taking away air booking fees, lowering hotel booking fees, no change/cancel fees, in general, the marketing out there, et cetera, we feel much more confident about the value that we are bringing consumers now, than I'd say we have in the last five years. And if you look in the last five years, if you look '05, '06, '07 periods in which the economy was in a strong recovery, I think we are able to deliver very solid unit growth. Typically, revenue per units was growing as well, and we showed nice revenue growth. And my expectation is to see that on a go-forward basis as well. So we might see some pressure, Q3, Q4, because we're not getting the unit benefit of booking cuts, but our revenue per unit should be in much, much better shape. And as Mike said, we are pretty confident that in the second half, we're going to be delivering pretty good growth, in order to get a full year at low double digits. So I think that's kind of the best I can do for you. Anything to add, Mike, to that?"

I think on the inventory side, one thing to keep in mind is that we have very strong relationships and contracts with our hotel partners. And I'd say, in general, to the extent that they're selling inventory on the Web, they're making that inventory",625,"Sure. I think on the inventory side, one thing to keep in mind is that we have very strong relationships and contracts with our hotel partners. And I'd say, in general, to the extent that they're selling inventory on the Web, they're making that inventory, that pricing, et cetera, available to us as well. So it's not an issue of quality, of inventory or our getting access to inventory. I do think that if you look at where we were last year versus this year, some of those hotel partners are not going to, call it, go in with promotional inventory as aggressively as they were last year, because the market's improving, because the consumer's coming back to some extent. That said, again, because of where occupancies are now, we do think that there is going to be plenty of promotional inventory. There are going to be good deals on a go-forward basis. And we do think that hoteliers, to the extent that they are too aggressive on the ADR side, will be leaving money on the table, as far as RevPAR goes. So we think we're going to have to work hard on getting the promotional inventory. But we're confident this year now, when we look at the summer, on a go-forward basis, that we'll have nice access to promotional inventory. I think the one area that I am a bit worried about is actually on the air side. Then if you look at the air ticket prices out there and the growth in air ticket prices, our average ticket price, I think, was up around 9%, and we see those numbers only going up for the summer. So to the extent that I worry about inventory, it's the effect that air ticket prices are going to have on the summer traveler and the leisure traveler. I'd say, in general, we don't see a direct effect on air ticket prices and room night growth, but we do see an effect on air ticket prices and air ticket growth. And also, air ticket prices could have an effect on the pricing in our packages and the attractiveness of our package inventory in general. So on an inventory basis or on a price basis, I'm actually quite confident of our hotel inventory. It's on the air side that I'd be a little bit more worried. As far as ITA and Google, that rumor has been going around for a while. And so we're not particularly inclined to speculate on what could happen or what could not happen there. ITA is a very strong technology company in the travel business. Most of the major part of the technology that they have is an air search engine or an air pricing engine called QPX. And we are fortunate enough to have built similar technology in-house. We have our own technology, BFS, which we call Best Fare Search, and we've got a group of brilliant engineers, a couple floors down from here, working on that. So we actually -- from our standpoint, we don't feel too exposed. I think if I were another OTA and there are others out there, for example, Orbitz, who depends on ITA for their pricing, you become awfully dependent on Google, not only for your, let's say, your leads, but also for the pricing of those leads. Your dependency on Google is pretty high. Now Google has been a great company. They've been fair with their partners, et cetera, but I think we're lucky enough where we don't have a dependency there. So we don't think it's going to have a particular effect on us, one way or the other. We will watch with interest and we will read the article like everyone else."

I think on conversion and customer retention, it's difficult to be general with all the various sites that we have out there. I'd say, in general, we are happy with conversion trends. Conversion trends tend to be positive. They are certainly positive on the Expedia side, and we expect kind of healthy conversion on a go-forward basis. hotels.com conversion in the first quarter took a little bit of a hit because of the platform, kind of the platform merging that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So on that basis, hotels.com took a bit of a hit on conversion. But we're already seeing the team kind of move their way back there. And actually, conversion on hotels.com is moving in the right direction, on a daily basis, or more recently, which gives us nice confidence for that team in kind of Q3, Q4. And Hotwire conversion, I'd say, is flat to down a bit on decent growth. And again, that conversion, we think, can be moved up as well. So overall, I'd say, conversion is stable to up, if I put everything together. Certainly, on TripAdvisor, to some extent, conversion is the number of clicks they get. And that team continues to execute very, very well on the conversion front there. As far as rental cars go, I think it's a tale of two cities. The retail part of our Rental Car business continues to do very, very well. We're seeing transaction growth. We're seeing nice revenue growth there. But we are selling a higher portion of our rental car sales, retail versus opaque. So as our mix goes more to retail versus opaque, our revenue per transaction comes down a bit. So overall, transactions are doing nicely, opaque transaction mix coming down, which hurts our revenue per transaction a bit. And I wouldn't expect to see that change unless to the extent that, call it, fleet strategies change going forward. And that's not something that we anticipate, at least, call it, in the near- to mid-term."

Obviously, our Package business is one in which the consumer decides to buy air and hotel together and gets a discount for it.

And if you see some of our off-line advertising for Expedia, the ad that we have on is a package ad, which appeals to that kind of leisure traveler, looking for a deal. And I think the deals on packages are terrific, but that is somewhat modified by air ticket prices. And as far as the number of consumers who come in, buying air ticket, and then come back and buy a hotel, that's actually a fairly small percentage.

That's up 24%, on a year-on-year basis, and again, we wouldn't be able to sign up this many hotels without the help of our kind of market managers and our market coordinators, et cetera. Another area that we haven't focused on is the agency kind of Easy Manage business. And on a worldwide basis, we've got over 20,000 Easy Manage properties. And we are starting to see volume move through Easy Manage as well, and that's encouraging, especially in secondary, tertiary markets, smaller hotels that we had a difficult time getting to. So it's feet on the street, getting more hotels on. And I'd say, the third area that we're focused on is technology, connectivity, et cetera. We are trying to actively lower the cost of hotels doing business with us, lower the cost of our doing business with hoteliers, getting them their cash faster, et cetera. And for example, one area that we're pretty interested in and pretty excited about is kind of matching up supply and demand, working on short order and making sure that when a consumer comes to our site, we show them and does a search, let's say, in New York or L.A., we show them the appropriate hotel at the right time. You should -- a person who comes to our site and does a weekday search should see a different list of hotels, because that's probably a business person than a person doing a weekend search. So those kinds of technologies are also being worked through on the PSG front, which we think are great for hoteliers, and we think can be additive for us on a kind of revenue or per unique basis."

We delivered a solid quarter here in Q2, especially given some of the headwinds that we faced.

We delivered a solid quarter here in Q2, especially given some of the headwinds that we faced. Obviously, the volcano and foreign exchange trends worked against us, as did sharply rising airfares. Although it's difficult to measure the precise impact economic uncertainty, air carrier strikes and the oil spill in the Gulf certainly didn't help the travel business.
Given this backdrop, we're satisfied with our transaction growth of 10%, operating income before amortization growth of 3% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%.
And briefly on the trends for the quarter. On a transactional side, room night growth in the Americas and Europe slowed as expected as we lapped fee cuts from last year and as our European point of sales faced foreign exchange-, volcano- and economic-related headwinds. We estimate that the cancellations related to the volcano cost us roughly 200 basis points of worldwide room night growth.
We also saw significant slowdown in growth rates for transatlantic travel in the quarter. We suspect primarily caused by foreign exchange fluctuations and higher airfares, which also contributed to the overall de-acceleration for the quarter. And remember that room night comps were simply more difficult in Q2, because we saw a real acceleration in last year's second quarter. Compared to 2008, room night growth in Q2 was 41% compared to 33% in Q1.
Room night growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America markets was very strong and accelerated from Q1, a good trend in markets with enormous potential for us.  As far as the shape of the quarter goes, the year-over-year room night growth was weakest in April due in part to the volcano, with momentum building through June. July trends are solid and while very early, it does give us some confidence relative to the balance of the year expectations.
Our TripAdvisor Media Group continues its incredibly strong performance with a revenue and operating income before amortization growth accelerating from Q1, growing year-over-year at 39% and 40% respectively.
Fueled by strong growth in traffic and clicks, both on a domestic and international basis. We were able to grow profits at a robust pace while investing aggressively in new geographies, as well as new products, such as Business Listings, with now over 15,000 properties, [indiscernible] down Kuxon in China, air meta search in the U.S. and U.K. and our vacation rentals product now augmented by our acquisition of Holiday Lettings in the U.K.
Finally, we're very excited about TripAdvisor's integration with Facebook through the launch of Trip friends which brings together our over 35 million TripAdvisor reviews and opinions with our Cities I’ve Visited in applications on Facebook with over 19 million users.
We brought the wisdom of the masses to your travel planning and now we want to bring them with some of your friends to your desktop. We have a unique asset and a great team at TripAdvisor and are quite optimistic about what the next few years will bring. 
And lastly, on capital allocation. We continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders.  So far in 2010, we've returned almost $230 million to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends and it's our expedition that we’ll continue to do so over the next few years. And as we've said before, we'd be comfortable with gross debt at 2x to 3x EBITDA, consistent with an investment-grade rating and will consider raising additional debt if the terms and conditions are right.  Now to Mike."

Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year.

Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year. In the hotel business, revenue per room night was down 7% while ADRs were up less than 1% for the quarter.
Revenue per room night for our Domestic business grew 1% year-over-year while international was down 17%. Two primary drivers that put pressure on international revenue per room night were the FX impact of “book to stay”, which we substantially offset with hedging gains and customer refunds related to the volcano. If you exclude the impact from these items, as well as the impact from reduced service fees on hotel, the change in our overall revenue per room night would have looked much more like the year-on-year change in ADRs, and we expect the gap between the two to narrow in the back half of the year, with the obvious caveat that we can't predict the future impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
In air, we grew revenue at a healthy 13% clip, our best rate of growth in two years, and the second quarter in a row where we've increased air revenue. Despite lapping fee cuts from last year and the steep increase in airfares, we grew ticket volume by 6%, with revenue per ticket up 7% in part due to variable fees on higher ticket prices.  Ticket growth did decelerate a bit as we move through the quarter but looks a bit better here in July.
The steep increase in air ticket prices and full airplanes has definitely put a damper in our packages business, which was essentially flat year-over-year on both a transaction and a revenue basis. Our OIBA performance in the quarter was driven in part by strong cost control. Selling and marketing expense grew just a bit faster than revenue and includes roughly $5 million related to the opening of our new global lodging supply headquarters in Geneva.
Direct selling and marketing, the largest piece of our expense, actually grew slower than revenue as we pulled back spend in light of the environment in Europe. In total, we estimate that the volcano cost us roughly $12 million in OIBA this quarter. Excluding that hit, as well as the Geneva expenses and a $6 million increase in the reserve for potential settlement of occupancy tax matters, our OIBA would've grown in the low teens.
Free cash flow was down year-over-year in the second quarter but is up 7% for the first half of the year. The benefit from working capital accounts can be a bit lumpy and depends in large part on the timing of when bookings come in versus when stays and payments occur. In businesses like our ad and media business in Egencia that consume working capital as they grow grew quite fast in the quarter.
In addition, CapEx is going to be a fair bit higher this year than last as you can see from our first half spend, due in part to additional infrastructure required as the traffic and transaction volume increases on our sites. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS grew at a healthy pace, driven in part by a more favorable tax rate of about 34%. All else held equal, our adjusted EPS should grow faster than OIBA as a result of a favorable tax rate trend through 2011.
As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we are still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for full year 2010, though it's fair to say that the exogenous factors working against us make it more difficult. And this of course assumes FX rates stay at current levels.
Though the headwinds in the business that we've discussed today are causing Leisure results to trail a bit, these are offset by continued strength in TripAdvisor and Egencia. We've now lapped the lion's share of our fee actions which we'll help unit pricing trends going forward. And as Dara mentioned, we are pleased with trends we’re seeing so far in July.  We will, of course, continue to monitor our spend levels and make appropriate adjustments depending on the environment. 
With that, let's turn to questions.  Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

[ id=”s4” name=”Analyst” /> 
This is actually Bridget [ph] for Imran. He’s in Europe this week. Two quick questions. Sales and marketing, you said that it was slightly lower because of the situation in Europe. Do you expect to continue to decrease that spend in the second half of the year? And then also you mentioned that you recognized about $5 million of the expenses of opening the new place. Are you planning – I know the total was $20 million. Do you plan to recognize a little bit additional in 3Q? And then the second question relates to ADRs. The rate of increase was slower from 1Q to 2Q than it has been in previous quarters. Is this due to the exchange rate and can you just give us a color on the U.S. versus international?"

But in general, as far as sales and marketing spend goes, we're able to react pretty quickly to the business trends that we see. Obviously, in our variable marketing, online marketing and also to some extent even with our brand marketing as well, we try to have some flexibility into dollars that we commit versus dollars that we can pull back, depending on what we see in the environment. And in Q2, especially starting in April with the volcano, et cetera, we saw that there was a fair amount of weakness, and as a result, we under-allocated in marketing compared to what we expected, and in reaction to kind of the reality that we saw in Europe, which was Europe was a bit weaker than we had expected. So I think that the answer for Q3 is going to depend on the results that we see. And this is one of the advantages of our business model. We can move up our marketing or down based on results. We don’t have to take huge risks with. Our goal would be to increase the rate of marketing spend in Q3 because that would tend to bring with it a higher revenue increase as well. And I'd say so far in July, we're pretty satisfied with the results that we've seen and kind of the marketing to revenue spend levels. Mike, can you talk about Geneva a bit?"

I think everyone knows that Google wields considerable market power, whether it's in the travel business, or many, many other industries. And so their actions can have very significant consequences in any industry, including ours. I think that one of the keys that we'll be looking for with Google is, if they start favoring their own content and their own results over the results of third parties, whether that's algorithmic, inside their system or are they hard coded, et cetera. And we think that to the extent that they do that, that will be a problem. The way we’ve seen them operating in general has been fair, but we think they’d be wise not to kind of favor their own internal products over external products and create an unfair playing field. And if they do, we think that the government will have something to say about that. So we’re great partners with them. In general, their management we’ve seen has done the right thing and it's working to build a great product, and in general, they work well with consumers. But the market power that they have is potentially significant. And that's something that we'll watch. Based on what we see right now and kind of the relationship that we have with them and our spend, et cetera, we think we’ll be in good shape. But again, it's something for us to watch. I think on the Egencia part of the business, it really does look like we have hit a critical mass as far as the revenue of that business matching the fixed cost base and now are leveraging off of that. If you look at Egencia P&L, it's a little bit the opposite of the Expedia P&L. The Expedia P&L has very high variable cost, low fixed costs. The Egencia P&L tends to have higher fixed cost, which is as the sales force, account management, et cetera, and lower variable costs. Once you bring in a client, that client tends to stay with. You don't have to remarket to that client over and over. We spent five, six years investing in Egencia technology and innovation, building up account management and sales force, et cetera, and building largely organically to a point at which we are right now, and we're seeing a couple of things. One is the technology that we built, the product that we built; we think is best of breed. And more and more clients are coming on to the Egencia platform and we think that’ll continue. We're expanding into new markets, international. We're very strong in the U.S. We're very strong in France. We're expanding into the U.K., Germany and some Asia-Pacific markets as well. So that adds to kind of the new client acquisition, although it does hurt profitability on a near-term basis. And then third, we're seeing a real bounce back on corporate spend. Companies are spending more in 2010. They're not back to 2008 levels and we haven't seen corporations pull back yet. It’s not the “go-go days” but they are spending more aggressively and being more offensive. So we think it's a pretty favorable corporate environment and we're gaining share from our competitors, and we don't see that changing at least over the next couple of years. We're quite happy about our position and we think Egencia is going to be solid profit driver over the next three, five years for us."

But I do think that they're making the trends look a little bit more negative than they actually are. As far as the back half of the year goes, I don't want to comment on whether it’s double digit or not. But because of the strength of the media business, because of the strength of Egencia, because of the strength that we're seeing in Asia-Pacific, et cetera, we don't need a whole lot of heavy lifting from the Leisure business in order to hit our expectations, although we certainly need the result of the leisure business to improve. And to the extent that the exogenous factors that we saw the first half of the year don't hit us -- the World Cup, the volcano, et cetera -- and foreign exchange doesn't move significantly against the us, we're reasonably confident that we can hit the double-digit numbers, the low double-digit numbers that we talked about.

With respect to the hotel revenue per room night down 7%, as I said in my remarks, the domestic revenue per room night was actually up 1%, and we think that, that is really kind of a good indication that our revenue per room nights and ADRs are going to start growing much more hand-in-hand as we go forward. And we now, again, have substantially lapped our service fee reductions and that was still just a bit of a headwind for us in the quarter. On the international side of the business, again, I can't predict FX and I can’t predict volcanoes. But to a large degree, those were kind of special things that made our numbers much more negatively impacted this quarter than we would expect on a going-forward basis. As to air revenue, we expect average ticket prices to stay relatively flat to current levels. And the year-on-year change in the average ticket prices will start to moderate for us. Nonetheless, our revenue per ticket will continue to benefit from higher average ticket prices as there are some of our agreements that are based upon ticket price, a small minority of them. But I think we'll see less and less of an impact as we progress through the year. Obviously, there's always puts and takes that impacts air revenue quarter-over-quarter. I think on both the air front and the hotel front, the important thing to keep in mind is that we think our underlying supplier dynamics are stable. And we think our fees have largely landed where they make sense and will continue to be over a fairly long period of time. And so that's what we look at when we look at the per-unit economics."

In general, I would say Europe on balance was weaker than we'd like it and hopefully we’ll see it strengthen for the balance of the year, especially cross-border Europe. Europe coming to the U.S. was down significantly and we didn't see kind of let's say a huge offsetting pickup of the U.S. going to Europe. Usually when Europe to U.S. slows down, U.S. to Europe speeds up. But we think because of air ticket prices, that didn't happen. And then the Asia-Pacific, Latin America markets were very strong. So on-a-go forward basis, I’d say the expectation is for Europe to strengthen, and we are seeing some indications of that, especially with the Hotels.com brand and some of the really good kind of conversion activity that's going on there. As far as search engine marketing goes, I would say CPCs have solidified. And as I mentioned previously, in the second quarter, we did pull back from marketing activities from a broad array of channels. That did include SEM, and I would expect in Q3 and Q4 for us to lean in a bit and try to increase our share of the SEM channel. It may require some increases in CPCs; it's hard to tell. But we’re trying to the extent that we can drive good conversion and solid conversion activity and solid sought activity; we think that leaning in to the SEM market might be a good strategy. So again, these are variable spends and we can react on a daily, almost hourly basis. But we’re bullish as far as where we think SEM trends are going to take us for the balance of the year."

You're seeing business  spend come back, and while the car piece of the business is solidifying on the hotel side, we're seeing hotel ADRs in some of the larger markets come up very significantly. The Hotwire consumer’s a pretty price-sensitive consumer, and to the extent that ADRs, especially in larger markets like New York, kind of let's say, top-eight markets, Hotwire volumes are suffering. So we're doing well on the secondary markets, but we are doing worse in the primary markets. And so on balance, I’d say Hotwire hotels is weaker than we'd like it to be and hopefully that situation will get better on the balance of the year. One of the positives that we expect in the second half is that we’re actually integrating some of Hotwire's opaque inventory into the Expedia retail path. We're doing as a test now. We’re seeing some early promising results and as we optimize the retail path, et cetera, we’re hoping that, that product will become a pretty good product, especially in an environment where ADRs are going up a bit, as the leisure traveler may be looking for deals, whether that's in packages or the opaque path. So we're pretty hopeful about that product integration and we'll certainly tell you more about it in Q3 and Q4."

If you look at the domestic revenue margin, some of that gets weeded out. Not all of it. And the domestic revenue margin was down only 68 bps, even with the higher air fees, as we have lapped a number of the fees. On the international rev margin, that was down significantly more than domestic and FX was the biggest driver behind the reduction on international rev margin, plus higher average ticket prices. And then the international revenue margin also includes on a year-on-year comp basis, I think, for the last time, our CruiseShipCenters business, which has a significant amount of international bookings at lower rev margin than some of our other products. And that is probably accounting for maybe 25% to 30% of the international rev margin decline. The good news is, CSC is more profitable, but it does affect this one metric. So if you look at the rev margin on an overall basis and adjust it for FX, we're down only 92 bps, which is our lowest drop since we took the fee actions. And I think on the car side, Michael, I'd say on balance, the environment is a bit better than it was last year. Last year, we had a pretty difficult environment, in that we had very, very strong leisure demand and the car fleets being quite limited as far as increases in fleet sizes. Now then I'd say, in general, the travel business is in much better shape. The car rental companies are in much better shape, looking to gain more share. We’re seeing some increases in fleet size, which makes the inventory situation better than it was last year. Now there's no question that during the summer, inventory does tighten up. But we think that this summer, it will be on balance a bit less tight than it was last summer. So as a result, in general, we're seeing increased transactions on the car side. Revenue per rental is down slightly on lower pricing with a little bit of an increase in the average kind of length of rental. So those are the kind of the factors that are affecting the car business."

There will always be things that will impact the merchant revenue margin, FX, mix; all sorts of other things. But in general, as we exit this period associated with the fee actions, we should start to see more stability. On that tech and content question, we now do expect to deliver in the back half of the year. We've made some decisions to increase our investment at TripAdvisor, as well as some other initiatives. Last year, we kept our spend relatively flat from Q1 to Q3. And this year, we’re now expecting a bit of an increase from Q2 and Q3 and into the back half of the year. |And so tech and content we do expect to be growing faster than revenue.

So for example, we are seeing the mobile markets developing much faster, mobile search developing much more quickly than it had last year. So we are building out mobile teams across the company to make sure that we not only build out mobile capabilities, but leading-edge mobile capabilities. Same thing for some of the foreign markets and the Asia-Pacific markets, et cetera. As we’re seeing the growth in those markets accelerate, we are finding it worthwhile for us to build up smaller kind of technology pods that are dedicated to the Asia-Pacific markets, for example, to normalize some of our products for those markets. In general, what we do is we build very, very big solutions that we can leverage on a worldwide basis. But some of the Asia-Pacific marketplaces have very different needs on payment services, especially some of the look and feel that you want on the sites; you’d want to be very different. Let's say the look and feel in Japan that’s acceptable is very different from a look and feel that you see the U.S. And as we've seen these markets kind of grow and mature, faster than frankly we expected, we're going to invest ahead to some extent on the tech and content side. And the nature of technology and content is that the kind of have to invest ahead of the revenue to some extent. You’ve got to put a team together. You’ve got to build our product and typically kind of six months to 12 months after the spend, you start getting some kind of a return on it. But we think those investments are worthwhile and we think then increased spend is a reflection of kind of very, very big potential in those marketplaces. As far as the buyback goes, I just urge you to kind of step back and if you step back, kind of you see that we spent about $2 billion buying back our stock since the spinoff. In Q1, we spent almost $200 million and we brought in over 8 million shares. And what I don't want to get into is kind of a quarterly recap of why we bought in one quarter or why we did buy in another quarter. There are many, many reasons, including times in which we might have a different -- call it information from the markets, et cetera. I think that what you want to pay attention to from a long-term perspective is that we are a company that’s going to be throwing off a lot of capital. We are happy with our strategic position. We don't have to save up a bunch of capital to go after, let's say, an Asian footprint or to buy media business, as we have them inside of our company. So we do think we're going to create build out at the capital and kind of consistent with an investment-grade rating, we are going to, over the long-term, return capital to shareholders. Some of it will happen with dividends. But we would expect, over the next couple of years, to be net buyers of our stock. But from a quarterly basis, that’s certainly not something that I'm going to comment on."

And as long as it plays a fair game, we feel okay. And that's really something that we’re watching much more carefully that ITA, at least in the hotel segment.

I think the first thing that it starts with is the team, and I they think we have an incredible team. We've got 700 employees at TripAdvisor that are incredibly talented, kind of from the top to the bottom. And I think it comes from building great products that attracts huge amounts of traffic from a user base that is very, very loyal to that product. TripAdvisor, like many other products that are built upon user-generated content are very viral and they have positions that are very difficult to unseat. If you got 30 million reviews and you're looking for a hotel review, you're just going to TripAdvisor. Chances are, you're going to find great product there, to the extent that you'd find great product and have a great experience and chances are, you're going to write a review. People like that new content. The search engine box, the Google box, the Bing box, et cetera, like that new content because it’s great, it’s relevant and it’s new. And so this kind of the new content coming out on the site feeds upon itself and has a self-reinforcing factor. Now what’s different about TripAdvisor from most user-generated sites is that whereas most EGC [ph] sites have a hard time monetizing, this incredibly relevant information for people who want to travel. It's very targeted so you have two weapons: one is you have free content that's viral in nature and has increasing returns to scale, and you have content that monetizes incredibly well. So you put those two together and you've got a great, great product to start with. Then we add on top of that international expansion. TripAdvisor is growing in Europe on a country basis anywhere from 50% to 100% its traffic. It's going very aggressively to the Asia-Pacific regions. We’re losing a lot of money in China, that's a good thing because that means we’re investing more aggressively in China than anyone else we believe. And so you add kind of this organic growth to international market growth, which is very, very substantial and you get a great combination. You add to that new products. So for example, Business Listings is a product that allows hoteliers to list their hotel, the URL, the phone number to call, right when someone is looking up a hotel. It’s a great product for the hotelier because they get direct distribution. It’s a great experience for the consumer because they can click right on to the hotel site rather than opening up a new window, et cetera. And for us, it’s a subscription model, which is recurring revenue and is a very solid kind of product. And we've already signed up 15,000 hoteliers and that can increase the multiples and multiples. Another new product, for example, is Vacation Rentals. Again, a subscription product that we think we can build up over years. So I just think it's a combination of great, great base product, international markets that are growing even faster than a domestic business that’s growing quite well and then a number of new products that are launching as well. And when you add it up together, you get very strong growth on a current basis and I would say the kind of investment that will hopefully keep the growth going for many years. It’s an asset that we certainly don’t take for granted, and we think that as it gets bigger, we frankly think it's one of the finest content and media businesses on the web bar-non. And we think it's only a matter of time before it gets recognized inside of our portfolio. Operator, any more questions, or is that it?"

We delivered a solid quarter here in Q2, especially given some of the headwinds that we faced. Obviously, the volcano and foreign exchange trends worked against us, as did sharply rising airfares. Although it's difficult to measure the precise impact economic uncertainty, air carrier strikes and the oil spill in the Gulf certainly didn't help the travel business.
Given this backdrop, we're satisfied with our transaction growth of 10%, operating income before amortization growth of 3% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%.
And briefly on the trends for the quarter. On a transactional side, room night growth in the Americas and Europe slowed as expected as we lapped fee cuts from last year and as our European point of sales faced foreign exchange-, volcano- and economic-related headwinds. We estimate that the cancellations related to the volcano cost us roughly 200 basis points of worldwide room night growth.
We also saw significant slowdown in growth rates for transatlantic travel in the quarter. We suspect primarily caused by foreign exchange fluctuations and higher airfares, which also contributed to the overall de-acceleration for the quarter. And remember that room night comps were simply more difficult in Q2, because we saw a real acceleration in last year's second quarter. Compared to 2008, room night growth in Q2 was 41% compared to 33% in Q1.
Room night growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America markets was very strong and accelerated from Q1, a good trend in markets with enormous potential for us.  As far as the shape of the quarter goes, the year-over-year room night growth was weakest in April due in part to the volcano, with momentum building through June. July trends are solid and while very early, it does give us some confidence relative to the balance of the year expectations.
Our TripAdvisor Media Group continues its incredibly strong performance with a revenue and operating income before amortization growth accelerating from Q1, growing year-over-year at 39% and 40% respectively.
Fueled by strong growth in traffic and clicks, both on a domestic and international basis. We were able to grow profits at a robust pace while investing aggressively in new geographies, as well as new products, such as Business Listings, with now over 15,000 properties, [indiscernible] down Kuxon in China, air meta search in the U.S. and U.K. and our vacation rentals product now augmented by our acquisition of Holiday Lettings in the U.K.
Finally, we're very excited about TripAdvisor's integration with Facebook through the launch of Trip friends which brings together our over 35 million TripAdvisor reviews and opinions with our Cities I’ve Visited in applications on Facebook with over 19 million users.
We brought the wisdom of the masses to your travel planning and now we want to bring them with some of your friends to your desktop. We have a unique asset and a great team at TripAdvisor and are quite optimistic about what the next few years will bring. 
And lastly, on capital allocation. We continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders.  So far in 2010, we've returned almost $230 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and it's our expectations that we’ll continue to do so over the next few years. And as we've said before, we'd be comfortable with gross debt at 2x to 3x EBITDA, consistent with an investment-grade rating and will consider raising additional debt if the terms and conditions are right.  Now to Mike."

Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year.

Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year. In the Hotel business, revenue per room night was down 7% while ADRs were up less than 1% for the quarter.
Revenue per room night for our Domestic business grew 1% year-over-year while International was down 17%. Two primary drivers that put pressure on International revenue per room night were the FX impact of book-to-stay, which we substantially offset with hedging gains and customer refunds related to the volcano. If you exclude the impact from these items, as well as the impact from reduced service fees on Hotel, the change in our overall revenue per room night would have looked much more like the year-on-year change in ADRs, and we expect the gap between the two to narrow in the back half of the year, with the obvious caveat that we can't predict the future impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
In Air, we grew revenue at a healthy 13% clip, our best rate of growth in two years, and the second quarter in a row where we've increased Air revenue. Despite lapping fee cuts from last year and the steep increase in airfares, we grew ticket volume by 6%, with revenue per ticket up 7% in part due to variable fees on higher ticket prices.  Ticket growth did decelerate a bit as we moved through the quarter but looks a bit better here in July.
The steep increase in air ticket prices and full airplanes has definitely put a damper in our Packages business, which was essentially flat year-over-year on both a transaction and a revenue basis. Our OIBA performance in the quarter was driven in part by strong cost control. Selling and marketing expense grew just a bit faster than revenue and includes roughly $5 million related to the opening of our new global lodging supply headquarters in Geneva.
Direct selling and marketing, the largest piece of our expense, actually grew slower than revenue as we pulled back spend in light of the environment in Europe. In total, we estimate that the volcano cost us roughly $12 million in OIBA this quarter. Excluding that hit, as well as the Geneva expenses and a $6 million increase in the reserve for potential settlement of occupancy tax matters, our OIBA would've grown in the low teens.
Free cash flow was down year-over-year in the second quarter but is up 7% for the first half of the year. The benefit from working capital accounts can be a bit lumpy and depends in large part on the timing of when bookings come in versus when stays and payments occur. In businesses like our Ad and Media business in Egencia that consume working capital as they grow grew quite fast in the quarter.
In addition, CapEx is going to be a fair bit higher this year than last as you can see from our first half spend, due in part to additional infrastructure required as the traffic and transaction volume increases on our sites. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS grew at a healthy pace, driven in part by a more favorable tax rate of about 34%. All else held equal, our adjusted EPS should grow faster than OIBA as a result of a favorable tax rate trend through 2011.
As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we are still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for full year 2010, though it's fair to say that the exogenous factors working against us make it more difficult. And this of course assumes FX rates stay at current levels.
Though the headwinds in the business that we've discussed today are causing Leisure results to trail a bit, these are offset by continued strength in TripAdvisor and Egencia. We've now lapped the lion's share of our fee actions which will help unit pricing trends going forward. And as Dara mentioned, we are pleased with trends we’re seeing so far in July.  We will, of course, continue to monitor our spend levels and make appropriate adjustments depending on the environment. 
With that, let's turn to questions.  Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

This is actually Bridget [ph] for Imran. He’s in Europe this week. Two quick questions. Sales and marketing, you said that it was slightly lower because of the situation in Europe. Do you expect to continue to decrease that spend in the second half of the year? And then also you mentioned that you recognized about $5 million of the expenses of opening the new place. Are you planning – I know the total was $20 million. Do you plan to recognize a little bit additional in 3Q? And then the second question relates to ADRs. The rate of increase was slower from 1Q to 2Q than it has been in previous quarters. Is this due to the exchange rate and can you just give us a color on the U.S. versus international?"

But in general, as far as sales and marketing spend goes, we're able to react pretty quickly to the business trends that we see. Obviously, in our variable marketing, online marketing and also to some extent even with our brand marketing as well, we try to have some flexibility into dollars that we commit versus dollars that we can pull back, depending on what we see in the environment. And in Q2, especially starting in April with the volcano, et cetera, we saw that there was a fair amount of weakness, and as a result, we under-allocated in marketing compared to what we expected, and in reaction to kind of the reality that we saw in Europe, which was Europe was a bit weaker than we had expected. So I think that the answer for Q3 is going to depend on the results that we see. And this is one of the advantages of our business model. We can move up our marketing or down based on results. We don’t have to take huge risks with. Our goal would be to increase the rate of marketing spend in Q3 because that would tend to bring with it a higher revenue increase as well. And I'd say so far in July, we're pretty satisfied with the results that we've seen and kind of the marketing to revenue spend levels. Mike, can you talk about Geneva a bit?"

I think everyone knows that Google wields considerable market power, whether it's in the travel business, or many, many other industries. And so their actions can have very significant consequences in any industry, including ours. I think that one of the keys that we'll be looking for with Google is, if they start favoring their own content and their own results over the results of third parties, whether that's algorithmic, inside their system or are they hard coded, et cetera. And we think that to the extent that they do that, that will be a problem. The way we’ve seen them operating in general has been fair, but we think they’d be wise not to kind of favor their own internal products over external products and create an unfair playing field. And if they do, we think that the government will have something to say about that. So we’re great partners with them. In general, their management we’ve seen has done the right thing and it's working to build a great product, and in general, they work well with consumers. But the market power that they have is potentially significant. And that's something that we'll watch. Based on what we see right now and kind of the relationship that we have with them and our spend, et cetera, we think we’ll be in good shape. But again, it's something for us to watch. I think on the Egencia part of the business, it really does look like we have hit a critical mass as far as the revenue of that business matching the fixed cost base and now are leveraging off of that. If you look at Egencia P&L, it's a little bit the opposite of the Expedia P&L. The Expedia P&L has very high variable cost, low fixed costs. The Egencia P&L tends to have higher fixed cost, which is as the sales force, account management, et cetera, and lower variable costs. Once you bring in a client, that client tends to stay with. You don't have to remarket to that client over and over. We spent five, six years investing in Egencia technology and innovation, building up account management and sales force, et cetera, and building largely organically to a point at which we are right now, and we're seeing a couple of things. One is the technology that we built, the product that we built; we think is best of breed. And more and more clients are coming on to the Egencia platform and we think that’ll continue. We're expanding into new markets, international. We're very strong in the U.S. We're very strong in France. We're expanding into the U.K., Germany and some Asia-Pacific markets as well. So that adds to kind of the new client acquisition, although it does hurt profitability on a near-term basis. And then third, we're seeing a real bounce back on corporate spend. Companies are spending more in 2010. They're not back to 2008 levels and we haven't seen corporations pull back yet. It’s not the “go-go days” but they are spending more aggressively and being more offensive. So we think it's a pretty favorable corporate environment and we're gaining share from our competitors, and we don't see that changing at least over the next couple of years. We're quite happy about our position and we think Egencia is going to be solid profit driver over the next three, five years for us."

But I do think that they're making the trends look a little bit more negative than they actually are. As far as the back half of the year goes, I don't want to comment on whether it’s double digit or not. But because of the strength of the media business, because of the strength of Egencia, because of the strength that we're seeing in Asia-Pacific, et cetera, we don't need a whole lot of heavy lifting from the Leisure business in order to hit our expectations, although we certainly need the result of the leisure business to improve. And to the extent that the exogenous factors that we saw the first half of the year don't hit us -- the World Cup, the volcano, et cetera -- and foreign exchange doesn't move significantly against the us, we're reasonably confident that we can hit the double-digit numbers, the low double-digit numbers that we talked about. Obviously, I said on balance, we were more comfortable with it at the beginning of the quarter than where we are now.

On the international side of the business, again, I can't predict FX and I can’t predict volcanoes. But to a large degree, those were kind of special things that made our numbers much more negatively impacted this quarter than we would expect on a going-forward basis. As to air revenue, we expect average ticket prices to stay relatively flat to current levels. And the year-on-year change in the average ticket prices will start to moderate for us. Nonetheless, our revenue per ticket will continue to benefit from higher average ticket prices as there are some of our agreements that are based upon ticket price, a small minority of them. But I think we'll see less and less of an impact as we progress through the year. Obviously, there's always puts and takes that impact our Air revenue quarter-to-quarter. I think on both the Air front and the Hotel front, the important thing to keep in mind is that we think our underlying supplier dynamics are stable. And we think our fees have largely landed to where they make sense and will continue to be over a fairly long period of time. And so that's what we look at when we look at the per-unit economics."

In general, I would say Europe on balance was weaker than we'd like it to be, and hopefully we’ll see it strengthen for the balance of the year, especially cross-border Europe. Europe coming to the U.S. was down significantly and we didn't see kind of let's say a huge offsetting pickup of the U.S. going to Europe. Usually when Europe to U.S. slows down, U.S. to Europe speeds up. But we think because of air ticket prices, that didn't happen. And then the Asia-Pacific, Latin America markets were very strong. So on a-go forward basis, I’d say the expectation is for Europe to strengthen, and we are seeing some indications of that, especially with the Hotels.com brand and some of the really good kind of conversion activity that's going on there. As far as search engine marketing goes, I would say CPCs have solidified. And as I mentioned previously, in the second quarter, we did pull back from marketing activities from a broad array of channels. That did include SEM, and I would expect in Q3 and Q4 for us to lean in a bit and try to increase our share of the SEM channel. It may require some increases in CPCs; it's hard to tell. But we’re trying to the extent that we can drive good conversion and solid conversion activity and solid sought activity; we think that leaning in to the SEM market might be a good strategy. So again, these are variable spends and we can react on a daily, almost hourly basis. But we’re bullish as far as where we think SEM trends are going to take us for the balance of the year."

You're seeing business  spend come back, and while the car piece of the business is solidifying on the hotel side, we're seeing hotel ADRs in some of the larger markets come up very significantly.

So we're doing well on the secondary markets, but we are doing worse in the primary markets. And so on balance, I’d say Hotwire hotels is weaker than we'd like it to be and hopefully that situation will get better on the balance of the year. One of the positives that we expect in the second half is that we’re actually integrating some of Hotwire's opaque inventory into the Expedia retail path. We're doing as a test now. We’re seeing some early promising results and as we optimize the retail path, et cetera, we’re hoping that, that product will become a pretty good product, especially in an environment where ADRs are going up a bit, as the leisure traveler may be looking for deals, whether that's in packages or the opaque path.

On a worldwide basis, the biggest impact by far was average ticket prices, lower fees, the volcano, FX book-to-stay. If you look at the domestic revenue margin, some of that gets weeded out. Not all of it",390,"So I'll take the question on revenue margin first. On a worldwide basis, the biggest impact by far was average ticket prices, lower fees, the volcano, FX book-to-stay. If you look at the domestic revenue margin, some of that gets weeded out. Not all of it. And the domestic revenue margin was down only 68 bps, even with the higher air fees, as we have lapped a number of the fees. On the international rev margin, that was down significantly more than domestic and FX was the biggest driver behind the reduction on international rev margin, plus higher average ticket prices. And then the international revenue margin also includes on a year-on-year comp basis, I think, for the last time, our CruiseShipCenters business, which has a significant amount of international bookings at lower rev margin than some of our other products. And that is probably accounting for maybe 25% to 30% of the international rev margin decline. The good news is, CSC is more profitable, but it does affect this one metric. So if you look at the rev margin on an overall basis and adjust it for FX, we're down only 92 bps, which is our lowest drop since we took the fee actions. And I think on the car side, Michael, I'd say on balance, the environment is a bit better than it was last year. Last year, we had a pretty difficult environment, in that we had very, very strong leisure demand and the car fleets being quite limited as far as increases in fleet sizes. Now then I'd say, in general, the travel business is in much better shape. The car rental companies are in much better shape, looking to gain more share. We’re seeing some increases in fleet size, which makes the inventory situation better than it was last year. Now there's no question that during the summer, inventory does tighten up. But we think that this summer, it will be on balance a bit less tight than it was last summer. So as a result, in general, we're seeing increased transactions on the car side. Revenue per rental is down slightly on lower pricing with a little bit of an increase in the average kind of length of rental. So those are the kind of the factors that are affecting the car business."

Last year, we kept our spend relatively flat from Q1 to Q3. And this year, we’re now expecting a bit of an increase from Q2 and Q3 and into the back half of the year.

So for example, we're seeing the mobile markets developing much faster, mobile search developing much more quickly than it had last year. So we are building out mobile teams across the company to make sure that we not only build out mobile capabilities, but leading-edge mobile capabilities. Same thing for some of the foreign markets and the Asia-Pacific markets, et cetera. As we’re seeing the growth in those markets accelerate, we are finding it worthwhile for us to build up smaller kind of technology pods that are dedicated to the Asia-Pacific markets, for example, to normalize some of our products for those markets. In general, what we do is we build very, very big solutions that we can leverage on a worldwide basis. But some of the Asia-Pacific marketplaces have very different needs on payment services, especially some of the look and feel that you want on the sites; you want to be very different. Let's say a look and feel in Japan that’s acceptable is very different from a look and feel that you see the U.S. And as we've seen these markets kind of grow and mature faster than, frankly, we expected, we're going to invest ahead to some extent on the tech and content side. And the nature of technology and content is that you kind of have to invest ahead of the revenue to some extent. You’ve got to put a team together. You’ve got to build out product and typically kind of six months to 12 months after the spend, you start getting some kind of a return on it. But we think those investments are worthwhile and we think then increased spend is a reflection of kind of very, very big potential in those marketplaces. As far as the buyback goes, I just urge you to kind of step back and if you step back, kind of you see that we spent about $2 billion buying back our stock since the spinoff. In Q1, we spent almost $200 million and we brought in over 8 million shares. And what I don't want to get into is kind of a quarterly recap of why we bought in one quarter or why we did buy in another quarter. There are many, many reasons, including times in which we might have a different -- call it information from the markets, et cetera. I think that what you want to pay attention to from a long-term perspective is that we are a company that’s going to be throwing off a lot of capital. We are happy with our strategic position. We don't have to save up a bunch of capital to go after, let's say, an Asian footprint or to buy media business, as we have them inside of our company. So we do think we're going to create build out at the capital and kind of consistent with an investment-grade rating, we are going to, over the long-term, return capital to shareholders. Some of it will happen with dividends. But we would expect, over the next couple of years, to be net buyers of our stock. But from a quarterly basis, that’s certainly not something that I'm going to comment on."

So we don't think that ITA will have any direct effect, so to speak, on the TripAdvisor business, which as you know is growing very, very quickly and is highly profitable for us. I think the key for us with Google in general on a go-forward basis is, is Google going to use its market power to kind of favor its internal content versus the third-party content. And as long as it plays a fair game, we feel okay. And that's really something that we’re watching much more carefully that ITA, at least in the hotel segment. But again, Google has very significant market power and it's something that I think everyone is going to be watching very closely."

I think the first thing that it starts with is the team, and I they think we have an incredible team. We've got 700 employees at TripAdvisor that are incredibly talented, kind of from the top to the bottom. And I think it comes from building great products that attracts huge amounts of traffic from a user base that is very, very loyal to that product. TripAdvisor, like many other products that are built upon user-generated content are very viral and they have positions that are very difficult to unseat. If you got 30 million reviews and you're looking for a hotel review, you're just going to TripAdvisor. Chances are, you're going to find great product there, to the extent that you'd find great product and have a great experience and chances are, you're going to write a review. People like that new content. The search engine box, the Google box, the Bing box, et cetera, like that new content because it’s great, it’s relevant and it’s new. And so this kind of the new content coming out on the site feeds upon itself and has a self-reinforcing factor. Now what’s different about TripAdvisor from most user-generated sites is that whereas most EGC [ph] sites have a hard time monetizing, this incredibly relevant information for people who want to travel. It's very targeted so you have two weapons: one is you have free content that's viral in nature and has increasing returns to scale, and you have content that monetizes incredibly well. So you put those two together and you've got a great, great product to start with. Then we add on top of that international expansion. TripAdvisor is growing in Europe on a country basis anywhere from 50% to 100% its traffic. It's going very aggressively to the Asia-Pacific regions. We’re losing a lot of money in China, that's a good thing because that means we’re investing more aggressively in China than anyone else we believe. And so you add kind of this organic growth to international market growth, which is very, very substantial and you get a great combination. You add to that new products. So for example, Business Listings is a product that allows hoteliers to list their hotel, the URL, the phone number to call, right when someone is looking up a hotel. It’s a great product for the hotelier because they get direct distribution. It’s a great experience for the consumer because they can click right on to the hotel site rather than opening up a new window, et cetera. And for us, it’s a subscription model, which is recurring revenue and is a very solid kind of product. And we've already signed up 15,000 hoteliers and that can increase the multiples and multiples. Another new product, for example, is Vacation Rentals. Again, a subscription product that we think we can build up over years. So I just think it's a combination of great, great base product, international markets that are growing even faster than a domestic business that’s growing quite well and then a number of new products that are launching as well. And when you add it up together, you get very strong growth on a current basis and I would say the kind of investment that will hopefully keep the growth going for many years. It’s an asset that we certainly don’t take for granted, and we think that as it gets bigger, we frankly think it's one of the finest content and media businesses on the web bar-non. And we think it's only a matter of time before it gets recognized inside of our portfolio. Operator, any more questions, or is that it?"

We delivered a solid quarter here in Q2, especially given some of the headwinds that we faced. Obviously, the volcano and foreign exchange trends worked against us, as did sha",597,"Thanks, Alan, and thanks to everyone for making time to join us this afternoon. We delivered a solid quarter here in Q2, especially given some of the headwinds that we faced. Obviously, the volcano and foreign exchange trends worked against us, as did sharply rising airfares. Although it's difficult to measure the precise impact economic uncertainty, air carrier strikes and the oil spill in the Gulf certainly didn't help the travel business.
Given this backdrop, we're satisfied with our transaction growth of 10%, operating income before amortization growth of 3% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%.
And briefly on the trends for the quarter. On a transactional side, room night growth in the Americas and Europe slowed as expected as we lapped fee cuts from last year and as our European point of sales faced foreign exchange-, volcano- and economic-related headwinds. We estimate that the cancellations related to the volcano cost us roughly 200 basis points of worldwide room night growth.
We also saw significant slowdown in growth rates for transatlantic travel in the quarter. We suspect primarily caused by foreign exchange fluctuations and higher airfares, which also contributed to the overall de-acceleration for the quarter. And remember that room night comps were simply more difficult in Q2, because we saw a real acceleration in last year's second quarter. Compared to 2008, room night growth in Q2 was 41% compared to 33% in Q1.
Room night growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America markets was very strong and accelerated from Q1, a good trend in markets with enormous potential for us.  As far as the shape of the quarter goes, the year-over-year room night growth was weakest in April due in part to the volcano, with momentum building through June. July trends are solid and while very early, it does give us some confidence relative to the balance of the year expectations.
Our TripAdvisor Media Group continues its incredibly strong performance with a revenue and operating income before amortization growth accelerating from Q1, growing year-over-year at 39% and 40% respectively.
Fueled by strong growth in traffic and clicks, both on a domestic and international basis. We were able to grow profits at a robust pace while investing aggressively in new geographies, as well as new products, such as Business Listings, with now over 15,000 properties, [indiscernible] down Kuxon in China, air meta search in the U.S. and U.K. and our vacation rentals product now augmented by our acquisition of Holiday Lettings in the U.K.
Finally, we're very excited about TripAdvisor's integration with Facebook through the launch of Trip friends which brings together our over 35 million TripAdvisor reviews and opinions with our Cities I’ve Visited in applications on Facebook with over 19 million users.
We brought the wisdom of the masses to your travel planning and now we want to bring them with some of your friends to your desktop. We have a unique asset and a great team at TripAdvisor and are quite optimistic about what the next few years will bring. 
And lastly, on capital allocation. We continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders.  So far in 2010, we've returned almost $230 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and it's our expectations that we’ll continue to do so over the next few years. And as we've said before, we'd be comfortable with gross debt at 2x to 3x EBITDA, consistent with an investment-grade rating and will consider raising additional debt if the terms and conditions are right.  Now to Mike."

Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year. In the Hotel business, revenue per room night was down 7% while ADRs were up less than 1% for the quarter.
Revenue per room night for our Domestic business grew 1% year-over-year while International was down 17%. Two primary drivers that put pressure on International revenue per room night were the FX impact of book-to-stay, which we substantially offset with hedging gains and customer refunds related to the volcano. If you exclude the impact from these items, as well as the impact from reduced service fees on Hotel, the change in our overall revenue per room night would have looked much more like the year-on-year change in ADRs, and we expect the gap between the two to narrow in the back half of the year, with the obvious caveat that we can't predict the future impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
In Air, we grew revenue at a healthy 13% clip, our best rate of growth in two years, and the second quarter in a row where we've increased Air revenue. Despite lapping fee cuts from last year and the steep increase in airfares, we grew ticket volume by 6%, with revenue per ticket up 7% in part due to variable fees on higher ticket prices.  Ticket growth did decelerate a bit as we moved through the quarter but looks a bit better here in July.
The steep increase in air ticket prices and full airplanes has definitely put a damper in our Packages business, which was essentially flat year-over-year on both a transaction and a revenue basis. Our OIBA performance in the quarter was driven in part by strong cost control. Selling and marketing expense grew just a bit faster than revenue and includes roughly $5 million related to the opening of our new global lodging supply headquarters in Geneva.
Direct selling and marketing, the largest piece of our expense, actually grew slower than revenue as we pulled back spend in light of the environment in Europe. In total, we estimate that the volcano cost us roughly $12 million in OIBA this quarter. Excluding that hit, as well as the Geneva expenses and a $6 million increase in the reserve for potential settlement of occupancy tax matters, our OIBA would've grown in the low teens.
Free cash flow was down year-over-year in the second quarter but is up 7% for the first half of the year. The benefit from working capital accounts can be a bit lumpy and depends in large part on the timing of when bookings come in versus when stays and payments occur. In businesses like our Ad and Media business in Egencia that consume working capital as they grow grew quite fast in the quarter.
In addition, CapEx is going to be a fair bit higher this year than last as you can see from our first half spend, due in part to additional infrastructure required as the traffic and transaction volume increases on our sites. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS grew at a healthy pace, driven in part by a more favorable tax rate of about 34%. All else held equal, our adjusted EPS should grow faster than OIBA as a result of a favorable tax rate trend through 2011.
As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we are still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for full year 2010, though it's fair to say that the exogenous factors working against us make it more difficult. And this of course assumes FX rates stay at current levels.
Though the headwinds in the business that we've discussed today are causing Leisure results to trail a bit, these are offset by continued strength in TripAdvisor and Egencia. We've now lapped the lion's share of our fee actions which will help unit pricing trends going forward. And as Dara mentioned, we are pleased with trends we’re seeing so far in July.  We will, of course, continue to monitor our spend levels and make appropriate adjustments depending on the environment. 
With that, let's turn to questions.  Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question?"

This is actually Bridget [ph] for Imran. He’s in Europe this week. Two quick questions. Sales and marketing, you said that it was slightly lower because of the situation in Europe. Do you expect to continue to decrease that spend in the second half of the year? And then also you mentioned that you recognized about $5 million of the expenses of opening the new place. Are you planning – I know the total was $20 million. Do you plan to recognize a little bit additional in 3Q? And then the second question relates to ADRs. The rate of increase was slower from 1Q to 2Q than it has been in previous quarters. Is this due to the exchange rate and can you just give us a color on the U.S. versus international?"

But in general, as far as sales and marketing spend goes, we're able to react pretty quickly to the business trends that we see. Obviously, in our variable marketing, online marketing and also to some extent even with our brand marketing as well, we try to have some flexibility into dollars that we commit versus dollars that we can pull back, depending on what we see in the environment. And in Q2, especially starting in April with the volcano, et cetera, we saw that there was a fair amount of weakness, and as a result, we under-allocated in marketing compared to what we expected, and in reaction to kind of the reality that we saw in Europe, which was Europe was a bit weaker than we had expected. So I think that the answer for Q3 is going to depend on the results that we see. And this is one of the advantages of our business model. We can move up our marketing or down based on results. We don’t have to take huge risks with. Our goal would be to increase the rate of marketing spend in Q3 because that would tend to bring with it a higher revenue increase as well. And I'd say so far in July, we're pretty satisfied with the results that we've seen and kind of the marketing to revenue spend levels. Mike, can you talk about Geneva a bit?"

I think everyone knows that Google wields considerable market power, whether it's in the travel business, or many, many other industries. And so their actions can have very significant consequences in any industry, including ours. I think that one of the keys that we'll be looking for with Google is, if they start favoring their own content and their own results over the results of third parties, whether that's algorithmic, inside their system or are they hard coded, et cetera. And we think that to the extent that they do that, that will be a problem. The way we’ve seen them operating in general has been fair, but we think they’d be wise not to kind of favor their own internal products over external products and create an unfair playing field. And if they do, we think that the government will have something to say about that. So we’re great partners with them. In general, their management we’ve seen has done the right thing and it's working to build a great product, and in general, they work well with consumers. But the market power that they have is potentially significant. And that's something that we'll watch. Based on what we see right now and kind of the relationship that we have with them and our spend, et cetera, we think we’ll be in good shape. But again, it's something for us to watch. I think on the Egencia part of the business, it really does look like we have hit a critical mass as far as the revenue of that business matching the fixed cost base and now are leveraging off of that. If you look at Egencia P&L, it's a little bit the opposite of the Expedia P&L. The Expedia P&L has very high variable cost, low fixed costs. The Egencia P&L tends to have higher fixed cost, which is as the sales force, account management, et cetera, and lower variable costs. Once you bring in a client, that client tends to stay with. You don't have to remarket to that client over and over. We spent five, six years investing in Egencia technology and innovation, building up account management and sales force, et cetera, and building largely organically to a point at which we are right now, and we're seeing a couple of things. One is the technology that we built, the product that we built; we think is best of breed. And more and more clients are coming on to the Egencia platform and we think that’ll continue. We're expanding into new markets, international. We're very strong in the U.S. We're very strong in France. We're expanding into the U.K., Germany and some Asia-Pacific markets as well. So that adds to kind of the new client acquisition, although it does hurt profitability on a near-term basis. And then third, we're seeing a real bounce back on corporate spend. Companies are spending more in 2010. They're not back to 2008 levels and we haven't seen corporations pull back yet. It’s not the “go-go days” but they are spending more aggressively and being more offensive. So we think it's a pretty favorable corporate environment and we're gaining share from our competitors, and we don't see that changing at least over the next couple of years. We're quite happy about our position and we think Egencia is going to be solid profit driver over the next three, five years for us."

But I do think that they're making the trends look a little bit more negative than they actually are. As far as the back half of the year goes, I don't want to comment on whether it’s double digit or not. But because of the strength of the media business, because of the strength of Egencia, because of the strength that we're seeing in Asia-Pacific, et cetera, we don't need a whole lot of heavy lifting from the Leisure business in order to hit our expectations, although we certainly need the result of the leisure business to improve. And to the extent that the exogenous factors that we saw the first half of the year don't hit us -- the World Cup, the volcano, et cetera -- and foreign exchange doesn't move significantly against the us, we're reasonably confident that we can hit the double-digit numbers, the low double-digit numbers that we talked about.

As to air revenue, we expect average ticket prices to stay relatively flat to current levels. And the year-on-year change in the average ticket prices will start to moderate for us. Nonetheless, our revenue per ticket will continue to benefit from higher average ticket prices as there are some of our agreements that are based upon ticket price, a small minority of them. But I think we'll see less and less of an impact as we progress through the year. Obviously, there's always puts and takes that impact our Air revenue quarter-to-quarter.

In gene",320,"As far as domestic room night growth and international room night growth, both of them slowed down to some extent because of the factors that we talked about earlier in the call, the volcano factors, economic factors and just more difficult comps. In general, I would say Europe on balance was weaker than we'd like it to be, and hopefully we’ll see it strengthen for the balance of the year, especially cross-border Europe. Europe coming to the U.S. was down significantly and we didn't see kind of let's say a huge offsetting pickup of the U.S. going to Europe. Usually when Europe to U.S. slows down, U.S. to Europe speeds up. But we think because of air ticket prices, that didn't happen. And then the Asia-Pacific, Latin America markets were very strong. So on a-go forward basis, I’d say the expectation is for Europe to strengthen, and we are seeing some indications of that, especially with the Hotels.com brand and some of the really good kind of conversion activity that's going on there. As far as search engine marketing goes, I would say CPCs have solidified. And as I mentioned previously, in the second quarter, we did pull back from marketing activities from a broad array of channels. That did include SEM, and I would expect in Q3 and Q4 for us to lean in a bit and try to increase our share of the SEM channel. It may require some increases in CPCs; it's hard to tell. But we’re trying to the extent that we can drive good conversion and solid conversion activity and solid sought activity; we think that leaning in to the SEM market might be a good strategy. So again, these are variable spends and we can react on a daily, almost hourly basis. But we’re bullish as far as where we think SEM trends are going to take us for the balance of the year."

You're seeing business  spend come back, and while the car piece of the business is solidifying on the hotel side, we're seeing hotel ADRs in some of the larger markets come up very significantly. The Hotwire consumer’s a pretty price-sensitive consumer, and to the extent that ADRs, especially in larger markets like New York, kind of let's say, top-eight markets, Hotwire volumes are suffering. So we're doing well on the secondary markets, but we are doing worse in the primary markets. And so on balance, I’d say Hotwire hotels is weaker than we'd like it to be and hopefully that situation will get better on the balance of the year. One of the positives that we expect in the second half is that we’re actually integrating some of Hotwire's opaque inventory into the Expedia retail path. We're doing as a test now. We’re seeing some early promising results and as we optimize the retail path, et cetera, we’re hoping that, that product will become a pretty good product, especially in an environment where ADRs are going up a bit, as the leisure traveler may be looking for deals, whether that's in packages or the opaque path. So we're pretty hopeful about that product integration and we'll certainly tell you more about it in Q3 and Q4."

We think that to the extent that they have eased up pricing in response to some of the weakness that they’ve observed that has then helped us on the volume front. And obviously, the balance of volume in the year is going to some extent depend on pricing. Europe and Asia-Pacific air ticket volume remains solid for us to some extent, assisted by cuts in air fees that we haven't fully lapped. So we'll see how that goes to the back half of the year."

If you look at the domestic revenue margin, some of that gets weeded out. Not all of it. And the domestic revenue margin was down only 68 bps, even with the higher air fees, as we have lapped a number of the fees. On the international rev margin, that was down significantly more than domestic and FX was the biggest driver behind the reduction on international rev margin, plus higher average ticket prices. And then the international revenue margin also includes on a year-on-year comp basis, I think, for the last time, our CruiseShipCenters business, which has a significant amount of international bookings at lower rev margin than some of our other products. And that is probably accounting for maybe 25% to 30% of the international rev margin decline. The good news is, CSC is more profitable, but it does affect this one metric. So if you look at the rev margin on an overall basis and adjust it for FX, we're down only 92 bps, which is our lowest drop since we took the fee actions. And I think on the car side, Michael, I'd say on balance, the environment is a bit better than it was last year. Last year, we had a pretty difficult environment, in that we had very, very strong leisure demand and the car fleets being quite limited as far as increases in fleet sizes. Now then I'd say, in general, the travel business is in much better shape. The car rental companies are in much better shape, looking to gain more share. We’re seeing some increases in fleet size, which makes the inventory situation better than it was last year. Now there's no question that during the summer, inventory does tighten up. But we think that this summer, it will be on balance a bit less tight than it was last summer. So as a result, in general, we're seeing increased transactions on the car side. Revenue per rental is down slightly on lower pricing with a little bit of an increase in the average kind of length of rental. So those are the kind of the factors that are affecting the car business."

So for example, we're seeing the mobile markets developing much faster, mobile search developing much more quickly than it had last year. So we are building out mobile teams across the company to make sure that we not only build out mobile capabilities, but leading-edge mobile capabilities. Same thing for some of the foreign markets and the Asia-Pacific markets, et cetera. As we’re seeing the growth in those markets accelerate, we are finding it worthwhile for us to build up smaller kind of technology pods that are dedicated to the Asia-Pacific markets, for example, to normalize some of our products for those markets. In general, what we do is we build very, very big solutions that we can leverage on a worldwide basis. But some of the Asia-Pacific marketplaces have very different needs on payment services, especially some of the look and feel that you want on the sites; you want to be very different. Let's say a look and feel in Japan that’s acceptable is very different from a look and feel that you see the U.S. And as we've seen these markets kind of grow and mature faster than, frankly, we expected, we're going to invest ahead to some extent on the tech and content side. And the nature of technology and content is that you kind of have to invest ahead of the revenue to some extent. You’ve got to put a team together. You’ve got to build out product and typically kind of six months to 12 months after the spend, you start getting some kind of a return on it. But we think those investments are worthwhile and we think then increased spend is a reflection of kind of very, very big potential in those marketplaces. As far as the buyback goes, I just urge you to kind of step back and if you step back, kind of you see that we spent about $2 billion buying back our stock since the spinoff. In Q1, we spent almost $200 million and we brought in over 8 million shares. And what I don't want to get into is kind of a quarterly recap of why we bought in one quarter or why we did buy in another quarter. There are many, many reasons, including times in which we might have a different -- call it information from the markets, et cetera. I think that what you want to pay attention to from a long-term perspective is that we are a company that’s going to be throwing off a lot of capital. We are happy with our strategic position. We don't have to save up a bunch of capital to go after, let's say, an Asian footprint or to buy media business, as we have them inside of our company. So we do think we're going to create build out at the capital and kind of consistent with an investment-grade rating, we are going to, over the long-term, return capital to shareholders. Some of it will happen with dividends. But we would expect, over the next couple of years, to be net buyers of our stock. But from a quarterly basis, that’s certainly not something that I'm going to comment on."

I think the first thing that it starts with is the team, and I they think we have an incredible team. We've got 700 employees at TripAdvisor that are incredibly talented, kind of from the top to the bottom. And I think it comes from building great products that attracts huge amounts of traffic from a user base that is very, very loyal to that product. TripAdvisor, like many other products that are built upon user-generated content are very viral and they have positions that are very difficult to unseat. If you got 30 million reviews and you're looking for a hotel review, you're just going to TripAdvisor. Chances are, you're going to find great product there, to the extent that you'd find great product and have a great experience and chances are, you're going to write a review. People like that new content. The search engine box, the Google box, the Bing box, et cetera, like that new content because it’s great, it’s relevant and it’s new. And so this kind of the new content coming out on the site feeds upon itself and has a self-reinforcing factor. Now what’s different about TripAdvisor from most user-generated sites is that whereas most EGC [ph] sites have a hard time monetizing, this incredibly relevant information for people who want to travel. It's very targeted so you have two weapons: one is you have free content that's viral in nature and has increasing returns to scale, and you have content that monetizes incredibly well. So you put those two together and you've got a great, great product to start with. Then we add on top of that international expansion. TripAdvisor is growing in Europe on a country basis anywhere from 50% to 100% its traffic. It's going very aggressively to the Asia-Pacific regions. We’re losing a lot of money in China, that's a good thing because that means we’re investing more aggressively in China than anyone else we believe. And so you add kind of this organic growth to international market growth, which is very, very substantial and you get a great combination. You add to that new products. So for example, Business Listings is a product that allows hoteliers to list their hotel, the URL, the phone number to call, right when someone is looking up a hotel. It’s a great product for the hotelier because they get direct distribution. It’s a great experience for the consumer because they can click right on to the hotel site rather than opening up a new window, et cetera. And for us, it’s a subscription model, which is recurring revenue and is a very solid kind of product. And we've already signed up 15,000 hoteliers and that can increase the multiples and multiples. Another new product, for example, is Vacation Rentals. Again, a subscription product that we think we can build up over years. So I just think it's a combination of great, great base product, international markets that are growing even faster than a domestic business that’s growing quite well and then a number of new products that are launching as well. And when you add it up together, you get very strong growth on a current basis and I would say the kind of investment that will hopefully keep the growth going for many years. It’s an asset that we certainly don’t take for granted, and we think that as it gets bigger, we frankly think it's one of the finest content and media businesses on the web bar-non. And we think it's only a matter of time before it gets recognized inside of our portfolio. Operator, any more questions, or is that it?"

And",823,"Thanks, Alan, and thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We're pleased to be announcing solid Q3 results today. Unit growth was quite healthy, with growth in air tickets and hotel room nights outpacing the growth that we posted last quarter. And as expected, per unit revenue improved with flat revenue per room night and 4% growth for revenue per air ticket. We also saw another terrific quarter for our Advertising and Media business, with revenue growing a robust 40% driven by TripAdvisor's third-party revenue growth of 59%. Our corporate travel business, Egencia, again posted solid gross bookings and revenue growth, and it's showing continued strength in new client sales across SME, mid-market segments as well as among large accounts. Recent notable new accounts include the U.S. and Canadian divisions of Procter & Gamble and NASDAQ.
Now while these Q3 results are quite good, we still have a ton of work to do to address our opportunities and to continue to grow our business over the long term. And although I can't really do a justice in a short call, I'd like to cover a few key focus areas. 
The quality of our product and the value for the consumer is of utmost importance to maximizing our conversion rates. Recently, we spent a significant amount of time and effort advancing our platform migration and other back end work that will help us ensure that we've got the right foundation to innovate quickly and deliver real, new valuable products and services to our customers. I'll list just a couple of examples amongst many. 
Our new opaque product in the retail path on Expedia.com. The inventory comes from Hotwire and is a great example of cross-company collaboration and the integration between two of the world's great travel brands. We launched over the summer in the U.S. and just this week, we began to roll it out on Expedia in certain international markets. We plan to continue to experiment with opaque products in international markets more broadly in the future, both on the Expedia point-of-sale as well as directly with the Hotwire brand.
Loyalty programs. We've spoken before about the success of the Hotels.com loyalty program WelcomeRewards, and we've now begun rolling it out internationally. In the third quarter, we announced that the Expedia brand is also building out a new loyalty program, which will begin to roll out domestically in January. These are robust programs which we think will differentiate our product offering over the long term. At the same time, our pace of testing, learning and optimizing our product set to consumers has and will continue to accelerate, from improved mapping to automated sort order, improved site speed, mobile sites and applications and many, many more. 
We're also highly focused on our international opportunities. We've talked a lot about Europe in the past, but today I'd like to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The market opportunity there is vast, and in many countries, largely untapped. Today, the annual travel market in the APAC region is over 200 billion, of which only around 20% is online. Our total annual gross bookings in the region are just north of $1 billion, representing roughly half a point of share of the total travel market compared to nearly 7% in the U.S. So we're planning to increase our investment level to be sure we're appropriately positioned to grow our share over time. Much of this investment will come in the way of stronger localized product, deeper hotel supply and increased marketing along with new points-of-sale. Expedia, Hotels.com, eLong, TripAdvisor and Egencia are all pushing hard in APAC. And while these efforts will hurt short-term profitability in the region, we expect them to pay off over the long term. Now let me touch a bit more on TripAdvisor. The business continues to grow quite fast and is nearing $500 million annual run rate in gross revenue. Domestically, we recently launched a new cycle, SniqueAway, which is the first private sale meets crowd sourcing site. All the hotels have earned a minimum of four star rating and four out of five review ratings on TripAdvisor. While it's too early to comment on the numbers, we're pleased with the launch and have seen quite a positive customer reaction. And outside the U.S., Trip's international third-party revenue is now roughly 40% of the business and grew over 100% year-over-year in each of the last four quarters. We've recently launched four new international sites in Korea, Thailand, Singapore and just this week, in Russia. We're now in 24 countries, 17 languages. 
And lastly, on capital allocation, we continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. So far in 2010, we've returned over $440 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and it's our expectation that we'll continue to return cash to shareholders over the next few years. 
Now over to Mike."

In",590,"Thanks, Dara. Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year.
Total revenue grew 16% in Q3, a nice broad-based acceleration from the 8% growth we saw last quarter. In fact, we saw faster growth rates in every major product line, including air, hotel, car, cruise and advertising and media. Revenue margins were nearly flat year-on-year as we've now lapped almost all of the booking fee cuts and reductions that we took last year. In air, the momentum continued, with ticket volume growth of 10% as year-over-year fare increases moderated. Domestic tickets grew nicely, and we're just a couple percentage points below the worldwide growth rate, while international ticket growth continue to outpace domestic. And revenue per ticket grew 4%, all of which led to 14% revenue growth for air, our best quarterly performance for air since the first quarter of 2008.
In hotel, healthy room night growth of 14% was accompanied by a flat year-over-year revenue per room night on slightly rising ADRs. As we expected, the gap between ADR growth and revenue per room night growth narrowed considerably. Both domestic and international room right growth accelerated relative to second quarter growth rates. Room night growth in APAC continues to be strong. Hotels.com, for example, saw room night growth in excess of 100% for four of its APAC points-of-sale, with another four growing at least 50%. On the expense side, as expected, we saw leverage in cost of goods sold and in G&A with some deleverage in tech new content in sales and marketing. We'll likely see these general trends continue in the next several quarters as we continue to benefit from operational efficiencies, while also making the investments that Dara mentioned to further expand internationally and to improve our products and services.
Sales and marketing included roughly $4 million associated with moving our global lodging supply headquarters to Geneva. For the full quarter, we expect the Geneva expenses to be almost $20 million in 2010, with a recurring annual incremental run rate of about $14 million. And briefly, on occupancy taxes, we recorded an expense of $6 million in the second quarter this year with another $1 million in Q3. Each quarter we evaluate reserve and the balance could fluctuate over time, resulting in additional expense. In addition, in 2011, we expect to pay an incremental $10 million in New York sales tax due to recent legislation. 
You'll also notice that our effective tax rate this quarter was below 26%. This especially low rate was driven by completion of some IRS audits and the resulting decrease of our liability for uncertain tax positions. We estimate that this resulted in favorability of about $0.06 in earnings per share for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be roughly 34% for the fourth quarter and around 31% for full year 2011. Bolstered by the lower effective tax rate and the impact from share repurchases, adjusted EPS grew 38% for the quarter.
As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we're still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for the full year 2010, with Q4 revenue and OIBA growth rates similar to those we saw in Q3. Regarding 2011, we are in the midst of our annual planning process and we plan to update you on our thinking for 2011 on the Q4 earnings call.

In general, the gross bookings number on a year-on-year basis in Europe came down a bit as we were rolling over the fee cuts that we put through last year. Revenue on an international basis x FX improved on it on kind of a quarter-to-quarter basis mostly because of revenue per room nights getting much better than they did last quarter. So I'd say on an international basis, in general, we're satisfied with our progress. In Europe, we're satisfied with our progress. Hotels.com on balance, I think, in Europe is doing better. I think Expedia's performance is okay, and it's something that we expect to get better on a go-forward basis. The Easy Manage properties, we've got around 8,000 of them. We've added around 8,000 of them year-to-date. The concentration of those properties is in secondary and tertiary markets. And in some of those markets, we are seeing ranges of 10% to 20% of our bookings being Easy Manage properties. And we think over time, as we establish those Easy Manage properties, as we move them up in the sort order and the new hotels that we're adding mature in our inventory set, we would expect that the percentage of bookings that come through Easy Manage as a percentage of our total bookings especially in secondary and tertiary markets should get higher than the levels that they are now, which is kind of a 10% to 20% level. So we think that we'll see improvement there, and we're happy with the progress. But we think we can do better."

The 21% increase in sales and marketing wasn't necessarily all keyword pricing. But it does reflect an increase in aggression on our part in the CPC space and search engine marketing in general. Both and are being very aggressive than some of the new territories that we're going into, new markets in Europe, Asia-Pacific, where we go in with more aggressive efficiencies, so to speak. So that's not necessarily keyword pricing going up. That's just our getting into new markets, which tend to be less efficient from a marketing perspective than, call it, our more mature markets where we have more repeat users, et cetera. So I think while there is some keyword pricing in there, while we are, on balance, being more aggressive in certain markets and we do anticipate being more aggressive in the European, Asia-Pacific markets, it's a combination of our getting into new markets and our being more aggressive on the keyword pricing front. As far as ROI goes, as we get into these new markets, as we increase our spend, our ROI is lower than, call it, the mainline spend that we have in place now. So my expectation will be that for a couple of quarters as we spend up, our CPC ROI will go down, and then what we do is we spend time optimizing the ROI there, understanding which keywords work, understanding which keywords don't, optimizing our landing pages, the presentation to the customer, which usually gets us some efficiency back. But right now, we're in a mode of spending up. You see it in our sales and marketing numbers but also, again, it's something that we manage and you see it in our revenue numbers and gross bookings numbers, which are quite healthy."

I would say if you look at TripAdvisor's patterns, really, TripAdvisor and Expedia-Hotel point-of-sale support each other in that as TripAdvisor gets into a new country, it has automatically launch partners with Expedia and Hotels.com, Hotwire to the extent. Well, Hotwire not internationally. But automatically, it has Expedia and Hotels.com as launch partners, which helps TripAdvisor monetize immediately and then allow TripAdvisor to spend marketing money to grow that point-of-sale, so to speak. With time, then TripAdvisor goes out and acquires domestic players to play in the TripAdvisor marketplace and to increase the marketplace. So the average number of OTAs that TripAdvisor works with typically increases as we establish a new TripAdvisor point-of-sale. So that's where you're seeing the third-party revenue growth very quickly. It's growing internationally very quickly. We're accelerating the pace of new TripAdvisor sites on an international basis, and those revenues are growing at triple-digit growth rates along with collect [ph] and a lot of that is third-party revenue after kind of anchor clients come in, which is Expedia and Hotels.com. So I think Trip runs a fair game, and they take all takers. And as long as quick growth grows as fast as it is, it is and will continue to be a perfect business for us."

We have seen with the economy struggling a reduction in U.S. to international flights and also, along with that, bookings, kind of room night bookings, from consumers in the U.S. going internationally. And part of that was because tickets going out to Europe, going out to Asia, ticket prices were very, very expensive on a year-on-year basis. The year-on-year comps seem to be easing in general because I think prices started getting a little stronger last year. So as international becomes more affordable, so to speak, we're seeing actually U.S. to international volumes improve both on the air side and the hotel side. So I'd say in general, adding capacity from airlines for us is a good thing. We're happy to see capacity coming into the system. It eases ATPs. And with easier ATP comps, so to speak, our business tends to pick up. I would say, if anything, our business tends to be a bit more internationally focused than domestically focused as far as U.S. consumers go.

I think in general, if you look at major platforms that have been introduced in the e-commerce space and in travel in general, the core of the introduction of a significant platform has been the opportunity for people to save money. Originally, when we came onto the scene, Hotels.com was on the scene, we were offering merchant rates below rack rates. Then the Internet became the rack rate, so to speak. So opaque models got introduced. Priceline, the Hotwires of the world, the dynamic package business, which allow you to save money. Those were kind of, call it, a second leg of growth for the business. And I think that these flash sales, what you see going on now, these new retail concepts could be a third leg because again, they offer consumers a chance to save significant amounts. SniqueAway is kind of a toe in the water for us. It's being introduced with the Smarter Travel team inside of TripAdvisor, which is a terrific team. And we've introduced it to a small percentage of our email database, which is frankly huge database, really with inventory focused on the East Coast now. And then over the next months, we're going to expand the inventory to the south, to the west, et cetera and build the concept. Early results are very good. We're getting fan mail from our hotel partners, and consumers love it as well. So I'd say the early results are very good, but this is a long journey. It's a very new concept, and we're not ready to declare whether it's long-term, how large it's going to be or exactly what the opportunity is going to be."

Secondly, at the Choice today, Hotels, one of your favorites I guess, was talking about how it's pushing its loyalty programs because they're much more profitable, for example, than OTAs.

I'll try to take of each of them. As far as ITA Google goes, we've been pretty consistent in our view that, first of all, Google was a great partner of ours and we're going to be working more closely together with them on a CPC basis certainly than we ever have. So we certainly don't object to Google as a partner as they are now. We do think that it's just a bad idea to put together the dominant kind of search engine on a worldwide basis with a dominant airline search technology. We just think it squeezes out competition or has the potential of squeezing out competition in the marketplace. It's bad for advertisers. And ultimately, we think that it could be very bad for consumers. So we're a member of this coalition. We think that the coalition will certainly make its case. And we think that the case is, hopefully, will be well received by the government. In the meantime, we're going to work with Google. We're a big spender there, and on a ground level, on a tactical basis, we have a good relationship with them. We just think that this transaction is a bad idea. As far as Choice goes and loyalty programs there, we have a very good relationship with Choice. The CEO there came from Marriott, and Marriott has one of the best loyalty programs there. So it's not a surprise that they are pushing loyalty. I think it makes sense to them. I think any player out there knows that repeat customers are the most profitable customers out there. And I think to try to build out a repeat base is good business, whether you're an airline, whether you're a hotel or whether you're an OTA. And we, along with Choice, see the wisdom of this. And we've made fairly significant investments and we think differentiated investments in the OTA field, both with Hotels.com, WelcomeRewards, which is quite differentiated from what anyone else has and the new Expedia royalty program coming in next year, which I think will be quite differentiated from any other OTA out there. So we believe in loyalty, and we think that there are customers who are going to be Expedia loyal customers and Hotels loyal customers, and they are fundamentally and typically different from, call it, a Choice brand loyal customers. So I don't think that one addition to us is a subtraction to any of the brands out there like Choice. They tend to be more, call it, business customers, et cetera, where we tend to be more leisure-specific."

And I think that the big brands out there are doing what's smart, which is they have a diversified base. They advertise to bring direct players out there. They've got loyalty programs. They work with OTAs. They work with Google, and all of that helps them build out an occupancy base, which hopefully will allow them to build up ADRs. So I don't think that one, again, is exclusive over the other. I think a smart player builds a multichannel strategy and builds strength in every single channel that they have. If they're stronger with us, they will be able to build out their occupancy base inside their hotel and that will be able to drive premium ADRs in the industry, which is how you win. Again, we haven't seen any kind of negative trends, and our relationship with the brands are, frankly, terrific. As far as the Car business goes, we did see some increase in fleets kind of over the summer. The fleets have tightened up again. And I would say that, yes, the car companies in general, like the airline companies, are more disciplined on a capacity basis. Our Car business is growing nicely, and we want it to grow more. We're looking at opportunities to grow that business. But I would say in general, the Car business for us remains healthy. And in an ideal world, we'd like to see a bit more capacity, but we are seeing to date some capacity restraint, which reflects a bit more discipline on our car vendors than at least we saw two, three years ago."

So of the 25% for Expedia, for example, the majority of that traffic is someone who's already looking for Expedia, and that person is going to find Expedia one way or the other because they are searching for something very specific. Of the searches that aren't Expedia searches, so to speak, there are other searches that we compete for and other players compete for. That traffic tends to be significantly less profitable than the direct traffic, the TripAdvisor traffic, the email traffic, et cetera, that we get. So hypothetical, that minority of traffic might come down. But certainly, it would not affect our profits in the same way because that traffic tends to be much, much less profitable traffic. That is one of our most expensive channels, so to speak. And we do continue to make investments in loyalty channels and loyalty programs, et cetera, to keep consumers coming on a direct basis and build up loyalty and build up reasons for them to come back directly to us, which is the most efficient customer acquisition tool for us."

One is just an investment in opening up new points-of-sale. There's technology investment that we have to make. There's a fairly significant localization investment that we have to make as far as taking all of the content that we have, the hotel content, et cetera, and making sure that it's localized so that local customers can find the information in their own languages. There's also investments that we have to make in payments. Payments in each market differ sometimes significantly. For example, India is a big market at the Internet Bank Pay, which is a payment system that we are launching, et cetera. So as you go local, you have to make sure that you'll allow people to pay in their local market currency, so to speak. Initially, when we launch, we typically launch with variable marketing, Google, other variable marketing channels that are available in a local market. And we tend to lose money as we enter that market for the first couple of years. After we establish a presence there, we will sometimes go on with brand marketing, and I think that's the stage that you're seeing some of our points-of-sale in Asia. In Australia, we are investing in brand marketing. In Japan, some of the other points-of-sale. We are establishing a brand which increases traffic to the sites and also tends to increase our conversion number on those sites as well. That kind of brand marketing doesn't bring with it immediate returns and you have to go negative for a while before it turns positive. And I would say that that's where we are in a number of our Asian markets as far as starting the brand marketing spend and then in other markets as far as expanding the reach of our sites. The good news is that Asia, in general, for us is generally a breakeven to positive on the transactional side. With TripAdvisor, we are investing pretty aggressively in China. And then eLong, also in China, has really turned around and has accelerated its growth. So we're well established. We know the game plan there, and we're pretty confident that the investments that we're going to make in Asia are going to bring with them some pretty significant returns over the kind of two to five-year time frame. How big is it going to get is anyone's question. I think if you look at Asia five to 10 years from now, it's going to be as large as, if not larger, than the European, U.S. markets and we want to have the kind of penetrations that we have in the U.S. in Asia, and that's going to take some focus. So we're very much committed to that market."

One is to the extent that it allows us to get into the geography that we think will be very difficult for us to get into, and it's also the significant opportunity that's a big positive. So eLong, for example, in China, we didn't think we could get a position in China as strong as eLong through organic growth. And while eLong had a tough time in its first couple of years, it's really turned around behind the new management team. And I'd say we're very happy that we have a position there. So one is large geographies that we don't think we can get proper scale then through typical organic growth, that's one. The second is if there's a new piece of technology or a new product that we think is an attractive product. Example there is Venere in the agency hotel market that we wanted to penetrate in Europe. It got us in there much more quickly. We're expanding that product in Europe as well as certain other areas of the world. And then the third or just kind of our big growth areas, we love media businesses that we can add to the TripAdvisor team. We would love to add some scale to Egencia because we think that's a big and growing opportunity. So those are also opportunities that we'll certainly keep an eye on.

And",823,"Thanks, Alan, and thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We're pleased to be announcing solid Q3 results today. Unit growth was quite healthy, with growth in air tickets and hotel room nights outpacing the growth that we posted last quarter. And as expected, per unit revenue improved with flat revenue per room night and 4% growth for revenue per air ticket. We also saw another terrific quarter for our Advertising and Media business, with revenue growing a robust 40% driven by TripAdvisor's third-party revenue growth of 59%. Our corporate travel business, Egencia, again posted solid gross bookings and revenue growth, and it's showing continued strength in new client sales across SME, mid-market segments as well as among large accounts. Recent notable new accounts include the U.S. and Canadian divisions of Procter & Gamble and NASDAQ.
Now while these Q3 results are quite good, we still have a ton of work to do to address our opportunities and to continue to grow our business over the long term. And although I can't really do a justice in a short call, I'd like to cover a few key focus areas. 
The quality of our product and the value for the consumer is of utmost importance to maximizing our conversion rates. Recently, we spent a significant amount of time and effort advancing our platform migration and other back end work that will help us ensure that we've got the right foundation to innovate quickly and deliver real, new valuable products and services to our customers. I'll list just a couple of examples amongst many. 
Our new opaque product in the retail path on Expedia.com. The inventory comes from Hotwire and is a great example of cross-company collaboration and the integration between two of the world's great travel brands. We launched over the summer in the U.S. and just this week, we began to roll it out on Expedia in certain international markets. We plan to continue to experiment with opaque products in international markets more broadly in the future, both on the Expedia point-of-sale as well as directly with the Hotwire brand.
Loyalty programs. We've spoken before about the success of the Hotels.com loyalty program WelcomeRewards, and we've now begun rolling it out internationally. In the third quarter, we announced that the Expedia brand is also building out a new loyalty program, which will begin to roll out domestically in January. These are robust programs which we think will differentiate our product offering over the long term. At the same time, our pace of testing, learning and optimizing our product set to consumers has and will continue to accelerate, from improved mapping to automated sort order, improved site speed, mobile sites and applications and many, many more. 
We're also highly focused on our international opportunities. We've talked a lot about Europe in the past, but today I'd like to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The market opportunity there is vast, and in many countries, largely untapped. Today, the annual travel market in the APAC region is over 200 billion, of which only around 20% is online. Our total annual gross bookings in the region are just north of $1 billion, representing roughly half a point of share of the total travel market compared to nearly 7% in the U.S. So we're planning to increase our investment level to be sure we're appropriately positioned to grow our share over time. Much of this investment will come in the way of stronger localized product, deeper hotel supply and increased marketing along with new points-of-sale. Expedia, Hotels.com, eLong, TripAdvisor and Egencia are all pushing hard in APAC. And while these efforts will hurt short-term profitability in the region, we expect them to pay off over the long term. Now let me touch a bit more on TripAdvisor. The business continues to grow quite fast and is nearing $500 million annual run rate in gross revenue. Domestically, we recently launched a new cycle, SniqueAway, which is the first private sale meets crowd sourcing site. All the hotels have earned a minimum of four star rating and four out of five review ratings on TripAdvisor. While it's too early to comment on the numbers, we're pleased with the launch and have seen quite a positive customer reaction. And outside the U.S., Trip's international third-party revenue is now roughly 40% of the business and grew over 100% year-over-year in each of the last four quarters. We've recently launched four new international sites in Korea, Thailand, Singapore and just this week, in Russia. We're now in 24 countries, 17 languages. 
And lastly, on capital allocation, we continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. So far in 2010, we've returned over $440 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and it's our expectation that we'll continue to return cash to shareholders over the next few years. 
Now over to Mike.

In",590,"Thanks, Dara. Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year.
Total revenue grew 16% in Q3, a nice broad-based acceleration from the 8% growth we saw last quarter. In fact, we saw faster growth rates in every major product line, including air, hotel, car, cruise and advertising and media. Revenue margins were nearly flat year-on-year as we've now lapped almost all of the booking fee cuts and reductions that we took last year. In air, the momentum continued, with ticket volume growth of 10% as year-over-year fare increases moderated. Domestic tickets grew nicely, and we're just a couple percentage points below the worldwide growth rate, while international ticket growth continue to outpace domestic. And revenue per ticket grew 4%, all of which led to 14% revenue growth for air, our best quarterly performance for air since the first quarter of 2008.
In hotel, healthy room night growth of 14% was accompanied by a flat year-over-year revenue per room night on slightly rising ADRs. As we expected, the gap between ADR growth and revenue per room night growth narrowed considerably. Both domestic and international room right growth accelerated relative to second quarter growth rates. Room night growth in APAC continues to be strong. Hotels.com, for example, saw room night growth in excess of 100% for four of its APAC points-of-sale, with another four growing at least 50%. On the expense side, as expected, we saw leverage in cost of goods sold and in G&A with some deleverage in tech new content in sales and marketing. We'll likely see these general trends continue in the next several quarters as we continue to benefit from operational efficiencies, while also making the investments that Dara mentioned to further expand internationally and to improve our products and services.
Sales and marketing included roughly $4 million associated with moving our global lodging supply headquarters to Geneva. For the full quarter, we expect the Geneva expenses to be almost $20 million in 2010, with a recurring annual incremental run rate of about $14 million. And briefly, on occupancy taxes, we recorded an expense of $6 million in the second quarter this year with another $1 million in Q3. Each quarter we evaluate reserve and the balance could fluctuate over time, resulting in additional expense. In addition, in 2011, we expect to pay an incremental $10 million in New York sales tax due to recent legislation. 
You'll also notice that our effective tax rate this quarter was below 26%. This especially low rate was driven by completion of some IRS audits and the resulting decrease of our liability for uncertain tax positions. We estimate that this resulted in favorability of about $0.06 in earnings per share for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be roughly 34% for the fourth quarter and around 31% for full year 2011. Bolstered by the lower effective tax rate and the impact from share repurchases, adjusted EPS grew 38% for the quarter.
As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we're still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for the full year 2010, with Q4 revenue and OIBA growth rates similar to those we saw in Q3. Regarding 2011, we are in the midst of our annual planning process and we plan to update you on our thinking for 2011 on the Q4 earnings call. 
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question.

Revenue on an international basis x FX improved on it on kind of a quarter-to-quarter basis mostly because of revenue per room nights getting much better than they did last quarter. So I'd say on an international basis, in general, we're satisfied with our progress. In Europe, we're satisfied with our progress. Hotels.com on balance, I think, in Europe is doing better. I think Expedia's performance is okay, and it's something that we expect to get better on a go-forward basis. The Easy Manage properties, we've got around 8,000 of them. We've added around 8,000 of them year-to-date. The concentration of those properties is in secondary and tertiary markets. And in some of those markets, we are seeing ranges of 10% to 20% of our bookings being Easy Manage properties. And we think over time, as we establish those Easy Manage properties, as we move them up in the sort order and the new hotels that we're adding mature in our inventory set, we would expect that the percentage of bookings that come through Easy Manage as a percentage of our total bookings especially in secondary and tertiary markets should get higher than the levels that they are now, which is kind of a 10% to 20% level.

The 21% increase in sales and marketing wasn't necessarily all keyword pricing. But it does reflect an increase in aggression on our part in the CPC space and search engine marketing in general. Both and are being very aggressive than some of the new territories that we're going into, new markets in Europe, Asia-Pacific, where we go in with more aggressive efficiencies, so to speak. So that's not necessarily keyword pricing going up. That's just our getting into new markets, which tend to be less efficient from a marketing perspective than, call it, our more mature markets where we have more repeat users, et cetera. So I think while there is some keyword pricing in there, while we are, on balance, being more aggressive in certain markets and we do anticipate being more aggressive in the European, Asia-Pacific markets, it's a combination of our getting into new markets and our being more aggressive on the keyword pricing front. As far as ROI goes, as we get into these new markets, as we increase our spend, our ROI is lower than, call it, the mainline spend that we have in place now. So my expectation will be that for a couple of quarters as we spend up, our CPC ROI will go down, and then what we do is we spend time optimizing the ROI there, understanding which keywords work, understanding which keywords don't, optimizing our landing pages, the presentation to the customer, which usually gets us some efficiency back. But right now, we're in a mode of spending up. You see it in our sales and marketing numbers but also, again, it's something that we manage and you see it in our revenue numbers and gross bookings numbers, which are quite healthy.

Well, Hotwire not internationally. But automatically, it has Expedia and Hotels.com as launch partners, which helps TripAdvisor monetize immediately and then allow TripAdvisor to spend marketing money to grow that point-of-sale, so to speak. With time, then TripAdvisor goes out and acquires domestic players to play in the TripAdvisor marketplace and to increase the marketplace. So the average number of OTAs that TripAdvisor works with typically increases as we establish a new TripAdvisor point-of-sale. So that's where you're seeing the third-party revenue growth very quickly. It's growing internationally very quickly. We're accelerating the pace of new TripAdvisor sites on an international basis, and those revenues are growing at triple-digit growth rates along with collect [ph] and a lot of that is third-party revenue after kind of anchor clients come in, which is Expedia and Hotels.com.

I think in general, if you look at major platforms that have been introduced in the e-commerce space and in travel in general, the core of the introduction of a significant platform has been the opportunity for people to save money. Originally, when we came onto the scene, Hotels.com was on the scene, we were offering merchant rates below rack rates. Then the Internet became the rack rate, so to speak. So opaque models got introduced. Priceline, the Hotwires of the world, the dynamic package business, which allow you to save money. Those were kind of, call it, a second leg of growth for the business. And I think that these flash sales, what you see going on now, these new retail concepts could be a third leg because again, they offer consumers a chance to save significant amounts. SniqueAway is kind of a toe in the water for us. It's being introduced with the Smarter Travel team inside of TripAdvisor, which is a terrific team. And we've introduced it to a small percentage of our email database, which is frankly huge database, really with inventory focused on the East Coast now. And then over the next months, we're going to expand the inventory to the south, to the west, et cetera and build the concept. Early results are very good. We're getting fan mail from our hotel partners, and consumers love it as well. So I'd say the early results are very good, but this is a long journey.

I'll try to take of each of them. As far as ITA Google goes, we've been pretty consistent in our view that, first of all, Google was a great partner of ours and we're going to be working more closely together with them on a CPC basis certainly than we ever have. So we certainly don't object to Google as a partner as they are now. We do think that it's just a bad idea to put together the dominant kind of search engine on a worldwide basis with a dominant airline search technology. We just think it squeezes out competition or has the potential of squeezing out competition in the marketplace. It's bad for advertisers. And ultimately, we think that it could be very bad for consumers. So we're a member of this coalition. We think that the coalition will certainly make its case. And we think that the case is, hopefully, will be well received by the government. In the meantime, we're going to work with Google. We're a big spender there, and on a ground level, on a tactical basis, we have a good relationship with them. We just think that this transaction is a bad idea. As far as Choice goes and loyalty programs there, we have a very good relationship with Choice. The CEO there came from Marriott, and Marriott has one of the best loyalty programs there. So it's not a surprise that they are pushing loyalty. I think it makes sense to them. I think any player out there knows that repeat customers are the most profitable customers out there. And I think to try to build out a repeat base is good business, whether you're an airline, whether you're a hotel or whether you're an OTA. And we, along with Choice, see the wisdom of this. And we've made fairly significant investments and we think differentiated investments in the OTA field, both with Hotels.com, WelcomeRewards, which is quite differentiated from what anyone else has and the new Expedia royalty program coming in next year, which I think will be quite differentiated from any other OTA out there. So we believe in loyalty, and we think that there are customers who are going to be Expedia loyal customers and Hotels loyal customers, and they are fundamentally and typically different from, call it, a Choice brand loyal customers. So I don't think that one addition to us is a subtraction to any of the brands out there like Choice. They tend to be more, call it, business customers, et cetera, where we tend to be more leisure-specific.

And I think that the big brands out there are doing what's smart, which is they have a diversified base. They advertise to bring direct players out there. They've got loyalty programs. They work with OTAs. They work with Google, and all of that helps them build out an occupancy base, which hopefully will allow them to build up ADRs. So I don't think that one, again, is exclusive over the other. I think a smart player builds a multichannel strategy and builds strength in every single channel that they have. If they're stronger with us, they will be able to build out their occupancy base inside their hotel and that will be able to drive premium ADRs in the industry, which is how you win. Again, we haven't seen any kind of negative trends, and our relationship with the brands are, frankly, terrific. As far as the Car business goes, we did see some increase in fleets kind of over the summer. The fleets have tightened up again. And I would say that, yes, the car companies in general, like the airline companies, are more disciplined on a capacity basis. Our Car business is growing nicely, and we want it to grow more. We're looking at opportunities to grow that business. But I would say in general, the Car business for us remains healthy. And in an ideal world, we'd like to see a bit more capacity, but we are seeing to date some capacity restraint, which reflects a bit more discipline on our car vendors than at least we saw two, three years ago.

So if there's a particular market or markets where we think we can grow better or expand more quickly, we could make an acquisition in that market as well. And also, just given the strong performance of the Egencia business and the huge opportunity that we see there, yes, we're also looking at tuck-in acquisitions for Egencia as well.

And if you look at our capital allocation this year, this year we've been buying back more in stock and returning more capital to shareholders versus acquisition. So far this year, we found that a better use of our capital and the opportunity had certainly been there. We think over time as that cash flow generation of the business is good enough and our balance sheet is certainly good enough with additional cash that we have raised, that we'll be able to do both, with the balance of smart acquisitions and we'll continue to return cash to our shareholders over time.

So we think absolutely fantastic performance for the business, and the core business continues to grow and be as efficient as ever. We are continuing to make acquisitions to try and fuel growth down the road as well. So the investments are fairly wide-ranging. There are a number of international points-of-sale that we've launched this year. Those tend to operate at a loss to breakeven in the first year or so. We have the investment in SniqueAway that Dara discussed earlier. We are also continuing to invest in the vacation rental space, where we think we have a pretty good opportunity to become pretty large in that space by leveraging the TripAdvisor brand, and we recently made an acquisition in that area to expand internationally. And then China, we've talked about our efforts with TripAdvisor in China fairly significantly, and we acquired a company called Kuxun, which is an air metasearch player. And then we also have a TripAdvisor-like product in China called Daodao. So for us, when we step back and we look at the amount of investments that we're making in this very high margin business and we see it grow as rapidly as it is and still deliver 53% OIBA margin for the quarter, we're pretty pleased with the balance that we've been able to strike between printing earnings as well as making sure that we are building a business for the future.

First of all, the majority of, at least Expedia's, and I believe Hotel.com's traffic that comes from search to our site actually come through people searching for Expedia, for example. So in typing in Expedia in Google or so on, typing in Hotels.com in Google. So of the 25% for Expedia, for example, the majority of that traffic is someone who's already looking for Expedia, and that person is going to find Expedia one way or the other because they are searching for something very specific. Of the searches that aren't Expedia searches, so to speak, there are other searches that we compete for and other players compete for. That traffic tends to be significantly less profitable than the direct traffic, the TripAdvisor traffic, the email traffic, et cetera, that we get. So hypothetical, that minority of traffic might come down. But certainly, it would not affect our profits in the same way because that traffic tends to be much, much less profitable traffic. That is one of our most expensive channels, so to speak. And we do continue to make investments in loyalty channels and loyalty programs, et cetera, to keep consumers coming on a direct basis and build up loyalty and build up reasons for them to come back directly to us, which is the most efficient customer acquisition tool for us.

One is just an investment in opening up new points-of-sale. There's technology investment that we have to make. There's a fairly significant localization investment that we have to make as far as taking all of the content that we have, the hotel content, et cetera, and making sure that it's localized so that local customers can find the information in their own languages. There's also investments that we have to make in payments. Payments in each market differ sometimes significantly. For example, India is a big market at the Internet Bank Pay, which is a payment system that we are launching, et cetera. So as you go local, you have to make sure that you'll allow people to pay in their local market currency, so to speak. Initially, when we launch, we typically launch with variable marketing, Google, other variable marketing channels that are available in a local market. And we tend to lose money as we enter that market for the first couple of years. After we establish a presence there, we will sometimes go on with brand marketing, and I think that's the stage that you're seeing some of our points-of-sale in Asia. In Australia, we are investing in brand marketing. In Japan, some of the other points-of-sale. We are establishing a brand which increases traffic to the sites and also tends to increase our conversion number on those sites as well. That kind of brand marketing doesn't bring with it immediate returns and you have to go negative for a while before it turns positive. And I would say that that's where we are in a number of our Asian markets as far as starting the brand marketing spend and then in other markets as far as expanding the reach of our sites. The good news is that Asia, in general, for us is generally a breakeven to positive on the transactional side. With TripAdvisor, we are investing pretty aggressively in China. And then eLong, also in China, has really turned around and has accelerated its growth. So we're well established. We know the game plan there, and we're pretty confident that the investments that we're going to make in Asia are going to bring with them some pretty significant returns over the kind of two to five-year time frame. How big is it going to get is anyone's question. I think if you look at Asia five to 10 years from now, it's going to be as large as, if not larger, than the European, U.S. markets and we want to have the kind of penetrations that we have in the U.S. in Asia, and that's going to take some focus. So we're very much committed to that market.

One is to the extent that it allows us to get into the geography that we think will be very difficult for us to get into, and it's also the significant opportunity that's a big positive. So eLong, for example, in China, we didn't think we could get a position in China as strong as eLong through organic growth. And while eLong had a tough time in its first couple of years, it's really turned around behind the new management team. And I'd say we're very happy that we have a position there. So one is large geographies that we don't think we can get proper scale then through typical organic growth, that's one. The second is if there's a new piece of technology or a new product that we think is an attractive product. Example there is Venere in the agency hotel market that we wanted to penetrate in Europe. It got us in there much more quickly. We're expanding that product in Europe as well as certain other areas of the world. And then the third or just kind of our big growth areas, we love media businesses that we can add to the TripAdvisor team. We would love to add some scale to Egencia because we think that's a big and growing opportunity. So those are also opportunities that we'll certainly keep an eye on.

And",823,"Thanks, Alan, and thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We're pleased to be announcing solid Q3 results today. Unit growth was quite healthy, with growth in air tickets and hotel room nights outpacing the growth that we posted last quarter. And as expected, per unit revenue improved with flat revenue per room night and 4% growth for revenue per air ticket. We also saw another terrific quarter for our Advertising and Media business, with revenue growing a robust 40% driven by TripAdvisor's third-party revenue growth of 59%. Our corporate travel business, Egencia, again posted solid gross bookings and revenue growth, and it's showing continued strength in new client sales across SME, mid-market segments as well as among large accounts. Recent notable new accounts include the U.S. and Canadian divisions of Procter & Gamble and NASDAQ.
Now while these Q3 results are quite good, we still have a ton of work to do to address our opportunities and to continue to grow our business over the long term. And although I can't really do it justice in a short call, I'd like to cover a few key focus areas. 
The quality of our product and the value for the consumer is of utmost importance to maximizing our conversion rates. Recently, we spent a significant amount of time and effort advancing our platform migration and other back end work that will help us ensure that we've got the right foundation to innovate quickly and deliver real, new valuable products and services to our customers. I'll list just a couple of examples amongst many. 
Our new opaque product in the retail path on Expedia.com. The inventory comes from Hotwire and is a great example of cross-company collaboration and the integration between two of the world's great travel brands. We launched over the summer in the U.S. and just this week, we began to roll it out on Expedia in certain international markets. We plan to continue to experiment with opaque products in international markets more broadly in the future, both on the Expedia point-of-sale as well as directly with the Hotwire brand.
Loyalty programs. We've spoken before about the success of the Hotels.com loyalty program WelcomeRewards, and we've now begun rolling it out internationally. In the third quarter, we announced that the Expedia brand is also building out a new loyalty program, which will begin to roll out domestically in January. These are robust programs which we think will differentiate our product offering over the long term. At the same time, our pace of testing, learning and optimizing our product set to consumers has and will continued to accelerate, from improved mapping to automated sort order, improved site speed, mobile sites and applications and many, many more. 
We're also highly focused on our international opportunities. We've talked a lot about Europe in the past, but today I'd like to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The market opportunity there is vast, and in many countries, largely untapped. Today, the annual travel market in the APAC region is over 200 billion, of which only around 20% is online. Our total annual gross bookings in the region are just north of $1 billion, representing roughly half a point of share of the total travel market compared to nearly 7% in the U.S. So we're planning to increase our investment level to be sure we're appropriately positioned to grow our share over time. Much of this investment will come in the way of stronger localized product, deeper hotel supply and increased marketing along with new points-of-sale. Expedia, Hotels.com, eLong, TripAdvisor and Egencia are all pushing hard in APAC. And while these efforts will hurt short-term profitability in the region, we expect them to pay off over the long term. Now let me touch a bit more on TripAdvisor. The business continues to grow quite fast and is nearing $500 million annual run rate in gross revenue. Domestically, we recently launched a new cycle, SniqueAway, which is the first private sale meets crowd sourcing site. All the hotels have earned a minimum of four star rating and four out of five review ratings on TripAdvisor. While it's too early to comment on the numbers, we're pleased with the launch and have seen quite a positive customer reaction. And outside the U.S., Trip's international third-party revenue is now roughly 40% of the business and grew over 100% year-over-year in each of the last four quarters. We've recently launched four new international sites in Korea, Thailand, Singapore and just this week, in Russia. We're now in 24 countries, 17 languages. 
And lastly, on capital allocation, we continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. So far in 2010, we've returned over $440 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and it's our expectation that we'll continue to return cash to shareholders over the next few years. 
Now over to Mike."

In",590,"Thanks, Dara. Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year.
Total revenue grew 16% in Q3, a nice broad-based acceleration from the 8% growth we saw last quarter. In fact, we saw faster growth rates in every major product line, including air, hotel, car, cruise and advertising and media. Revenue margins were nearly flat year-on-year as we've now lapped almost all of the booking fee cuts and reductions that we took last year. In air, the momentum continued, with ticket volume growth of 10% as year-over-year fare increases moderated. Domestic tickets grew nicely, and we're just a couple percentage points below the worldwide growth rate, while international ticket growth continued to outpace domestic. And revenue per ticket grew 4%, all of which led to 14% revenue growth for air, our best quarterly performance for air since the first quarter of 2008.
In hotel, healthy room night growth of 14% was accompanied by a flat year-over-year revenue per room night on slightly rising ADRs. As we expected, the gap between ADR growth and revenue per room night growth narrowed considerably. Both domestic and international room night growth accelerated relative to second quarter growth rates. Room night growth in APAC continues to be strong. Hotels.com, for example, saw room night growth in excess of 100% for four of its APAC points-of-sale, with another four growing at least 50%. On the expense side, as expected, we saw leverage in cost of goods sold and in G&A with some deleverage in tech new content in sales and marketing. We'll likely see these general trends continue in the next several quarters as we continue to benefit from operational efficiencies, while also making the investments that Dara mentioned to further expand internationally and to improve our products and services.
Sales and marketing included roughly $4 million associated with moving our global lodging supply headquarters to Geneva. For the full quarter, we expect the Geneva expenses to be almost $20 million in 2010, with a recurring annual incremental run rate of about $14 million. And briefly, on occupancy taxes, we recorded an expense of $6 million in the second quarter this year with another $1 million in Q3. Each quarter we evaluate reserve and the balance could fluctuate over time, resulting in additional expense. In addition, in 2011, we expect to pay an incremental $10 million in New York sales tax due to recent legislation. 
You'll also notice that our effective tax rate this quarter was below 26%. This especially low rate was driven by completion of some IRS audits and the resulting decrease of our liability for uncertain tax positions. We estimate that this resulted in favorability of about $0.06 in earnings per share for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be roughly 34% for the fourth quarter and around 31% for full year 2011. Bolstered by the lower effective tax rate and the impact from share repurchases, adjusted EPS grew 38% for the quarter.
As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we're still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for the full year 2010, with Q4 revenue and OIBA growth rates similar to those we saw in Q3. Regarding 2011, we are in the midst of our annual planning process and we plan to update you on our thinking for 2011 on the Q4 earnings call. 
With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question."

In general, the gross bookings number on a year-on-year basis in Europe came down a bit as we were rolling over the fee cuts that we put through last year. Revenue on an international basis x FX improved on it on kind of a quarter-to-quarter basis mostly because of revenue per room nights getting much better than they did last quarter. So I'd say on an international basis, in general, we're satisfied with our progress. In Europe, we're satisfied with our progress. Hotels.com on balance, I think, in Europe is doing better. I think Expedia's performance is okay, and it's something that we expect to get better on a go-forward basis. The Easy Manage properties, we've got around 8,000 of them. We've added around 8,000 of them year-to-date. The concentration of those properties is in secondary and tertiary markets. And in some of those markets, we are seeing ranges of 10% to 20% of our bookings being Easy Manage properties. And we think over time, as we establish those Easy Manage properties, as we move them up in the sort order and the new hotels that we're adding mature in our inventory set, we would expect that the percentage of bookings that come through Easy Manage as a percentage of our total bookings especially in secondary and tertiary markets should get higher than the levels that they are now, which is kind of a 10% to 20% level. So we think that we'll see improvement there, and we're happy with the progress. But we think we can do better."

The 21% increase in sales and marketing wasn't necessarily all keyword pricing. But it does reflect an increase in aggression on our part in the CPC space and search engine marketing in general. Both and are being very aggressive than some of the new territories that we're going into, new markets in Europe, Asia-Pacific, where we go in with more aggressive efficiencies, so to speak. So that's not necessarily keyword pricing going up. That's just our getting into new markets, which tend to be less efficient from a marketing perspective than, call it, our more mature markets where we have more repeat users, et cetera. So I think while there is some keyword pricing in there, while we are, on balance, being more aggressive in certain markets and we do anticipate being more aggressive in the European, Asia-Pacific markets, it's a combination of our getting into new markets and our being more aggressive on the keyword pricing front. As far as ROI goes, as we get into these new markets, as we increase our spend, our ROI is lower than, call it, the mainline spend that we have in place now. So my expectation will be that for a couple of quarters as we spend up, our CPC ROI will go down, and then what we do is we spend time optimizing the ROI there, understanding which keywords work, understanding which keywords don't, optimizing our landing pages, the presentation to the customer, which usually gets us some efficiency back. But right now, we're in a mode of spending up. You see it in our sales and marketing numbers but also, again, it's something that we manage and you see it in our revenue numbers and gross bookings numbers, which are quite healthy."

Well, Hotwire not internationally. But automatically, it has Expedia and Hotels.com as launch partners, which helps TripAdvisor monetize immediately and then allow TripAdvisor to spend marketing money to grow that point-of-sale, so to speak. With time, then TripAdvisor goes out and acquires domestic players to play in the TripAdvisor marketplace and to increase the marketplace. So the average number of OTAs that TripAdvisor works with typically increases as we establish a new TripAdvisor point-of-sale. So that's where you're seeing the third-party revenue grow very quickly. It's growing internationally very quickly. We're accelerating the pace of new TripAdvisor sites on an international basis, and those revenues are growing at triple-digit growth rates along with collect [ph] and a lot of that is third-party revenue after kind of anchor clients come in, which is Expedia and Hotels.com.

I think in general, if you look at major platforms that have been introduced in the e-commerce space and in travel in general, the core of the introduction of a significant platform has been the opportunity for people to save money. Originally, when we came onto the scene, Hotels.com was on the scene, we were offering merchant rates below rack rates. Then the Internet became the rack rate, so to speak. So opaque models got introduced. Priceline, the Hotwires of the world, the dynamic package business, which allow you to save money. Those were kind of, call it, a second leg of growth for the business. And I think that these flash sales, what you see going on now, these new retail concepts could be a third leg because again, they offer consumers a chance to save significant amounts. SniqueAway is kind of a toe in the water for us. It's being introduced with the Smarter Travel team inside of TripAdvisor, which is a terrific team. And we've introduced it to a small percentage of our email database, which is frankly huge database, really with inventory focused on the East Coast now. And then over the next months, we're going to expand the inventory to the south, to the west, et cetera and build the concept. Early results are very good.

One is you, apparently with a few others, are joining to battle the ITA approval -- FTC approval, and maybe you can talk to that in light of previous comments when they didn't see it necessarily as a big problem. Secondly, at the Choice today, Hotels, one of your favorites I guess, was talking about how it's pushing its loyalty programs because they're much more profitable, for example, than OTAs. I was wondering if you're seeing the hotel industry being better equipped to do that than they have in the past. And then could you talk about car revenues? Are fleets still tight, or is it much more that some of the companies are getting smarter at least from their standpoint in making cars available for the opaque market?"

I'll try to take of each of them. As far as ITA Google goes, we've been pretty consistent in our view that, first of all, Google was a great partner of ours and we're going to be working more closely together with them on a CPC basis certainly than we ever have. So we certainly don't object to Google as a partner as they are now. We do think that it's just a bad idea to put together the dominant kind of search engine on a worldwide basis with a dominant airline search technology. We just think it squeezes out competition or has the potential of squeezing out competition in the marketplace. It's bad for advertisers. And ultimately, we think that it could be very bad for consumers. So we're a member of this coalition. We think that the coalition will certainly make its case. And we think that the case is, hopefully, will be well received by the government. In the meantime, we're going to work with Google. We're a big spender there, and on a ground level, on a tactical basis, we have a good relationship with them. We just think that this transaction is a bad idea. As far as Choice goes and loyalty programs there, we have a very good relationship with Choice. The CEO there came from Marriott, and Marriott has one of the best loyalty programs there. So it's not a surprise that they are pushing loyalty. I think it makes sense to them. I think any player out there knows that repeat customers are the most profitable customers out there. And I think to try to build out a repeat base is good business, whether you're an airline, whether you're a hotel or whether you're an OTA. And we, along with Choice, see the wisdom of this. And we've made fairly significant investments and we think differentiated investments in the OTA field, both with Hotels.com, WelcomeRewards, which is quite differentiated from what anyone else has and the new Expedia loyalty program coming in next year, which I think will be quite differentiated from any other OTA out there. So we believe in loyalty, and we think that there are customers who are going to be Expedia loyal customers and Hotels loyal customers, and they are fundamentally and typically different from, call it, a Choice brand loyal customers. So I don't think that one addition to us is a subtraction to any of the brands out there like Choice. They tend to be more, call it, business customers, et cetera, where we tend to be more leisure-specific."

And I think that the big brands out there are doing what's smart, which is they have a diversified base. They advertise to bring direct players out there. They've got loyalty programs. They work with OTAs. They work with Google, and all of that helps them build out an occupancy base, which hopefully will allow them to build up ADRs. So I don't think that one, again, is exclusive over the other. I think a smart player builds a multichannel strategy and builds strength in every single channel that they have. If they're stronger with us, they will be able to build out their occupancy base inside their hotel and that will be able to drive premium ADRs in the industry, which is how you win. Again, we haven't seen any kind of negative trends, and our relationship with the brands are, frankly, terrific. As far as the Car business goes, we did see some increase in fleets kind of over the summer. The fleets have tightened up again. And I would say that, yes, the car companies in general, like the airline companies, are more disciplined on a capacity basis. Our Car business is growing nicely, and we want it to grow more. We're looking at opportunities to grow that business. But I would say in general, the Car business for us remains healthy. And in an ideal world, we'd like to see a bit more capacity, but we are seeing to date some capacity restraint, which reflects a bit more discipline on our car vendors than at least we saw two, three years ago."

So we think absolutely fantastic performance for the business, and the core business continues to grow and be as efficient as ever. We are continuing to make acquisitions to try and fuel growth down the road as well. So the investments are fairly wide-ranging. There are a number of international points-of-sale that we've launched this year. Those tend to operate at a loss to breakeven in the first year or so. We have the investment in SniqueAway that Dara discussed earlier. We are also continuing to invest in the vacation rental space, where we think we have a pretty good opportunity to become pretty large in that space by leveraging the TripAdvisor brand, and we recently made an acquisition in that area to expand internationally. And then China, we've talked about our efforts with TripAdvisor in China fairly significantly, and we acquired a company called Kuxun, which is an air metasearch player. And then we also have a TripAdvisor-like product in China called Daodao. So for us, when we step back and we look at the amount of investments that we're making in this very high margin business and we see it grow as rapidly as it is and still deliver 53% OIBA margin for the quarter, we're pretty pleased with the balance that we've been able to strike between printing earnings as well as making sure that we are building a business for the future."

First of all, the majority of, at least Expedia's, and I believe Hotel.com's traffic that comes from search to our site actually come through people searching for Expedia, for example. So in typing in Expedia in Google or so on, typing in Hotels.com in Google. So of the 25% for Expedia, for example, the majority of that traffic is someone who's already looking for Expedia, and that person is going to find Expedia one way or the other because they are searching for something very specific. Of the searches that aren't Expedia searches, so to speak, there are other searches that we compete for and other players compete for. That traffic tends to be significantly less profitable than the direct traffic, the TripAdvisor traffic, the email traffic, et cetera, that we get. So hypothetical, that minority of traffic might come down. But certainly, it would not affect our profits in the same way because that traffic tends to be much, much less profitable traffic. That is one of our most expensive channels, so to speak.

One is just an investment in opening up new points-of-sale. There's technology investment that we have to make. There's a fairly significant localization investment that we have to make as far as taking all of the content that we have, the hotel content, et cetera, and making sure that it's localized so that local customers can find the information in their own languages. There's also investments that we have to make in payments. Payments in each market differ sometimes significantly. For example, India is a big market at the Internet Bank Pay, which is a payment system that we are launching, et cetera. So as you go local, you have to make sure that you'll allow people to pay in their local market currency, so to speak. Initially, when we launch, we typically launch with variable marketing, Google, other variable marketing channels that are available in a local market. And we tend to lose money as we enter that market for the first couple of years. After we establish a presence there, we will sometimes go on with brand marketing, and I think that's the stage that you're seeing some of our points-of-sale in Asia. In Australia, we are investing in brand marketing. In Japan, some of the other points-of-sale. We are establishing a brand which increases traffic to the sites and also tends to increase our conversion on those sites as well. That kind of brand marketing doesn't bring with it immediate returns and you have to go negative for a while before it turns positive. And I would say that that's where we are in a number of our Asian markets as far as starting the brand marketing spend and then in other markets as far as expanding the reach of our sites. The good news is that Asia, in general, for us is generally a breakeven to positive on the transactional side. With TripAdvisor, we are investing pretty aggressively in China. And then eLong, also in China, has really turned around and has accelerated its growth. So we're well established. We know the game plan there, and we're pretty confident that the investments that we're going to make in Asia are going to bring with them some pretty significant returns over the kind of two- to five-year time frame. How big is it going to get is anyone's question. I think if you look at Asia five to 10 years from now, it's going to be as large as, if not larger, than the European, U.S. markets and we want to have the kind of penetrations that we have in the U.S. in Asia, and that's going to take some focus. So we're very much committed to that market."

One is to the extent that it allows us to get into the geography that we think will be very difficult for us to get into, and it's also the significant opportunity that's a big positive. So eLong, for example, in China, we didn't think we could get a position in China as strong as eLong through organic growth. And while eLong had a tough time in its first couple of years, it's really turned around behind the new management team. And I'd say we're very happy that we have a position there. So one is large geographies that we don't think we can get proper scale then through typical organic growth, that's one. The second is if there's a new piece of technology or a new product that we think is an attractive product. Example there is Venere in the agency hotel market that we wanted to penetrate in Europe. It got us in there much more quickly. We're expanding that product in Europe as well as certain other areas of the world. And then the third or just kind of our big growth areas, we love media businesses that we can add to the TripAdvisor team.

And",823," Thanks, Alan, and thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We're pleased to be announcing solid Q3 results today. Unit growth was quite healthy, with growth in air tickets and hotel room nights outpacing the growth that we posted last quarter. And as expected, per unit revenue improved with flat revenue per room night and 4% growth for revenue per air ticket. We also saw another terrific quarter for our Advertising and Media business, with revenue growing a robust 40% driven by TripAdvisor's third-party revenue growth of 59%. Our corporate travel business, Egencia, again posted solid gross bookings and revenue growth, and it's showing continued strength in new client sales across SME, mid-market segments as well as among large accounts. Recent notable new accounts include the U.S. and Canadian divisions of Procter & Gamble and NASDAQ.
 Now while these Q3 results are quite good, we still have a ton of work to do to address our opportunities and to continue to grow our business over the long term. And although I can't really do a justice in a short call, I'd like to cover a few key focus areas.
 The quality of our product and the value for the consumer is of utmost importance to maximizing our conversion rates. Recently, we spent a significant amount of time and effort advancing our platform migration and other back end work that will help us ensure that we've got the right foundation to innovate quickly and deliver real, new valuable products and services to our customers. I'll list just a couple of examples amongst many.
 Our new opaque product in the retail path on Expedia.com. The inventory comes from Hotwire and is a great example of cross-company collaboration and the integration between two of the world's great travel brands. We launched over the summer in the U.S. and just this week, we began to roll it out on Expedia in certain international markets. We plan to continue to experiment with opaque products in international markets more broadly in the future, both on the Expedia point-of-sale as well as directly with the Hotwire brand.
 Loyalty programs. We've spoken before about the success of the Hotels.com loyalty program WelcomeRewards, and we've now begun rolling it out internationally. In the third quarter, we announced that the Expedia brand is also building out a new loyalty program, which will begin to roll out domestically in January. These are robust programs which we think will differentiate our product offering over the long term. At the same time, our pace of testing, learning and optimizing our product set to consumers has and will continue to accelerate, from improved mapping to automated sort order, improved site speed, mobile sites and applications and many, many more.
 We're also highly focused on our international opportunities. We've talked a lot about Europe in the past, but today I'd like to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The market opportunity there is vast, and in many countries, largely untapped. Today, the annual travel market in the APAC region is over 200 billion, of which only around 20% is online. Our total annual gross bookings in the region are just north of $1 billion, representing roughly half a point of share of the total travel market compared to nearly 7% in the U.S. So we're planning to increase our investment level to be sure we're appropriately positioned to grow our share over time. Much of this investment will come in the way of stronger localized product, deeper hotel supply and increased marketing along with new points-of-sale. Expedia, Hotels.com, eLong, TripAdvisor and Egencia are all pushing hard in APAC. And while these efforts will hurt short-term profitability in the region, we expect them to pay off over the long term. Now let me touch a bit more on TripAdvisor. The business continues to grow quite fast and is nearing $500 million annual run rate in gross revenue. Domestically, we recently launched a new cycle, SniqueAway, which is the first private sale meets crowd sourcing site. All the hotels have earned a minimum of four star rating and four out of five review ratings on TripAdvisor. While it's too early to comment on the numbers, we're pleased with the launch and have seen quite a positive customer reaction. And outside the U.S., Trip's international third-party revenue is now roughly 40% of the business and grew over 100% year-over-year in each of the last four quarters. We've recently launched four new international sites in Korea, Thailand, Singapore and just this week, in Russia. We're now in 24 countries, 17 languages.
 And lastly, on capital allocation, we continue to have confidence in our ability to grow the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. So far in 2010, we've returned over $440 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and it's our expectation that we'll continue to return cash to shareholders over the next few years.
 Now over to Mike.

Just a few additional details about the quarter, and then I'll cover some thoughts about our expectations for the balance of the year.
 Total revenue grew 16% in Q3, a nice broad-based acceleration from the 8% growth we saw last quarter. In fact, we saw faster growth rates in every major product line, including air, hotel, car, cruise and advertising and media. Revenue margins were nearly flat year-on-year as we've now lapped almost all of the booking fee cuts and reductions that we took last year. In air, the momentum continued, with ticket volume growth of 10% as year-over-year fare increases moderated. Domestic tickets grew nicely, and we're just a couple percentage points below the worldwide growth rate, while international ticket growth continue to outpace domestic. And revenue per ticket grew 4%, all of which led to 14% revenue growth for air, our best quarterly performance for air since the first quarter of 2008.
 In hotel, healthy room night growth of 14% was accompanied by a flat year-over-year revenue per room night on slightly rising ADRs. As we expected, the gap between ADR growth and revenue per room night growth narrowed considerably. Both domestic and international room right growth accelerated relative to second quarter growth rates. Room night growth in APAC continues to be strong. Hotels.com, for example, saw room night growth in excess of 100% for four of its APAC points-of-sale, with another four growing at least 50%. On the expense side, as expected, we saw leverage in cost of goods sold and in G&A with some deleverage in tech new content in sales and marketing. We'll likely see these general trends continue in the next several quarters as we continue to benefit from operational efficiencies, while also making the investments that Dara mentioned to further expand internationally and to improve our products and services.
 Sales and marketing included roughly $4 million associated with moving our global lodging supply headquarters to Geneva. For the full quarter, we expect the Geneva expenses to be almost $20 million in 2010, with a recurring annual incremental run rate of about $14 million. And briefly, on occupancy taxes, we recorded an expense of $6 million in the second quarter this year with another $1 million in Q3. Each quarter we evaluate reserve and the balance could fluctuate over time, resulting in additional expense. In addition, in 2011, we expect to pay an incremental $10 million in New York sales tax due to recent legislation.
 You'll also notice that our effective tax rate this quarter was below 26%. This especially low rate was driven by completion of some IRS audits and the resulting decrease of our liability for uncertain tax positions. We estimate that this resulted in favorability of about $0.06 in earnings per share for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be roughly 34% for the fourth quarter and around 31% for full year 2011. Bolstered by the lower effective tax rate and the impact from share repurchases, adjusted EPS grew 38% for the quarter.
 As far as our financial expectations are concerned, we're still expecting to deliver low double-digit OIBA growth for the full year 2010, with Q4 revenue and OIBA growth rates similar to those we saw in Q3. Regarding 2011, we are in the midst of our annual planning process and we plan to update you on our thinking for 2011 on the Q4 earnings call.
 With that, let's turn to questions. Operator, would you please remind listeners how to ask a question.

In general, the gross bookings number on a year-on-year basis in Europe came down a bit as we were rolling over the fee cuts that we put through last year. Revenue on an international basis x FX improved on it on kind of a quarter-to-quarter basis mostly because of revenue per room nights getting much better than they did last quarter. So I'd say on an international basis, in general, we're satisfied with our progress. In Europe, we're satisfied with our progress. Hotels.com on balance, I think, in Europe is doing better. I think Expedia's performance is okay, and it's something that we expect to get better on a go-forward basis. The Easy Manage properties, we've got around 8,000 of them. We've added around 8,000 of them year-to-date. The concentration of those properties is in secondary and tertiary markets. And in some of those markets, we are seeing ranges of 10% to 20% of our bookings being Easy Manage properties. And we think over time, as we establish those Easy Manage properties, as we move them up in the sort order and the new hotels that we're adding mature in our inventory set, we would expect that the percentage of bookings that come through Easy Manage as a percentage of our total bookings especially in secondary and tertiary markets should get higher than the levels that they are now, which is kind of a 10% to 20% level. So we think that we'll see improvement there, and we're happy with the progress. But we think we can do better.

The 21% increase in sales and marketing wasn't necessarily all keyword pricing. But it does reflect an increase in aggression on our part in the CPC space and search engine marketing in general. Both and are being very aggressive than some of the new territories that we're going into, new markets in Europe, Asia-Pacific, where we go in with more aggressive efficiencies, so to speak. So that's not necessarily keyword pricing going up. That's just our getting into new markets, which tend to be less efficient from a marketing perspective than, call it, our more mature markets where we have more repeat users, et cetera. So I think while there is some keyword pricing in there, while we are, on balance, being more aggressive in certain markets and we do anticipate being more aggressive in the European, Asia-Pacific markets, it's a combination of our getting into new markets and our being more aggressive on the keyword pricing front. As far as ROI goes, as we get into these new markets, as we increase our spend, our ROI is lower than, call it, the mainline spend that we have in place now. So my expectation will be that for a couple of quarters as we spend up, our CPC ROI will go down, and then what we do is we spend time optimizing the ROI there, understanding which keywords work, understanding which keywords don't, optimizing our landing pages, the presentation to the customer, which usually gets us some efficiency back. But right now, we're in a mode of spending up. You see it in our sales and marketing numbers but also, again, it's something that we manage and you see it in our revenue numbers and gross bookings numbers, which are quite healthy.

I would say if you look at TripAdvisor's patterns, really, TripAdvisor and Expedia-Hotel point-of-sale support each other in that as TripAdvisor gets into a new country, it has automatically launch partners with Expedia and Hotels.com, Hotwire to the extent. Well, Hotwire not internationally. But automatically, it has Expedia and Hotels.com as launch partners, which helps TripAdvisor monetize immediately and then allow TripAdvisor to spend marketing money to grow that point-of-sale, so to speak. With time, then TripAdvisor goes out and acquires domestic players to play in the TripAdvisor marketplace and to increase the marketplace. So the average number of OTAs that TripAdvisor works with typically increases as we establish a new TripAdvisor point-of-sale. So that's where you're seeing the third-party revenue growth very quickly. It's growing internationally very quickly. We're accelerating the pace of new TripAdvisor sites on an international basis, and those revenues are growing at triple-digit growth rates along with collect [ph] and a lot of that is third-party revenue after kind of anchor clients come in, which is Expedia and Hotels.com. So I think Trip runs a fair game, and they take all takers. And as long as quick growth grows as fast as it is, it is and will continue to be a perfect business for us.

And we are seeing some tightness in occupancy and ADR strength in some of the metropolitan markets where you see a lot of business travel, in the New Yorks of the world, in Hong Kong, in Singapore, in London, et cetera. So I would say all of the signs that we see are pointing upward. Now I'll note that they are against very easy comps. And I think the comps are going to get harder as the year goes on. So I wouldn't declare all systems go yet, but I think the trends are good. And I think to the extent that we have a balanced business, a good, strong domestic business, a strong international business, a strong leisure business, a corporate business that's growing very, very quickly and on top of that, a terrific, terrific media business, I think we'll benefit from all those listings, so to speak.

I think in general, if you look at major platforms that have been introduced in the e-commerce space and in travel in general, the core of the introduction of a significant platform has been the opportunity for people to save money. Originally, when we came onto the scene, Hotels.com was on the scene, we were offering merchant rates below rack rates. Then the Internet became the rack rate, so to speak. So opaque models got introduced. Priceline, the Hotwires of the world, the dynamic package business, which allow you to save money. Those were kind of, call it, a second leg of growth for the business. And I think that these flash sales, what you see going on now, these new retail concepts could be a third leg because again, they offer consumers a chance to save significant amounts. SniqueAway is kind of a toe in the water for us. It's being introduced with the Smarter Travel team inside of TripAdvisor, which is a terrific team. And we've introduced it to a small percentage of our email database, which is frankly huge database, really with inventory focused on the East Coast now. And then over the next months, we're going to expand the inventory to the south, to the west, et cetera and build the concept. Early results are very good. We're getting fan mail from our hotel partners, and consumers love it as well. So I'd say the early results are very good, but this is a long journey. It's a very new concept, and we're not ready to declare whether it's long-term, how large it's going to be or exactly what the opportunity is going to be.

Secondly, at the Choice today, Hotels, one of your favorites I guess, was talking about how it's pushing its loyalty programs because they're much more profitable, for example, than OTAs. I was wondering if you're seeing the hotel industry being better equipped to do that than they have in the past. And then could you talk about car revenues? Are fleets still tight, or is it much more that some of the companies are getting smarter at least from their standpoint in making cars available for the opaque market?

I'll try to take of each of them. As far as ITA Google goes, we've been pretty consistent in our view that, first of all, Google was a great partner of ours and we're going to be working more closely together with them on a CPC basis certainly than we ever have. So we certainly don't object to Google as a partner as they are now. We do think that it's just a bad idea to put together the dominant kind of search engine on a worldwide basis with a dominant airline search technology. We just think it squeezes out competition or has the potential of squeezing out competition in the marketplace. It's bad for advertisers. And ultimately, we think that it could be very bad for consumers. So we're a member of this coalition. We think that the coalition will certainly make its case. And we think that the case is, hopefully, will be well received by the government. In the meantime, we're going to work with Google. We're a big spender there, and on a ground level, on a tactical basis, we have a good relationship with them. We just think that this transaction is a bad idea. As far as Choice goes and loyalty programs there, we have a very good relationship with Choice. The CEO there came from Marriott, and Marriott has one of the best loyalty programs there. So it's not a surprise that they are pushing loyalty. I think it makes sense to them. I think any player out there knows that repeat customers are the most profitable customers out there. And I think to try to build out a repeat base is good business, whether you're an airline, whether you're a hotel or whether you're an OTA. And we, along with Choice, see the wisdom of this. And we've made fairly significant investments and we think differentiated investments in the OTA field, both with Hotels.com, WelcomeRewards, which is quite differentiated from what anyone else has and the new Expedia royalty program coming in next year, which I think will be quite differentiated from any other OTA out there. So we believe in loyalty, and we think that there are customers who are going to be Expedia loyal customers and Hotels loyal customers, and they are fundamentally and typically different from, call it, a Choice brand loyal customers. So I don't think that one addition to us is a subtraction to any of the brands out there like Choice. They tend to be more, call it, business customers, et cetera, where we tend to be more leisure-specific.

And I think that the big brands out there are doing what's smart, which is they have a diversified base. They advertise to bring direct players out there. They've got loyalty programs. They work with OTAs. They work with Google, and all of that helps them build out an occupancy base, which hopefully will allow them to build up ADRs. So I don't think that one, again, is exclusive over the other. I think a smart player builds a multichannel strategy and builds strength in every single channel that they have. If they're stronger with us, they will be able to build out their occupancy base inside their hotel and that will be able to drive premium ADRs in the industry, which is how you win. Again, we haven't seen any kind of negative trends, and our relationship with the brands are, frankly, terrific. As far as the Car business goes, we did see some increase in fleets kind of over the summer. The fleets have tightened up again. And I would say that, yes, the car companies in general, like the airline companies, are more disciplined on a capacity basis. Our Car business is growing nicely, and we want it to grow more. We're looking at opportunities to grow that business. But I would say in general, the Car business for us remains healthy. And in an ideal world, we'd like to see a bit more capacity, but we are seeing to date some capacity restraint, which reflects a bit more discipline on our car vendors than at least we saw two, three years ago.

So we think absolutely fantastic performance for the business, and the core business continues to grow and be as efficient as ever.

We have the investment in SniqueAway that Dara discussed earlier. We are also continuing to invest in the vacation rental space, where we think we have a pretty good opportunity to become pretty large in that space by leveraging the TripAdvisor brand, and we recently made an acquisition in that area to expand internationally. And then China, we've talked about our efforts with TripAdvisor in China fairly significantly, and we acquired a company called Kuxun, which is an air metasearch player.

First of all, the majority of, at least Expedia's, and I believe Hotel.com's traffic that comes from search to our site actually come through people searching for Expedia, for example. So in typing in Expedia in Google or so on, typing in Hotels.com in Google. So of the 25% for Expedia, for example, the majority of that traffic is someone who's already looking for Expedia, and that person is going to find Expedia one way or the other because they are searching for something very specific. Of the searches that aren't Expedia searches, so to speak, there are other searches that we compete for and other players compete for. That traffic tends to be significantly less profitable than the direct traffic, the TripAdvisor traffic, the email traffic, et cetera, that we get. So hypothetical, that minority of traffic might come down. But certainly, it would not affect our profits in the same way because that traffic tends to be much, much less profitable traffic. That is one of our most expensive channels, so to speak.

One is just an investment in opening up new points-of-sale. There's technology investment that we have to make. There's a fairly significant localization investment that we have to make as far as taking all of the content that we have, the hotel content, et cetera, and making sure that it's localized so that local customers can find the information in their own languages. There's also investments that we have to make in payments. Payments in each market differ sometimes significantly. For example, India is a big market at the Internet Bank Pay, which is a payment system that we are launching, et cetera. So as you go local, you have to make sure that you'll allow people to pay in their local market currency, so to speak. Initially, when we launch, we typically launch with variable marketing, Google, other variable marketing channels that are available in a local market. And we tend to lose money as we enter that market for the first couple of years. After we establish a presence there, we will sometimes go on with brand marketing, and I think that's the stage that you're seeing some of our points-of-sale in Asia. In Australia, we are investing in brand marketing. In Japan, some of the other points-of-sale. We are establishing a brand which increases traffic to the sites and also tends to increase our conversion number on those sites as well. That kind of brand marketing doesn't bring with it immediate returns and you have to go negative for a while before it turns positive. And I would say that that's where we are in a number of our Asian markets as far as starting the brand marketing spend and then in other markets as far as expanding the reach of our sites. The good news is that Asia, in general, for us is generally a breakeven to positive on the transactional side. With TripAdvisor, we are investing pretty aggressively in China. And then eLong, also in China, has really turned around and has accelerated its growth. So we're well established. We know the game plan there, and we're pretty confident that the investments that we're going to make in Asia are going to bring with them some pretty significant returns over the kind of two to five-year time frame. How big is it going to get is anyone's question. I think if you look at Asia five to 10 years from now, it's going to be as large as, if not larger, than the European, U.S. markets and we want to have the kind of penetrations that we have in the U.S. in Asia, and that's going to take some focus. So we're very much committed to that market.

So on Egencia, we continue to be pretty pleased with its growth, and it really is kind of across-the-board, different segments in the market, geographically dispersed as well. We are seeing much faster growth rates than we think the industry is experiencing. We grew 40-plus percent gross bookings, and AMEX, I believe, grew about 20%. And so we feel like we are taking share. The comp does start to get a little bit more difficult based upon when corporate travel started to return a bit. For us though, I think what's most positive is that we're seeing the increase in same client spending as well as a lot of the new business that we signed during the recession and then continuing on with new business today. So I think our value proposition continues to resonate very well.

So you'll start to see that kind of seasonality as the business gets bigger, and that's what you saw this quarter. But we're happy with how we're doing and clients sign-ups are great, and the team is executing nicely and we want to add to that business. As far as the M&A in Europe and the speculation regarding some of the OTA deals out there, listen, we have a lot of cash. We're going to look at all the transactions out there, and we'll decide whether we want to go forward or not. I would tell you, we're very happy with our footprint and anything that we do is going to be measured against buying back our own stock and the fact that we can grow the business through incremental investment in businesses that are already established and management teams that we have confidence in. That doesn't mean that we won't take an opportunity when we see it. We absolutely believe in scale. We've done, I think, quite well as far as return on capital on many of our M&A activities. So we're quite confident in our ability to execute there. But I think I won't comment on specifics. We're looking at deals, and we'll pull the trigger if we think a deal is going to be accretive to us over the long term. And Europe, Asia, Latin America, all of these markets are quite interesting to us.

One is to the extent that it allows us to get into the geography that we think will be very difficult for us to get into, and it's also the significant opportunity that's a big positive. So eLong, for example, in China, we didn't think we could get a position in China as strong as eLong through organic growth. And while eLong had a tough time in its first couple of years, it's really turned around behind the new management team. And I'd say we're very happy that we have a position there. So one is large geographies that we don't think we can get proper scale then through typical organic growth, that's one. The second is if there's a new piece of technology or a new product that we think is an attractive product. Example there is Venere in the agency hotel market that we wanted to penetrate in Europe. It got us in there much more quickly. We're expanding that product in Europe as well as certain other areas of the world. And then the third or just kind of our big growth areas, we love media businesses that we can add to the TripAdvisor team. We would love to add some scale to Egencia because we think that's a big and growing opportunity. So those are also opportunities that we'll certainly keep an eye on.
