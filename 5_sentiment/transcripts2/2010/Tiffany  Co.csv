Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us for a review of Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results that we reported this morning. On today's call, Mike, Jim and I will provide an analysis of those results and comment on Tiffany's",2278,"Thank you. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us for a review of Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results that we reported this morning. On today's call, Mike, Jim and I will provide an analysis of those results and comment on Tiffany's wide-ranging plans for 2010.Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor language, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.What a difference a year can make. On our conference call last March, we were experiencing the depths of the economic downturn, and we're reporting a sales decline in that fourth quarter and a drop in earnings. Against that backdrop, it's much more pleasing to be discussing the results we've achieved in our latest fourth quarter, where worldwide sales rose 17% and we posted strong earnings from continuing operations at the upper end of our expectation.For the full year, net sales declined 5%. And net earnings from continuing operations came in at $2.12 per diluted share, which was at the high end of the $2.07 to $2.12 per share outlook we provided when we reported holiday sales in January. At this time last year, our initial outlook for 2009 called for an 11% decline in worldwide sales and net earnings from continuing operations of $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share. So relative to that initial outlook, we are proud of this considerably better-than-expected performance. Let's begin by reviewing sales results.Sales in the Americas rose 14% in the fourth quarter compared with the 29% drop last year, and the growth was driven by a substantial increase in the number of transactions. U.S. store traffic in the quarter did improve from the steep declines experienced earlier in the year, but only to a level that was virtually equal to last year, indicating that there was a meaningful improvement in the customer conversion rate. We were also pleased that the U.S. sales increased in the fourth quarter, indicated growth at all price strata from silver jewelry under $500 to diamond jewelry over $50,000.Comparable U.S. store sales rose 11% in the quarter compared with a 33% decline in 2008's fourth quarter. The strong performance we had reported for the holiday season continued through January. By month, U.S. comps rose 16% in November, 10% in December and 6% in January. In last year's fourth quarter, comps had declined 39% in November, 33% in December and 23% in January.The U.S. comp growth was pretty geographically broad-based. Comparable brand stores increased 8%, with strength seen from coast-to-coast, representing quite an improvement from steep declines earlier in the year. The New York flagship store increased by 22%, also reversing declines earlier in the year as it also benefited from a higher tourist spending. In fact, sales rose 19% in the entire nine store New York region in the quarter.For the full year, the New York flagship store represented 9% of worldwide sales versus 10% in 2008. And despite a 15% sales decline in the year, generated productivity of approximately $5,500 per gross square foot. U.S. brand store comps also coincidentally declined 15% for the full year. And you may be interested to know that the five highest-volume U.S. brand stores were once again in South Coast Plaza in Orange County, California; in San Francisco; Chicago; Washington, D.C; and Beverly Hills. U.S. sales growth in the fourth quarter resulted from increases in both local customer and tourist spending. That contrasted with the sales decline in the full year, which resulted from lower sales to both local customers and tourists. In fact, for the full year, sales to non-U.S. visitors represented 15% of total U.S. store sales versus 16% in 2008 and 14% in 2007, with tourist sales not surprisingly representing higher percentages of sales in New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii and Guam.Tourism and related spending does periodically shift due to currency swings and economic factors, but most important is that we have a global store base to serve customers regardless of whether they are at home or traveling. In 2009, we opened three new U.S. stores: One in Roseville, California near Sacramento, a third store in the Seattle market and a grandly-designed store in the new Crystals at CityCenter in Las Vegas. At year-end, we operated 79 Tiffany stores in the U.S. and we're planning an increased rate of expansion in 2010.Our direct marketing sales in the U.S. also rebounded very nicely in the fourth quarter. A 16% increase in combined Internet and catalog sales versus a 20% drop last year was entirely tied to an increase in the number of orders shipped. For the year, despite economic challenges, our combined Internet and catalog sales in the U.S. declined only 1% as a modest increase in orders was offset by a slight decline in the average order size.In addition, as we had planned, we reduced catalog circulation in 2009 by about 35% to roughly 12 million catalogs, as we continued to shift some resources toward online communication. We're planning catalog circulation about flat in 2010. These combined sales represented slightly more than 10% of sales in the Americas. We expect a low double-digit percentage increase in combined U.S. e-commerce and catalog sales in 2010. Also in the Americas, we're very pleased with performance in Canada and Latin America, where we posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We opened a second store last spring in Toronto in the Yorkville area, which is having a stellar first year and is increasing our penetration of that important market. And our stores in Mexico and Brazil also performed very well in 2009, with strong local currency comp store sales growth.Our plan for 2010 calls for a low double-digit percentage sales increase in the Americas, which assumes a high single-digit increase in U.S. comparable store sales for the year. This spread by quarter will be affected to some degree by the comparison and progression of comps during 2009.Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where we enjoyed robust sales growth in practically every country except Japan. Sales in the region rose 14% in the quarter in dollars, which was entirely due to increased unit volume. On the more meaningful constant currency basis, Asia-Pacific sales rose 7% and comps rose 3%. The following comments will be on a constant exchange rate basis.Sales in Japan declined 9% in the quarter. Comp store sales also declined 9% on top of a 16% decline last year. Comps declined in November and December and were inexplicably flat in January. There was virtually no difference in performance within or outside Tokyo in the quarter, which was also true for the 11% full year comp decline.During 2009, we closed and relocated two department store boutiques in Ikebukuro and Kagoshima, and we'll continue to focus on maximizing profitability of the existing store base. We currently operate 57 Tiffany stores and boutiques in Japan.The picture looks quite different in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, where constant currency sales in the quarter rose 38% due to strong growth in every country. Comp store sales rose 24% versus a 9% drop last year. In addition, comps rose by at least 20% in all three months of the quarter.After comps declined modestly in the first quarter of 2009, we posted sequentially larger increases of 5% in the second quarter, 9% in the third quarter and 24% in the fourth quarter, which we're comparing against the opposite trend in 2008 when comps increased 22%, 13% and 4% in the first, second and third quarters and then declined 9% in the fourth quarter. In any case, we couldn't be more pleased with our strong development in Asia-Pacific and also with some excellent new-store performance. For the full year, Asia-Pacific comp store sales, excluding Japan, rose 8%. We finished the year operating 45 stores, which included the opening of six new stores during 2009: In Hangzhou and Shenzhen in mainland China, Canton Road in Hong Kong, our second store in the Melbourne market in Chadstone and stores in Busan and Seoul, Korea. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the new Canton Road store already ranked highest in sales volumes among our eight stores in Hong Kong.The total Asia-Pacific region represented 35% of worldwide sales in 2009 versus 32% in 2008. Japan was unchanged at 19%, only because of the translation effect from the strong yen, while the rest of Asia-Pacific rose to 16% of worldwide sales versus 13% in 2008. Hong Kong alone represents more than a quarter of that 16%, as it benefits from sales to local customers and to mainland Chinese visitors. And you might find it interesting that in 2009, our highest-volume single store in Asia-Pacific outside Japan was in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. Our plan for 2010 calls for a high single-digit percentage increase in total Asia-Pacific sales in dollars, which includes a low single-digit decline in Japan and at least 20% growth in the rest of the region.Europe also posted truly-excellent results in the fourth quarter, with sales up 29% in dollars mostly due to increased unit volume. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 18% due to a 14% comp increase and the results of new stores. In fact, all European countries, except Ireland and Spain, achieved double-digit comp store sales growth in the quarter.For the year, European comps rose 9%, with increases of 3%, 5%, 9% and 14% in the first through fourth quarters. In 2008, European comps by quarter were 12%, 11%, 8% and flat in the first to fourth quarters. As customer awareness of Tiffany continues to grow, Europe, like Asia, is becoming a bigger contributor to sales. Europe accounted for 12% of worldwide sales in 2009 versus 10% in 2008. Our sales in the United Kingdom, which includes nine stores and a successful E-commerce business, account for about half of our European sales. We are equally pleased with store performance in the rest of Europe, with 18 stores that span nine countries. In total, we now operate 27 stores in Europe, including three that we opened in 2009 in Selfridges department store in Manchester, in London Heathrow Terminal 3 and in Amsterdam. Our plan for 2010 calls for a mid-teens percentage increase, in dollars, in European sales.Worldwide, we opened 14 Tiffany & Co. stores and boutiques in 2009 and finished the year with 220 company-operated locations. That represented a 7% increase in the number of locations. Worldwide gross square footage rose 5% to approximately 982,000 gross square feet in 2009, including a 4% increase to 626,000 in the Americas, a 5% increase to 255,000 in Asia-Pacific and a 7% increase to 101,000 gross square feet in Europe.We continue to achieve high productivity in Tiffany & Co. stores, and it can certainly go higher, but results were affected in 2009 by economic conditions. Nonetheless, worldwide sales per gross square foot in Tiffany-operated stores, in dollars, were $2,400 in 2009 versus $2,600 in 2008. And by region, were as follows: In the Americas, we generated approximately $1,900 per gross square foot in 2009 versus $2,200; Japan was $3,300 in 2009 versus $3,400; Asia-Pacific outside Japan was unchanged at $3,800; and Europe rose to $2,700 from $2,500 in 2008.Lastly, beyond our three geographical segments is Tiffany's Other channel, which now consists mostly of rough diamond sales since we've closed the Iridesse business. We also record license revenue from our eyewear venture with Luxottica in the Other channel. Other sales increased in the fourth quarter, but declined 46% for the full year. The full year decline reflected lower wholesale sales of diamonds that did not meet our quality standards, while the increase in the fourth quarter just reflected the timing of those sales. We are planning other sales to decline about 5% in 2010.From a merchandising perspective, it's probably appropriate to call 2009 the year of the key, referring to the success of the Tiffany Keys collection. We launched it last spring, and the collection generated the highest full year sales volume in our company's history. The collection ranges from sterling silver to gold and platinum with diamonds, with price points from $150 to $35,000. Its success reflects the combination of great design and worldwide marketing support. And we believe it will be a perennial favorite among customers.Looking at the fourth quarter, we were pleased to experience sales growth across product categories and price points. We saw a recovery in high-end statement jewelry sales, which is a merchandise category that was most pressured earlier in the year. Engagement jewelry sales rose substantially in the fourth quarter, offsetting most of the declines earlier in the year. Fine jewelry collections, such as Victoria and Metro, also posted strong growth in the quarter. The fashion gold and silver jewelry categories rose strongly in the fourth quarter, and rose for the year as well, representing the success of Keys, along with growth in our famous Return to Tiffany, Notes and Charms collections, which all grew in the quarter. And the designer jewelry category, which includes the designs of Frank Gehry, Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso and Joan Schlumberger, rose modestly in the quarter. So you can get a sense that our geographically broad sales growth in the fourth quarter also span many jewelry categories. And I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

Good morning to everyone. We think you will agree that Tiffany's top line performance was quite good in 2009, considering the economic headwinds we faced, and certainly better than what we expected at the s",1391,"Thanks, Mark, for that informative sales review. Good morning to everyone. We think you will agree that Tiffany's top line performance was quite good in 2009, considering the economic headwinds we faced, and certainly better than what we expected at the start of 2009. Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin at 58.7% in the fourth quarter was seven tenths of a point below the 59.4% last year, with the decrease due to the increased wholesale sales of diamonds, which are a minimal, if any, margin. For the full year, gross margin of 56.5% was 1.3 points lower than the 57.8% in 2008 due to the effect of higher product costs through most of the year. We've been dealing with volatile swings in precious metals and diamond prices over the past two years. Prices have generally moved higher since mid-2009. Considering our rate of inventory turnover, which spans about a year, the effect on Tiffany's gross margin lags cost changes. While margin was pressured in most of 2009 from higher input costs in 2008, we expect to benefit in 2010 from the lower input costs at this time last year, and are planning gross margin up at least a full point for the year.Looking at SG&A expenses, we entered 2009 by making some meaningful expense reductions. And Tiffany's entire organization demonstrated excellent and prudent expense discipline throughout the year.  SG&A expenses increased 7% in the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding non-recurring items recorded last year, SG&A expenses increased 12% over last year, and this was largely due to management incentive compensation recorded this year. Such compensation was curtailed last year for obvious reasons tied to financial performance. In addition, sales growth in the quarter triggered higher variable cost tied to store rents and sales commissions. For the full year, SG&A expenses declined 6%. We reduced Tiffany staff count by 10%, or about 900 people at the beginning of 2009, which generated annual savings in SG&A expenses and cost of sales in the area of $60 million. A portion of the staff reductions, especially in our stores, will eventually need to be restored to maintain excellent customer service levels as store traffic increases. But a meaningful number of other positions were permanently eliminated and will contribute to improved operating leverage.We also reduced  marketing spending by approximately $44 million over the course of 2009, and a percentage to sales declined modestly. In addition, variable costs tied to sales declined in the first two quarters of the year, and then increased in the fourth quarter as sales rebounded.  We expect SG&A expenses to increase approximately 10% in 2010, partly due to a new stores and increased labor costs. This also includes an increase in marketing spending in 2010 at a rate in excess of sales growth to support our pursuit of market share opportunities. All in all, we expect some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio to sales.Tiffany's operating margin was 16.3% in 2009, which we think was commendable performance especially considering the challenging environment. The expected improvements in gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio should result in a good increase in 2010. And as we've said before, we believe there is no structural reason in the future to prevent Tiffany from achieving higher operating margins. Other expenses of $15 million in the quarter and $51 million in the year were above last year's levels due to the higher interest expense tied to higher long-term debt levels. Conversely, our substantial cash balance is currently not earning much interest income due to low rates. We expect other expenses net to be virtually unchanged at approximately $50 million in 2010.Tiffany's effective income tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarter versus 40% last year. The rate for the full year came in at an expected 32% versus 37% in 2008, due to $11 million of favorable tax reserve adjustments recorded earlier in the year. We are currently expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 35% for 2010.Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $1.09 in the fourth quarter and $2.12 in the full year. Please note that the full year earnings included a net benefit of $0.08 per share from various non-recurring items earlier in the year, which would put adjusted EPS, excluding those items, at $2.04 per share. In 2008, Tiffany's net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.25 in the quarter and $1.74 in the year. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations that excluded non-recurring items were $0.86 in the quarter and $2.39 in the year.Based on our objective that calls for 11% worldwide sales growth and the other financial assumptions we've mentioned, our outlook for 2010 calls for net earnings of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share. That compares with adjusted EPS of $2.04 in 2009 when excluding non-recurring items, representing expected growth of 20% to 23% in 2010. Although we do not provide outlooks by quarter, I encourage you to consider excluding non-recurring items from last year's earnings when you forecast quarterly earnings in 2010. You can find a list of the items in the non-GAAP schedule in today's news release.For 2009, Tiffany's return on average stockholders' equity was 15%, and the return on average assets was 8%. We remain committed to our long-term objectives to achieve at least a 15% ROE and at least a 10% ROA. Tiffany finished fiscal 2009 with a very strong balance sheet, which we believe is and will continue to be an important competitive advantage for us. Accounts receivable declined 3% in 2009. The quality of receivables remains very high, and receivables continue to turn at a high 18x per year.We were also very pleased with inventory performance in 2009. Our initial outlook for the year called for a single digit percentage decline. The actual decline came in at 11%, which was greater than we expected due to the stronger-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter. Despite that, we have maintained good in-store availability and are replenishing any gaps in assortment. In addition, we had reduced internal manufacturing early in 2009, but have since ramped up production to meet growing demand. We are planning for a high single-digit percentage increase in inventories in 2010, to support the opening of new stores resulting in an improved rate of inventory turnover, which is consistent with our long-term financial objectives.Capital expenditures of $75 million was 3% of net sales in the full year and was below our normal target of 6% to 7% of sales, due to fewer store openings and generally constrained spending throughout the company. We expect to return to a more normal level of CapEx as a percentage of sales in 2010, which will equate to approximately $200 million of capital expenditures.We began the year expecting to generate at least $400 million of free cash flow. But the combination of stronger-than-expected earnings and lower-than-expected inventories contributed ultimately, generating more than $600 million in 2009. We finished 2009 with our cash position actually exceeding the level of our total short-term and long-term debt. At January 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were $786 million versus $160 million in the prior year, while short-term and long-term debt totaled $754 million versus $709 million last year. And stockholders' equity was $1.88 billion at the end of the year versus $1.59 billion last year.Early in 2009, when global financial conditions looked pretty bleak, we took advantage of capital availability and secured $300 million of long-term debt. A portion was used to repay some outstanding debt that was maturing. We have some other long-term debt that will mature later in 2010 and are evaluating our options with respect to refinancing some or all of that debt.In any scenario, Tiffany enjoys an enviable liquidity position, and we expect to fund our expansion in 2010 with internally generated cash flow. In fact, Tiffany's Board of Directors demonstrated its confidence two months ago when they approved resuming share repurchases and increasing the quarterly dividend rate by 18%. Lastly, I'm pleased to say that our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities are effectively supporting our global operations, and make us well positioned to expand our worldwide business and achieve meaningfully higher levels of sales and earnings in the coming years. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike."

I'm very proud of the result we showed at every level of our organization to weather the economic storm we faced in 2009. We planned our business cautiously last year by reducing headcount and other expenses. We also closed our IRIDESSE business. However, we were not completely in a defensive mode. We took advantage of new store opportunities, although at a somewhat moderated rate. We introduced exciting and successful new products, we maintained an adequate level of marketing communications and we managed our inventories very well. As the year progressed, better-than-expected sales and inventory performance combined with disciplined spending enabled us to generate stronger-than-expected earnings and cash flow.For much of the year, the luxury industry and especially the jewelry sector, felt the severe impact from reduced consumer spending. Simultaneously, some jewelers lacked both the financial resources and the brand capital [ph] (46:35) to survive in the downturn. Many turned to aggressive discounting while others liquidated. It also now appears that media reports from a year ago predicting the demise of luxury and full-priced spending were most certainly exaggerated. Our research confirmed that many consumers were simply waiting for improvements in their personal incomes and their balance sheets prior to resuming spending.People are still celebrating and commemorating life's important occasions. And we believe they are increasingly seeking products and brands that represent genuine luxury and lasting value. They still desire beautiful designs of high quality. They appreciate and expect a superior shopping experience. This is everything that Tiffany represents and consistently delivers. While the current economic environment is still fraught with challenge, there are important opportunities for us to pursue. Our plans for 2010 include expanding our store base, introducing new products and marketing aggressively, in order to gain share of this competitively fragmented jewelry market. Our current plan calls for opening 17 new stores in 2010, including six in the Americas, eight in Asia-Pacific and three in Europe. This equates to an 8% gross increase in the number of locations and a 5% increase in gross square footage.In the Americas, we finalized leases for new stores in Baltimore in Towson Center, in Jacksonville in St. Johns Town Center, in Los Angeles at Santa Monica Place, and in Houston at The Woodlands, two additional stores are planned. Most of you know that over the past year, we have been testing a 2,500 square-foot store concept in the United States, that contains an edited selection of merchandise along with other enhancements in visual merchandising and selling style. Customer reaction has been quite good, and we've gained meaningful insight from it. At the same time, we have continued to open full line 5,000 square-foot stores. We now believe it is appropriate to combine the best attributes of both formats into a new but smaller-sized full line store. As a result, the five U.S. stores we plan to open in 2010 will offer a relatively full range of products and will average about 3,700 square feet each. We continue to believe that the U.S. market can support 150 stores and believe we have now settled on the right size format for future stores.In the Asia-Pacific region, our plans call for eight new stores, including among others, opening our fourth store in Singapore in the new shops at Marina Bay Sands, as well as another store in Shanghai in the Hong Kong Plaza. And in Europe, our plans call for adding three new stores, including one at Canary Wharf in London. E-commerce has proven to be very successful and an efficient complement to our retail stores in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, Japan and Australia. In fact, our total Internet sales in those 5 countries accounted for approximately 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales in 2009. I'm pleased to say that we will further expand Tiffany's Internet reach this year when we launch e-commerce in Continental Europe scheduled for midyear.In merchandising, we will continue to introduce new designs in a wide range of materials and price points. We're enthusiastic about a new collection of jewelry focused on yellow diamonds that will launch this spring. Of course, there will also be other new jewelry designs introduced in both silver and gold. We are in the early stages of growing our Watch business with new designs, distribution and marketing, and I believe that the potential exists for solid long-term growth.And we will move forward with a wonderful new collection of leather handbags and accessories that have been designed by Richard Lamberton and John Truex. It will debut this year with distribution limited to a small number of our U.S. stores, as well as tiffany.com. Our company has become increasingly global over the years. And with it, we have built a strong management team around the world. The organization continues to evolve towards greater decision-making in each region, especially as it relates to in-store product assortment, inventory management and advertising spending. Local managements ultimately know their market best. And we expect improved decision-making and accountability at that level to generate meaningful increases in sales and market share. Clearly, corporate management in New York will continue to establish and control company-wide strategic and operational decision-making, and provide all necessary support to the global organization.Concluding my remarks, the global economy still has its challenges and we've considered it in formulating our 2010 plans and financial outlook. We plan for reasonably strong sales growth, factoring in comparisons to the steep declines in the first half of 2009. We think we've also made reasonable margin assumptions, and we will continue to demonstrate expense discipline. In terms of the current environment, we are now a little more than halfway through our first quarter and are pleased that worldwide sales growth is exceeding our first quarter plan, which calls for a high-teens percentage increase.It may go without saying but let me reiterate once again, that we do take a long-term approach to managing and growing Tiffany's business. Our company's reputation is built on product and brand integrity, and investors and customers can be assured that we will never compromise on those values and our strengths. Tiffany has the critical components necessary for continued success, organizational and financial strength, and a premium brand that is increasingly recognized around the world for genuine luxury and lasting value. Please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on May 27. That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions you have, and thank you very much for joining us this morning."

Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us for a review of Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results that we reported this morning. On today's call, Mike, Jim and I will provide an analysis of those results and comment on Tiffany's wide-ranging plans for 2010.Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor language, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.What a difference a year can make. On our conference call last March, we were experiencing the depths of the economic downturn, and we're reporting a sales decline in that fourth quarter and a drop in earnings. Against that backdrop, it's much more pleasing to be discussing the results we've achieved in our latest fourth quarter, where worldwide sales rose 17% and we posted strong earnings from continuing operations at the upper end of our expectation.For the full year, net sales declined 5%. And net earnings from continuing operations came in at $2.12 per diluted share, which was at the high end of the $2.07 to $2.12 per share outlook we provided when we reported holiday sales in January. At this time last year, our initial outlook for 2009 called for an 11% decline in worldwide sales and net earnings from continuing operations of $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share. So relative to that initial outlook, we are proud of this considerably better-than-expected performance. Let's begin by reviewing sales results.Sales in the Americas rose 14% in the fourth quarter compared with the 29% drop last year, and the growth was driven by a substantial increase in the number of transactions. U.S. store traffic in the quarter did improve from the steep declines experienced earlier in the year, but only to a level that was virtually equal to last year, indicating that there was a meaningful improvement in the customer conversion rate. We were also pleased that the U.S. sales increased in the fourth quarter, indicated growth at all price strata from silver jewelry under $500 to diamond jewelry over $50,000.Comparable U.S. store sales rose 11% in the quarter compared with a 33% decline in 2008's fourth quarter. The strong performance we had reported for the holiday season continued through January. By month, U.S. comps rose 16% in November, 10% in December and 6% in January. In last year's fourth quarter, comps had declined 39% in November, 33% in December and 23% in January.The U.S. comp growth was pretty geographically broad-based. Comparable brand stores increased 8%, with strength seen from coast-to-coast, representing quite an improvement from steep declines earlier in the year. The New York flagship store increased by 22%, also reversing declines earlier in the year as it also benefited from a higher tourist spending. In fact, sales rose 19% in the entire nine store New York region in the quarter.For the full year, the New York flagship store represented 9% of worldwide sales versus 10% in 2008. And despite a 15% sales decline in the year, generated productivity of approximately $5,500 per gross square foot. U.S. brand store comps also coincidentally declined 15% for the full year. And you may be interested to know that the five highest-volume U.S. brand stores were once again in South Coast Plaza in Orange County, California; in San Francisco; Chicago; Washington, D.C; and Beverly Hills. U.S. sales growth in the fourth quarter resulted from increases in both local customer and tourist spending. That contrasted with the sales decline in the full year, which resulted from lower sales to both local customers and tourists. In fact, for the full year, sales to non-U.S. visitors represented 15% of total U.S. store sales versus 16% in 2008 and 14% in 2007, with tourist sales not surprisingly representing higher percentages of sales in New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii and Guam.Tourism and related spending does periodically shift due to currency swings and economic factors, but most important is that we have a global store base to serve customers regardless of whether they are at home or traveling. In 2009, we opened three new U.S. stores: One in Roseville, California near Sacramento, a third store in the Seattle market and a grandly-designed store in the new Crystals at CityCenter in Las Vegas. At year end, we operated 79 Tiffany stores in the U.S. and we're planning an increased rate of expansion in 2010.Our direct marketing sales in the U.S. also rebounded very nicely in the fourth quarter. A 16% increase in combined Internet and catalog sales versus a 20% drop last year was entirely tied to an increase in the number of orders shipped. For the year, despite economic challenges, our combined Internet and catalog sales in the U.S. declined only 1% as a modest increase in orders was offset by a slight decline in the average order size.In addition, as we had planned, we reduced catalog circulation in 2009 by about 35% to roughly 12 million catalogs, as we continued to shift some resources toward online communication. We're planning catalog circulation about flat in 2010. These combined sales represented slightly more than 10% of sales in the Americas. We expect a low double-digit percentage increase in combined U.S. e-commerce and catalog sales in 2010. Also, in the Americas, we're very pleased with performance in Canada and Latin America, where we posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We opened a second store last spring in Toronto in the Yorkdale area, which is having a stellar first year and is increasing our penetration of that important market. And our stores in Mexico and Brazil also performed very well in 2009, with strong local currency comp store sales growth.Our plan for 2010 calls for a low double-digit percentage sales increase in the Americas, which assumes a high single-digit increase in U.S. comparable store sales for the year. The spread by quarter will be affected to some degree by the comparison and progression of comps during 2009.Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where we enjoyed robust sales growth in practically every country except Japan. Sales in the region rose 14% in the quarter in dollars, which was entirely due to increased unit volume. On the more meaningful constant currency basis, Asia-Pacific sales rose 7% and comps rose 3%. The following comments will be on a constant exchange rate basis.Sales in Japan declined 9% in the quarter. Comp store sales also declined 9% on top of the 16% decline last year. Comps declined in November and December and were inexplicably flat in January. There was virtually no difference in performance within or outside Tokyo in the quarter, which was also true for the 11% full year comp decline.During 2009, we closed and relocated two department store boutiques in Ikebukuro and Kagoshima, and we'll continue to focus on maximizing profitability of the existing store base. We currently operate 57 Tiffany stores and boutiques in Japan.The picture looks quite different in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, where constant currency sales in the quarter rose 38% due to strong growth in every country. Comp store sales rose 24% versus a 9% drop last year. In addition, comps rose by at least 20% in all three months of the quarter.After comps declined modestly in the first quarter of 2009, we posted sequentially larger increases of 5% in the second quarter, 9% in the third quarter and 24% in the fourth quarter, which we're comparing against the opposite trend in 2008 when comps increased 22%, 13% and 4% in the first, second and third quarters and then declined 9% in the fourth quarter. In any case, we couldn't be more pleased with our strong development in Asia-Pacific and also with some excellent new store performance. For the full year, Asia-Pacific comp store sales, excluding Japan, rose 8%. We finished the year operating 45 stores, which included the opening of six new stores during 2009: In Hangzhou and Shenzhen in mainland China, Canton Road in Hong Kong, our second store in the Melbourne market in Chadstone and stores in Busan and Seoul, Korea. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the new Canton Road store already ranked highest in sales volume among our eight stores in Hong Kong.The total Asia-Pacific region represented 35% of worldwide sales in 2009 versus 32% in 2008. Japan was unchanged at 19%, only because of the translation effect from the strong yen, while the rest of Asia-Pacific rose to 16% of worldwide sales versus 13% in 2008. Hong Kong alone represents more than a quarter of that 16%, as it benefits from sales to local customers and to mainland Chinese visitors. And you might find it interesting that in 2009, our highest-volume single store in Asia-Pacific outside Japan was in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. Our plan for 2010 calls for a high single-digit percentage increase in total Asia-Pacific sales in dollars, which includes a low single-digit decline in Japan and at least 20% growth in the rest of the region.Europe also posted truly excellent results in the fourth quarter, with sales up 29% in dollars mostly due to increased unit volume. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 18% due to a 14% comp increase and the results of new stores. In fact, all European countries, except Ireland and Spain, achieved double-digit comp store sales growth in the quarter.For the year, European comps rose 9%, with increases of 3%, 5%, 9% and 14% in the first through fourth quarters. In 2008, European comps by quarter were 12%, 11%, 8% and flat in the first to fourth quarters. As customer awareness of Tiffany continues to grow, Europe, like Asia, is becoming a bigger contributor to sales. Europe accounted for 12% of worldwide sales in 2009 versus 10% in 2008. Our sales in the United Kingdom, which includes nine stores and a successful E-commerce business, account for about half of our European sales. We are equally pleased with store performance in the rest of Europe, with 18 stores that span nine countries. In total, we now operate 27 stores in Europe, including three that we opened in 2009 in Selfridges department store in Manchester, in London Heathrow's Terminal 3 and in Amsterdam. Our plan for 2010 calls for a mid-teens percentage increase, in dollars, in European sales.Worldwide, we opened 14 Tiffany & Co. stores and boutiques in 2009 and finished the year with 220 company-operated locations. That represented a 7% increase in the number of locations. Worldwide gross square footage rose 5% to approximately 982,000 gross square feet in 2009, including a 4% increase to 626,000 in the Americas, a 5% increase to 255,000 in Asia-Pacific and a 7% increase to 101,000 gross square feet in Europe.We continue to achieve high productivity in Tiffany & Co. stores, and it can certainly go higher, but results were affected in 2009 by economic conditions. Nonetheless, worldwide sales per gross square foot in Tiffany-operated stores, in dollars, were $2,400 in 2009 versus $2,600 in 2008. And by region, were as follows: In the Americas, we generated approximately $1,900 per gross square foot in 2009 versus $2,200; Japan was $3,300 in 2009 versus $3,400; Asia-Pacific outside Japan was unchanged at $3,800; and Europe rose to $2,700 from $2,500 in 2008.Lastly, beyond our three geographical segments is Tiffany's Other channel, which now consists mostly of rough diamond sales since we've closed the Iridesse business. We also record license revenue from our eyewear venture with Luxottica in the Other channel. Other sales increased in the fourth quarter, but declined 46% for the full year. The full year decline reflected lower wholesale sales of diamonds that did not meet our quality standards, while the increase in the fourth quarter just reflected the timing of those sales. We are planning other sales to decline about 5% in 2010.From a merchandising perspective, it's probably appropriate to call 2009 the year of the key, referring to the success of the Tiffany Keys collection. We launched it last spring, and the collection generated the highest full year sales volume in our company's history. The collection ranges from sterling silver to gold and platinum with diamonds, with price points from $150 to $35,000. Its success reflects the combination of great design and worldwide marketing support. And we believe it will be a perennial favorite among customers.Looking at the fourth quarter, we were pleased to experience sales growth across product categories and price points. We saw a recovery in high-end statement jewelry sales, which is a merchandise category that was most pressured earlier in the year. Engagement jewelry sales rose substantially in the fourth quarter, offsetting most of the declines earlier in the year. Fine jewelry collections, such as Victoria and Metro, also posted strong growth in the quarter. The fashion gold and silver jewelry categories rose strongly in the fourth quarter, and rose for the year as well, representing the success of Keys, along with growth in our famous Return to Tiffany, Notes and Charms collections, which all grew in the quarter. And the designer jewelry category, which includes the designs of Frank Gehry, Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso and Joan Schlumberger, rose modestly in the quarter. So you can get a sense that our geographically broad sales growth in the fourth quarter also span many jewelry categories. And I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

Good morning to everyone.

Good morning to everyone. We think you will agree that Tiffany's top line performance was quite good in 2009, considering the economic headwinds we faced, and certainly better than what we expected at the start of 2009. Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin at 58.7% in the fourth quarter was seven tenths of a point below the 59.4% last year, with the decrease due to the increased wholesale sales of diamonds, which are a minimal, if any, margin. For the full year, gross margin of 56.5% was 1.3 points lower than the 57.8% in 2008 due to the effect of higher product costs through most of the year. We've been dealing with volatile swings in precious metals and diamond prices over the past two years. Prices have generally moved higher since mid-2009. Considering our rate of inventory turnover, which spans about a year, the effect on Tiffany's gross margin lags cost changes. While margin was pressured in most of 2009 from higher input costs in 2008, we expect to benefit in 2010 from the lower input costs at this time last year, and are planning gross margin up at least a full point for the year.Looking at SG&A expenses, we entered 2009 by making some meaningful expense reductions. And Tiffany's entire organization demonstrated excellent and prudent expense discipline throughout the year.  SG&A expenses increased 7% in the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding non-recurring items recorded last year, SG&A expenses increased 12% over last year, and this was largely due to management incentive compensation recorded this year. Such compensation was curtailed last year for obvious reasons tied to financial performance. In addition, sales growth in the quarter triggered higher variable cost tied to store rents and sales commissions. For the full year, SG&A expenses declined 6%. We reduced Tiffany staff count by 10%, or about 900 people at the beginning of 2009, which generated annual savings in SG&A expenses and cost of sales in the area of $60 million. A portion of the staff reductions, especially in our stores, will eventually need to be restored to maintain excellent customer service levels as store traffic increases. But a meaningful number of other positions were permanently eliminated and will contribute to improved operating leverage.We also reduced marketing spending by approximately $44 million over the course of 2009, and a percentage to sales declined modestly. In addition, variable costs tied to sales declined in the first two quarters of the year, and then increased in the fourth quarter as sales rebounded. We expect SG&A expenses to increase approximately 10% in 2010, partly due to a new stores and increased labor costs. This also includes an increase in marketing spending in 2010 at a rate in excess of sales growth to support our pursuit of market share opportunities. All in all, we expect some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio to sales.Tiffany's operating margin was 16.3% in 2009, which we think was commendable performance especially considering the challenging environment. The expected improvements in gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio should result in a good increase in 2010. And as we've said before, we believe there is no structural reason in the future to prevent Tiffany from achieving higher operating margins. Other expenses of $15 million in the quarter and $51 million in the year were above last year's levels due to the higher interest expense tied to higher long-term debt levels. Conversely, our substantial cash balance is currently not earning much interest income due to low rates. We expect other expenses net to be virtually unchanged at approximately $50 million in 2010.Tiffany's effective income tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarter versus 40% last year. The rate for the full year came in at an expected 32% versus 37% in 2008, due to $11 million of favorable tax reserve adjustments recorded earlier in the year. We are currently expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 35% for 2010.Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $1.09 in the fourth quarter and $2.12 in the full year. Please note that the full year earnings included a net benefit of $0.08 per share from various non-recurring items earlier in the year, which would put adjusted EPS, excluding those items, at $2.04 per share. In 2008, Tiffany's net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.25 in the quarter and $1.74 in the year. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations that excluded non-recurring items were $0.86 in the quarter and $2.39 in the year.Based on our objective that calls for 11% worldwide sales growth and the other financial assumptions we've mentioned, our outlook for 2010 calls for net earnings of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share. That compares with adjusted EPS of $2.04 in 2009 when excluding non-recurring items, representing expected growth of 20% to 23% in 2010. Although we do not provide outlooks by quarter, I encourage you to consider excluding non-recurring items from last year's earnings when you forecast quarterly earnings in 2010. You can find a list of the items in the non-GAAP schedule in today's news release.For 2009, Tiffany's return on average stockholders' equity was 15%, and the return on average assets was 8%. We remain committed to our long-term objectives to achieve at least a 15% ROE and at least a 10% ROA. Tiffany finished fiscal 2009 with a very strong balance sheet, which we believe is and will continue to be an important competitive advantage for us. Accounts receivable declined 3% in 2009. The quality of receivables remains very high, and receivables continue to turn at a high 18x per year.We were also very pleased with inventory performance in 2009. Our initial outlook for the year called for a single-digit percentage decline. The actual decline came in at 11%, which was greater than we expected due to the stronger-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter. Despite that, we have maintained good in-store availability and are replenishing any gaps in assortment. In addition, we had reduced internal manufacturing early in 2009, but have since ramped up production to meet growing demand. We are planning for a high single-digit percentage increase in inventories in 2010, to support the opening of new stores resulting in an improved rate of inventory turnover, which is consistent with our long-term financial objectives.Capital expenditures of $75 million was 3% of net sales in the full year and was below our normal target of 6% to 7% of sales, due to fewer store openings and generally constrained spending throughout the company. We expect to return to a more normal level of CapEx as a percentage of sales in 2010, which will equate to approximately $200 million of capital expenditures.We began the year expecting to generate at least $400 million of free cash flow. But the combination of stronger-than-expected earnings and lower-than-expected inventories contributed ultimately, generating more than $600 million in 2009. We finished 2009 with our cash position actually exceeding the level of our total short-term and long-term debt. At January 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were $786 million versus $160 million in the prior year, while short-term and long-term debt totaled $754 million versus $709 million last year. And stockholders' equity was $1.88 billion at the end of the year versus $1.59 billion last year.Early in 2009, when global financial conditions looked pretty bleak, we took advantage of capital availability and secured $300 million of long-term debt. A portion was used to repay some outstanding debt that was maturing. We have some other long-term debt that will mature later in 2010 and are evaluating our options with respect to refinancing some or all of that debt.In any scenario, Tiffany enjoys an enviable liquidity position, and we expect to fund our expansion in 2010 with internally generated cash flow. In fact, Tiffany's Board of Directors demonstrated its confidence two months ago when they approved resuming share repurchases and increasing the quarterly dividend rate by 18%. Lastly, I'm pleased to say that our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities are effectively supporting our global operations, and make us well-positioned to expand our worldwide business and achieve meaningfully higher levels of sales and earnings in the coming years. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike."

I'm very proud of the result we showed at every level of our organization to weather the economic storm we faced in 2009. We planned our business cautiously last year by reducing headcount and other expenses. We also closed our IRIDESSE business. However, we were not completely in a defensive mode. We took advantage of new store opportunities, although at a somewhat moderated rate. We introduced exciting and successful new products, we maintained an adequate level of marketing communications and we managed our inventories very well. As the year progressed, better-than-expected sales and inventory performance combined with disciplined spending enabled us to generate stronger-than-expected earnings and cash flow.For much of the year, the luxury industry and especially the jewelry sector, felt the severe impact from reduced consumer spending. Simultaneously, some jewelers lacked both the financial resources and the brand capital [ph] to survive in the downturn. Many turned to aggressive discounting while others liquidated. It also now appears that media reports from a year ago predicting the demise of luxury and full-priced spending were most certainly exaggerated. Our research confirm that many consumers were simply waiting for improvements in their personal incomes and their balance sheets prior to resuming spending.People are still celebrating and commemorating life's important occasions. And we believe they are increasingly seeking products and brands that represent genuine luxury and lasting value. They still desire beautiful designs of high quality. They appreciate and expect a superior shopping experience. This is everything that Tiffany represents and consistently delivers. While the current economic environment is still fraught with challenge, there are important opportunities for us to pursue. Our plans for 2010 include expanding our store base, introducing new products and marketing aggressively in order to gain share of this competitively fragmented jewelry market. Our current plan calls for opening 17 new stores in 2010, including six in the Americas, eight in Asia-Pacific and three in Europe. This equates to an 8% gross increase in the number of locations and a 5% increase in gross square footage.In the Americas, we finalized leases for new stores in Baltimore in Towson Center, in Jacksonville in St. Johns Town Center, in Los Angeles at Santa Monica Place, and in Houston at The Woodlands. Two additional stores are planned. Most of you know that over the past year, we have been testing a 2,500 square-foot store concept in the United States, that contains an edited selection of merchandise along with other enhancements in visual merchandising and selling style. Customer reaction has been quite good, and we've gained meaningful insight from it. At the same time, we have continued to open full-line 5,000 square-foot stores. We now believe it is appropriate to combine the best attributes of both formats into a new but smaller-sized full-line store. As a result, the five U.S. stores we plan to open in 2010 will offer a relatively full range of products and will average about 3,700 square feet each. We continue to believe that the U.S. market can support 150 stores and believe we have now settled on the right size format for future stores.In the Asia-Pacific region, our plans call for eight new stores, including among others, opening our fourth store in Singapore in the new shops at Marina Bay Sands, as well as another store in Shanghai in the Hong Kong Plaza. And in Europe, our plans call for adding three new stores, including one at Canary Wharf in London. E-commerce has proven to be very successful and an efficient complement to our retail stores in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, Japan and Australia. In fact, our total Internet sales in those 5 countries accounted for approximately 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales in 2009. I'm pleased to say that we will further expand Tiffany's Internet reach this year when we launch e-commerce in Continental Europe scheduled for midyear.In merchandising, we will continue to introduce new designs in a wide range of materials and price points. We're enthusiastic about a new collection of jewelry focused on yellow diamonds that we'll launch this spring. Of course, there will also be other new jewelry designs introduced in both silver and gold. We are in the early stages of growing our Watch business with new designs, distribution and marketing, and I believe that the potential exists for solid long-term growth.And we will move forward with a wonderful new collection of leather handbags and accessories that have been designed by Richard Lamberton and John Truex. It will debut this year with distribution limited to a small number of our U.S. stores, as well as tiffany.com. Our company has become increasingly global over the years. And with it, we have built a strong management team around the world. The organization continues to evolve towards greater decision-making in each region, especially as it relates to in-store product assortment, inventory management and advertising spending. Local managements ultimately know their market best. And we expect improved decision-making and accountability at that level to generate meaningful increases in sales and market share. Clearly, corporate management in New York will continue to establish and control company-wide strategic and operational decision-making, and provide all necessary support to the global organization.Concluding my remarks, the global economy still has its challenges and we've considered it in formulating our 2010 plans and financial outlook. We plan for reasonably strong sales growth, factoring in comparisons to the steep declines in the first half of 2009. We think we've also made reasonable margin assumptions, and we will continue to demonstrate expense discipline. In terms of the current environment, we are now a little more than halfway through our first quarter and are pleased that worldwide sales growth is exceeding our first quarter plan, which calls for a high-teens percentage increase.It may go without saying but let me reiterate once again, that we do take a long-term approach to managing and growing Tiffany's business. Our company's reputation is built on product and brand integrity, and investors and customers can be assured that we will never compromise on those values and our strengths. Tiffany has the critical components necessary for continued success, organizational and financial strength, and a premium brand that is increasingly recognized around the world for genuine luxury and lasting value. Please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on May 27. That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions you have, and thank you very much for joining us this morning."

Now we can proceed. We're pleased to say that the improved sales and earnings performance we observed in the latter part of 2009 has continued into 2010, and in the first quarter, surpassed our expectations. And we were also pleased that the growth was generally broad-based geographically and by price point, although we attribute much of this strong improvement to comparisons to the troughs of a year ago.
Before reviewing sales by region, you should note in today's news release that we are now expanding our disclosure by geographical segment to align external reporting with changes in our organizational structure and greater decision-making and accountability at the regional level. One revision is to report Japan separately from Asia-Pacific. Also, results for certain emerging markets, such as Russia and the Middle East, where we sell to distributors for their resale in those markets, have moved out of Asia-Pacific and Europe and into the Other segment. We’ve posted prior year sales on our website under the headings Financial Information and Reportable Segments. Prior-year operating earnings by segment will be reported in our 10-Q reports as we move through the year. 
Having noted that, Tiffany's worldwide sales rose 22% in the first quarter after declining 22% in last year's first quarter. Let's now look at sales by segment.
Sales in the Americas increased 22% in the first quarter, which was better than we expected and compared with a 31% decline last year. The 22% increase was generated by increased transactions in all major product categories and an increase in the average transaction size. Traffic and conversion rose too. In terms of price stratification, we continued to see growth in sales and transactions across the range of price strata, from silver jewelry to diamond jewelry, with the largest percentage increases in jewelry above $50,000. Of course, high-end statement jewelry was the most depressed category a year ago.
We are now reporting comparable store sales for the entire Americas as opposed to just the U.S., although the U.S. is the largest driver of the segment, representing 91% of sales in this segment in 2009. On a constant exchange rate basis, America's sales increased 20% and comps rose 15% versus a comp decline of 32% last year.
In terms of the monthly trend, Americas comps rose 18% in February, 21% in March and 7% in April. This contrasted with respective monthly comp declines of 32%, 36% and 29% in the Americas last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 26% in the quarter versus a 42% decline last year, while comparable Americas brand store sales rose 13% versus a 30% decline last year.
The comp store sales growth was pretty broad-based in the U.S. although we did note softness in our Southwest region, as well as in Hawaii. Stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted strong increases in the quarter. In terms of customer mix, more than half of the comp growth was generated by increased spending by domestic customers, with a smaller contribution from foreign tourists. We believe sales in April were adversely affected by the Icelandic volcano, which reduced foreign tourist travel to New York and some other markets too. We expect that much of that travel will eventually be rescheduled, so the spending may just be temporarily deferred.
Direct marketing sales in the Americas also performed well in the first quarter, with combined Internet and catalog sales posting a 23% increase that was better than we expected and which compared with a 17% sales decline last year. The 23% increase was largely due to more orders shipped. But we also saw an increased average order size. Now let's look at Japan, where total sales declined 2% due to a small decline in both units and in the average price per unit sold. The yen averaged 91 to $1 in the first quarter versus 96 last year. Our full year plan is based on a rate of 95. On a constant exchange rate basis, excluding the effect of the stronger yen, total sales in Japan declined 7% in the quarter and comps declined 10%, which was below our expectations and was on top of a 13% comp decline in last year's first quarter. Comps declined in all three months with no discernible pattern. There was no meaningful difference in comp declines within or outside Tokyo and the retail environment remains challenging. Our objective in Japan is to maximize profitability there.
The picture is much brighter in the Asia-Pacific region, where sales growth was generally strong in most markets. Total sales increased 50% in the first quarter due to a substantial increase in unit volume, as well as an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, increases of 37% in total sales and 21% in comparable store sales exceeded our expectations. Comps had declined 5% in last year's first quarter but since then have improved steadily and we posted double digit growth in every month of this first quarter. During the quarter, we expanded Tiffany's presence in China with the opening of an additional store in Shanghai, a substantial 6,400 square-foot store in the Hong Kong Plaza. And just earlier this month, we also opened a 3,100 square-foot store in the IFC mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai. We now operate 12 stores in mainland China and are on track to have approximately 30 stores there within about five years.
We were also pleased with performance in Europe in the quarter, where total sales rose 25%, largely due to increased unit volume. In constant currencies, total sales rose 19% and comps increased 14%. This was better than we expected and was on top of a 3% comp increase last year. Double digit comp store sales growth was the norm across continental Europe, while sales in the U.K. rose modestly. European comps rose in all three months, although a deceleration in April might have been due, at least in part, to travel disruption from the volcano, as well as customers focused on and distracted by various European economic and political issues. We should add that the weaker euro, which averaged $1.36 in the first quarter, did not have much of a negative effect on the translation of our European results into U.S. dollars compared with the rate of $1.37 that we had planned. But it did benefit translation of results when compared with the rate of $1.30 last year. However, we are now forecasting the euro at $1.25 for the rest of the year and are similarly forecasting the pound to be somewhat weaker than our original plan of $1.55.
Lastly, sales in our Other segment more than doubled in the quarter. This segment consists of wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program and those sales were up substantially. In addition, as I said before, we now also include our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets, and those sales also increased. We intend to place greater emphasis on growing our business in those markets in the coming years.
Looking at results from a merchandising perspective, the sales growth in the quarter came from a wide range of product categories. At the highest end, we saw considerable growth in Statement Jewelry over $50,000. The Engagement Jewelry category was also quite strong, benefiting from our extraordinary assortment of designs and strong inventory position, and perhaps also reflecting some pent up demand. The Fine Jewelry category also posted a solid increase, reflecting growth of Celebration Ring sales tied to a renewed marketing emphasis, as well as the strength of other core collections such as Victoria, Metro and Hearts. Fashion Jewelry, such as the Keys and Charms Collections, were strong and right now we are lapping the hugely successful launch of Keys last spring. We were also pleased with solid sales growth of the designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. And lastly, watch sales were up nicely in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the rest of the earnings statement. It's a pleasure to report that gross margin rose 1.9 points in the first quarter to 57.8% after experiencing declines throughout last year. This increase largely resulted from sales leverage on fixed costs and manufacturing efficiencies and was higher than we expected. 
In addition, we periodically review and adjust retail prices as we did in the first quarter to address market conditions and product cost increases, which despite volatility, have trended higher over the past couple of years. We continue to expect that gross margin will increase at least a full point for the year.
SG&A expenses rose 13% in the quarter. This virtually matched our expectation and compared with a 16% decline in last year's first quarter. The 13% increase reflected higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs as we expected, along with an increase in variable costs tied to the sales growth. 
In addition, we announced on April 29 that we will be relocating Tiffany's headquarters staff to a new Manhattan location early next year. Costs associated with the move were not significant in the first quarter. We suggest you read the news release of April 29 for a description of all expected short-term costs and expected long-term savings. 
As a result of good leverage on fixed costs in the quarter, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 41.1% in the quarter versus 44.4% last year. And we continue to expect that SG&A expenses will increase about 10% for the full year. 
Putting it all together, Tiffany's operating margin rose to 16.6% in the quarter versus 11.5% last year. Interest and other expenses net were virtually unchanged from last year at $12 million. The effective income tax rate was 31% in the first quarter versus our plan of 35% and a rate of 42% last year. The variance to our plan resulted from a benefit related to a change in tax status as certain subsidiaries associated with a previously disclosed acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interest in our diamond polishing operation. This was partly offset by a charge related to the new health care reform legislation, whereby the tax benefit related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy received by the company was eliminated. Combined, these two non-recurring items benefited EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter. The 42% rate last year reflected a shift in the geographical mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35%. So in total, net earnings from continuing operations rose 135% to $64 million in the first quarter and per share earnings rose to $0.50 from $0.22 last year. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

We were very pleased and encouraged with the sales and earnings performance in the first quarter. We do think however, that the economic and consumer spending environment still contains enough uncertainties to warrant continuing degrees of caution and expense discipline in our outlook.
That said, we are excited about Tiffany's considerable growth potential, and we have the financial and organizational wherewithal to expand our strong position within the jewelry industry.
 Let's look at the balance sheet. At April 30, accounts receivable were 3% higher than last year due to sales growth and receivables were turning at 19x per year. Inventories at April 30 were 5% below a year ago. However, inventories have increased 3% since the start of the year as we replenished stores following the very strong demand in the fourth quarter and store availability has improved. Our plan continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in inventories for the year.
Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter compared with $15 million last year. After spending only $75 million on CapEx in all of 2009 as we held back on non-essential projects, we are on track to spend approximately $200 million in 2010, representing a more normal spending rate of 6% to 7% of sales. From a liquidity perspective, we had $674 million of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter versus $304 million a year ago.
Our total short-term and long-term debt amounted to $760 million at April 30 versus $822 million last year. Total debt to stockholders' equity declined to 39% at April 30 from 51% last year. In terms of spending a portion of that cash, we have $253 million of long-term debt coming due within the next 12 months, much of which is in Japan. At this time, we anticipate refinancing 10 billion yen or approximately $110 million and paying down the balance.
In addition, we resumed share repurchases near the end of January. In the first quarter, we spent $14.3 million to buy 319,500 shares at an average cost of $44.62 per share. There's about $388 million remaining under the currently authorized plan, which expires next January. And Tiffany's board of directors has approved two dividend increases this year, including an 18% increase in the quarterly rate earlier in the year, which was followed last week by an additional 25% increase in the quarterly rate. But in light of obvious economic uncertainties, I want to emphasize that we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet with a comfortable level of financial flexibility. We have a robust schedule of store openings this year. Our worldwide plans now call for opening 16 stores. One previously planned store in Europe has had a construction delay until early 2011, but we are on schedule in Europe this year to open a store in London's Canary Wharf and a second store in Spain in Barcelona.
In the Americas, we've signed leases for new stores in Baltimore, Jacksonville, The Woodlands in Houston and in Santa Monica. And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Beyond store expansion, we are looking forward to our upcoming launch of e-commerce in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain. 
In addition to store expansion, we have an active lineup of product introductions this year. We recently launched in Japan our extraordinary new collection of jewelry with yellow diamonds. It's been very well received and will be rolled out to our other stores later in the year. There are additions to our Keys and Charms Collection. We are now introducing Tiffany Garden, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives. There's Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh Collection, which is already proving quite popular. We will also be expanding our very successful Return to Tiffany Collection. There are new watches being introduced, and we are excited about the upcoming launch of a collection of leather handbags and accessories designed by Richard Lambertson and John Truex. And as we've previously reported, we are stepping up the pace of marketing communications this year through print and online media that will support new products as well as enhance overall customer awareness of Tiffany's offerings.
We are now almost one month into the second quarter and consolidated worldwide sales growth is in line with our objective. For the full year, we think our sales growth projections and assumptions are reasonable. They are largely based on easy comparisons to the soft results last year and are not based on overly optimistic economic assumptions. But they do assume no deterioration in the macro environment or in consumer confidence.
Specifically, those full year projections continue to include an 11% increase in worldwide sales and by region, a low double digit percentage sales increase in the Americas, a low single digit percentage decline in Japan, a mid-20s percentage sales increase in Asia-Pacific, which is a bit better than the 20% growth that we previously expected, a high single digit percentage increase in Europe, which is somewhat lower than the mid-teens growth that we previously expected due to translation; and other sales would be equal to last year. And we have not made any meaningful changes to our assumptions for margins, expense discipline, interest expense or the effective tax rate for the rest of the year.
But because of better than expected first quarter earnings, we are increasing our outlook for the year from the previous $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share to the new range of $2.55 to $2.60 per diluted share. Please note that consistent with the previous outlook, this does not include expenses related to our headquarters staff relocation or the first quarter's net tax benefit, which total approximately $0.09 per share. 
Our success for many years and most recently has resulted from a disciplined approach to managing Tiffany's business. As we mentioned on our year end call in March, and shown now with the new sales reporting structure we have disclosed today, our organization has evolved toward greater local decision-making and accountability in each region. We expect to achieve improvements in the areas of in-store product assortment, inventory management and in our allocation of marketing spending, which should ultimately lead to a greater growth in sales and market share.
This will be an important driver in our overall pursuit of substantial growth around the world. That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on August 27. Thank you for joining us."

Now we can proceed. We're pleased to say that the improved sales and earnings performance we observed in the latter part of 2009 has continued into 2010, and in the first quarter, surpassed our expectations. And we were also pleased that the growth was generally broad-based geographically and by price point, although we attribute much of this strong improvement to comparisons to the troughs of a year ago.
Before reviewing sales by region, you should note in today's news release that we are now expanding our disclosure by geographical segment to align external reporting with changes in our organizational structure and greater decision-making and accountability at the regional level. One revision is to report Japan separately from Asia-Pacific. Also, results for certain emerging markets, such as Russia and the Middle East, where we sell to distributors for their resale in those markets, have moved out of Asia-Pacific and Europe and into the Other segment. We’ve posted prior year sales on our website under the headings Financial Information and Reportable Segments. Prior-year operating earnings by segment will be reported in our 10-Q reports as we move through the year. 
Having noted that, Tiffany's worldwide sales rose 22% in the first quarter after declining 22% in last year's first quarter. Let's now look at sales by segment.
Sales in the Americas increased 22% in the first quarter, which was better than we expected and compared with a 31% decline last year. The 22% increase was generated by increased transactions in all major product categories and an increase in the average transaction size. Traffic and conversion rose too. In terms of price stratification, we continued to see growth in sales and transactions across the range of price strata, from silver jewelry to diamond jewelry, with the largest percentage increases in jewelry above $50,000. Of course, high-end statement jewelry was the most depressed category a year ago.
We are now reporting comparable store sales for the entire Americas as opposed to just the U.S., although the U.S. is the largest driver of the segment, representing 91% of sales in this segment in 2009. On a constant exchange rate basis, America's sales increased 20% and comps rose 15% versus a comp decline of 32% last year.
In terms of the monthly trend, Americas comps rose 18% in February, 21% in March and 7% in April. This contrasted with respective monthly comp declines of 32%, 36% and 29% in the Americas last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 26% in the quarter versus a 42% decline last year, while comparable Americas brand store sales rose 13% versus a 30% decline last year.
The comp store sales growth was pretty broad-based in the U.S. although we did note softness in our Southwest region, as well as in Hawaii. Stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted strong increases in the quarter. In terms of customer mix, more than half of the comp growth was generated by increased spending by domestic customers, with a smaller contribution from foreign tourists. We believe sales in April were adversely affected by the Icelandic volcano, which reduced foreign tourist travel to New York and some other markets too. We expect that much of that travel will eventually be rescheduled, so the spending may just be temporarily deferred.
Direct marketing sales in the Americas also performed well in the first quarter, with combined Internet and catalog sales posting a 23% increase that was better than we expected and which compared with a 17% sales decline last year. The 23% increase was largely due to more orders shipped. But we also saw an increased average order size. Now let's look at Japan, where total sales declined 2% due to a small decline in both units and in the average price per unit sold. The yen averaged 91 to $1 in the first quarter versus 96 last year. Our full year plan is based on a rate of 95. On a constant exchange rate basis, excluding the effect of the stronger yen, total sales in Japan declined 7% in the quarter and comps declined 10%, which was below our expectations and was on top of a 13% comp decline in last year's first quarter. Comps declined in all three months with no discernible pattern. There was no meaningful difference in comp declines within or outside Tokyo and the retail environment remains challenging. Our objective in Japan is to maximize profitability there.
The picture is much brighter in the Asia-Pacific region, where sales growth was generally strong in most markets. Total sales increased 50% in the first quarter due to a substantial increase in unit volume, as well as an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, increases of 37% in total sales and 21% in comparable store sales exceeded our expectations. Comps had declined 5% in last year's first quarter but since then have improved steadily and we posted double digit growth in every month of this first quarter. During the quarter, we expanded Tiffany's presence in China with the opening of an additional store in Shanghai, a substantial 6,400 square-foot store in the Hong Kong Plaza. And just earlier this month, we also opened a 3,100 square-foot store in the IFC mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai. We now operate 12 stores in mainland China and are on track to have approximately 30 stores there within about five years.
We were also pleased with performance in Europe in the quarter, where total sales rose 25%, largely due to increased unit volume. In constant currencies, total sales rose 19% and comps increased 14%. This was better than we expected and was on top of a 3% comp increase last year. Double digit comp store sales growth was the norm across continental Europe, while sales in the U.K. rose modestly. European comps rose in all three months, although a deceleration in April might have been due, at least in part, to travel disruption from the volcano, as well as customers focused on and distracted by various European economic and political issues. We should add that the weaker euro, which averaged $1.36 in the first quarter, did not have much of a negative effect on the translation of our European results into U.S. dollars compared with the rate of $1.37 that we had planned. But it did benefit translation of results when compared with the rate of $1.30 last year. However, we are now forecasting the euro at $1.25 for the rest of the year and are similarly forecasting the pound to be somewhat weaker than our original plan of $1.55.
Lastly, sales in our Other segment more than doubled in the quarter. This segment consists of wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program and those sales were up substantially. In addition, as I said before, we now also include our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets, and those sales also increased. We intend to place greater emphasis on growing our business in those markets in the coming years.
Looking at results from a merchandising perspective, the sales growth in the quarter came from a wide range of product categories. At the highest end, we saw considerable growth in Statement Jewelry over $50,000. The Engagement Jewelry category was also quite strong, benefiting from our extraordinary assortment of designs and strong inventory position, and perhaps also reflecting some pent up demand. The Fine Jewelry category also posted a solid increase, reflecting growth of Celebration Ring sales tied to a renewed marketing emphasis, as well as the strength of other core collections such as Victoria, Metro and Hearts. Fashion Jewelry, such as the Keys and Charms Collections, were strong and right now we are lapping the hugely successful launch of Keys last spring. We were also pleased with solid sales growth of the designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. And lastly, watch sales were up nicely in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the rest of the earnings statement. It's a pleasure to report that gross margin rose 1.9 points in the first quarter to 57.8% after experiencing declines throughout last year. This increase largely resulted from sales leverage on fixed costs and manufacturing efficiencies and was higher than we expected. 
In addition, we periodically review and adjust retail prices as we did in the first quarter to address market conditions and product cost increases, which despite volatility, have trended higher over the past couple of years. We continue to expect that gross margin will increase at least a full point for the year.
SG&A expenses rose 13% in the quarter. This virtually matched our expectation and compared with a 16% decline in last year's first quarter. The 13% increase reflected higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs as we expected, along with an increase in variable costs tied to the sales growth. 
In addition, we announced on April 29 that we will be relocating Tiffany's headquarters staff to a new Manhattan location early next year. Costs associated with the move were not significant in the first quarter. We suggest you read the news release of April 29 for a description of all expected short-term costs and expected long-term savings. 
As a result of good leverage on fixed costs in the quarter, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 41.1% in the quarter versus 44.4% last year. And we continue to expect that SG&A expenses will increase about 10% for the full year. 
Putting it all together, Tiffany's operating margin rose to 16.6% in the quarter versus 11.5% last year. Interest and other expenses net were virtually unchanged from last year at $12 million. The effective income tax rate was 31% in the first quarter versus our plan of 35% and a rate of 42% last year. The variance to our plan resulted from a benefit related to a change in tax status as certain subsidiaries associated with a previously disclosed acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interest in our diamond polishing operation. This was partly offset by a charge related to the new health care reform legislation, whereby the tax benefit related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy received by the company was eliminated. Combined, these two non-recurring items benefited EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter. The 42% rate last year reflected a shift in the geographical mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35%. So in total, net earnings from continuing operations rose 135% to $64 million in the first quarter and per share earnings rose to $0.50 from $0.22 last year. I'll now turn the call over to Jim.

That said, we are excited about Tiffany's considerable growth potential, and we have the financial and organizational wherewithal to expand our strong position within the jewelry industry.
 Let's look at the balance sheet. At April 30, accounts receivable were 3% higher than last year due to sales growth and receivables were turning at 19x per year. Inventories at April 30 were 5% below a year ago. However, inventories have increased 3% since the start of the year as we replenished stores following the very strong demand in the fourth quarter and store availability has improved. Our plan continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in inventories for the year.
Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter compared with $15 million last year. After spending only $75 million on CapEx in all of 2009 as we held back on non-essential projects, we are on track to spend approximately $200 million in 2010, representing a more normal spending rate of 6% to 7% of sales. From a liquidity perspective, we had $674 million of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter versus $304 million a year ago.
Our total short-term and long-term debt amounted to $760 million at April 30 versus $822 million last year. Total debt to stockholders' equity declined to 39% at April 30 from 51% last year. In terms of spending a portion of that cash, we have $253 million of long-term debt coming due within the next 12 months, much of which is in Japan. At this time, we anticipate refinancing 10 billion yen or approximately $110 million and paying down the balance.
In addition, we resumed share repurchases near the end of January. In the first quarter, we spent $14.3 million to buy 319,500 shares at an average cost of $44.62 per share. There's about $388 million remaining under the currently authorized plan, which expires next January. And Tiffany's board of directors has approved two dividend increases this year, including an 18% increase in the quarterly rate earlier in the year, which was followed last week by an additional 25% increase in the quarterly rate. But in light of obvious economic uncertainties, I want to emphasize that we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet with a comfortable level of financial flexibility. We have a robust schedule of store openings this year. Our worldwide plans now call for opening 16 stores. One previously planned store in Europe has had a construction delay until early 2011, but we are on schedule in Europe this year to open a store in London's Canary Wharf and a second store in Spain in Barcelona.
In the Americas, we've signed leases for new stores in Baltimore, Jacksonville, The Woodlands in Houston and in Santa Monica. And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Beyond store expansion, we are looking forward to our upcoming launch of e-commerce in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain. 
In addition to store expansion, we have an active lineup of product introductions this year. We recently launched in Japan our extraordinary new collection of jewelry with yellow diamonds. It's been very well received and will be rolled out to our other stores later in the year. There are additions to our Keys and Charms Collection. We are now introducing Tiffany Garden, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives. There's Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh Collection, which is already proving quite popular. We will also be expanding our very successful Return to Tiffany Collection. There are new watches being introduced, and we are excited about the upcoming launch of a collection of leather handbags and accessories designed by Richard Lambertson and John Truex. And as we've previously reported, we are stepping up the pace of marketing communications this year through print and online media that will support new products as well as enhance overall customer awareness of Tiffany's offerings.
We are now almost one month into the second quarter and consolidated worldwide sales growth is in line with our objective. For the full year, we think our sales growth projections and assumptions are reasonable. They are largely based on easy comparisons to the soft results last year and are not based on overly optimistic economic assumptions. But they do assume no deterioration in the macro environment or in consumer confidence.
Specifically, those full year projections continue to include an 11% increase in worldwide sales and by region, a low double digit percentage sales increase in the Americas, a low single digit percentage decline in Japan, a mid-20s percentage sales increase in Asia-Pacific, which is a bit better than the 20% growth that we previously expected, a high single digit percentage increase in Europe, which is somewhat lower than the mid-teens growth that we previously expected due to translation; and other sales would be equal to last year. And we have not made any meaningful changes to our assumptions for margins, expense discipline, interest expense or the effective tax rate for the rest of the year.
But because of better than expected first quarter earnings, we are increasing our outlook for the year from the previous $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share to the new range of $2.55 to $2.60 per diluted share. Please note that consistent with the previous outlook, this does not include expenses related to our headquarters staff relocation or the first quarter's net tax benefit, which total approximately $0.09 per share. 
Our success for many years and most recently has resulted from a disciplined approach to managing Tiffany's business. As we mentioned on our year end call in March, and shown now with the new sales reporting structure we have disclosed today, our organization has evolved toward greater local decision-making and accountability in each region. We expect to achieve improvements in the areas of in-store product assortment, inventory management and in our allocation of marketing spending, which should ultimately lead to a greater growth in sales and market share.
This will be an important driver in our overall pursuit of substantial growth around the world. That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on August 27. Thank you for joining us.

Now we can proceed. We're pleased to say that the improved sales and earnings performance we observed in the latter part of 2009 has continued into 2010, and in the first quarter, surpassed our expectations. And we were also pleased that the growth was generally broad-based geographically and by price point, although we attribute much of this strong improvement to comparisons to the troughs of a year ago.
Before reviewing sales by region, you should note in today's news release that we are now expanding our disclosure by geographical segment to align external reporting with changes in our organizational structure and greater decision-making and accountability at the regional level. One revision is to report Japan separately from Asia-Pacific. Also, results for certain emerging markets, such as Russia and the Middle East, where we sell to distributors for their resale in those markets, have moved out of Asia-Pacific and Europe and into the Other segment. We’ve posted prior year sales on our website under the headings Financial Information and Reportable Segments. Prior-year operating earnings by segment will be reported in our 10-Q reports as we move through the year. 
Having noted that, Tiffany's worldwide sales rose 22% in the first quarter after declining 22% in last year's first quarter. Let's now look at sales by segment.
Sales in the Americas increased 22% in the first quarter, which was better than we expected and compared with a 31% decline last year. The 22% increase was generated by increased transactions in all major product categories and an increase in the average transaction size. Traffic and conversion rose too. In terms of price stratification, we continued to see growth in sales and transactions across the range of price strata, from silver jewelry to diamond jewelry, with the largest percentage increases in jewelry above $50,000. Of course, high-end statement jewelry was the most depressed category a year ago.
We are now reporting comparable store sales for the entire Americas as opposed to just the U.S., although the U.S. is the largest driver of the segment, representing 91% of sales in this segment in 2009. On a constant exchange rate basis, Americas’ sales increased 20% and comps rose 15% versus a comp decline of 32% last year.
In terms of the monthly trend, Americas’ comps rose 18% in February, 21% in March and 7% in April. This contrasted with respective monthly comp declines of 32%, 36% and 29% in the Americas last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 26% in the quarter versus a 42% decline last year, while comparable Americas’ brand store sales rose 13% versus a 30% decline last year.
The comp store sales growth was pretty broad-based in the U.S., although we did note softness in our Southwest region, as well as in Hawaii. Stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted strong increases in the quarter. In terms of customer mix, more than half of the comp growth was generated by increased spending by domestic customers, with a smaller contribution from foreign tourists. We believe sales in April were adversely affected by the Icelandic volcano, which reduced foreign tourist travel to New York and some other markets too. We expect that much of that travel will eventually be rescheduled, so the spending may just be temporarily deferred.
Direct marketing sales in the Americas also performed well in the first quarter, with combined Internet and catalog sales posting a 23% increase that was better than we expected and which compared with a 17% sales decline last year. The 23% increase was largely due to more orders shipped. But we also saw an increased average order size. Now let's look at Japan, where total sales declined 2% due to a small decline in both units and in the average price per unit sold. The yen averaged 91 to $1 in the first quarter versus 96 last year. Our full year plan is based on a rate of 95. On a constant exchange rate basis, excluding the effect of the stronger yen, total sales in Japan declined 7% in the quarter and comps declined 10%, which was below our expectations and was on top of a 13% comp decline in last year's first quarter. Comps declined in all three months with no discernible pattern. There was no meaningful difference in comp declines within or outside Tokyo and the retail environment remains challenging. Our objective in Japan is to maximize profitability there.
The picture is much brighter in the Asia-Pacific region, where sales growth was generally strong in most markets. Total sales increased 50% in the first quarter due to a substantial increase in unit volume, as well as an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, increases of 37% in total sales and 21% in comparable store sales exceeded our expectations. Comps had declined 5% in last year's first quarter, but since then have improved steadily and we posted double digit growth in every month of this first quarter. During the quarter, we expanded Tiffany's presence in China with the opening of an additional store in Shanghai, a substantial 6,400 square-foot store in the Hong Kong Plaza. And just earlier this month, we also opened a 3,100 square-foot store in the IFC mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai. We now operate 12 stores in mainland China and are on track to have approximately 30 stores there within about five years.
We were also pleased with performance in Europe in the quarter, where total sales rose 25%, largely due to increased unit volume. In constant currencies, total sales rose 19% and comps increased 14%. This was better than we expected and was on top of a 3% comp increase last year. Double digit comp store sales growth was the norm across continental Europe, while sales in the U.K. rose modestly. European comps rose in all three months, although a deceleration in April might have been due, at least in part, to travel disruption from the volcano, as well as customers focused on and distracted by various European economic and political issues. We should add that the weaker euro, which averaged $1.36 in the first quarter, did not have much of a negative effect on the translation of our European results into U.S. dollars compared with the rate of $1.37 that we had planned. But it did benefit translation of results when compared with the rate of $1.30 last year. However, we are now forecasting the euro at $1.25 for the rest of the year and are similarly forecasting the pound to be somewhat weaker than our original plan of $1.55.
Lastly, sales in our Other segment more than doubled in the quarter. This segment consists of wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program and those sales were up substantially. In addition, as I said before, we now also include our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets, and those sales also increased. We intend to place greater emphasis on growing our business in those markets in the coming years.
Looking at results from a merchandising perspective, the sales growth in the quarter came from a wide range of product categories. At the highest end, we saw considerable growth in Statement Jewelry over $50,000. The Engagement Jewelry category was also quite strong, benefiting from our extraordinary assortment of designs and strong inventory position, and perhaps also reflecting some pent up demand. The Fine Jewelry category also posted a solid increase, reflecting growth of Celebration Ring sales tied to a renewed marketing emphasis, as well as the strength of other core collections such as Victoria, Metro and Hearts. Fashion Jewelry, such as the Keys and Charms Collections, were strong and right now we are lapping the hugely successful launch of Keys last spring. We were also pleased with solid sales growth of the designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. And lastly, watch sales were up nicely in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the rest of the earnings statement. It's a pleasure to report that gross margin rose 1.9 points in the first quarter to 57.8% after experiencing declines throughout last year. This increase largely resulted from sales leverage on fixed costs and manufacturing efficiencies and was higher than we expected. 
In addition, we periodically review and adjust retail prices as we did in the first quarter to address market conditions and product cost increases, which despite volatility, have trended higher over the past couple of years. We continue to expect that gross margin will increase at least a full point for the year.
SG&A expenses rose 13% in the quarter. This virtually matched our expectation and compared with a 16% decline in last year's first quarter. The 13% increase reflected higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs as we expected, along with an increase in variable costs tied to the sales growth. 
In addition, we announced on April 29 that we will be relocating Tiffany's headquarters staff to a new Manhattan location early next year. Costs associated with the move were not significant in the first quarter. We suggest you read the news release of April 29 for a description of all expected short-term costs and expected long-term savings. 
As a result of good leverage on fixed costs in the quarter, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 41.1% in the quarter versus 44.4% last year. And we continue to expect that SG&A expenses will increase about 10% for the full year. 
Putting it all together, Tiffany's operating margin rose to 16.6% in the quarter versus 11.5% last year. Interest and other expenses net were virtually unchanged from last year at $12 million. The effective income tax rate was 31% in the first quarter versus our plan of 35% and a rate of 42% last year. The variance to our plan resulted from a benefit related to a change in tax status as certain subsidiaries associated with a previously disclosed acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interest in our diamond polishing operation. This was partly offset by a charge related to the new health care reform legislation, whereby the tax benefit related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy received by the company was eliminated. Combined, these two non-recurring items benefited EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter. The 42% rate last year reflected a shift in the geographical mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35%. So in total, net earnings from continuing operations rose 135% to $64 million in the first quarter and per share earnings rose to $0.50 from $0.22 last year. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

We were very pleased and encouraged with the sales and earnings performance in the first quarter. We do think however, that the economic and consumer spending environment still contains enough uncertainties to warrant continuing degrees of caution and expense discipline in our outlook.
That said, we are excited about Tiffany's considerable growth potential, and we have the financial and organizational wherewithal to expand our strong position within the jewelry industry.
Let's look at the balance sheet. At April 30, accounts receivable were 3% higher than last year due to sales growth and receivables were turning at 19x per year. Inventories at April 30 were 5% below a year ago. However, inventories have increased 3% since the start of the year as we replenished stores following the very strong demand in the fourth quarter and store availability has improved. Our plan continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in inventories for the year.
Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter compared with $15 million last year. After spending only $75 million on CapEx in all of 2009 as we held back on non-essential projects, we are on track to spend approximately $200 million in 2010, representing a more normal spending rate of 6% to 7% of sales. From a liquidity perspective, we had $674 million of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter versus $304 million a year ago.
Our total short-term and long-term debt amounted to $760 million at April 30 versus $822 million last year. Total debt to stockholders' equity declined to 39% at April 30 from 51% last year. In terms of spending a portion of that cash, we have $253 million of long-term debt coming due within the next 12 months, much of which is in Japan. At this time, we anticipate refinancing 10 billion yen or approximately $110 million and paying down the balance.
In addition, we resumed share repurchases near the end of January. In the first quarter, we spent $14.3 million to buy 319,500 shares at an average cost of $44.62 per share. There's about $388 million remaining under the currently authorized plan, which expires next January. And Tiffany's board of directors has approved two dividend increases this year, including an 18% increase in the quarterly rate earlier in the year, which was followed last week by an additional 25% increase in the quarterly rate. But in light of obvious economic uncertainties, I want to emphasize that we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet with a comfortable level of financial flexibility. We have a robust schedule of store openings this year. Our worldwide plans now call for opening 16 stores. One previously planned store in Europe has had a construction delay until early 2011, but we are on schedule in Europe this year to open a store in London's Canary Wharf and a second store in Spain in Barcelona.
In the Americas, we've signed leases for new stores in Baltimore, Jacksonville, The Woodlands in Houston and in Santa Monica. And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Beyond store expansion, we are looking forward to our upcoming launch of e-commerce in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain. 
In addition to store expansion, we have an active lineup of product introductions this year. We recently launched in Japan our extraordinary new collection of jewelry with yellow diamonds. It's been very well received and will be rolled out to our other stores later in the year. There are additions to our Keys and Charms Collections. We are now introducing Tiffany Garden, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives. There's Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh Collection, which is already proving quite popular. We will also be expanding our very successful Return to Tiffany Collection. There are new watches being introduced, and we are excited about the upcoming launch of a collection of leather handbags and accessories designed by Richard Lambertson and John Truex. And as we've previously reported, we are stepping up the pace of marketing communications this year through print and online media that will support new products, as well as enhance overall customer awareness of Tiffany's offerings.

And we have not made any meaningful changes to our assumptions for margins, expense discipline, interest expense or the effective tax rate for the rest of the year.

Earlier today, we reported Tiffany’s second quarter results, and on this call Jim and I will review that performance and also comment on the outlook for the full year.
Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
Now we can proceed. We're very with Tiffany’s second-quarter earnings growth. As a stronger than expected gross margin more than offset sales growth that fell modestly short of our internal expectations. Worldwide sales grew 9% in the quarter reflecting softer than expected growth in the Americas. However, sales results for total Asia-Pacific were generally solid and sales growth strengthened in Europe in the second quarter as we expected.
And probably not surprisingly there was continued softness in Japanese sales. We had a very strong increase in gross margins, and SG&A expense growth was well contained. So all in all it was a good quarter with net earnings from continuing operations up 19%, and more relevant up 45% when excluding some non-recurring items recorded in the current and prior year periods. And we modestly increased our full-year earnings outlook.
Let us first look at sales by segment. In the Americas region sales increased 8% in the second quarter, which was lighter than we expected especially due to softness earlier in the quarter. The 8% increase entirely resulted from an increase in the average transaction size. Our price stratification analysis indicated healthy growth in sales and transaction at most price points, including the highest end, but lower sales and transaction at price points below $500.
Some of that softness below $500 might reflect the tough comparison to the launch in last year’s second quarter of Tiffany Keys, and the softness might also say something about consumer behavior related to current economic conditions. In any case, Tiffany benefits from offering products in a broad range of price points.
Comparable store sales in the Americas rose 5% in the quarter on a constant currency basis on top of 25% decline in last year’s second quarter. Looking at the trend during the quarter, Americas comps increased 5% in May versus a 27% declined last year, rose 2% in June versus a 25% decline, and increased 9% in July versus a 23% decline last year. Comparable Americas brand store sales increased 4% versus a 24% decline last year. Sales in the New York flagship store increased 8% in the quarter versus a 30% decline last year.
In addition, the 8 New York area brand stores posted a 12% comp increase in the quarter. There were no significant differences in performance among most regions, except for continued and pronounced softness in the south-west US region that includes Southern California, Arizona and Las Vegas. On the other hand, our sales in Hawaii and Guam were very strong and our stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted solid increases in the quarter.
Looking at the customer mix, foreign tourist spending accounted for more than half of the sales growth in the quarter, with the largest increases from Asian customers and minimum sales growth to European visitors. Interestingly, the entire increase in our New York flagship store sales came from higher sales to tourist, and Mayor Bloomberg recently projected that tourist visits to New York will reach record levels this year. While foreign tourism accounts for roughly 15% of US store sales, it runs at roughly twice that rate in the New York flagship store.
Direct marketing, Internet and catalog sales in the Americas declined by 2% in the quarter, which was below our expectation and was due to a decline in orders shipped. In last year’s second quarter while retail store sales were still running down more than 20%, direct marketing sales had declined only 8% as it benefited from the launch of the Keys collection. We are pleased to be seeing a resumption of direct marketing sales growth this month.
Now let us take a look at our growing business in Europe. Total sales increased 14% in the second quarter. However, year-over-year the euro and pound on average were 10% and 7% weaker than the dollar in the quarter, and were close to our internal forecast. Therefore, on the more meaningful constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 25% and comparable store sales increased 21%. This was on top of a 5% comp increase last year.
After experiencing a slowdown in European sales near the end of the first quarter, comparable store sales growth improved steadily throughout the second quarter, and actually rose by double-digit percentages in all three months. We were pleased that sales growth was pretty evenly divided between the UK and continental Europe. The vast majority of our European business is transacted with local customers, but we are also seeing an increase in sales to foreign visitors, especially from China. In mid-June, we launched e-commerce in 8 countries in continental Europe, and are quite pleased with the initial numbers of both visits and orders.
Turning to Asia-Pacific, total sales in the quarter were up 21% in dollars. On a constant exchange rate basis total sales rose 17% and comparable store sales rose 7%, which was close to our expectation and on top of a 5% increase last year. The monthly trend was choppy with the greatest strength in May and the greatest softness in June. Quarterly performance by country was mixed, ranging from total sales growth of more than 20% in China, Hong Kong, Macao and Korea to relatively flat sales in Australia and Taiwan.
We opened two stores in Asia Pacific in the quarter. One in the IFC mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai, which now gives us 12 stores in mainland China; and our fourth store in Singapore, this one in the new Marina Bay Sands Resort. In addition, two days ago we opened a store in Taipei in the Bellavita mall, which brought us to 6 stores in Taiwan.
Rounding out the geographical review by region is Japan, where total sales increased 4% in dollars. However, that reflected the year-over-year translation effect from a strong yen, which averaged 90 to the dollar in the second quarter versus 96 last year. On a constant currency basis, total sales declined 2% and comparable store sales declined 7% on top of 11% comp decline last year. Our expectation was just for a slight comp decline.
Comps were down to varying degrees throughout the quarter, and the economic and retail environment in Japan remains challenging. Our objective is to enhance our existing store base and maximize profitability there. As examples, earlier this month, we relocated and expanded a boutique within the Takashimaya store in Osaka, and also closed a department store boutique in Kawasaki [ph].
Lastly, sales in the other segment declined 19% in the second quarter. This was largely due to lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds, while our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets was virtually equal to the prior year. However, we are more focused now on growing our businesses in the Middle East and Russia.
In terms of merchandising highlights, worldwide sales grew in all major categories. Sales of engagement jewelry rose strongly in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe largely due to solid growth in units, as well as a higher average price. At the highest end, there was modest growth in Statement Jewelry sales over $50,000. There was also continued strong performance in celebration rings and other popular jewelry collections like Victoria, Metro and Hearts. The Keys collection remained strong at higher price points.
Generally speaking, there was healthy demand for gold and platinum jewelry in contrast to silver jewelry sales, which were virtually equal to the prior year. The designer jewelry category had a good increase, and we were pleased to see watch sales up more than 30% in the quarter, reflecting strong interest in our new Tiffany brand designs.
Jim will now take you through the rest of the earnings statement.

As most of you know, we have increased retail prices earlier in the year to offset higher product costs and recapture lost margin. We are also seeing manufacturing efficiencies. Lastly, gross margin benefited from lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds, and are minimal if any margin. We now expect that gross margin may increase close to a point and a half for the full year.
SG&A expenses increased 10% in the second quarter. SG&A expenses included $3.6 million of costs associated with the pending relocation of our headquarters staff. Last year’s SG&A expenses in the quarter included a $4.4 million gain related to a loan recovery. Excluding those items, SG&A expenses rose 7% in the quarter due to higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs, along with increased variable cost due to the sales growth. Also on that adjusted basis, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 40.3% in the quarter from 41.2% last year.
We expect that SG&A expenses excluding nonrecurring items will increase a bit less than 10% for the full year. Tiffany’s operating margin as reported was 17% in the second quarter versus 14.6% last year. On an adjusted basis that excludes nonrecurring items, the operating margin improved from 13.9% last year to 17.6% this year. The non-GAAP measures scheduled in today’s press release reconcile these nonrecurring items in detail.
Interest and other expenses net of $11.1 million in the quarter were slightly lower than last year. The effective income tax rate of 34% in the second quarter compared with 26.7% last year. However, last year we recorded favorable reserve adjustments tied to the conclusion of certain tax audits. Excluding that item, the effective tax rates in this year and last year would have been roughly similar. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 34% to 35%.
Adding this all up, net earnings from continuing operations rose 19% in the second quarter to $0.53 per diluted share, and excluding the nonrecurring items in this year and last year it rose 45% to $0.55 per diluted share. I will now turn the call back to Mark to review some balance sheet highlights.

Tiffany continues to maintain balance sheet strength, which not only supports our current business and planned expansion, but we believe also acts as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable at July 31 were 12% higher than last year reflecting sales growth. Inventories at July 31 were just 1% above last year. However, inventories have increased 9% since the start of the fiscal year. We have reduced inventory levels last year due to economic condition, but inventories finished the year even lower than we had planned because of stronger than expected sales in the fourth quarter. Our plan for this year continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in inventories.
Capital expenditures were $51 million in the first half of the year compared with $30 million last year. We are now on track to spend approximately $180 million this year, representing about 6% of sales and down from our previous forecast of $200 million. We are also repurchasing shares through a program that is both ongoing and opportunistic. We spent $33 million in the second quarter to buy almost 800,000 shares at an average cost of $41.16 per share. That brought our first half spending to $47 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares. There is about $355 million remaining under the currently authorized plan, which expires next January.
Tiffany finished the second quarter with $615 million of cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $334 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt at July 31 totaled $782 million versus $752 million last year, partly reflecting the translation effect on Yen denominated debt.
Total debt to stockholders' equity declined to 40% at July 31 from 45% last year. We intend to spend a portion of our cash for the repayment of approximately $155 million of long-term debt over the next 12 months, while we will be refinancing $115 million of other maturing long-term debt.
I will now turn it back to Jim.

Those of you on this call know about, and we believe appreciate the long-term approach we take to managing Tiffany’s business and brand. So notwithstanding the obvious macro uncertainties, we remain committed to pursuing important expansion opportunities.
Our worldwide plan is to open 14 stores in 2010. We began the year planning for 17 stores, but to have been postponed to 2011 due to construction delays beyond our control and one planned in Canada is now postponed as well. Nonetheless, in the Americas our plans include opening five new stores and Baltimore, Jacksonville, the Woodlands in Houston, Santa Monica, and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. In Europe, we will be opening a store in London’s Canary Wharf, and a second store in Spain in Barcelona.
And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China and Korea, as well as the stores we have already opened in China, Singapore and Taiwan. We are also maintaining an active line up of product introductions this year. We are enthusiastic about our new and extensive jewelry collection of yellow diamonds, which we first launched in Japan and Australia, and which will soon debut in all regions.
And next week, we will launch the very enticing collection of leather handbags and accessories in select US stores and online. Perhaps, you have seen some of the favorable media coverage it has recently received. In addition, we have been very pleased with initial customer response to other new designs like Paloma Picasso’s new Marrakesh jewelry, and the Tiffany Garden collection, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives.
We have been expanding our very successful Keys, Charms, and Return to Tiffany collections. As we said, we are pleased with customer response to new watches in our stores, and we look forward to a significant expansion of wholesale distribution. To build awareness of our new products and stores, we’re spending more on marketing communications this year in absolute terms, and as a percentage of sales. It will be a significant step up in marketing spending in the third quarter, some of which will be tied to our hosting of major customer and media event in Beijing. In fact, we noted in today’s news release that the rate of earnings growth in the third quarter will be somewhat restrained by that increased marketing spending. But we believe the long-term benefits to the brand will far outweigh the short term cost.
We have produced good results in the first half of 2010, and are looking to the back half with a sense of guarded optimism to quote Mike Kowalski in today’s news release. We are almost one month into the third quarter, and are pleased to say that our consolidated worldwide sales growth has accelerated from the second quarter rate, and is currently increasing at a low double-digit percentage pace, with some variations by region.
For the full year, our projections and assumptions are based on relatively unchanged economic conditions. Our full-year projections call for 11% increase in worldwide sales, and by region 10% sales increase in the Americas, the low single digit percentage decline in Japan, a mid 20s percentage sales increase in Asia Pacific, a mid teens percentage increase in Europe, and other sales up modestly over last year. We expect about 1.5 point increase in gross margin, and will maintain appropriate expense discipline.
Therefore, we are flowing through the better than expected second-quarter earnings, as well as our expectation for a slightly stronger than initially expected gross margin, and are raising our earnings outlook for the year to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 per diluted share from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. Consistent with the previous outlook, this does not include net expenses related to the pending relocation of our New York headquarters staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total are now estimated at $0.06 per diluted share for the year.
In closing, we have a strong global organization, and while there are economic uncertainties out there, we strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is very well positioned to meet the desires of current and future customers.
That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Wednesday, November 24, and thanks for joining us.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.
We're very pleased with Tiffany's second quarter earnings growth as a stronger-than-expected gross margin more than offset sales growth that sell modestly short of our internal expectations. Worldwide sales grew 9% in the quarter, reflecting softer-than-expected growth in the Americas. However, sales results for total Asia-Pacific were generally solid and sales growth strengthened in Europe in the second quarter as we expected.
And probably not surprisingly, there was continued softness in Japanese sales. We had a very strong increase in gross margin, and SG&A expense growth was well contained. So all in all, it was a good quarter, with net earnings from continuing operations up 19% and more relevant, up 45% when excluding some non-recurring items recorded in the current and prior year period. And we modestly increased our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's first look at sales by segment. In the Americas region, sales increased 8% in the second quarter, which was lighter than we expected, especially due to softness earlier in the quarter. The 8% increase entirely resulted from an increase in the average transaction size. Our price stratification analysis indicated healthy growth in sales and transaction at most price points, including the highest end, but lower sales and transactions at price points below $500.
Some of that softness below $500 might reflect the tough comparison to the launch in last year's second quarter of Tiffany Keys, and the softness might also say something about consumer behavior related to current economic conditions. In any case, Tiffany benefits from offering products in a broad range of price points.
Comparable store sales in the Americas rose 5% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis, on top of a 25% decline in last year's second quarter. Looking at the trend during the quarter, Americas' comps increased 5% in May versus a 27% decline last year, rose 2% in June versus a 25% decline and increased 9% in July versus a 23% decline last year. Comparable Americas' brand store sales increased 4% versus a 24% decline last year. Sales in the New York flagship store increased 8% in the quarter versus a 30% decline last year.
In addition, the eight New York area brand stores posted a 12% comp increase in the quarter. There were no significant differences in performance among most regions, except for continued and pronounced softness in the Southwest U.S. region that includes Southern California, Arizona and Las Vegas. 
On the other hand, our sales in the Hawaii and Guam were very strong, and our stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted solid increases in the quarter. Looking at the customer mix, foreign tourists spending accounted for more than half of the sales growth in the quarter, with the largest increases from Asian customers and minimal sales growth to European tour visitors.
Interestingly, the entire increase in our New York flagship store sales came from higher sales to tourists. And Mayor Bloomberg recently projected that tourist visits to New York will reach record levels this year. While foreign tourism accounts for roughly 15% of U.S. store sales, it runs at roughly twice that rate in the New York flagship store.
Direct marketing, Internet and catalog sales in the Americas declined by 2% in the quarter, which was below our expectation and was due to a decline in orders shipped. In last year's second quarter, while retail store sales were still running down more than 20%, direct marketing sales had declined only 8% as it benefited from the launch of the Keys Collection. We're pleased to be seeing a resumption of direct marketing sales growth this month.
Now let's take a look at our growing business in Europe. Total sales increased 14% in the second quarter. However, year-over-year, the euro and pound, on average, were 10% and 7% weaker than the dollar in the quarter and were close to our internal forecast. Therefore, on the more meaningful constant exchange-rate basis, total European sales rose 25% and comparable store sales increased 21%. This was on top of a 5% comp increase last year.
After experiencing a slowdown in European sales near the end of the first quarter, comparable store sales growth improved steadily throughout the second quarter and actually rose by double-digit percentages in all three months. We were pleased that sales growth was pretty evenly divided between the U.K. and Continental Europe. The vast majority of our European business is transacted with local customers, but we are also seeing an increase in sales to foreign visitors, especially from China. And in mid-June, we launched e-commerce in eight countries in Continental Europe and are quite pleased with the initial numbers of both visits and orders.
Turning to Asia-Pacific. Total sales in the quarter were up 21% in dollars. On a constant exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 17%, and comparable store sales rose 7%, which was close to our expectation and on top of a 5% increase last year. The monthly trend was choppy, with the greatest strength in May and the greatest softness in June. 
Quarterly performance by country was mixed, ranging from total sales growth of more than 20% in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Korea to relatively flat sales in Australia and Taiwan. We opened two stores in Asia-Pacific in the quarter: one in the ifc mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai, which now gives us 12 stores in mainland China; and our fourth store in Singapore, this one in the new Marina Bay Sands Resort. 
In addition two days ago, we opened a store in Taipei in the Bellavita Mall, which brought us to six stores in Taiwan. Rounding out the geographical review by region is Japan, where total sales increased 4% in dollars. However, that reflected the year-over-year translation effect from a strong yen, which averaged 90 to the dollar in the second quarter versus 96 last year. On a constant-currency basis, total sales declined 2% and comparable store sales declined 7% on top of an 11% comp decline last year. Our expectation was for just a slight comp decline.
Comps were down to varying degrees throughout the quarter, and the economic and retail environment in Japan remains challenging. Our objective is to enhance our existing store base and maximize profitability there. As examples, earlier this month, we relocated and expanded a boutique within the Takashimaya store in Osaka and also closed a department store boutique in Kawasaki. 
Lastly, sales in the Other segment declined 19% in the second quarter. This was largely due to lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds, while our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets was virtually equal to the prior year. However, we are more focused now on growing our businesses in the Middle East and Russia.
In terms of merchandising highlights, worldwide sales grew in all major categories. Sales of engagement jewelry rose strongly in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, largely due to solid growth in units, as well as a higher average price. At the highest end, there was modest growth in statement jewelry sales over $50,000. There was also continued strong performance in celebration rings and other popular jewelry collections like Victoria, Metro and Heart. The Keys Collection remains strong at higher price points. Generally speaking, there was healthy demand for gold and platinum jewelry in contrast to silver jewelry sales, which were virtually equal to the prior year. The designer jewelry category had a good increase, and we were pleased to see Watch sales up more than 30% in the quarter, reflecting strong interest in our new Tiffany brand design. 
Jim will now take you through the rest of the earnings statement."

Lastly, gross margin benefited from lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds that are minimal with any margin. We now expect that gross margin may increase close to 1.5 for the full year. SG&A expenses increased 10% in the second quarter. SG&A expenses included $3.6 million of costs associated with the pending relocation of our headquarters staff. Last year's SG&A expenses in the quarter included a $4.4 million gain related to a loan recovery. Excluding those items, SG&A expenses rose 7% in the quarter due to higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs, along with increased variable cost due to the sales growth.

Our worldwide plan is to open 14 stores in 2010. We began the year planning for 17 stores, but two have been postponed to 2011 due to construction delays beyond our control, and one plan in Canada is now postponed as well. Nonetheless, in the Americas, our plans include opening five new stores: in Baltimore; Jacksonville; The Woodlands in Houston; Santa Monica; and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles.

Therefore, we are flowing through the better-than-expected second quarter earnings, as well as our expectation for a slightly stronger-than-initially-expected gross margin and are raising our earnings outlook for the year to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 per diluted share from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share.

So all in all, it was a good quarter, with net earnings from continuing operations up 19% and more relevant, up 45% when excluding some nonrecurring items recorded in the current and prior year period. And we modestly increased our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's first look at sales by segment. In the Americas region, sales increased 8% in the second quarter, which was lighter than we expected, especially due to softness earlier in the quarter. The 8% increase entirely resulted from an increase in the average transaction size. 
Our price stratification analysis indicated healthy growth in sales and transaction at most price points, including the highest end, but lower sales and transactions at price points below $500. Some of that softness below $500 might reflect the tough comparison to the launch in last year's second quarter of Tiffany Keys, and the softness might also say something about consumer behavior related to current economic conditions. In any case, Tiffany benefits from offering products in a broad range of price points.
Comparable store sales in the Americas rose 5% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis, on top of a 25% decline in last year's second quarter. Looking at the trend during the quarter, Americas' comps increased 5% in May versus a 27% decline last year, rose 2% in June versus a 25% decline and increased 9% in July versus a 23% decline last year. Comparable Americas' brand store sales increased 4% versus a 24% decline last year. Sales in the New York flagship store increased 8% in the quarter versus a 30% decline last year. In addition, the eight New York area branch stores posted a 12% comp increase in the quarter. 
There were no significant differences in performance among most regions, except for continued and pronounced softness in the Southwest U.S. region that includes Southern California, Arizona and Las Vegas. On the other hand, our sales in the Hawaii and Guam were very strong, and our stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted solid increases in the quarter. Looking at the customer mix, foreign tourists spending accounted for more than half of the sales growth in the quarter, with the largest increases from Asian customers and minimal sales growth to European tour visitors.
Interestingly, the entire increase in our New York flagship store sales came from higher sales to tourists, and Mayor Bloomberg recently projected that tourist visits to New York will reach record levels this year. While foreign tourism accounts for roughly 15% of U.S. store sales, it runs at roughly twice that rate in the New York flagship store.
Direct marketing, Internet and catalog sales in the Americas declined by 2% in the quarter, which was below our expectation and was due to a decline in orders shipped. In last year's second quarter, while retail store sales were still running down more than 20%, direct marketing sales had declined only 8% as it benefited from the launch of the Keys Collection. We're pleased to be seeing a resumption of direct marketing sales growth this month.
Now let's take a look at our growing business in Europe. Total sales increased 14% in the second quarter. However, year-over-year, the euro and pound, on average, were 10% and 7% weaker than the dollar in the quarter and were close to our internal forecast. Therefore, on the more meaningful constant exchange-rate basis, total European sales rose 25% and comparable store sales increased 21%. This was on top of a 5% comp increase last year.
After experiencing a slowdown in European sales near the end of the first quarter, comparable store sales growth improved steadily throughout the second quarter and actually rose by double-digit percentages in all three months. We were pleased that sales growth was pretty evenly divided between the U.K. and Continental Europe. The vast majority of our European business is transacted with local customers, but we are also seeing an increase in sales to foreign visitors, especially from China. And in mid-June, we launched e-commerce in eight countries in Continental Europe and are quite pleased with the initial numbers of both visits and orders.
Turning to Asia-Pacific. Total sales in the quarter were up 21% in dollars. On a constant exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 17%, and comparable store sales rose 7%, which was close to our expectation and on top of a 5% increase last year. The monthly trend was choppy, with the greatest strength in May and the greatest softness in June. 
Quarterly performance by country was mixed, ranging from total sales growth of more than 20% in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Korea to relatively flat sales in Australia and Taiwan. We opened two stores in Asia-Pacific in the quarter: one in the ifc mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai, which now gives us 12 stores in mainland China; and our fourth store in Singapore, this one in the new Marina Bay Sands Resort. 
In addition two days ago, we opened a store in Taipei in the Bellavita Mall, which brought us to six stores in Taiwan. Rounding out the geographical review by region is Japan, where total sales increased 4% in dollars. However, that reflected the year-over-year translation effect from a strong yen, which averaged 90 to the dollar in the second quarter versus 96 last year. On a constant-currency basis, total sales declined 2% and comparable store sales declined 7%, on top of an 11% comp decline last year. Our expectation was for just a slight comp decline.
Comps were down to varying degrees throughout the quarter, and the economic and retail environment in Japan remained challenging. Our objective is to enhance our existing store base and maximize profitability there. As example, earlier this month, we relocated and expanded a boutique within the Takashimaya store in Osaka and also closed the department store boutique in Kawasaki. 
Lastly, sales in the Other segment declined 19% in the second quarter. This was largely due to lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds, while our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets was virtually equal to the prior year. However, we are more focused now on growing our businesses in the Middle East and Russia.
In terms of merchandising highlights, worldwide sales grew in all major categories. Sales of engagement jewelry rose strongly in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, largely due to solid growth in units, as well as a higher average price. 
At the highest end, there was modest growth in statement jewelry sales over $50,000. There was also continued strong performance in celebration rings and other popular jewelry collections like Victoria, Metro and Heart. The Keys Collection remained strong at higher price points. 
Generally speaking, there was healthy demand for gold and platinum jewelry in contrast to silver jewelry sales, which were virtually equal to the prior year. The designer jewelry category had a good increase, and we were pleased to see Watch sales up more than 30% in the quarter, reflecting strong interest in our new Tiffany brand design.

Gross margin of 57.8% was 2.7 points above the 55.1% in last year's second quarter. As most of you know, we've increased retail prices earlier in the year to offset higher product costs and recapture the lost margin. We are also seeing manufacturing efficiencies. Lastly, gross margin benefited from lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds that earned minimal, if any, margin. We now expect that gross margin may increase close to 1.5 for the full year. 
SG&A expenses increased 10% in the second quarter. SG&A expenses included $3.6 million of costs associated with the pending relocation of our headquarters staff. Last year's SG&A expenses in the quarter included a $4.4 million gain related to a loan recovery. Excluding those items, SG&A expenses rose 7% in the quarter due to higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs, along with increased variable cost due to the sales growth. Also, on that adjusted basis, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 40.3% in the quarter from 41.2% last year. We expect that SG&A expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, will increase a bit less than 10% for the full year.
Tiffany's operating margin as reported was 17% in the second quarter versus 14.6% last year. On the adjusted basis that excludes nonrecurring items, the operating margin improved from 13.9% last year to 17.6% this year. The non-GAAP measure schedule on today's press release reconciles these nonrecurring items in detail.
Interest and other expenses net of $11.1 million in the quarter were slightly lower than last year. The effective income tax rate of 34% in the second quarter compared with 26.7% last year. However, last year, we recorded favorable reserve adjustments tied to the conclusion of certain tax audits. Excluding that item, the effective tax rates in this year and last year would have been roughly similar. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 34% to 35%.
Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations rose 19% in the second quarter to $0.53 per diluted share. And excluding the nonrecurring items in this year and last year, it rose 45% to $0.55 per diluted share. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mark to review some balance sheet highlights."

Tiffany continues to maintain balance sheet strength, which not only supports our current business and planned expansion, but we believe also acts as a competitive advantage. 
Accounts receivable at July 31 were 12% higher than last year, reflecting sales growth. Inventories at July 31 were just 1% above last year. However, inventories have increased 9% since the start of the fiscal year. We had reduced inventory levels last year due to economic condition, but inventories finished the year even lower than we had planned because of stronger-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter. Our plan for this year continues to call for a high single-digit percentage increase in inventories.
Capital expenditures were $51 million in the first half of the year compared with $30 million last year. We are now on track to spend approximately $180 million this year, representing about 6% of sales and down from our previous forecast of $200 million. 
We are also repurchasing shares through a program that is both ongoing and opportunistic. We spent $33 million in the second quarter to buy almost 800,000 shares at an average cost of $41.16 per share. That brought our first half spending to $47 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares. There's about $355 million remaining under the currently authorized plan, which expires next January.
Tiffany finished the second quarter with $615 million of cash, equivalents and short-term investments compared with $334 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt at July 31 totaled $782 million versus $752 million last year, partly reflecting the translation effect on yen-denominated debt. 
Total debt to stockholders' equity declined to 40% at July 31 from 45% last year. We intend to spend a portion of our cash for the repayment of approximately $155 million of long-term debt over the next 12 months, while we will be refinancing about $115 million of other maturing long-term debt.

Those of you on this call know about, and we believe, appreciate the long-term approach we take to managing Tiffany's business and brand. So notwithstanding the obvious macro uncertainties, we remain committed to pursuing important expansion opportunities. 
Our worldwide plan is to open 14 stores in 2010. We began the year planning for 17 stores, but two have been postponed to 2011 due to construction delays beyond our control, and one plan in Canada is now postponed as well. Nonetheless, in the Americas, our plans include opening five new stores: in Baltimore, Jacksonville, The Woodlands in Houston, Santa Monica and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. 
In Europe, we'll be opening a store in London's Canary Wharf and a second store in Spain, in Barcelona. And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China and Korea, as well as the stores we have already opened in China, Singapore and Taiwan. 
We are also maintaining an active lineup of product introductions this year. We are enthusiastic about our new and extensive jewelry collection of yellow diamonds, which we first launched in Japan and Australia and which will soon debut in all regions.  And next week, we will launch a very enticing collection of leather handbags and accessories in its select U.S. stores and online, perhaps you've seen some of the favorable media coverage it's recently received. 
In addition, we've been very pleased with initial customer response to other new designs like Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh jewelry and the Tiffany Garden collection, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives. We've been expanding our very successful Keys, Charms and Return to Tiffany collections. As we said, we're pleased with customer response to new watches in our stores, and we look forward to a significant expansion of wholesale distribution. 
To build awareness of our new products and stores, we are spending more on marketing communications this year in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. There will be a significant step-up in marketing spending in the third quarter, some of which will be tied to our hosting a major customer and media event in Beijing. In fact, we noted in today's news release that the rate of earnings growth in the third quarter will be somewhat restrained by that increased marketing spending, but we believe the long-term benefits to the brand will far outweigh the short-term costs.
We've produced good results in the first half of 2010 and are looking to the back half with a sense of guarded optimism, to quote Mike Kowalski in today's news release. We are almost one month into the third quarter and are pleased to say that our consolidated worldwide sales growth has accelerated from the second quarter rate and is currently increasing at a low double-digit percentage pace with some variations by region. 
For the full year, our projections and assumptions are based on relatively unchanged economic conditions. Our full year projections call for an 11% increase in worldwide sales, and by region: a 10% sales increase in the Americas; a low single-digit percentage decline in Japan; a mid-20s percentage sales increase in Asia-Pacific; a mid-teens percentage increase in Europe; and other sales up modestly over last year. We expect about a 1.5 point increase in gross margin, and we'll maintain appropriate expense discipline.
Therefore, we are flowing through the better-than-expected second quarter earnings, as well as our expectation for a slightly stronger-than-initially-expected gross margin and are raising our earnings outlook for the year to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 per diluted share from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. 
Consistent with the previous outlook, this does not include net expenses related to the pending relocation of our New York headquarters staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total are now estimated at $0.06 per diluted share for the year.
In closing, we have a strong global organization and while there are economic uncertainties out there, we strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is very well positioned to meet the desires of current and future customers. 
That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Wednesday, November 24. And thanks for joining us."

We're very pleased with Tiffany's second quarter earnings growth as a stronger-than-expected gross margin more than offset sales growth that fell modestly short of our internal expectations. Worldwide sales grew 9% in the quarter, reflecting softer-than-expected growth in the Americas. However, sales results for total Asia-Pacific were generally solid and sales growth strengthened in Europe in the second quarter as we expected. And probably not surprisingly, there was continued softness in Japanese sales. 
We had a very strong increase in gross margin, and SG&A expense growth was well contained. So all in all, it was a good quarter, with net earnings from continuing operations up 19% and more relevant, up 45% when excluding some nonrecurring items recorded in the current and prior year period. And we modestly increased our full year earnings outlook. 
Let's first look at sales by segment. In the Americas region, sales increased 8% in the second quarter, which was lighter than we expected, especially due to softness earlier in the quarter. The 8% increase entirely resulted from an increase in the average transaction size. 
Our price stratification analysis indicated healthy growth in sales and transaction at most price points, including the highest end, but lower sales and transactions at price points below $500. Some of that softness below $500 might reflect the tough comparison to the launch in last year's second quarter of Tiffany Keys, and the softness might also say something about consumer behavior related to current economic conditions. In any case, Tiffany benefits from offering products in a broad range of price points.
Comparable store sales in the Americas rose 5% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis, on top of a 25% decline in last year's second quarter. Looking at the trend during the quarter, Americas' comps increased 5% in May versus a 27% decline last year, rose 2% in June versus a 25% decline and increased 9% in July versus a 23% decline last year. Comparable Americas' brand store sales increased 4% versus a 24% decline last year. Sales in the New York flagship store increased 8% in the quarter versus a 30% decline last year. In addition, the eight New York area branch stores posted a 12% comp increase in the quarter. 
There were no significant differences in performance among most regions, except for continued and pronounced softness in the Southwest U.S. region that includes Southern California, Arizona and Las Vegas. On the other hand, our sales in the Hawaii and Guam were very strong, and our stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted solid increases in the quarter. Looking at the customer mix, foreign tourists spending accounted for more than half of the sales growth in the quarter, with the largest increases from Asian customers and minimal sales growth to European tour visitors.
Interestingly, the entire increase in our New York flagship store sales came from higher sales to tourists, and Mayor Bloomberg recently projected that tourist visits to New York will reach record levels this year. While foreign tourism accounts for roughly 15% of U.S. store sales, it runs at roughly twice that rate in the New York flagship store.
Direct marketing, Internet and catalog sales in the Americas declined by 2% in the quarter, which was below our expectation and was due to a decline in orders shipped. In last year's second quarter, while retail store sales were still running down more than 20%, direct marketing sales had declined only 8% as it benefited from the launch of the Keys Collection. We're pleased to be seeing a resumption of direct marketing sales growth this month.
Now let's take a look at our growing business in Europe. Total sales increased 14% in the second quarter. However, year-over-year, the euro and pound, on average, were 10% and 7% weaker than the dollar in the quarter and were close to our internal forecast. Therefore, on the more meaningful constant exchange-rate basis, total European sales rose 25% and comparable store sales increased 21%. This was on top of a 5% comp increase last year.
After experiencing a slowdown in European sales near the end of the first quarter, comparable store sales growth improved steadily throughout the second quarter and actually rose by double-digit percentages in all three months. We were pleased that sales growth was pretty evenly divided between the U.K. and Continental Europe. The vast majority of our European business is transacted with local customers, but we are also seeing an increase in sales to foreign visitors, especially from China. And in mid-June, we launched e-commerce in eight countries in Continental Europe and are quite pleased with the initial numbers of both visits and orders.
Turning to Asia-Pacific. Total sales in the quarter were up 21% in dollars. On a constant exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 17%, and comparable store sales rose 7%, which was close to our expectation and on top of a 5% increase last year. The monthly trend was choppy, with the greatest strength in May and the greatest softness in June. 
Quarterly performance by country was mixed, ranging from total sales growth of more than 20% in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Korea to relatively flat sales in Australia and Taiwan. We opened two stores in Asia-Pacific in the quarter: one in the ifc mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai, which now gives us 12 stores in mainland China; and our fourth store in Singapore, this one in the new Marina Bay Sands Resort. 
In addition two days ago, we opened a store in Taipei in the Bellavita Mall, which brought us to six stores in Taiwan. Rounding out the geographical review by region is Japan, where total sales increased 4% in dollars. However, that reflected the year-over-year translation effect from a strong yen, which averaged 90 to the dollar in the second quarter versus 96 last year. On a constant-currency basis, total sales declined 2% and comparable store sales declined 7%, on top of an 11% comp decline last year. Our expectation was for just a slight comp decline.
Comps were down to varying degrees throughout the quarter, and the economic and retail environment in Japan remained challenging. Our objective is to enhance our existing store base and maximize profitability there. As example, earlier this month, we relocated and expanded a boutique within the Takashimaya store in Osaka and also closed the department store boutique in Kawasaki. 
Lastly, sales in the Other segment declined 19% in the second quarter. This was largely due to lower wholesale sales of rough diamonds, while our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets was virtually equal to the prior year. However, we are more focused now on growing our businesses in the Middle East and Russia.
In terms of merchandising highlights, worldwide sales grew in all major categories. Sales of engagement jewelry rose strongly in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, largely due to solid growth in units, as well as a higher average price. 
At the highest end, there was modest growth in statement jewelry sales over $50,000. There was also continued strong performance in celebration rings and other popular jewelry collections like Victoria, Metro and Heart. The Keys Collection remained strong at higher price points. 
Generally speaking, there was healthy demand for gold and platinum jewelry in contrast to silver jewelry sales, which were virtually equal to the prior year. The designer jewelry category had a good increase, and we were pleased to see Watch sales up more than 30% in the quarter, reflecting strong interest in our new Tiffany brand design.

Nonetheless, in the Americas, our plans include opening five new stores: in Baltimore, Jacksonville, The Woodlands in Houston, Santa Monica and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. 
In Europe, we'll be opening a store in London's Canary Wharf and a second store in Spain, in Barcelona. And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China and Korea, as well as the stores we have already opened in China, Singapore and Taiwan. 
We are also maintaining an active lineup of product introductions this year. We are enthusiastic about our new and extensive jewelry collection of yellow diamonds, which we first launched in Japan and Australia and which will soon debut in all regions.  And next week, we will launch a very enticing collection of leather handbags and accessories in its select U.S. stores and online, perhaps you've seen some of the favorable media coverage it's recently received. 
In addition, we've been very pleased with initial customer response to other new designs like Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh jewelry and the Tiffany Garden collection, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives. We've been expanding our very successful Keys, Charms and Return to Tiffany collections. As we said, we're pleased with customer response to new watches in our stores, and we look forward to a significant expansion of wholesale distribution. 
To build awareness of our new products and stores, we are spending more on marketing communications this year in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. There will be a significant step-up in marketing spending in the third quarter, some of which will be tied to our hosting a major customer and media event in Beijing. In fact, we noted in today's news release that the rate of earnings growth in the third quarter will be somewhat restrained by that increased marketing spending, but we believe the long-term benefits to the brand will far outweigh the short-term costs.
We've produced good results in the first half of 2010 and are looking to the back half with a sense of guarded optimism, to quote Mike Kowalski in today's news release. We are almost one month into the third quarter and are pleased to say that our consolidated worldwide sales growth has accelerated from the second quarter rate and is currently increasing at a low double-digit percentage pace with some variations by region. 
For the full year, our projections and assumptions are based on relatively unchanged economic conditions. Our full year projections call for an 11% increase in worldwide sales, and by region: a 10% sales increase in the Americas; a low single-digit percentage decline in Japan; a mid-20s percentage sales increase in Asia-Pacific; a mid-teens percentage increase in Europe; and other sales up modestly over last year. We expect about a 1.5 point increase in gross margin, and we'll maintain appropriate expense discipline.
Therefore, we are flowing through the better-than-expected second quarter earnings, as well as our expectation for a slightly stronger-than-initially-expected gross margin and are raising our earnings outlook for the year to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 per diluted share from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. 
Consistent with the previous outlook, this does not include net expenses related to the pending relocation of our New York headquarters staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total are now estimated at $0.06 per diluted share for the year.
In closing, we have a strong global organization and while there are economic uncertainties out there, we strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is very well positioned to meet the desires of current and future customers. 
That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Wednesday, November 24. And thanks for joining us."

Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now we can proceed. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of strong financial performance. Worldwide sales growth of 14% was higher than we expected. Gross margin was also better than we expected, and SG&A expense growth was in line with our expectations, all of which contributed to a solid 27% increase in earnings and a 43% increase in net earnings from continuing operations when excluding non-recurring items.
Despite challenging conditions that continue in some markets, these results reflect the powerful benefit from having a globally diversified store base. In fact, the combined sales of the Asia-Pacific, Japan and Europe regions actually exceeded our U.S. sales in the third quarter. 
Let's now look at the details. In the Americas, sales increased 9% in the third quarter. The overall sales growth came from increased average price per unit sold as strong unit growth in the engagement fine and designer jewelry categories was offset by unit declines in silver jewelry.
Comparable store sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 5% in the quarter versus a 10% decline last year. The trend improved as the quarter progressed, with increases of 1% in August, 6% in September and 10% in October. This compared with declines last year of 17%, 8% and 4% in the respective three months.
Please note that effective with our next report, we will be discontinuing the disclosure of specific monthly comp store sales numbers for the Americas. Instead in the future, we will discuss intra-quarter changes and trends in a more general and directional sense as we do for our other geographic regions, which we think is more relevant.
Continuing with the quarterly review, sales in the New York flagship store declined 3% in the quarter, but our annual Blue Book customer event in New York occurred last year in October and this year in November. The eight New York area branch stores posted a 1% comp increase. Comparable sales for brand stores in the Americas rose 8% in the quarter on top of a 10% decline last year. Looking around the Americas, there was generally consistent single-digit comp growth in most regions, with the exception of greater strength in the Pacific Northwest, as well as in Hawaii and Guam.
Sales to local market customers increased in the quarter, but a larger portion of the sales growth in the Americas continue to come from higher sales made to foreign visitors. The sales result in the New York flagship store reflected no significant changes in sales to either local customers or tourists. In terms of price stratification, we continue to see bifurcated performance with declines in sales and transactions below $500 but double-digit percentage increases in most every other higher-priced category. Indicating to us the diverging effects to one degree or another that the economy is having on consumer spending. 
During the third quarter, we opened new stores in Baltimore, Maryland at the center and in Santa Monica, California in Santa Monica Place and are very pleased with initial results.
And just earlier this month, we opened our jewel salon in the New York flagship store where we invite our highest spending clients from throughout the world to see our statement jewelry collection in a luxurious new environment. Complementing our stores in the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which increased 7% in the quarter due to an increased average order size. This compared with an 8% decline last year. 
And lastly, the Americas region includes Canada, Mexico and Brazil, and we are pleased to say that local currency comps in the quarter rose nicely in all three countries. We definitely see the potential for additional stores in those countries.
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where a 24% sales increase was generated by higher spending per transaction tied to unit volume growth, especially in the fine and engagement jewelry categories. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 20%, and comparable store sales rose 11% on top of a 9% increase last year. The trend during the quarter showed the largest increase in October.
The Greater China market now represents more than half of our Asia-Pacific sales, and it posted the highest total sales growth in the region. While most other countries were up to lesser degrees and Australia continued to be relatively soft. We held a glamorous event in Beijing in October within the Forbidden City. Attended by over 400 customers and members from the press, we were extremely pleased with the favorable reactions and extensive media coverage, which serve to heighten awareness of our brand and support Tiffany's growing position as a diamond authority throughout China as we move to double our store base there in the next few years.
Also during the quarter, we opened our sixth store in Taiwan, and we were pleased to launch informational websites last month in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which we know from historical experience should benefit our stores from the increased brand and product exposure that the websites provide. 
Turning to our business in Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the quarter as an increased average price per unit sold more than offset lower units. However, the sales growth was magnified by the yen being about 10% stronger than the U.S. dollar versus last year. Measured in local currency, total sales in Japan rose 2%, but comparable retail store sales declined 2%, which was on top of a 13% decline last year. The monthly trend improved during the quarter, and the comp in October was actually positive, although it's certainly too early to draw any conclusions from that.
Now let's look at our continued strength in Europe, where robust 22% sales growth was due to increases in jewelry unit sales and in the average price per unit sold. In the quarter, the euro and pound averaged 9% and 4% weaker than last year. Therefore, total European sales, excluding translation, rose 29%, and comparable store sales increased 24% on top of a 9% increase in last year's third quarter. Comps rose by at least 20% in all three months, and there was no meaningful difference in the strong performance between sales in the U.K. and in most Continental European countries.
A large majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, but we are seeing increasing sales to foreign visitors as well. In addition, this past June, we introduced e-commerce in Continental Europe, and it is generating sales above our expectations and probably also stimulating customer visits to our stores.
Rounding out our segments are other sales, which rose 26% in the third quarter, primarily due to increased wholesale sales of Tiffany products to third-party distributors in emerging markets such as Russia and the Middle East. 
Looking at a few merchandising highlights in the quarter. Sales of engagement jewelry were strong in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Statement jewelry and the fine jewelry category, including the Tiffany Garden and Metro collection, celebration rings and many others performed very well, reflecting the overall strength of higher-end transactions in platinum diamonds and gold. Conversely, worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly although pretty strongly in Europe and Asia, and the Keys Collection continues to perform well, especially in platinum and gold despite tough year-over-year comparison.
The designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso posted healthy sales increases, led by Elsa's always popular Diamonds by the Yard and Paloma's distinctive new Marrakesh collection. We are delighted with initial customer response to our new collection of extraordinary yellow diamonds. Tiffany brand watch sales continued to post strong growth in our stores. In fact, you can see one of the beautiful new watch designs today in our ad on Page 3 on both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. And lastly, we are very pleased with initial sales of our new leather accessories collection. So you can see that sales growth in the quarter spans the majority of product categories.
Turning to the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin in the quarter rose 3.7 points to 58.5%, which was higher than we expected. An important contributor to the higher margin was the price increase that we took earlier in the year to offset higher product costs over the past two years. In addition, there were also meaningful manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on the fixed costs that are in cost of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% in the third quarter, which were close to our expectation. We had said at the start of the year that SG&A would increase all year due to higher staffing and occupancy costs tied to store growth and that marketing costs would rise sharply all year in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales to reverse the steep reduction last year. In addition, we said that the increase in marketing spending would be greater in the third quarter to support the major event we held last month in Beijing.
SG&A in the third quarter also included about $6 million of non-recurring costs tied to the pending relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Last year, SG&A expenses included a $4 million charge related to terminating a management agreement after we bought out some minority interest in connection with our diamond sourcing and polishing operations in South Africa and Botswana. You can refer to the non-GAAP measures schedule in today's news release.
Excluding those onetime items, the SG&A increase over last year was also 15%, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 43.3% in the quarter versus 43% last year. Other expenses net, which is largely interest expense, was $13 million in the quarter versus $11.3 million last year. The effective tax rate was 34.9%, in line with our expectation, compared with 22% last year when there were favorable tax reserve adjustments tied to the expiration of certain statutory periods.
Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations rose 27% in the third quarter to $55.1 million, and EPS rose 26% to $0.43 per diluted share. And excluding the various non-recurring items, net earnings from continuing operations increased 43% in the third quarter and have increased 63% in the year-to-date. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

We are, obviously, very satisfied with Tiffany's overall financial performance in the third quarter, with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. New stores and new products are being well receive, and our infrastructure is performin",915,"Thanks, Mark. We are, obviously, very satisfied with Tiffany's overall financial performance in the third quarter, with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. New stores and new products are being well receive, and our infrastructure is performing efficiently to ensure product supply availability and timely distribution.
So we believe we are well positioned for a successful finish to 2010 and of course, the sustained solid performance over the longer term. We certainly have the financial strength to achieve our objectives. Our balance sheet at October 31 had $530 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $375 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt at October 31 stood at $755 million versus $753 million a year ago, and stockholders' equity was about $2 billion.
At October 31, Tiffany's return on average assets was 10%, and return on average stockholders' equity was 18%, both of which achieved our objectives. Looking at a few other items on the balance sheet, accounts receivable at October 31 were up 19% from a year ago, largely due to sales growth, and receivables are turning at a high 17x per year.
Net inventories at October 31 were up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to the addition of new stores and new products. In addition, about a third of the year-over-year increase resulted from translating foreign inventories into U.S. dollars. Inventory availability in our stores is high, and we expect the low double-digit percentage increase for the full year.
I want to add that our internal manufacturing facilities complemented by outside suppliers are performing very well to ensure that we have strong product supply. Last year, we internally produced 60% of merchandise sold. The net number will move higher in the coming years. In fact, we recently finalized plans to expand our U.S. jewelry manufacturing capacity, and we broke ground for a 25,000 square foot facility in Lexington, Kentucky. Earlier this year, we began some production in a temporary facility in Lexington and look forward to opening this new facility next spring, which will ultimately employ approximately 125 skilled workers.
Capital expenditures were $89 million in the year-to-date versus $47 million last year when we restricted spending wherever we could. And we are now forecasting full year CapEx of approximately $150 million, which is down from our previous forecast of $180 million, which results from some projects being carried over into 2011.
You should still assume that CapEx in future years will represent approximately 6% to 7% of sales, with 2011 CapEx probably at the upper end of that range. We've been repurchasing stock this year on a regular and also opportunistic basis. In the third quarter, we spent $26 million to buy back approximately 588,000 shares at an average cost of $43.68 per share. In the year-to-date, we spent $73 million to repurchase approximately 1.7 million shares at an average cost of $42.68. While we have $329 million of remaining purchase authority under our currently authorized program, which will expire in January, we do not expect to spend that full amount in the next two months.
We previously indicated our intentions to refinance a portion of the current maturity debt that was on our balance sheet at July 31. In September, we paid off JPY 15 billion or approximately $179 million of maturing debt and entered into JPY 10 billion or $118 million of new six-year debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. At October 31, we had about $100 million of current maturity long-term debt, which we intend to pay off as it comes due over the next year.
While we reduced our cash balances for debt reduction and share repurchases, I want to reiterate that we intend to maintain what we consider higher-than-normal liquidity in light of lingering economic uncertainties. Mark mentioned some of the new stores that we opened in the third quarter. There are additional exciting store openings in this fourth quarter. In the U.S., we will be opening stores the next few weeks in Jacksonville, a second Houston area store in The Woodlands and another store in Los Angeles in Beverly Center. 
In Asia-Pacific this month, we've opened a store in Kunming, China, another store in Seoul, Korea and we'll soon open a major store in China World in Beijing that will mark our 14th store in China. In Europe, two weeks ago, we opened our ninth location in London, a 260 square meter store in Canary Wharf and next week, we will add our second store in Spain when we open a 360 square meter location on Paseo De Gracia in Barcelona. Worldwide, this will bring us to 14 stores added in 2010 and one closed in Japan, representing a net 6% increase in the number of company operated stores. We have not finalized our store opening plans for next year, but I will share with you that we are looking at quite a number of attractive markets, and we'll accelerate the rate of store openings in 2011.
We indicated in today's news release that the fourth quarter has started very nicely, with sales growth exceeding our expectations even though the vast majority of the holiday season is certainly still ahead of us, we're pleased with the strong start. In terms of our financial outlook for the full year, we are now projecting worldwide sales growing 12% to just over $3 billion.
This implies a high single-digit percentage worldwide sales increase in the fourth quarter, with sales by region."

We expect the slight decline in other sales for the year. We've raised our gross margin expectation based on recent margin dynamics, and now look for about a two-point increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, this implies more than a two-point increase versus the previous expectation of 1.5 points. Related to that, since increasing our retail prices earlier this year, precious metal and diamond costs have moved higher. We used substantial quantities of platinum and silver, and their cost have increased substantially year-to-date. Gold has also increased but our usage is much smaller than platinum and silver, and costs for Tiffany quality diamonds are also up.
Of course, keep in mind that labor can be a meaningful portion of product costs, and labor costs have increased only modestly. Our strategy has always called for increasing retail prices when necessary and appropriate to offset higher product costs. And we would expect to take such action probably early next year. But as long as we assume that every jeweler also passes through their cost increases, Tiffany will maintain its strong competitive position.
Looking at the rest of our forecast, we continue to manage our SG&A expenses very effectively, and we expect SG&A expenses, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 10% to 11% for the year, which implies a high single-digit percentage increase in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect other expenses net of about $50 million for the full year, and we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 34% for the year.
In total, based on our higher-than-expected third quarter earnings and our increased assumptions for gross margin, we're now projecting net earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.72 to $2.77 per diluted share. Consistent with previous forecast, this does not include expenses related to the pending relocation of our New York headquarter staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total is estimated at $0.06 per diluted share. And it compares very favorably with our initial 2010 expectation of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share.
I'll close my remarks by reiterating that Tiffany's experienced organization, financial and brand strength position us very well for the long term to continue to reward our stockholders."

Measured in local currency, total sales in Japan rose 2%, but comparable retail store sales declined 2%, which was on top of a 13% decline last year. The monthly trend improved during the quarter, and the comp in October was actually positive, although it's certainly too early to draw any conclusions from that.
Now let's look at our continued strength in Europe, where robust 22% sales growth was due to increases in jewelry unit sales and in the average price per unit sold. In the quarter, the euro and pound averaged 9% and 4% weaker than last year. Therefore, total European sales, excluding translation, rose 29%, and comparable store sales increased 24% on top of a 9% increase in last year's third quarter. Comps rose by at least 20% in all three months, and there was no meaningful difference in the strong performance between sales in the U.K. and in most Continental European countries.
A large majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, but we are seeing increasing sales to foreign visitors as well. In addition, this past June, we introduced e-commerce in Continental Europe, and it is generating sales above our expectations, and probably also stimulating customer visits to our stores.
Rounding out our segments are other sales, which rose 26% in the third quarter, primarily due to increased wholesale sales of Tiffany products to third-party distributors in emerging markets such as Russia and the Middle East. 
Looking at a few merchandising highlights in the quarter. Sales of engagement jewelry were strong in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Statement jewelry and the fine jewelry category, including the Tiffany Garden and Metro collection, Celebration rings and many others performed very well, reflecting the overall strength of higher-end transactions in platinum diamonds and gold. Conversely, worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly, although pretty strongly in Europe and Asia. And the Keys Collection continues to perform well, especially in platinum and gold, despite tough year-over-year comparison.
The designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso posted healthy sales increases, led by Elsa's always popular Diamonds by the Yard and Paloma's distinctive new Marrakesh collection. We are delighted with initial customer response to our new collection of extraordinary yellow diamonds. Tiffany brand watch sales continued to post strong growth in our stores. In fact, you can see one of the beautiful new watch designs today in our ad on Page 3 of both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. And lastly, we are very pleased with initial sales of our new leather accessories collection. So you can see that sales growth in the quarter spans the majority of product categories.
Turning to the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin in the quarter rose 3.7 points to 58.5%, which was higher than we expected. An important contributor to the higher margin was the price increase that we took earlier in the year to offset higher product costs over the past two years. In addition, there were also meaningful manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on the fixed costs that are in cost of sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% in the third quarter, which were close to our expectation. We had said at the start of the year that SG&A would increase all year due to higher staffing and occupancy costs tied to store growth, and that marketing costs would rise sharply all year in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales to reverse the steep reduction last year. In addition, we said that the increase in marketing spending would be even greater in the third quarter to support the major event we held last month in Beijing.
SG&A in the third quarter also included about $6 million of non-recurring costs tied to the pending relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Last year, SG&A expenses included a $4 million charge related to terminating a management agreement after we bought out some minority interest in connection with our diamond sourcing and polishing operations in South Africa and Botswana. You can refer to the non-GAAP measures schedule in today's news release.
Excluding those one-time items, the SG&A increase over last year was also 15%, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 43.3% in the quarter versus 43% last year. Other expenses net, which is largely interest expense, was $13 million in the quarter versus $11.3 million last year. The effective tax rate was 34.9%, in line with our expectation, compared with 22% last year when there were favorable tax reserve adjustments tied to the expiration of certain statutory periods.
Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations rose 27% in the third quarter to $55.1 million, and EPS rose 26% to $0.43 per diluted share. And excluding the various non-recurring items, net earnings from continuing operations increased 43% in the third quarter and have increased 63% in the year-to-date. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

We are obviously very satisfied with Tiffany's overall financial performance in the third quarter, with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. New stores and new products are being well-received, and our infrastructure is performing",912,"Thanks, Mark. We are obviously very satisfied with Tiffany's overall financial performance in the third quarter, with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. New stores and new products are being well-received, and our infrastructure is performing efficiently to ensure product supply availability and timely distribution.
So we believe we are well-positioned for a successful finish to 2010 and, of course, the sustained solid performance over the longer term. We certainly have the financial strength to achieve our objectives. Our balance sheet at October 31 had $530 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $375 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt at October 31 stood at $755 million versus $753 million a year ago, and stockholders' equity was about $2 billion.
At October 31, Tiffany's return on average assets was 10%, and return on average stockholders' equity was 18%, both of which achieved our objectives. Looking at a few other items on the balance sheet, accounts receivable at October 31 were up 19% from a year ago, largely due to sales growth, and receivables are turning at a high 17x per year.
Net inventories at October 31 were up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to the addition of new stores and new products. In addition, about a third of the year-over-year increase resulted from translating foreign inventories into U.S. dollars. Inventory availability in our stores is high, and we expect a low double-digit percentage increase for the full year.
I want to add that our internal manufacturing facilities, complemented by outside suppliers, are performing very well to ensure that we have strong product supply. Last year, we internally produced 60% of merchandise sold. The net number will move higher in the coming years. In fact, we recently finalized plans to expand our U.S. jewelry manufacturing capacity, and we broke ground for a 25,000 square foot facility in Lexington, Kentucky. Earlier this year, we began some production in a temporary facility in Lexington, and look forward to opening this new facility next spring, which will ultimately employ approximately 125 skilled workers.
Capital expenditures were $89 million in the year-to-date versus $47 million last year when we restricted spending wherever we could. And we are now forecasting full year CapEx of approximately $150 million, which is down from our previous forecast of $180 million, which results from some projects being carried over into 2011.
You should still assume that CapEx in future years will represent approximately 6% to 7% of sales, with 2011 CapEx probably at the upper end of that range. We've been repurchasing stock this year on a regular, and also opportunistic, basis. In the third quarter, we spent $26 million to buy back approximately 588,000 shares at an average cost of $43.68 per share. In the year-to-date, we've spent $73 million to repurchase approximately 1.7 million shares at an average cost of $42.68. While we have $329 million of remaining purchase authority under our currently authorized program, which will expire in January, we do not expect to spend that full amount in the next two months.
We've previously indicated our intentions to refinance a portion of the current maturity debt that was on our balance sheet at July 31. In September, we paid off JPY 15 billion or approximately $179 million of maturing debt, and entered into JPY 10 billion or $118 million of new six-year debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. At October 31, we had about $100 million of current maturity long-term debt, which we intend to pay off as it comes due over the next year.
While we reduced our cash balances for debt reduction and share repurchases, I want to reiterate that we intend to maintain what we consider higher-than-normal liquidity in light of lingering economic uncertainties. Mark mentioned some of the new stores that we opened in the third quarter. There are additional exciting store openings in this fourth quarter. In the U.S., we will be opening stores the next few weeks in Jacksonville, a second Houston area store in The Woodlands and another store in Los Angeles in Beverly Center. 
In Asia-Pacific this month, we've opened a store in Kunming, China, another store in Seoul, Korea and we'll soon open a major store in China World in Beijing that will mark our 14th store in China. 
In Europe, two weeks ago, we opened our ninth location in London, a 260 square meter store in Canary Wharf, and next week, we will add our second store in Spain when we open a 360 square meter location on Paseo De Gracia in Barcelona. Worldwide, this will bring us to 14 stores added in 2010 and one closed in Japan, representing a net 6% increase in the number of company-operated stores. We have not finalized our store opening plans for next year, but I will share with you that we are looking at quite a number of attractive markets, and we'll accelerate the rate of store openings in 2011.
We indicated in today's news release that the fourth quarter has started very nicely, with sales growth exceeding our expectations. Even though the vast majority of the holiday season is certainly still ahead of us, we're pleased with the strong start. In terms of our financial outlook for the full year, we are now projecting worldwide sales growing 12% to just over $3 billion.
This implies a high single-digit percentage worldwide sales increase in the fourth quarter, with sales by region."

We expect a slight decline in other sales for the year. We've raised our gross margin expectation based on recent margin dynamics, and now look for about a two-point increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, this implies more than a two-point increase versus the previous expectation of 1.5 points. Related to that, since increasing our retail prices earlier this year, precious metal and diamond costs have moved higher. We used substantial quantities of platinum and silver, and their costs have increased substantially year-to-date. Gold has also increased, but our usage is much smaller than platinum and silver, and costs for Tiffany-quality diamonds are also up.
Of course, keep in mind that labor can be a meaningful portion of product costs, and labor costs have increased only modestly. Our strategy has always called for increasing retail prices when necessary and appropriate to offset higher product costs. And we would expect to take such action probably early next year. But as long as we assume that every jeweler also passes through their cost increases, Tiffany will maintain its strong competitive position.
Looking at the rest of our forecast, we continue to manage our SG&A expenses very effectively, and we expect SG&A expenses, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 10% to 11% for the year, which implies a high single-digit percentage increase in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect other expenses net of about $50 million for the full year, and we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 34% for the year.
In total, based on our higher-than-expected third quarter earnings and our increased assumptions for gross margin, we're now projecting net earnings from continuing operation in a range of $2.72 to $2.77 per diluted share. Consistent with previous forecasts, this does not include expenses related to the pending relocation of our New York headquarter staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total is estimated at $0.06 per diluted share. And it compares very favorably with our initial 2010 expectation of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share.
I'll close my remarks by reiterating that Tiffany's experienced organization, financial and brand strength position us very well for the long term to continue to reward our stockholders."

Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now we can proceed. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of strong financial performance. Worldwide sales growth of 14% was higher than we expected. Gross margin was also better than we expected, and SG&A expense growth was in line with our expectation, all of which contributed to a solid 27% increase in net earnings and a 43% increase in net earnings from continuing operations when excluding non-recurring items.
Despite challenging conditions that continue in some markets, these results reflect the powerful benefit from having a globally diversified store base. In fact, the combined sales of the Asia-Pacific, Japan and Europe regions actually exceeded our U.S. sales in the third quarter. 
Let's now look at the details. In the Americas, sales increased 9% in the third quarter. The overall sales growth came from increased average price per unit sold, as strong unit growth in the engagement, fine and designer jewelry categories was offset by unit declines in silver jewelry.
Comparable store sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 5% in the quarter versus a 10% decline last year. The trend improved as the quarter progressed, with increases of 1% in August, 6% in September and 10% in October. This compared with declines last year of 17%, 8% and 4% in the respective three months.
Please note that effective with our next report, we will be discontinuing the disclosure of specific monthly comp store sales numbers for the Americas. Instead, in the future, we will discuss intra-quarter changes and trends in a more general and directional sense, as we do for our other geographic regions, which we think is more relevant.
Continuing with the quarterly review, sales in the New York flagship store declined 3% in the quarter, but our annual Blue Book customer event in New York occurred last year in October and this year in November. The eight New York area branch stores posted a 1% comp increase. Comparable sales for brand stores in the Americas rose 8% in the quarter on top of a 10% decline last year. Looking around the Americas, there was generally consistent single-digit comp growth in most regions, with the exception of greater strength in the Pacific Northwest, as well as in Hawaii and Guam.
Sales to local market customers increased in the quarter, but a larger portion of the sales growth in the Americas continue to come from higher sales made to foreign visitors. The sales result in the New York flagship store reflected no significant changes in sales to either local customers or tourists. In terms of price stratification, we continued to see bifurcated performance, with declines in sales and transactions below $500 but double-digit percentage increases in most every other higher-priced category, indicating to us the diverging effects, to one degree or another, that the economy is having on consumer spending. 
During the third quarter, we opened new stores in Baltimore, Maryland, in the Towson Center and in Santa Monica, California, in Santa Monica Place, and are very pleased with initial results.
And just earlier this month, we opened our jewel salon in the New York flagship store, where we invite our highest-spending clients from throughout the world to see our statement jewelry collection in a luxurious new environment. Complementing our stores in the Americas are internet and catalog sales, which increased 7% in the quarter due to an increased average order size. This compared with an 8% decline last year. 
And lastly, the Americas region includes Canada, Mexico and Brazil, and we are pleased to say that local currency comps in the quarter rose nicely in all three countries. We definitely see the potential for additional stores in those countries.
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where a 24% sales increase was generated by higher spending per transaction tied to unit volume growth, especially in the fine and engagement jewelry categories. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 20%, and comparable store sales rose 11% on top of a 9% increase last year. The trend during the quarter showed the largest increase in October.
The Greater China market now represents more than half of our Asia-Pacific sales, and it posted the highest total sales growth in the region while most other countries were up to lesser degrees, and Australia continued to be relatively soft. We held a glamorous event in Beijing in October within the Forbidden City. Attended by over 400 customers and members from the press, we were extremely pleased with the favorable reactions and extensive media coverage, which had served to heighten awareness of our brand and support Tiffany's growing position as a diamond authority throughout China, as we move to double our store base there in the next few years.
Also during the quarter, we opened our sixth store in Taiwan, and we were pleased to launch informational websites last month in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which we know from historical experience should benefit our stores from the increased brand and product exposure that the websites provide. 
Turning to our business in Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the quarter, as an increased average price per unit sold more than offset lower units. However, the sales growth was magnified by the yen being about 10% stronger than the U.S. dollar versus last year. Measured in local currency, total sales in Japan rose 2%, but comparable retail store sales declined 2%, which was on top of a 13% decline last year.

We've raised our gross margin expectation based on recent margin dynamics, and now look for about a two-point increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, this implies more than a two-point increase versus the previous expectation of 1.5 points. Related to that, since increasing our retail prices earlier this year, precious metal and diamond costs have moved higher. We used substantial quantities of platinum and silver, and their costs have increased substantially year-to-date. Gold has also increased, but our usage is much smaller than platinum and silver, and costs for Tiffany-quality diamonds are also up.
Of course, keep in mind that labor can be a meaningful portion of product costs, and labor costs have increased only modestly. Our strategy has always called for increasing retail prices when necessary and appropriate to offset higher product costs. And we would expect to take such action probably early next year. But as long as we assume that every jeweler also passes through their cost increases, Tiffany will maintain its strong competitive position.
Looking at the rest of our forecast, we continue to manage our SG&A expenses very effectively, and we expect SG&A expenses, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 10% to 11% for the year, which implies a high single-digit percentage increase in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect other expenses net of about $50 million for the full year, and we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 34% for the year.
In total, based on our higher-than-expected third quarter earnings and our increased assumptions for gross margin, we're now projecting net earnings from continuing operation in a range of $2.72 to $2.77 per diluted share. Consistent with previous forecasts, this does not include net expenses related to the pending relocation of our New York headquarter staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total is estimated at $0.06 per diluted share. And it compares very favorably with our initial 2010 expectation of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share.
I'll close my remarks by reiterating that Tiffany's experienced organization, financial and brand strength position us very well for the long term to continue to reward our stockholders."
