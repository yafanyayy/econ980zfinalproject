Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also with the us is Scott Anderson, President of Patterson Dental Supply and my successor to the CEO role at the end of the fiscal year. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve, Scott and I will be pleased to take your questions. Such Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for full year 2010 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail on our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.Turning now to our third quarter results. Patterson performed generally in line with our expectations during this period. Consolidated sales rose 1% to $820.1 million. Third quarter earnings of $56 million or $0.47 per diluted share were up 6% from $52.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009. Over the past year, we have instituted a range of expense control measures in response to economic downturn that has streamlined our cost structure and slowed our expense growth. These actions have benefited our third quarter earnings. Turning now to a brief review of our business unit performances. Sales of Patterson Dental, our largest business declined 2% to $572.1 million in the third quarter. Within Patterson Dental, sales consumable dental supplies and printed office products rose 2% from last year's third quarter. We're encouraged that the internally-generated sales of consumables, excluding foreign currency adjustments and acquisitions were up slightly, making the first such consumables growth since the fall of 2008 when the economy started to deteriorate sharply. All in all we feel that our Consumable business has held up relatively well during the first nine months of 2010. With many patients have elected the four [ph] high-end in cosmetic procedures for economic related reasons. Sales of dental equipment and software declined 10% from the year earlier level that was with consistent with our internal forecast for this period. We believe that purchasing decisions of dental practitioners for new equipment are continuing to be affected by the weak economy. Sales of dental equipment also faced a difficult comparison with the third quarter of fiscal 2009 when we significantly outperformed the overall dental equipment market. As we have reported since then, the basic equipment market has been soft. Although sales of CEREC dental restorative systems were down modestly in the third quarter, sales were up on a sequential quarterly basis. This was encouraging since new CEREC systems accounted for a substantial portion of our third quarter sales, as compared to the first half of the year when trade-ups to the new Bluecam AC imaging unit represented the majority of the activity. We believe the unequal performance of CEREC has made us the most viable choice for dentist purchasing next generation CAD/CAM equipment. Sales of Webster Veterinary increased 5% in the third quarter of 2010 to $151.8 million. Websters third quarter results reflected the fact that the winter months marked the seasonally softness period of the year for Webster due to reduced demand for flea, tick and hardware medications. Moreover, sales of veterinary equipment remains sluggish as many veterinary practices remained cautious about purchasing equipments. The integration of Columbus CERES company, a large value added distributors serving the mid-Atlantic and Midwestern market that was acquired in 2008 should be largely complete by the end of our year. This will allow us to remove additional cost from the combined operation. The performance of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit also met our expectations in the third quarter. Sales rose 18% to $96.2 million, with the acquisitions of Mobilis Healthcare Group in April 2009 and Empi Therapy Solutions in June 2009 accounted for most of this increase. The integration of these businesses is proceeding on schedule and we are pleased with our contributions to our third quarter performance.Patterson Medical continue to increase its share of the global rehabilitation market in the third quarter. We also believe that the overall rehabilitation market continued firming during this period. All in all, we believe Patterson Medical's prospects are encouraging. But only one more quarter left in 2010, we refined our full year earnings guidance in this morning's release to $1.74 to $1.78 per diluted share from the previous reported $1.70 to $1.80 per share. Looking farther down the road, we remain optimistic about Patterson's future. Our three businesses are aggressively marketing their products, we are generating substantial operating cash flows providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. And now, Scott Anderson will provide some perspective on the dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets as we move into the next fiscal year. Thank you. Scott?"

As I transition into my new responsibilities, I want to take a few minutes this morning to present my perspective on Patterson's future and our priorities for continuing to build on its success. My style will be different than Jim's, that's natural, but my core philosophies for leading and managing this business are very much in alignment with Jim and Pete Frechette, our Chairman. We will continue to take care of our customers, great opportunities for our employees and build on our strong history of profitable operations to create value for our shareholders. We are in three very strong markets today and in time, with the right opportunities, we could enter additional specialty markets, but that is not a high priority in the near term. Our strategy for serving our markets will remain the same and is comprised of five key elements: Being a value-added, single source for supplier for goods and services, building strong relationships with our customers through a knowledgeable dedicated sales and technical service force, bringing new innovative products to the practitioner that allow them to treat more patients with improved outcomes, investing in systems and services and provide solutions to the practitioners' business needs and operating with a decentralized organizational structure placing decision-making close to the customer and providing local economy and accountability. We believe that the dentist, veterinarian and therapist entering their profession today and in the future will be embracing technology at an ever increasing pace. To serve them and our existing customers, we have committed to a new 100,000 square foot state-of-the-art technology center that will replace our current facility allowing our over 300 staff to continue to provide industry-leading products, services and support to customers and vendors. Turning now to some key priorities as I move into the leadership role of Patterson. We are in difficult economic times and each of our business unit is feeling the effect to some degree. But as the economy begins to recover, our first priority is to reestablish our historical industry-leading operating performance. Over the past several years, we have made numerous strategic investments in the company both internally in people, systems and programs and externally in acquisitions. In various ways, these investments have dampened our operating performance. We now need to sharpen our execution focus and deliver return on these investments. Another priority will be creating better and more effective programs to train our people to meet the demands of our ever evolving customer needs. Our legacy as one of leadership in innovation in our markets. And we will continue to build on that history. This will include finding new products and services to bring to our customers, and build a new system that create competitive advantage for our customers and our people. We are currently in our planning process, develop our operating strategies and programs for fiscal 2011 so we are not prepared to provide any specific guidance for this period, but it may be helpful to discuss briefly how we see our markets shaping up. In the dental area, we saw signs of stabilization in our Consumable business in the third quarter when we posted our first positive internally-generated sales growth in five quarters. We see this trend continuing in fiscal 2011. Although progress with our Consumable business will likely be gradual as we continue to contend with high unemployment and soft consumer confidence. The market growth for consumables could be in the low-single digits for this period. In the area of dental equipment, many dental practitioners postponed major office remodeling and expansion projects as a result of the weak economy. We believe that once status regains its efficient confidence in the economy, they will push forward with their plans and resume purchasing new equipment. If the overall economy sees modest growth in calendar 2010, we believe it is quite possible to see the dental equipment market grow mid to high single-digits in our fiscal 2011. The companion-pet veterinary market is probably growing in the range of 2% to 4% driven by steadily growing pet ownership and the fact that household tend to treat their pets as integral parts of their family. We would see a continuation of this trend for fiscal 2011. A major focus for our veterinary unit for the next fiscal year will be building on the Equipment and Software business. The demands by the pet owner for more extensive services from the veterinarian will require capital investment by practitioners to meet these demands. We see this as a terrific opportunity for this portion of our business. Patterson Medical's experience with the recession has been somewhat mixed as well. It's consumable supply business is held up reasonably well, while equipment sales have been soft. Patterson Medical is strongly positioned to gain share from smaller competitors and continue making strategic acquisitions. Additional geographic expansion is planned, primarily through a greenfield approach. A portion of which will be accomplished in a highly cost-effective manner by using space in our dental branches. Patterson Medical's growth also will be driven by continued expansion of its sales force. We believe the rehabilitation and therapy market could see growth in the low-single digits in our next fiscal year and of course, this is couched by whatever might come out of Washington in the way of healthcare legislation. Taken as a whole, we believe that all of our markets should gradually strengthen during the coming year are in the possibility of further negative macroeconomic pressure. Let me conclude my comments by saying that it is an honor to be named as Jim Wiltz's successor. Jim, having served in numerous management posts during his more than 40 years with Patterson merits our sincere thanks for his many contributions to Patterson's success. He also leaves large shoes to be filled and I am pleased that we have an extremely deep, talented and capable management team to help lead Patterson into the years just ahead. Thank you. Now, Steve will provide additional details on Patterson's third quarter financial performance."

Let me begin with a couple of comments on our sales performance. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for two percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a one point positive impact. Each of our operating units produce positive growth in sales and consumable supplies. But as Jim noted, capital goods remains soft. Our decline in equipment revenues was exacerbated this period by our relative strength in last year's third quarter. Particularly in the Dental segment where we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points. While the equipment market remains difficult and we are not immune to the economic conditions affecting it, we believe this market is stabilized. In addition, going forward, the year-over-year comparison has become a bit easier. Our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter improved by 50 basis points from the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of product mix. Both the Dental and Veterinary segments saw their product margins expand in the quarter. While the Medical segment experienced some erosion in its gross margin, we expect this effect to dissipate as acquisitions completed earlier this year are more fully integrated. Because the Medical segment has the highest gross margin of our three segments and likely faster revenue growth until these acquisitions anniversary into our results there will be a positive impact on our consolidated gross margins from this mix effect due to fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our operating expense leverage declined 30 basis points in the quarter due to the expenses related to the integration of the Columbus Serum, Mobilis, Dolphin and Empi Therapy's operations into our system. Including the intangible amortization arising from the purchase accounting process. Again, we are expecting improvement in our expense leverage in the fourth quarter of the year. By segment, our third quarter operating margins were 13.1% for dental, 13.4% for medical, and 3.9% for veterinary. As we reported last quarter, we are now estimating an effective tax rate for the year of 37.8%. We have seen our effective state income tax rate increased this year, at the same time that we have realized less benefit from our tax reinvestment income. For the current quarter, we had favorable discrete tax items that lowered the tax rate slightly and we anticipate a similar rate for the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet shows our inventory levels are relatively consistent with this year's second quarter level. The increase of $32 million from the prior year balance result from the normal seasonal increases on our warehouse inventories to improve service levels, along with some impact from the acquisitions we made. As we have historically done, we expect to work these inventories down before our year end to minimize the impact of our LIFO valuation method. Our DSO stands at 42 days compared to 42 days in the prior year, while inventory turns are at 7.2 compared to 6.7 a year ago. The DSO exclude the impact of the finance contracts that have been generated during our CEREC promotions over the past year or so. These contracts will continue to be sold to our regular funding sources in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $98 million in the third quarter compared to $15 million in the year-earlier period. For the nine months, our cash flow from operations was $153 million compared to $72 million for the same period last year. Most of the change in operating cash flow for both the current and year-to-date periods resulted from the sale of finance contracts in the third quarter versus the build of contracts that we reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We are continuing to estimate that capital expenditures will total approximately $30 million to $35 million for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, we are negotiating the purchase of an existing facility that will accommodate the consolidation of several of our smaller Mid-Western distribution centers. This initiative is part of our continuing program to consolidate our distribution function. We had originally planned to build a suit project for fiscal 2011 and when an existing facility was identified, we decided to move the project forward into fiscal 2010. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to the conference operator for your prep questions. Damien?"

But we feel definitely that it has stabilized and we think the worst is behind us in terms of the Basic Equipment business."

Good morning and thanks for participating in our fourth quarter conference call. I am humbled to be doing my inaugural call as Patterson’s CEO, considering the two gentlemen who have preceded me in this role, Pete Frechette and Jim Wiltz, both outstanding leaders and change agents in the specialty distribution market.
Let me begin by noting that joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we’ve provided financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson’s actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Consolidated sales rose 4% to $812.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Internal growth accounted for 1% of our fourth quarter sales growth with acquisitions and foreign currency adjustments accounting for the balance. Fourth quarter earnings of $61.8 million or $0.52 per diluted share were up 15% from $54 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the year, consolidated sales totaled $3.2 billion, up 5% from $3.1 billion in fiscal 2009. Net income for the year came to $212.3 million or $1.78 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from $199.6 million or $1.69 per diluted share in fiscal 2009.
Patterson’s overall fourth quarter results generally reflect the impact of the nation’s slow economic recovery. This impact was particularly evident in the performance of our Patterson dental unit, which recorded sales growth of 3% to $527.3 million in the fourth quarter. Sales were affected by uneven patient demand for dental services that affected our consumables business, as well as by the hesitancy of practitioners to commit to new capital investments.
However, we believe the dental market is stabilizing, and we are encouraged by some preliminary indications that the market may be starting to strengthen. For example, sales of digital imaging systems, including sensors, panoramic and combing units grew over 18% in the fourth quarter. Although a broadly based recovery of the dental market is expected to be gradual, we are taking a pro-active approach, having initiated new sales and marketing programs to stimulate sales in several product categories. This approach includes using our leadership in equipment technology to bolster our performance until the market recovers for basic equipment, including chairs, power units, and cabinetry.
As evidenced by the robust sales growth of imaging products, dental practitioners are more willing at this time to invest in systems that offer a strong return on investment over a relatively short period. For this reason, we believe the outlook for many of our technology products remains promising.
And while CEREC sales were off approximately 10% in the recent quarter, we strongly believe this product will be a significant contributor to the future of dentistry. In an economy, where selling capital goods has been a challenge, CEREC sales rose over 15% for the year, and we believe we should see similar growth in fiscal 2011.
We believe Patterson is positioned to capture a significant share of the equipment business both basic and new technology that has been deferred during the past two years due to concerns about the economy.
From an operational standpoint, I would also like to briefly review a number of recent developments at our dental operation. We extended Patterson’s exclusive distribution agreement for Schick digital x-ray products in the US and Canada to December 31, 2012. Schick, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sirona Dental Systems, is the acknowledged leader in digital sensor technology, which is one of the fastest growing segments in dentistry. Extending our exclusive agreement with Schick will enable us to continue providing the best digital x-ray solutions to dentists.
As I mentioned last quarter, we are building a new 100,000 square foot state-of-the-art technology center that will replace our smaller current facility. The new centre will serve technology needs not only of dentist, but also veterinarians and physical and occupational therapists. We believe our customers will be embracing technology at a steadily growing pace, and our extended technology centre will enable Patterson to meet their needs.
Turning now to Webster sales of our veterinarian unit increased 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to $162 million. We were generally pleased with Webster’s fourth-quarter performance, although revenues were affected by a shift in its sales mix towards agency sales of certain pharmaceuticals. This sales mix shift masked an increase in consumable sales that we believe would have been between 5% and 6% on a comparable basis.
We also were encouraged by improved sales of veterinary equipment, equipment which constitutes a relatively small part, small but growing portion of Webster’s revenue stream, represents a key facet of Webster’s drive to expand and strengthen its value-added proposition.
During the fourth quarter, Webster entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with VetSource, a leading North American provider of integrated pharmacy distribution services, including a home delivery capability. We believe that offering the VetSource solution further strengthens Webster’s value-added platform. We also made a minority equity investment in VetSource, but since we closed this transaction late in the quarter this transaction had virtually no impact on Webster’s fourth-quarter results.
Finally, the integration of Columbus Serum Company, a large value-added distributor serving the mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets that was acquired in October 2008 was completed by the end of fiscal 2010.
Sales of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit rose 18% in the fourth quarter to $103.5 million. Internally generated sales rose 4%, while the acquisitions of Mobilis Healthcare Group in April 2009 and Empi Therapy Solutions in June 2009 accounted for the balance of the fourth-quarter sales increase. These acquired units are continuing to meet our expectations and their integration is proceeding on schedule. Expenses related to these acquisitions continued to moderate in the fourth quarter. The overall rehabilitation market continued to firm in the fourth quarter, and we believe Patterson Medical continued to increase its share of the global rehabilitation market during this period.
Reflecting the significant investments that were made in Patterson Medical over the past few years, we believe our rehabilitation business is positioned as a strong growth driver going forward. All in all, we believe Patterson Medical had an outstanding year, and we are excited about our future in this market. Regarding Patterson Medical’s future, we're continuing to identify and evaluate additional acquisition opportunities for this business. I should add that our need to retain infrastructure in acquired entities will diminish given the investments we have already made in this business. This should allow us to integrate acquisitions faster and with less disruption to our operating metrics.
Before turning to our financial guidance for fiscal 2011, I would like to briefly review our capital allocation strategy. As previously announced, our board of directors approved initiating a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share in March, and the first dividend was paid on April 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 2.
Acquisitions and other critical investments in our three businesses will remain a top priority for our cash, and we believe that our earnings potential, strong financial condition and substantial operating cash flows provide the financial flexibility required to support both a dividend program and continued business investment. Also, as part of our capital allocation strategy approximately 6 million common shares remain available under our previously authorized 25 million share repurchase program. We intend to use this authorization to repurchase an equivalent number of shares as are issued under our employee share plans in order to maintain a relatively constant number of outstanding shares.
As we stated in this morning's release, we're forecasting earnings of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for fiscal 2011. It should be noted that the first quarter of fiscal year includes one additional selling week, due to our 52-week, 53-week fiscal year convention.
As we begin this decade with new leadership, we remain very optimistic about Patterson's future. Our three businesses have strong sustainable competitive advantages, driven by talented and highly motivated employees. We are generating substantial operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. And the overall health of our three markets is gradually strengthening and all have compelling long-term growth drivers.
Thank you and now, Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights from our fourth-quarter performance.

I want to begin my comments with a brief review of our gross margins. Consolidated gross margin improved 90 basis points this quarter, primarily as a result of improvements at the medical and veterinary segments. Our gross margin also be",516,"Thank you. Scott. I want to begin my comments with a brief review of our gross margins. Consolidated gross margin improved 90 basis points this quarter, primarily as a result of improvements at the medical and veterinary segments. Our gross margin also benefited from medical’s higher revenue growth rate, hence resulting in favorable impact on our consolidated gross margin mix.
In analyzing these margins, the improvements are generally as a result of period specific items such as rebates, and going forward we would expect fiscal 2011 consolidated gross margins to be more in line with our annual results. Conversely, our operating expense ratio in the quarter is higher than we would expect to see going forward due to incentive compensation expense earned this year compared to last year.
We are expecting to see improvements in our expense leverage in fiscal 2011. Since, as Scott noted, 2011 will be a 53 week year, and this generally allows the capture of more operating leverage in these periods.
Turning to operating margins by segment, the dental margin was 12.9% for the quarter. The veterinary and medical segments reported operating margins of 7.1% and 16.7% respectively. In the quarter tax expense benefited from the dividends paid on the shares held by our employee stock ownership trust. This portion of the dividend is deductible on our income tax return. This benefit along with several other discreet items accounts for the majority of the decrease in the tax rates between the periods. As we look to fiscal 2011, we expect the tax rate in the mid-37% range.
Looking now at our cash flow, we generated approximately $112 million from operations in the quarter, compared to $54 million in the prior year. As many of you know, we made the decision to invest in various financing promotions to support marketing efforts directed at the CEREC product line beginning in the second quarter of our fiscal 2009. These promotions ran through the close of the fiscal year, and were used to a lesser degree in fiscal 2010. At this year and, we held approximately $62 million of finance contracts, arising from the fiscal 2010 promotions that we could not immediately sell to our funding sources due to certain requirements in our arrangements with these entities.
We expect to liquidate the majority of these contracts in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and should see an incremental impact on our operating cash flow from the sale of these contracts in that period.
A couple of notes on our balance sheet, our DSO stood at 44 days similar to the prior year end and again excluding the finance contracts just discussed. Our inventory turns improved to 7.1, up from 6.8 one year ago.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2011, we expect our CapEx to approximate $35 million to $40 million, while depreciation and amortization should be in the vicinity of $40 million. The CapEx includes the new technology center, and the build out of the new South Bend distribution centre.
With that, I'll turn it back to our operator who will poll you for your questions. Alisha?

You know, first, I think we are never completely satisfied, but then we're up against tough comparable in CEREC a year ago. We have just started rolling with the launch of the AC Bluecam, and had a very aggressive finance promotion. Our confidence in CEREC, and let us start with the trade up program, is we would like to see that be as at least as successful as our last trade up program a year ago.
We think the market acceptance of the AC Bluecam has been very strong, and we have a large pool of CEREC customers that are out there that still need to be upgraded. So, I think the data points are still little bit too early. We're only three or four weeks into our fiscal year activity side, but I wouldn't give you more than that right now.
In terms of confidence in CEREC going forward, you know, the things I look at is we now have over 11,000 users in North America. You have seen Sirona as a partner continue to invest in research and development and really push the envelope of the technology, things like the Galileo’s integration are all compelling reasons for the dentists of tomorrow to get into this technology.
And I think, as we have talked quite a bit the next generation of dentists are going to embrace technology in a very real way, and we think CEREC is right in the middle of that game. So we think 15% growth this year is extremely doable and given an improving economy, hopefully that will be a low number.

It is much more difficult to quantify.
The impact to the bottom line or to the operating line, you are correct we do get some and should get some lift just from the increased revenues with the fixed cost structure. But again a lot of the cost structure is not totally fixed, and so even you are going to have an extra week of compensation expense in there in many cases, you are going to have warehousing cost and so forth, incremental warehousing cost. So the leverage starts to, you don't get it, if not totally a variable incremental benefit at the operating line, so be cautious with it.
We see it generally is about $0.02 to $0.04 in our best estimates of what the impact might be to the bottom line.

We will do a dilutive acquisition at the bottom line if we think it makes sense long-term for the business. As you know, our numbers reflect - some of metrics do suffer in the near term as we do acquisitions because of some of the amortization and absorbing the infrastructure costs of those acquisitions. As Scott said, we particularly in the medical space we’ve had to add the infrastructure over the last several years as we’ve done acquisitions and (inaudible) for our metrics. We are to a point now where we think there’s going to be less of that going forward and most of the acquisitions that you would see in dental and vet going forward, would be pretty much tuck ins.

Good morning, and thanks for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I",1254,"Thank you, Craig. Good morning, and thanks for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions. Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report in Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
As a reminder, our first quarter results included the impact of an extra 14th week, which will make fiscal 2011 a 53-week year ending on April 30, 2011.
It's difficult to quantify the exact impact of this additional week on our first quarter results, but we will provide estimates in those areas where it is possible to make reasonable approximations.
In the first quarter, consolidated sales of $850 million rose 8% from $790 million in the year-earlier period. The impact of the additional week is estimated to be approximately five percentage points. Net income of $54 million or $0.45 per diluted share rose 20% from $45 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We're generally pleased with Patterson's first quarter results, considering the ongoing effect of sluggish economic conditions within our served markets.
Sales of Patterson Dental Supply increased 6% to $543 million in this year's first quarter. Sales of consumable dental supplies rose 7% from last year's first quarter, and were essentially unchanged from the year-earlier period after excluding the impact of the additional week. Our Consumable business is continuing to be affected by uneven patient demand for dental services as a result of the soft economy. However, our consumable results over the past few quarters suggest that the overall dental market is stabilizing. As we predicted earlier this calendar year, consumable demand has remained soft throughout the summer, but we believe there could be modest growth during the latter half of our fiscal year. 
At the same time, we are encouraged by the strong sales growth of our non-CEREC equipment, which was up 13% in the quarter, including a 17% in basic dental equipment. The 17% increase was led by sales of cone beam and panoramic imaging system, but sales in all major categories including chairs, units, cabinetry and lighting grew in the quarter. It needs to be pointed out that it is difficult to measure the impact of an extra week on equipment sales due to such factors as the length of time from initial order installation, which can span several months between quarters. Even so, we believe that sales of basic dental equipment still would've been solidly higher on a fully comparable year-over-year basis. We believe this growth reflects our ability to capture significant share of the Equipment business that has been deferred for the past two years.
Sales of digital sensors and CEREC equipment were down in the first quarter reflecting a strong comparable sales level that each of these categories faced versus the last year's first quarter. The strength of our CEREC line in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was generated primarily by the high level of interest in our initial trade-up program following the introduction of the CEREC AC imaging unit early in calendar 2009. A similar CEREC trade-up program has been running through this year's first quarter and will end later this month.
For the full year, we continue to believe that CEREC sales should increase by at least 10%, and we are committing substantial marketing resources to accomplish this goal. Digital sensors sales in last year first quarter were aided by a financing promotion that was not run this year.
Turning now to Webster Veterinary. Sales of our veterinary unit increased 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to $180 million. We were generally pleased with Webster's first quarter performance, including the solidly higher equipment sales reported for this period. Equipment, which constitutes a relatively small but growing portion of Webster's revenue stream, represents a key facet of Webster's drive to expand and strengthen its value-added proposition. Steve will provide greater detail in a few minutes, but we estimate that the impact of the additional week was largely offset by several factors that adversely affected the comparability of Webster's sales, including changes in the distribution arrangements for certain pharmaceuticals and the exiting of Production Animal business that was part of Columbus Serum operation prior to its acquisition. As a result, we believe Webster's reported 6% sales growth reflects the performance of its ongoing business in the first quarter. I want to add that Webster will continue to experience the impact of the sales mix shift and the absence of the Large Animal business on its sales for approximately two more quarters.
Sales of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, increased 17% to $127 million in this year's first quarter. Acquisitions contributed approximately 10 percentage points of Patterson Medical's first quarter sales growth, while the additional week accounted for approximately five percentage points.
We believe the overall rehabilitation market continue to firm in the first quarter and that Patterson Medical continue to increase its share of the global rehabilitation market during this period. The acquisition that benefited Patterson Medical's first quarter performance included Empi Therapy Solutions in June 2009 and the Rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare in June 2010. The previously reported DCC acquisition is of particular strategic importance. The acquired DCC business ranked among the leaders in their respective overseas markets, and had combined sales of approximately $70 million for their fiscal year that ended March 31, 2010.
They provide assisted-living products and rehabilitation equipment and supplies to hospitals, physical and occupational therapists, long-term care facilities, dealers and consumers in the U.K. and continental Europe. In addition to significantly strengthening the market presence and geographic reach of our Homecraft Rolyan unit in U.K., the acquired business bring a stable of trusted and established brands that encompass an extensive range of products. The integration of the acquired units is proceeding on schedule, and expenses related to the DCC transaction are expected to gradually moderate over the next several quarters. 
We are not anticipating any meaningful contribution to our earnings from this acquisition for the remainder of fiscal 2011 after factoring in the cost of integration and the incremental amortization of intangible assets arising from the evaluation process. We believe our Rehabilitation business is positioned as a strong growth driver going forward, and we are continuing to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities for this business.
Regarding the financial outlook contained in this morning's release, our expectations for fiscal 2011 have not changed from our previously issued guidance. And we are maintaining our earnings forecast of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for the full year.
Looking ahead, the health of our dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets is gradually strengthening, and all have compelling long-term growth opportunities. Our three businesses are well positioned to capitalize on these. Moreover, we're generating substantial operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. All in all, we are optimistic about Patterson's future. 
Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights from our first quarter performance."
320186,108800154,76321,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-26-2010",2010-08-26,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for 1.6 percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a minimal impact. As Scott mentioned, within our Veterinary segment, the",739,"Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for 1.6 percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a minimal impact. As Scott mentioned, within our Veterinary segment, the impact of the extra selling week was offset by a number of factors that adversely affected the comparability of Webster's first quarter sales. First, Webster experienced a shift in its mix toward more agency sales in flea and tick and heartworm categories. Second, Webster's sales were negatively affected by our decision to exit the Production Animal business. It was part of the Columbus Serum operations prior to its acquisition. This occurred primarily in the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal 2010. And third, as a result of the various pharmaceutical mergers over the past few years, certain products previously sold through distribution are now being sold direct by the manufacturer. After taking these factors into consideration, which are expected to continue affecting Webster's sales for roughly two more quarters, we believe Webster's reported 6% sales growth reflects the performance of its ongoing business in the first quarter.
As further support, we also know that our actual dosages in flea and tick and heartworm shift for the first six months of the calendar year have increased at a double-digit rate. In a market that is showing very low growth at the current time, Webster is performing very well on a comparable basis.
The Medical segment sales performance was clouded by some residual impact from the Mobilis acquisition that was completed in April 2009. As the integration of the various Mobilis entities progressed, it was necessary to step away from certain unprofitable business, and this decision affected the comparability of this quarter's sales results. When this unprofitable business is excluded from the prior year's quarter, the Medical segment would have reported solid internal growth in the mid-single digits. Again, very good results in a slow market.
Moving on to our consolidated gross margin. We saw an improvement of 20 basis points from the prior year. The gross margins of the Veterinary and Medical segments both improved for the quarter as product mix and rebates favorably impacted their results.
We garnered operating expense leverage in the quarter due to expense control measures we have taken over the past year in addition to the benefit of the extra week and its impact on the fixed cost.  This improvement was muted due to expenses related to the integration of the acquired DCC rehabilitation assets and the due diligence costs associated with this transaction. The due diligence and other acquisition costs included in operations for the quarter were approximately $1.5 million. 
By segment, our first quarter operating profits were 11.2% for Dental, 13.5% for Medical and 6% for Veterinary.
Our income tax rate reflects the benefit of the deductibility of the cash dividends paid to our employee stock ownership plan in the current period. As you will recall, we began our cash dividend program in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year. A quick view of our balance sheet reveals that inventory levels increased by approximately $47 million at the end of this year's first quarter compared to the balance at the end of fiscal 2010.  This expansion resulted from the acquisition of the DCC assets as well as from a temporary-incremental increase in CEREC inventory, and meet anticipated sales generated by our current trade-up program and the 25th anniversary events occurring later this month.
Our DSOs stand 44 days compared to the same 44 days in the prior year, while inventory turns are 7.1 compared to 7.0 a year ago. The DSO for each period excludes the impact of finance contracts that were generated during various promotions over the past two years, through which the customer was provided payment and interest holiday periods. These contracts have been or will be sold to our regular funding sources in due course. 
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $23 million in the first quarter compared to $47 million in the year-earlier period. In addition to the temporary inventory build noted previously, the timing of our cash disbursement cycle reduced our accounts payable balances in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We would expect both of these factors to reverse by the end of the fiscal year.

Good morning, and thanks for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I",1254,"Thank you, Craig. Good morning, and thanks for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions. Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for fiscal year 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report in Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
As a reminder, our first quarter results included the impact of an extra 14th week, which will make fiscal 2011 a 53-week year ending on April 30, 2011.  It's difficult to quantify the exact impact of this additional week on our first quarter results, but we will provide estimates in those areas where it is possible to make reasonable approximations.
In the first quarter, consolidated sales of $850 million rose 8% from $790 million in the year-earlier period. The impact of the additional week is estimated to be approximately five percentage points. Net income of $54 million or $0.45 per diluted share rose 20% from $45 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We're generally pleased with Patterson's first quarter results, considering the ongoing effect of sluggish economic conditions within our served markets.
Sales of Patterson Dental Supply increased 6% to $543 million in this year's first quarter. Sales of consumable dental supplies rose 7% from last year's first quarter, and were essentially unchanged from the year-earlier period after excluding the impact of the additional week. Our Consumable business is continuing to be affected by uneven patient demand for dental services as a result of the soft economy. However, our consumable results over the past few quarters suggest that the overall dental market is stabilizing. As we predicted earlier this calendar year, consumable demand has remained soft throughout the summer, but we believe there could be modest growth during the latter half of our fiscal year. 
At the same time, we are encouraged by the strong sales growth of our non-CEREC equipment, which was up 13% in the quarter, including a 17% in basic dental equipment. The 17% increase was led by sales of cone beam and panoramic imaging system, but sales in all major categories including chairs, units, cabinetry and lighting grew in the quarter. It needs to be pointed out that it is difficult to measure the impact of an extra week on equipment sales due to such factors as the length of time from initial order installation, which can span several months between quarters. Even so, we believe that sales of basic dental equipment still would've been solidly higher on a fully comparable year-over-year basis. We believe this growth reflects our ability to capture significant share of the Equipment business that has been deferred for the past two years.
Sales of digital sensors and CEREC equipment were down in the first quarter reflecting a strong comparable sales level that each of these categories faced versus the last year's first quarter. The strength of our CEREC line in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was generated primarily by the high level of interest in our initial trade-up program following the introduction of the CEREC AC imaging unit early in calendar 2009. A similar CEREC trade-up program has been running through this year's first quarter and will end later this month.
For the full year, we continue to believe that CEREC sales should increase by at least 10%, and we are committing substantial marketing resources to accomplish this goal. Digital sensors sales in last year first quarter were aided by a financing promotion that was not run this year.
Turning now to Webster Veterinary. Sales of our veterinary unit increased 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to $180 million. We were generally pleased with Webster's first quarter performance, including the solidly higher equipment sales reported for this period. Equipment, which constitutes a relatively small but growing portion of Webster's revenue stream, represents a key facet of Webster's drive to expand and strengthen its value-added proposition. Steve will provide greater detail in a few minutes, but we estimate that the impact of the additional week was largely offset by several factors that adversely affected the comparability of Webster's sales, including changes in the distribution arrangements for certain pharmaceuticals and the exiting of Production Animal business that was part of Columbus Serum operation prior to its acquisition. As a result, we believe Webster's reported 6% sales growth reflects the performance of its ongoing business in the first quarter. I want to add that Webster will continue to experience the impact of the sales mix shift and the absence of the Large Animal business on its sales for approximately two more quarters.
Sales of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, increased 17% to $127 million in this year's first quarter. Acquisitions contributed approximately 10 percentage points of Patterson Medical's first quarter sales growth, while the additional week accounted for approximately five percentage points. We believe the overall rehabilitation market continue to firm in the first quarter and that Patterson Medical continue to increase its share of the global rehabilitation market during this period. 
The acquisition that benefited Patterson Medical's first quarter performance included Empi Therapy Solutions in June 2009 and the Rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare in June 2010. The previously reported DCC acquisition is of particular strategic importance. The acquired DCC business ranked among the leaders in their respective overseas markets, and had combined sales of approximately $70 million for their fiscal year that ended March 31, 2010. They provide assisted-living products and rehabilitation equipment and supplies to hospitals, physical and occupational therapists, long-term care facilities, dealers and consumers in the U.K. and continental Europe. 
In addition to significantly strengthening the market presence and geographic reach of our Homecraft Rolyan unit in U.K., the acquired businesses bring a stable of trusted and established brands that encompass an extensive range of products. The integration of the acquired units is proceeding on schedule and expenses related to the DCC transaction are expected to gradually moderate over the next several quarters. 
We are not anticipating any meaningful contribution to our earnings from this acquisition for the remainder of fiscal 2011 after factoring in the cost of integration and the incremental amortization of intangible assets arising from the valuation process. We believe our Rehabilitation business is positioned as a strong growth driver going forward, and we are continuing to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities for this business.
Regarding the financial outlook contained in this morning's release, our expectations for fiscal 2011 have not changed from our previously issued guidance. And we are maintaining our earnings forecast of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for the full year.
Looking ahead, the health of our dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets is gradually strengthening, and all have compelling long-term growth opportunities. Our three businesses are well positioned to capitalize on these. Moreover, we're generating substantial operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. All in all, we are optimistic about Patterson's future. 
Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights from our first quarter performance."
320186,108800154,76578,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-26-2010",2010-08-26,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for 1.6 percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a minimal impact. As Scott mentioned, within our Veterinary segment, the",740,"Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for 1.6 percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a minimal impact. As Scott mentioned, within our Veterinary segment, the impact of the extra selling week was offset by a number of factors that adversely affected the comparability of Webster's first quarter sales. First, Webster experienced a shift in its mix toward more agency sales in flea and tick and heartworm categories. Second, Webster's sales were negatively affected by our decision to exit the Production Animal business. It was part of the Columbus Serum operations prior to its acquisition. This occurred primarily in the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal 2010. And third, as a result of the various pharmaceutical mergers over the past few years, certain products previously sold through distribution are now being sold direct by the manufacturer. 
After taking these factors into consideration, which are expected to continue affecting Webster's sales for roughly two more quarters, we believe Webster's reported 6% sales growth reflects the performance of its ongoing business in the first quarter. As further support, we also know that our actual dosages in flea and tick and heartworm shift for the first six months of the calendar year have increased at a double-digit rate. In a market that is showing very low growth at the current time, Webster is performing very well on a comparable basis.
The Medical segment sales performance was clouded by some residual impact from the Mobilis acquisition that was completed in April 2009. As the integration of the various Mobilis entities progressed, it was necessary to step away from certain unprofitable business, and this decision affected the comparability of this quarter's sales results. When this unprofitable business is excluded from the prior year's quarter, the Medical segment would have reported solid internal growth in the mid single digits. Again, very good results in a slow market.
Moving on to our consolidated gross margin. We saw an improvement of 20 basis points from the prior year. The gross margins of the Veterinary and Medical segments both improved for the quarter as product mix and rebates favorably impacted their results. We garnered operating expense leverage in the quarter due to expense control measures we have taken over the past year in addition to the benefit of the extra week and its impact on the fixed cost.  This improvement was muted due to expenses related to the integration of the acquired DCC rehabilitation assets and the due diligence costs associated with this transaction. The due diligence and other acquisition costs included in operations for the quarter were approximately $1.5 million. By segment, our first quarter operating profits were 11.2% for Dental, 13.5% for Medical and 6% for Veterinary.
Our income tax rate reflects the benefit of the deductibility of the cash dividends paid to our employee stock ownership plan in the current period. As you will recall, we began our cash dividend program in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year. A quick view of our balance sheet reveals that inventory levels increased by approximately $47 million at the end of this year's first quarter compared to the balance at the end of fiscal 2010.  This expansion resulted from the acquisition of the DCC assets as well as from a temporary-incremental increase in CEREC inventory, and meet anticipated sales generated by our current trade-up program and the 25th anniversary events occurring later this month.
Our DSOs stand 44 days compared to the same 44 days in the prior year, while inventory turns are 7.1 compared to 7.0 a year ago. The DSO for each period excludes the impact of finance contracts that were generated during various promotions over the past two years, through which the customer was provided payment and interest holiday periods. These contracts have been or will be sold to our regular funding sources in due course. 
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $23 million in the first quarter compared to $47 million in the year-earlier period. In addition to the temporary inventory build noted previously, the timing of our cash disbursement cycle reduced our accounts payable balances in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We would expect both of these factors to reverse by the end of the fiscal year.

Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we’ve provided financial guidance for fiscal 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson’s actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report and on Form 10K of our SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Turning to our Q2 results, consolidated sales of $857.4 million were up 5% from $815 million in last year’s Q2. Internal growth generated one half of the sales increase, with acquisitions including currency exchange accounting for the balance. Net income of $53.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share rose 8%, from $49.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the Q2 of fiscal 2010. We are encouraged by Patterson’s solid Q2 results, which were attained amid the context of soft economic conditions that continued to affect our served markets.
Sales of Patterson Dental Supply increased 5% to $563.2 million in this year’s Q2. Sales of consumable dental supplies rose 1% from last year’s Q2, reflecting the impact of the economy upon patient demand for dental services. We believe the dental market has stabilized, and there could be a modest consumable market growth during the second half of our fiscal year.
For the quarter, our Equipment business grew 14% in response to our continuing initiatives aimed at emphasizing the productivity benefits and rapid rates of return of new technology equipment. Reflecting the effectiveness of these efforts, sales of CEREC dental restoration system increased nearly 30% in the Q2. The primary contributor of this growth was more than a 50% increase in new unit sales year over year. CEREC sales also benefited from a strong finish to the tradeoff program that began earlier this year.
For the full year, we continue to believe that CEREC sales should increase by at least 10% which would represent a very solid performance. In addition, sales of Schick digital sensors and our various lines of cone beam and panoramic imaging systems produced a very strong increase from year earlier levels, another indication of the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.
Turning now to Patterson Medical, sales of rehabilitation supply and equipment unit increased 13% to $132.6 million in this year’s Q2, reflecting the positive impact of the June, 2010 acquisition of the rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare. Q2 sales reflect the impact in the UK of budgetary constraints being imposed by the British government on its national health service. While austerity moves in the UK are expected to influence domestic sales there, the worldwide business continues to grow nicely. As such, we believe our rehabilitation business is increasingly well-positioned as an ongoing growth driver.
The previously reported acquisition of DCC rehabilitation business is of particular strategic importance to Patterson Medical. In addition to significantly strengthening and expanding Patterson Medical’s international presence, the acquired businesses bring a stable of trusted and established brand names that encompass an extensive range of products. The integration of the acquired units is proceeding on schedule, and expenses related to this activity should continue to gradually moderate over the next few quarters.
As we have stated previously, we are not anticipating a meaningful contribution to our earnings from this acquisition in fiscal 2011 after factoring in the costs of acquisition, integration, and the incremental amortization of intangible assets arising from the valuation process, however we expect the acquired businesses to be accretive to Patterson’s earnings in fiscal 2012.
Turning to Webster Veterinary, sales of our Veterinary unit increased slightly in this year’s Q2 to $161.6 million. We were pleased with Webster’s overall performance although the year over year comparability of Webster sales was affected by previously reported changes in the distribution arrangements for certain pharmaceuticals. We estimate that this changeover had the effect of reducing Webster’s Q2 sales growth by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points. Webster will continue to experience the impact of this sales mix on its sales for approximately one more quarter.
During this quarter we purchased and retired approximately 1.3 million shares of Patterson stock which, when combined with our quarterly dividend, returned approximately $50 million to shareholders during the period. We will continue to use our remaining repurchase authorization of approximately 4.5 million shares when we believe our cash position and market conditions justify it.
Regarding our financial outlook contained in this morning’s release, we are reiterating our previously issued guidance of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for fiscal 2011. As we complete the first half of our year and look ahead to the second half, our fiscal year is unfolding in line with our initial expectations. We believe our dental, veterinary, and rehabilitation markets are gradually strengthening. These markets also have attracted long-term fundamentals and our three businesses are well positioned to capitalize upon these opportunities.
Moreover, we are generating strong operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. These factors make us optimistic about Patterson’s future. Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights from our Q2 performance. Steve?

On a consolidated basis, currency exchange had a favorable 20 basis point impact on sales growth. Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales growth was influenced by two negative factors in addition to the shift in mix towards agency sales in the flea & tick and heartworm categories that Scott mentioned. First, Webster sales were affected by our decision to exit the production animal business that was part of Clumbus Serem’s operations prior to its acquisition. This occurred primarily in the Q3 and the Q4 of fiscal 2010. And second, as a result of the various pharmaceutical mergers over the past two years, certain products previously sold through distribution are now being sold direct by the manufacturer. As we noted during previous conference calls, these factors are expected to generally dissipate in our third fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our consolidated gross margin, we saw a slight decrease of ten basis points from the prior year. Two factors that contributed to this decrease was a shift in our dental sales mix toward equipment and the impact of being unable to recognize gains from our finance contract sales. I will talk more about this latter item in a couple of minutes. The gross margins of the Veterinary and Medical segments both improved for the quarter as product mix and rebates favorably impacted the results of these segments. We improved our operating expense leverage in the quarter by 30 basis points despite absorbing the expenses relating to the integration of the acquired DCC rehabilitation assets. For the quarter, the Medical segment’s operating margin was reduced by over 100 basis points by the integration of the DCC assets but this should begin to improve as we move into the second half of the fiscal year. By segment, our Q2 operating margins were 11.3% for dental, 13.8% for medical, and 5.1% for veterinary.
As you may have noted in our press release this morning, we became aware late in the quarter that our customer financing agreement, whereby we sell the finance contracts to a commercial paper conduit, required modification for us to continue to remove the finance contracts from our financial statements when sold. While this was an unpleasant surprise, considering the due diligence that we had done to be certain that we complied with the new provisions of the relevant accounting standards, I want to emphasize that this does not change the underlying economics for the customer or Patterson.
We have nearly completed the technical modifications to our financing agreement which will bring it into compliance with the provisions of ASC-860, accounting for the transfers of financial assets, that allow us to remove the contracts from our financial statements as they are sold. We expect to close on the amended agreement in early December. In the meantime, the contracts that we sold during this year’s Q1 and Q2, which are the contracts impacted by the new provisions of ASC-860 are shown on our balance sheet as an asset and a liability. The gain connected with these sales has been deferred. In our statement of cash flows for the period, the sales of finance contracts is grossed up such that the cash flow from operations is reduced and the cash flow from financing activities is increased for the cash received on the sale of the contracts.
When the amended agreements are closed, our financial statements will reflect the activities of our customer financing activities consistent with our historical presentation. Again, the cash is on the balance sheet and is available for us to use.
Our balance sheet shows that inventory levels decreased by approximately $30 million during the quarter, as we wrapped up the CEREC trade up program and executed on our sales programs. The growth in inventory since the beginning of the fiscal year has resulted from the acquisition of the DCC assets during the Q1. Our DSO stands at 44 days in the current period, consistent with the prior year, while inventory turns are at 7 compared to 7.2 a year ago. The DSO for each period excludes the impact of finance contracts.
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $86 million in the Q2, compared to $8 million in the year earlier period. The cash flow amount that I just provided for the current period adjusts for the impact of the gross up of our customer financing operations discussed earlier. Our CAPEX for the first half of the year includes the completion of the build out of our new distribution center in South Bend, Indiana, and the progress on a new facility for the Patterson Technology Center. It is our expectation that CAPEX for the fiscal year should be approximately $35 million.
With that, I’ll turn it back to the conference operator who will poll you for your questions. Alicia?

And the fact that we still have six out of ten dentists using dental film says that there’s a long runway as we move the industry towards a digital platform.

Really the softness in our medical business came from that. It also came from we saw tighter school budgets during the football bidding season that impacted sales at MedCo, our sports medicine business. While the top line was affected the MedCo management team did a great job with the product mix to protect the bottom line results. In addition at medical we made the strategic decision to exit some businesses from our Mobilis acquisition. I would say we’ll react to market conditions. We think going forward our strength in these markets, the UK and France, really gives us an opportunity to gain market share regardless of the market conditions. I would say, and Steve mentioned it in his comments, our international dealer business was very strong in the quarter, growing double digits. So I think it’s too early to tell in terms of the crystal ball on the austerity measures.

Yeah, I think going back to the essence of your question, there is some seasonality. The last half of Patterson’s year is generally a more productive year. We have more capital activity during that cycle and there seems to be more dentistry performed during the winter months as sort of licensed consistent people, or the kids are in school and a lot of vacations either of staff or of patients. So you do see higher performance in the Q3 and the Q4 out of our business. With that said, I would tell you that the Q3 for the vet business happens to be their lowest production quarter. As the northern tier states freeze up, you’ve got less mosquitoes obviously, less heartworm, less flea & tick; and then as you get into the Q4 the vets start stocking back up again. So with regard to the guidance, we’re obviously continuing to be cautious. It’s a soft market out there as Scott mentioned and so we have to be cautious, but at the same time we’re optimistic. Our organizations across the board are doing the (inaudible) job to generate revenues when the customers aren’t jumping out of the woods to grab the product out of your hands.

So our theory is, and we feel confident in this, that the hygiene chairs are still full in the dental offices, and the challenge continues to be moving people over for restorative work and discretionary procedures. So the two big things we look at obviously, and we’ve talked about this many times, is consumer confidence and unemployment. And we think as those two gradually improve you’ll see the underlying market firm up even more. That being said, a lot of our customers have been very proactive in how they move people through their offices and schedule to increase productivity, and I think the reason technology products have resonated so well in this time of flat market growth is that dentists really are looking at ways that they can treat their patients more efficiently and also have a much better patient experience. And products like digital x-ray and CEREC surely increase the patient experience in the dental office.

I was one of the bigger skeptics on you guys’ ability to hit that number this quarter. Congrats on that. One question on that number, Scott, I guess as I look at the next few quarters the comps actually get a lot easier than this 45% comp you guys came up against this quarter, but the year over year growth numbers aren’t always the best way to look at those comps I realize. So how do you think the comps are over the next few quarters, whether we talk on an absolute dollar basis or year over year growth? Is the outlook getting a little easier here over the next few quarters or are there things we need to not take into account there?

That being said, and then I mentioned that after the Q1 that we felt the first part of the year, the first six months were obviously the tougher months in terms of comparables, but what we’re encouraged by is the customer interest in CAD/CAM, the customer interest in digital impressions, in cone beam and the CEREC story is a compelling one because it can tie all those things together. So our success in the second half of the year will really come down to sales execution, and our expectation is that we will continue to execute like we did in the last quarter.

Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we’ve provided financial guidance for fiscal 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson’s actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report and on Form 10K of our SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Turning to our second quarter results. Consolidated sales of $857.4 million were up 5% from $815 million last year's second quarter. Internal growth generated 1/2 of the sales increase with acquisitions and currency exchange accounting for the balance. 
Net income of $53.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share rose 8% from $49.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. 
We are encouraged by Patterson's solid second quarter results, which were attained amid the context of soft economic conditions that continued to affect our served market. 
Sales of Patterson Dental Supply increased 5% to $563.2 million in this year's second quarter. Sales of consumable dental supplies rose 1% from last year's second quarter, reflecting the impact of the economy upon patient demand for dental services. 
We believe the dental market have stabilized and there could be a modest consumable market growth during the second half of our fiscal year. 
For the quarter, our Equipment business grew 14% in response to our continuing initiatives aimed at emphasizing the productivity benefits and rapid rates of return of new technology equipment. 
Reflecting the effectiveness of these efforts, sales of CEREC dental restoration system increased nearly 30% in the second quarter. The primary contributor of this growth was more than a 50% increase in new unit sales year-over-year . CEREC sales also benefited from a strong finish to the trade up program that began earlier this year. For the full year, we continue to believe that CEREC sales should increase by at least 10%, which would represent a very solid performance. 
In addition, sales of Schick digital sensors and our various lines of cone beam and panoramic imaging system produced a very strong increase from the year earlier level, another indication of the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. 
Turning now to Patterson Medical. Sales of rehabilitation supply and equipment unit increased 13% to $132.6 million in this year's second quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the June 2010 acquisition of the rehabilitation business at DCC Healthcare. 
Second quarter sales reflect the impact in the U.K. of budgetary constraints being imposed by the British government on its National Health Service. While in the U.K. are expected to influence domestic sales there, the worldwide business continued to grow nicely. As such, we believe our rehabilitation business is increasingly well-positioned as an our ongoing growth driver.
The previously reported acquisition of DCC Rehabilitation business is of particular strategic importance to Patterson Medical. In addition to significantly strengthening and expanding Patterson Medical international presence, the acquired businesses bring a stable of trusted and established brand names that encompass an extensive range of products. The integration of the acquired units is proceeding on schedule and expenses related to this activity should continue to gradually moderate over the next few quarters.  As we have stated previously, we are not anticipating a meaningful contribution to our earnings from this acquisition in fiscal 2011. After factoring in the cost of acquisition, immigration and the incremental amortization of intangible assets arising from the evaluation process. However, we expect the acquired businesses to be accretive to Patterson's earnings in fiscal 2012. 
Turning to Webster Veterinary. Sales of our veterinary unit increased slightly in this year's second quarter to $161.6 million. We were pleased with Webster's overall performance, although the year-over-year comparability of Webster sales was affected by previously reported changes in the distribution arrangements for certain pharmaceuticals. We estimate that this change over had the effect of reducing Webster second quarter sales growth by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points. Webster will continue to experience the impact of the sales mix on its sales for approximately one more quarter. 
During this quarter, we purchased and retired approximately 1.3 million shares of Patterson's stock, which when combined with our quarterly dividends, returned approximately $50 million to shareholders during the period. We will continue to use our remaining repurchase authorization of approximately 4.5 million shares when we believe our cash position and market conditions justify it. 
Regarding our financial outlook contained in this morning's release, we are reiterating our previously issued guidance of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for fiscal 2011. 
As we complete the first half of our year and look ahead to the second half, our fiscal year is unfolding in line with our initial expectations. We believe our dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets are gradually strengthening. These markets also have attracted long-term fundamentals and our 3 businesses are well-positioned to capitalize upon these opportunities. Moreover, we are generating strong operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. These factors make us optimistic about Patterson's future. 
Thank you. Now, Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights for our second quarter performance. Steve?"
320186,115635341,162384,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2010",2010-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. To begin, I just have a couple of additional points on our sales performance for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency exchange had a favorable 20 basis point impact on sales growth. Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales",806,"Thank you, Scott. To begin, I just have a couple of additional points on our sales performance for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency exchange had a favorable 20 basis point impact on sales growth. Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales growth was influenced by 2 negative factors in addition to the shift in mix toward agency sales in the flea and tick take heartworm categories as Scott mentioned. 
First, Webster sales were affected by our decision to exit the production animal business as part of the Columbus Serem operations prior to its acquisition. This occurred primarily in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. And second, as a result of the various pharmaceutical mergers over the past 2 years, certain products previously sold through distributions are now being sold direct by the manufacturer. As we noted during previous conference calls, these factors are expected to generally dissipate in our third fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our consolidated gross margin. We saw slight decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. Two factors contributed to this decrease with a shift in our dental sales mix towards equipment and the impact of being unable to recognize gains from our finance contract sales. I will talk more about this latter item in a couple of minutes. 
The gross margins of the Veterinary and Medical segments both improved for the quarter as product mix and rebates favorably impacted the result of these segments. We improved our operating expense leverage in the quarter by 30 basis points despite absorbing the expenses related to the integration of the acquired DCC Rehabilitation asset. 
For the quarter, the medical segment operating margin was reduced by over 100 basis points by the integration of the DCC asset. But this should begin to improve as we move into the second half of the fiscal year. 
By segment, our first quarter operating margins were 11.3% for dental, 13.8% for medical and 5.1% for veterinary. 
As you may have noted in our press release this morning, we became aware late in the quarter there are customer financing agreement or contracts would have commercial paper conduit required modification for us to continue to finance contracts from our financial statements when sold. While this was an unpleasant surprise considering the due diligence that we have done to be certain that we comply with the new provisions of the relevant accounting standards, I want to emphasize that it does not change the underlying economics for the customer or Patterson. 
We have nearly completed the technical modifications to our financing agreement, which will bring compliance with the provisions of the ASC-860 accounted for the transfer of the financial assets that will allow us to remove the contracts from our financial statements as they are sold. We expect to close the amended agreement in early December. 
In the meantime, the contracts that we sold during the year's first and second quarters, which are the contract impacted by the ASC-860, are shown on our balance sheet as an asset and a liability. A gain connected with the sales has been deferred. 
In our statement of cash flows for the period, the sales of finance contracts has gross up such as the cash flow from operations is reduced and the cash flow from financing activities is increased for the cash receipt in the sale of the contract. 
When the amended agreements are close, our financial statements will reflect the activities of our customer financing committee consistent with our historical presentation. Again, the cash is on the balance sheet and is available for us to use. 
Our balance sheet shows inventory levels increased by approximately $30 million during the quarter as planned as we wrap up as your trading program and executed on our sales program. 
The growth in inventory since the beginning of the fiscal year has resulted from teh acquisition of the DCC asset during the first quarter. 
Our DSO stands at 44 days in the current period consistent with the prior year, while inventory turns are 7x compared to 7.2x a year ago. The DSO for each period excludes the impact of finance contracts. 
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $86 million in the second quarter compared to $8 million in the year-earlier period. The cash flow amount that I just provided for the current period adjusts for the impact of the growth of customer financing operations discussed earlier.

Good morning and thanks for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we’ve provided financial guidance for fiscal 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson’s actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report and on Form 10-K of our SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Turning to our second quarter results. Consolidated sales of $857.4 million were up 5% from $815 million in last year's second quarter. Internal growth generated 1/2 of the sales increase with acquisitions and currency exchange accounting for the balance. Net income of $53.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share rose 8% from $49.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. 
We are encouraged by Patterson's solid second quarter results, which were attained amid the context of a soft economic condition that continued to affect our served markets. 
Sales of Patterson Dental Supply increased 5% to $563.2 million in this year's second quarter. Sales of consumable dental supplies rose 1% from last year's second quarter, reflecting the impact of the economy upon patient demand for dental services. 
We believe the dental market is stabilized, and there could be a modest consumable market growth during the second half of our fiscal year. For the quarter, our Equipment business grew 14% in response to our continuing initiatives aimed at emphasizing the productivity benefits and rapid rates of return of new technology equipment. 
Reflecting the effectiveness of these efforts, sales of CEREC dental restoration system increased nearly 30% in the second quarter. The primary contributor of this growth was more than a 50% increase in new unit sales year-over-year . CEREC sales also benefited from a strong finish to the trade-up program that began earlier this year. For the full year, we continue to believe that CEREC sales should increase by at least 10%, which would represent a very solid performance. 
In addition, sales of Schick digital sensors and our various lines of ConeBeam and panoramic imaging system produced a very strong increase from the year earlier level, another indication of the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. 
Turning now to Patterson Medical. Sales of rehabilitation supply and equipment unit increased 13% to $132.6 million in this year's second quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the June 2010 acquisition of the rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare. 
Second quarter sales reflect the impact in the U.K. of budgetary constraints being imposed by the British government on its National Health Service. While our security moves in the U.K. are expected to influence domestic sales there, the worldwide business continue to grow nicely. As such, we believe our Rehabilitation business is increasingly well positioned as an ongoing growth driver.
The previously reported acquisition of DCC rehabilitation business is of particular strategic importance to Patterson Medical. In addition to significantly strengthening and expanding Patterson Medical international presence, the acquired businesses bring a stable of trusted and established brand names that encompass an extensive range of products. The integration of the acquired units is proceeding on schedule and expenses related to this activity should continue to gradually moderate over the next few quarters.  As we have stated previously, we are not anticipating a meaningful contribution to our earnings from this acquisition in fiscal 2011. After factoring in the cost of acquisition, immigration and the incremental amortization of intangible assets arising from the valuation process. However, we expect the acquired businesses to be accretive to Patterson's earnings in fiscal 2012. 
Turning to Webster Veterinary. Sales of our veterinary unit increased slightly in this year's second quarter to $161.6 million. We were pleased with Webster's overall performance, although the year-over-year comparability of Webster sales was affected by previously reported changes in the distribution arrangements for certain pharmaceuticals. We estimate that this change over had the effect of reducing Webster second quarter sales growth by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points. Webster will continue to experience the impact of the sales mix on its sales for approximately one more quarter. 
During this quarter, we purchased and retired approximately 1.3 million shares of Patterson stock, which when combined with our quarterly dividends, returned approximately $50 million to shareholders during the period. We will continue to use our remaining repurchase authorization of approximately 4.5 million shares when we believe our cash position and market conditions justify it. 
Regarding our financial outlook contained in this morning's release, we are reiterating our previously issued guidance of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for fiscal 2011. 
As we complete the first half of our year and look ahead to the second half, our fiscal year is unfolding in line with our initial expectations. We believe our dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets are gradually strengthening. These markets also have attracted long-term fundamentals and our 3 businesses are well positioned to capitalize upon these opportunities. Moreover, we are generating strong operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. These factors make us optimistic about Patterson's future. 
Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights from our second quarter performance. Steve?"
320186,115635341,162512,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2010",2010-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales",825,"Thank you, Scott. To begin, I just have a couple of additional points on our sales performance for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency exchange had a favorable 20 basis point impact on sales growth. Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales growth was influenced by 2 negative factors in addition to the shift in mix toward agency sales in the flea and tick and heartworm categories as Scott mentioned. 
First, Webster sales were affected by our decision to exit the Production Animal business as part of Columbus Serem operations prior to its acquisition. This occurred primarily in the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal 2010. And second, as a result of the various pharmaceutical mergers over the past 2 years, certain products previously sold through distribution are now being sold direct by the manufacturer. As we noted during previous conference calls, these factors are expected to generally dissipate in our third fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our consolidated gross margin. We saw a slight decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. Two factors contributed to this decrease with the shift in our dental sales mix toward equipment and the impact of being unable to recognize gains from our finance contract sales. I will talk more about this latter item in a couple of minutes. 
The gross margins of the Veterinary and Medical segments both improved for the quarter as product mix and rebates favorably impacted the results of these segments. We improved our operating expense leverage in the quarter by 30 basis points despite absorbing the expenses related to the integration of the acquired DCC rehabilitation asset. 
For the quarter, the Medical segment operating margin was reduced by over 100 basis points by the integration of the DCC asset. But this should begin to improve as we move into the second half of the fiscal year. 
By segment, our first quarter operating margins were 11.3% for Dental, 13.8% for Medical and 5.1% for Veterinary. 
As you may have note in our press release this morning, we became aware late in the quarter that our customer financing agreement whereby we sell the finance contracts to a commercial paper conduit require modification for us to continue to remove the finance contracts from our financial statements when sold. While this was an unpleasant surprise considering the due diligence that we have done to be certain that we comply with the new provisions of the relevant accounting standards, I want to emphasize that it does not change the underlying economics for the customer or Patterson. 
We have nearly completed the technical modifications to our financing agreement, which will bring in into compliance with the provisions of the ASC-860 accounting for the transfer of the financial assets that allow us to remove the contracts from our financial statements as they are sold. We expect to close on the amended agreement in early December. 
In the meantime, the contracts that we sold during this year's first and second quarters, which are the contracts impacted by the new provisions of ASC-860, are shown on our balance sheet as an asset and a liability. The gain connected with these sales has been deferred. 
In our statement of cash flows for the period, the sales of finance contracts has grossed up such as the cash flow from operations is reduced, and the cash flow from financing activities is increased for the cash receipt on the sale of the contract. 
When the amended agreements are closed, our financial statements will reflect the activities of our customer financing activities consistent with our historical presentation. Again, the cash is on the balance sheet and is available for us to use. 
Our balance sheet shows that inventory levels decreased by approximately $30 million during the quarter as planned as we wrap up the CEREC trade-up program and executed on our sales program. The growth in inventory since the beginning of the fiscal year has resulted from the acquisition of the DCC asset during the first quarter. 
Our DSO stands at 44 days in the current period consistent with the prior year, while inventory turns are 7 compared to 7.2 a year ago. The DSO for each period excludes the impact of finance contracts. 
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $86 million in the second quarter compared to $8 million in the year-earlier period. The cash flow amount that I just provided for the current period adjusts for the impact of the gross up of our financing -- our customer financing operations discussed earlier. 
Our CapEx for the first half of the year includes the completion of the build-out of our new distribution center at South Bend, Indiana and the progress on the new facility for the Patterson Technology Center. It is our expectation that CapEx for the fiscal year should be approximately $35 million. 
With that, I'll turn it back to the conference operator who will poll you for your questions. Alicia?"

So you do see higher performance in the third and the fourth quarter out of our business. With that said, I would tell you that the third quarter for the vet business happens to be their lowest production quarter as the northern-tier states freeze up. You've got less mosquitoes and obviously, less heart worm, less flea and tick. And then if you get into the fourth quarter, the vet starts back. They [ph] got back up again. So with regard to the guidance, we're obviously continuing to be cautious. It's a soft market out there, as Scott mentioned. And so we have to be cautious. But at the same time, we're optimistic.

So the 2 big things we look at, obviously, and we've talk about this many times, is consumer confidence and unemployment, and we think as those 2 gradually improve, you'll see underlying market firm up even more. That being said, a lot of our customers have been very proactive in how they move people through their offices and scheduled to increase productivity.

Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we’ve provided financial guidance for fiscal 2011 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson’s actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report and on Form 10-K of our SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Turning to our second quarter results. Consolidated sales of $857.4 million were up 5% from $815 million in last year's second quarter. Internal growth generated 1/2 of the sales increase with acquisitions and currency exchange accounting for the balance. Net income of $53.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share rose 8% from $49.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. 
We are encouraged by Patterson's solid second quarter results, which were attained amid the context of a soft economic conditions that continued to affect our served markets. 
Sales of Patterson Dental Supply increased 5% to $563.2 million in this year's second quarter. Sales of consumable dental supplies rose 1% from last year's second quarter, reflecting the impact of the economy upon patient demand for dental services. 
We believe the dental market is stabilized, and there could be a modest consumable market growth during the second half of our fiscal year. For the quarter, our Equipment business grew 14% in response to our continuing initiatives aimed at emphasizing the productivity benefits and rapid rates of return of new technology equipment. 
Reflecting the effectiveness of these efforts, sales of CEREC dental restoration system increased nearly 30% in the second quarter. The primary contributor of this growth was more than a 50% increase in new unit sales year-over-year . CEREC sales also benefited from a strong finish to the trade-up program that began earlier this year. For the full year, we continue to believe that CEREC sales should increase by at least 10%, which would represent a very solid performance. 
In addition, sales of Schick digital sensors and our various lines of ConeBeam and panoramic imaging system produced a very strong increase from the year earlier level, another indication of the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. 
Turning now to Patterson Medical. Sales of rehabilitation supply and equipment unit increased 13% to $132.6 million in this year's second quarter, reflecting the positive impact of the June 2010 acquisition of the rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare. 
Second quarter sales reflect the impact in the U.K. of budgetary constraints being imposed by the British government on its National Health Service. While our security moves in the U.K. are expected to influence domestic sales there, the worldwide business continued to grow nicely. As such, we believe our Rehabilitation business is increasingly well positioned as an ongoing growth driver.
The previously reported acquisition of DCC rehabilitation business is of particular strategic importance to Patterson Medical. In addition to significantly strengthening and expanding Patterson Medical international presence, the acquired businesses bring a stable of trusted and established brand names that encompass an extensive range of products. The integration of the acquired units is proceeding on schedule and expenses related to this activity should continue to gradually moderate over the next few quarters.  As we have stated previously, we are not anticipating a meaningful contribution to our earnings from this acquisition in fiscal 2011. After factoring in the cost of acquisition, integration and the incremental amortization of intangible assets arising from the valuation process. However, we expect the acquired businesses to be accretive to Patterson's earnings in fiscal 2012. 
Turning to Webster Veterinary. Sales of our veterinary unit increased slightly in this year's second quarter to $161.6 million. We were pleased with Webster's overall performance, although the year-over-year comparability of Webster sales was affected by previously reported changes in the distribution arrangements for certain pharmaceuticals. We estimate that this change over had the effect of reducing Webster second quarter sales growth by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points. Webster will continue to experience the impact of the sales mix on its sales for approximately one more quarter. 
During this quarter, we purchased and retired approximately 1.3 million shares of Patterson stock, which when combined with our quarterly dividend, returned approximately $50 million to shareholders during the period. We will continue to use our remaining repurchase authorization of approximately 4.5 million shares when we believe our cash position and market conditions justify it. 
Regarding our financial outlook contained in this morning's release, we are reiterating our previously issued guidance of $1.89 to $1.99 per diluted share for fiscal 2011. 
As we complete the first half of our year and look ahead to the second half, our fiscal year has unfolded in line with our initial expectations. We believe our dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets are gradually strengthening. These markets also have attractive long-term fundamentals and our 3 businesses are well positioned to capitalize upon these opportunities. Moreover, we are generating strong operating cash flows, providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. These factors make us optimistic about Patterson's future. 
Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some operational highlights from our second quarter performance. Steve?"
320186,115635341,162545,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2010",2010-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. To begin, I just have a couple of additional points on our sales performance for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency exchange had a favorable 20 basis point impact on sales growth. Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales",826,"Thank you, Scott. To begin, I just have a couple of additional points on our sales performance for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency exchange had a favorable 20 basis point impact on sales growth. Within our Webster Veterinary segment, sales growth was influenced by 2 negative factors in addition to the shift in mix toward agency sales in the flea and tick and heartworm categories that Scott mentioned. 
First, Webster sales were affected by our decision to exit the Production Animal business as part of Columbus Serem operations prior to its acquisition. This occurred primarily in the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal 2010. And second, as a result of the various pharmaceutical mergers over the past 2 years, certain products previously sold through distribution are now being sold direct by the manufacturer. As we noted during previous conference calls, these factors are expected to generally dissipate in our third fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our consolidated gross margin. We saw a slight decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. Two factors contributed to this decrease with the shift in our dental sales mix toward equipment and the impact of being unable to recognize gains from our finance contract sales. I will talk more about this latter item in a couple of minutes. 
The gross margins of the Veterinary and Medical segments both improved for the quarter as product mix and rebates favorably impacted the results of these segments. We improved our operating expense leverage in the quarter by 30 basis points despite absorbing the expenses related to the integration of the acquired DCC rehabilitation asset. 
For the quarter, the Medical segment operating margin was reduced by over 100 basis points by the integration of the DCC asset. But this should begin to improve as we move into the second half of the fiscal year. 
By segment, our first quarter operating margins were 11.3% for Dental, 13.8% for Medical and 5.1% for Veterinary. 
As you may have note in our press release this morning, we became aware late in the quarter that our customer financing agreement whereby we sell the finance contracts to a commercial paper conduit require modification for us to continue to remove the finance contracts from our financial statements when sold. While this was an unpleasant surprise considering the due diligence that we have done to be certain that we comply with the new provisions of the relevant accounting standards, I want to emphasize that it does not change the underlying economics for the customer or Patterson. 
We have nearly completed the technical modifications to our financing agreement, which will bring it into compliance with the provisions of the ASC-860 accounting for the transfer of the financial assets that allow us to remove the contracts from our financial statements as they are sold. We expect to close on the amended agreement in early December. In the meantime, the contracts that we sold during this year's first and second quarters, which are the contracts impacted by the new provisions of ASC-860, are shown on our balance sheet as an asset and a liability. The gain connected with these sales has been deferred. 
In our statement of cash flows for the period, the sales of finance contracts has grossed up such as the cash flow from operations is reduced, and the cash flow from financing activities is increased for the cash received on a sale of the contract. 
When the amended agreements are closed, our financial statements will reflect the activities of our customer financing activities consistent with our historical presentation. Again, the cash is on the balance sheet and is available for us to use. 
Our balance sheet shows that inventory levels decreased by approximately $30 million during the quarter as planned as we wrap up the CEREC trade-up program and executed on our sales program. The growth in inventory since the beginning of the fiscal year has resulted from the acquisition of the DCC asset during the first quarter. 
Our DSO stands at 44 days in the current period consistent with the prior year, while inventory turns are at 7 compared to 7.2 a year ago. The DSO for each period excludes the impact of finance contracts. 
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $86 million in the second quarter compared to $8 million in the year-earlier period. The cash flow amount that I just provided for the current period adjusts for the impact of the gross up of our financing -- our customer financing operations discussed earlier. 
Our CapEx for the first half of the year includes the completion of the build-out of our new distribution center at South Bend, Indiana and the progress on the new facility for the Patterson Technology Center.

Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also with the us is Scott Anderson, President of Patterson Dental Supply and my successor to the CEO role at the end of the fiscal year. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve, Scott and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Such Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for full year 2010 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail on our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Turning now to our third quarter results. Patterson performed generally in line with our expectations during this period. Consolidated sales rose 1% to $820.1 million. Third quarter earnings of $56 million or $0.47 per diluted share were up 6% from $52.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009. Over the past year, we have instituted a range of expense control measures in response to economic downturn that has streamlined our cost structure and slowed our expense growth. These actions have benefited our third quarter earnings.
Turning now to a brief review of our business unit performances. Sales of Patterson Dental, our largest business declined 2% to $572.1 million in the third quarter. Within Patterson Dental, sales consumable dental supplies and printed office products rose 2% from last year's third quarter. We're encouraged that the internally generated sales of consumables, excluding foreign currency adjustments and acquisitions were up slightly, making the first such consumables growth since the fall of 2008 when the economy started to deteriorate sharply.
All in all we feel that our Consumable business has held up relatively well during the first nine months of 2010. With many patients have elected the four [ph] high-end in cosmetic procedures for economic related reasons. Sales of dental equipment and software declined 10% from the year earlier level that was with consistent with our internal forecast for this period. We believe that purchasing decisions of dental practitioners for new equipment are continuing to be affected by the weak economy.
Sales of dental equipment also faced a difficult comparison with the third quarter of fiscal 2009 when we significantly outperformed the overall dental equipment market. As we have reported since then, the basic equipment market has been soft. Although sales of CEREC dental restorative systems were down modestly in the third quarter, sales were up on a sequential quarterly basis. This was encouraging since new CEREC systems accounted for a substantial portion of our third quarter sales, as compared to the first half of the year when trade-ups to the new Bluecam AC imaging unit represented the majority of the activity. We believe the unequal performance of CEREC has made us the most viable choice for dentist purchasing next generation CAD/CAM equipment.
Sales of Webster Veterinary increased 5% in the third quarter of 2010 to $151.8 million. Websters third quarter results reflected the fact that the winter months marked the seasonally softness period of the year for Webster due to reduced demand for flea, tick and hardware medications. Moreover, sales of veterinary equipment remain sluggish as many veterinary practices remained cautious about purchasing equipment. The integration of Columbus CERES company, a large value-added distributors serving the mid-Atlantic and Midwestern market that was acquired in 2008 should be largely complete by the end of our year. This will allow us to remove additional cost from the combined operation.
The performance of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit also met our expectations in the third quarter. Sales rose 18% to $96.2 million, with the acquisitions of Mobilis Healthcare Group in April 2009 and Empi Therapy Solutions in June 2009 accounted for most of this increase. The integration of these businesses is proceeding on schedule, and we are pleased with our contributions to our third quarter performance.
Patterson Medical continue to increase its share of the global rehabilitation market in the third quarter. We also believe that the overall rehabilitation market continued firming during this period. All in all, we believe Patterson Medical's prospects are encouraging. But only one more quarter left in 2010, we refined our full year earnings guidance in this morning's release to $1.74 to $1.78 per diluted share from the previous reported $1.70 to $1.80 per share.
Looking farther down the road, we remain optimistic about Patterson's future. Our three businesses are aggressively marketing their products, we are generating substantial operating cash flows providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. And now, Scott Anderson will provide some perspective on the dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets as we move into the next fiscal year. Thank you. Scott?"

As I transition into my new responsibilities, I want to take a few minutes this morning to present my perspective on Patterson's future and our priorities for continuing to build on its success. My style will be different than Jim's, that'",1001,"Thank you, Jim. As I transition into my new responsibilities, I want to take a few minutes this morning to present my perspective on Patterson's future and our priorities for continuing to build on its success. My style will be different than Jim's, that's natural, but my core philosophies for leading and managing this business are very much in alignment with Jim and Pete Frechette, our Chairman.
We will continue to take care of our customers, great opportunities for our employees and build on our strong history of profitable operations to create value for our shareholders. We are in three very strong markets today and in time, with the right opportunities, we could enter additional specialty markets, but that is not a high priority in the near term. Our strategy for serving our markets will remain the same and is comprised of five key elements: Being a value-added, single source for supplier for goods and services, building strong relationships with our customers through a knowledgeable dedicated sales and technical service force, bringing new innovative products to the practitioner that allow them to treat more patients with improved outcomes, investing in systems and services and provide solutions to the practitioners' business needs and operating with a decentralized organizational structure placing decision-making close to the customer and providing local economy and accountability.
We believe that the dentist, veterinarian, and therapist entering their profession today and, in the future, will be embracing technology at an ever-increasing pace. To serve them and our existing customers, we have committed to a new 100,000 square foot state-of-the-art technology center that will replace our current facility allowing our over 300 staff to continue to provide industry-leading products, services and support to customers and vendors.
Turning now to some key priorities as I move into the leadership role of Patterson. We are in difficult economic times and each of our business unit is feeling the effect to some degree. But as the economy begins to recover, our first priority is to reestablish our historical industry-leading operating performance. Over the past several years, we have made numerous strategic investments in the company both internally in people, systems, and programs and externally in acquisitions. In various ways, these investments have dampened our operating performance. We now need to sharpen our execution focus and deliver return on these investments.
Another priority will be creating better and more effective programs to train our people to meet the demands of our ever-evolving customer needs. Our legacy as one of leadership in innovation in our markets. And we will continue to build on that history. This will include finding new products and services to bring to our customers and build a new system that create competitive advantage for our customers and our people. We are currently in our planning process, develop our operating strategies and programs for fiscal 2011 so we are not prepared to provide any specific guidance for this period, but it may be helpful to discuss briefly how we see our markets shaping up.
In the dental area, we saw signs of stabilization in our Consumable business in the third quarter when we posted our first positive internally generated sales growth in five quarters. We see this trend continuing in fiscal 2011. Although progress with our Consumable business will likely be gradual as we continue to contend with high unemployment and soft consumer confidence. The market growth for consumables could be in the low-single digits for this period.
In the area of dental equipment, many dental practitioners postponed major office remodeling and expansion projects as a result of the weak economy. We believe that once status regains its efficient confidence in the economy, they will push forward with their plans and resume purchasing new equipment. If the overall economy sees modest growth in calendar 2010, we believe it is quite possible to see the dental equipment market grow mid to high single-digits in our fiscal 2011.
The companion-pet veterinary market is probably growing in the range of 2% to 4% driven by steadily growing pet ownership and the fact that household tend to treat their pets as integral parts of their family. We would see a continuation of this trend for fiscal 2011. A major focus for our veterinary unit for the next fiscal year will be building on the Equipment and Software business. The demands by the pet owner for more extensive services from the veterinarian will require capital investment by practitioners to meet these demands. We see this as a terrific opportunity for this portion of our business.
Patterson Medical's experience with the recession has been somewhat mixed as well. Its consumable supply business is held up reasonably well, while equipment sales have been soft. Patterson Medical is strongly positioned to gain share from smaller competitors and continue making strategic acquisitions. Additional geographic expansion is planned, primarily through a greenfield approach. A portion of which will be accomplished in a highly cost-effective manner by using space in our dental branches. Patterson Medical's growth also will be driven by continued expansion of its sales force. We believe the rehabilitation and therapy market could see growth in the low-single digits in our next fiscal year and of course, this is couched by whatever might come out of Washington in the way of healthcare legislation.
Taken as a whole, we believe that all of our markets should gradually strengthen during the coming year are in the possibility of further negative macroeconomic pressure. Let me conclude my comments by saying that it is an honor to be named as Jim Wiltz's successor. Jim, having served in numerous management posts during his more than 40 years with Patterson merits our sincere thanks for his many contributions to Patterson's success. He also leaves large shoes to be filled and I am pleased that we have an extremely deep, talented, and capable management team to help lead Patterson into the years just ahead. Thank you. Now, Steve will provide additional details on Patterson's third quarter financial performance."
320186,92088871,2476405,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Let me begin with a couple of comments on our sales performance. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for two percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a one-point positive impact. Ea",743,"Thank you, Scott. Let me begin with a couple of comments on our sales performance. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for two percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a one-point positive impact. Each of our operating units produce positive growth in sales and consumable supplies. But as Jim noted, capital goods remain soft. Our decline in equipment revenues was exacerbated this period by our relative strength in last year's third quarter. Particularly in the Dental segment where we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points. While the equipment market remains difficult and we are not immune to the economic conditions affecting it, we believe this market is stabilized.
In addition, going forward, the year-over-year comparison has become a bit easier. Our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter improved by 50 basis points from the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of product mix. Both the Dental and Veterinary segments saw their product margins expand in the quarter. While the Medical segment experienced some erosion in its gross margin, we expect this effect to dissipate as acquisitions completed earlier this year are more fully integrated. Because the Medical segment has the highest gross margin of our three segments and likely faster revenue growth until these acquisitions anniversary into our results there will be a positive impact on our consolidated gross margins from this mix effect due to fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Our operating expense leverage declined 30 basis points in the quarter due to the expenses related to the integration of the Columbus Serum, Mobilis, Dolphin and Empi Therapy's operations into our system. Including the intangible amortization arising from the purchase accounting process.
Again, we are expecting improvement in our expense leverage in the fourth quarter of the year. By segment, our third quarter operating margins were 13.1% for dental, 13.4% for medical, and 3.9% for veterinary. As we reported last quarter, we are now estimating an effective tax rate for the year of 37.8%. We have seen our effective state income tax rate increased this year, at the same time that we have realized less benefit from our tax reinvestment income. For the current quarter, we had favorable discrete tax items that lowered the tax rate slightly and we anticipate a similar rate for the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet shows our inventory levels are relatively consistent with this year's second quarter level. The increase of $32 million from the prior year balance result from the normal seasonal increases on our warehouse inventories to improve service levels, along with some impact from the acquisitions we made. As we have historically done, we expect to work these inventories down before our year end to minimize the impact of our LIFO valuation method. Our DSO stands at 42 days compared to 42 days in the prior year, while inventory turns are at 7.2 compared to 6.7 a year ago. The DSO exclude the impact of the finance contracts that have been generated during our CEREC promotions over the past year or so. These contracts will continue to be sold to our regular funding sources in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $98 million in the third quarter compared to $15 million in the year-earlier period. For the nine months, our cash flow from operations was $153 million compared to $72 million for the same period last year. Most of the change in operating cash flow for both the current and year-to-date periods resulted from the sale of finance contracts in the third quarter versus the build of contracts that we reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We are continuing to estimate that capital expenditures will total approximately $30 million to $35 million for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, we are negotiating the purchase of an existing facility that will accommodate the consolidation of several of our smaller Mid-Western distribution centers. This initiative is part of our continuing program to consolidate our distribution function. We had originally planned to build a suit project for fiscal 2011 and when an existing facility was identified, we decided to move the project forward into fiscal 2010. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to the conference operator for your prep questions. Damien?"

Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also with the us is Scott Anderson, President of Patterson Dental Supply and my successor to the CEO role at the end of the fiscal year. At the conclusion of our formal remarks, Steve, Scott and I will be pleased to take your questions.
Such Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for full year 2010 in our press release earlier this morning. Our guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail on our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.
Turning now to our third quarter results. Patterson performed generally in line with our expectations during this period. Consolidated sales rose 1% to $820.1 million. Third quarter earnings of $56 million or $0.47 per diluted share were up 6% from $52.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009. Over the past year, we have instituted a range of expense control measures in response to economic downturn that has streamlined our cost structure and slowed our expense growth. These actions have benefited our third quarter earnings.
Turning now to a brief review of our business unit performances. Sales of Patterson Dental, our largest business declined 2% to $572.1 million in the third quarter. Within Patterson Dental, sales consumable dental supplies and printed office products rose 2% from last year's third quarter. We're encouraged that the internally generated sales of consumables, excluding foreign currency adjustments and acquisitions were up slightly, making the first such consumables growth since the fall of 2008 when the economy started to deteriorate sharply.
All in all we feel that our Consumable business has held up relatively well during the first nine months of 2010. With many patients have elected the four [ph] high-end in cosmetic procedures for economic related reasons. Sales of dental equipment and software declined 10% from the year earlier level that was with consistent with our internal forecast for this period. We believe that purchasing decisions of dental practitioners for new equipment are continuing to be affected by the weak economy.
Sales of dental equipment also faced a difficult comparison with the third quarter of fiscal 2009 when we significantly outperformed the overall dental equipment market. As we have reported since then, the basic equipment market has been soft. Although sales of CEREC dental restorative systems were down modestly in the third quarter, sales were up on a sequential quarterly basis. This was encouraging since new CEREC systems accounted for a substantial portion of our third quarter sales, as compared to the first half of the year when trade-ups to the new Bluecam AC imaging unit represented the majority of the activity. We believe the unequal performance of CEREC has made us the most viable choice for dentist purchasing next generation CAD/CAM equipment.
Sales of Webster Veterinary increased 5% in the third quarter of 2010 to $151.8 million. Websters third quarter results reflected the fact that the winter months marked the seasonally softness period of the year for Webster due to reduced demand for flea, tick and hardware medications. Moreover, sales of veterinary equipment remain sluggish as many veterinary practices remained cautious about purchasing equipment. The integration of Columbus CERES company, a large value-added distributors serving the mid-Atlantic and Midwestern market that was acquired in 2008 should be largely complete by the end of our year. This will allow us to remove additional cost from the combined operation.
The performance of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit also met our expectations in the third quarter. Sales rose 18% to $96.2 million, with the acquisitions of Mobilis Healthcare Group in April 2009 and Empi Therapy Solutions in June 2009 accounted for most of this increase. The integration of these businesses is proceeding on schedule, and we are pleased with our contributions to our third quarter performance.
Patterson Medical continue to increase its share of the global rehabilitation market in the third quarter. We also believe that the overall rehabilitation market continued firming during this period. All in all, we believe Patterson Medical's prospects are encouraging. But only one more quarter left in 2010, we refined our full year earnings guidance in this morning's release to $1.74 to $1.78 per diluted share from the previous reported $1.70 to $1.80 per share.
Looking farther down the road, we remain optimistic about Patterson's future. Our three businesses are aggressively marketing their products, we are generating substantial operating cash flows providing us with ample resources for supporting our various growth initiatives. And now, Scott Anderson will provide some perspective on the dental, veterinary and rehabilitation markets as we move into the next fiscal year. Thank you. Scott?"

As I transition into my new responsibilities, I want to take a few minutes this morning to present my perspective on Patterson's future and our priorities for continuing to build on its success. My style will be different than Jim's, that'",1001,"Thank you, Jim. As I transition into my new responsibilities, I want to take a few minutes this morning to present my perspective on Patterson's future and our priorities for continuing to build on its success. My style will be different than Jim's, that's natural, but my core philosophies for leading and managing this business are very much in alignment with Jim and Pete Frechette, our Chairman.
We will continue to take care of our customers, great opportunities for our employees and build on our strong history of profitable operations to create value for our shareholders. We are in three very strong markets today and in time, with the right opportunities, we could enter additional specialty markets, but that is not a high priority in the near term. Our strategy for serving our markets will remain the same and is comprised of five key elements: Being a value-added, single source for supplier for goods and services, building strong relationships with our customers through a knowledgeable dedicated sales and technical service force, bringing new innovative products to the practitioner that allow them to treat more patients with improved outcomes, investing in systems and services and provide solutions to the practitioners' business needs and operating with a decentralized organizational structure placing decision-making close to the customer and providing local economy and accountability.
We believe that the dentist, veterinarian, and therapist entering their profession today and, in the future, will be embracing technology at an ever-increasing pace. To serve them and our existing customers, we have committed to a new 100,000 square foot state-of-the-art technology center that will replace our current facility allowing our over 300 staff to continue to provide industry-leading products, services and support to customers and vendors.
Turning now to some key priorities as I move into the leadership role of Patterson. We are in difficult economic times and each of our business unit is feeling the effect to some degree. But as the economy begins to recover, our first priority is to reestablish our historical industry-leading operating performance. Over the past several years, we have made numerous strategic investments in the company both internally in people, systems, and programs and externally in acquisitions. In various ways, these investments have dampened our operating performance. We now need to sharpen our execution focus and deliver return on these investments.
Another priority will be creating better and more effective programs to train our people to meet the demands of our ever-evolving customer needs. Our legacy as one of leadership in innovation in our markets. And we will continue to build on that history. This will include finding new products and services to bring to our customers and build a new system that create competitive advantage for our customers and our people. We are currently in our planning process, develop our operating strategies and programs for fiscal 2011 so we are not prepared to provide any specific guidance for this period, but it may be helpful to discuss briefly how we see our markets shaping up.
In the dental area, we saw signs of stabilization in our Consumable business in the third quarter when we posted our first positive internally generated sales growth in five quarters. We see this trend continuing in fiscal 2011. Although progress with our Consumable business will likely be gradual as we continue to contend with high unemployment and soft consumer confidence. The market growth for consumables could be in the low-single digits for this period.
In the area of dental equipment, many dental practitioners postponed major office remodeling and expansion projects as a result of the weak economy. We believe that once status regains its efficient confidence in the economy, they will push forward with their plans and resume purchasing new equipment. If the overall economy sees modest growth in calendar 2010, we believe it is quite possible to see the dental equipment market grow mid to high single-digits in our fiscal 2011.
The companion-pet veterinary market is probably growing in the range of 2% to 4% driven by steadily growing pet ownership and the fact that household tend to treat their pets as integral parts of their family. We would see a continuation of this trend for fiscal 2011. A major focus for our veterinary unit for the next fiscal year will be building on the Equipment and Software business. The demands by the pet owner for more extensive services from the veterinarian will require capital investment by practitioners to meet these demands. We see this as a terrific opportunity for this portion of our business.
Patterson Medical's experience with the recession has been somewhat mixed as well. Its consumable supply business is held up reasonably well, while equipment sales have been soft. Patterson Medical is strongly positioned to gain share from smaller competitors and continue making strategic acquisitions. Additional geographic expansion is planned, primarily through a greenfield approach. A portion of which will be accomplished in a highly cost-effective manner by using space in our dental branches. 
Patterson Medical's growth also will be driven by continued expansion of its sales force. We believe the rehabilitation and therapy market could see growth in the low-single digits in our next fiscal year and of course, this is couched by whatever might come out of Washington in the way of healthcare legislation.
Taken as a whole, we believe that all of our markets should gradually strengthen during the coming year are in the possibility of further negative macroeconomic pressure. Let me conclude my comments by saying that it is an honor to be named as Jim Wiltz's successor. Jim, having served in numerous management posts during his more than 40 years with Patterson merits our sincere thanks for his many contributions to Patterson's success. He also leaves large shoes to be filled and I am pleased that we have an extremely deep, talented, and capable management team to help lead Patterson into the years just ahead. Thank you. Now, Steve will provide additional details on Patterson's third quarter financial performance."
320186,92088871,2476407,"Patterson Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Let me begin with a couple of comments on our sales performance. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for two percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a one-point positive impact. Ea",743,"Thank you, Scott. Let me begin with a couple of comments on our sales performance. On a consolidated basis, acquisitions accounted for two percentage points of our revenue growth for the quarter, while currency exchange had a one-point positive impact. Each of our operating units produce positive growth in sales and consumable supplies. But as Jim noted, capital goods remain soft. Our decline in equipment revenues was exacerbated this period by our relative strength in last year's third quarter. Particularly in the Dental segment where we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points. While the equipment market remains difficult and we are not immune to the economic conditions affecting it, we believe this market is stabilized.
In addition, going forward, the year-over-year comparison has become a bit easier. Our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter improved by 50 basis points from the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of product mix. Both the Dental and Veterinary segments saw their product margins expand in the quarter. While the Medical segment experienced some erosion in its gross margin, we expect this effect to dissipate as acquisitions completed earlier this year are more fully integrated. Because the Medical segment has the highest gross margin of our three segments and likely faster revenue growth until these acquisitions anniversary into our results there will be a positive impact on our consolidated gross margins from this mix effect due to fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Our operating expense leverage declined 30 basis points in the quarter due to the expenses related to the integration of the Columbus Serum, Mobilis, Dolphin and Empi Therapy's operations into our system. Including the intangible amortization arising from the purchase accounting process.
Again, we are expecting improvement in our expense leverage in the fourth quarter of the year. By segment, our third quarter operating margins were 13.1% for dental, 13.4% for medical, and 3.9% for veterinary. As we reported last quarter, we are now estimating an effective tax rate for the year of 37.8%. We have seen our effective state income tax rate increased this year, at the same time that we have realized less benefit from our tax reinvestment income. For the current quarter, we had favorable discrete tax items that lowered the tax rate slightly and we anticipate a similar rate for the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet shows our inventory levels are relatively consistent with this year's second quarter level. The increase of $32 million from the prior year balance result from the normal seasonal increases on our warehouse inventories to improve service levels, along with some impact from the acquisitions we made. As we have historically done, we expect to work these inventories down before our year end to minimize the impact of our LIFO valuation method. Our DSO stands at 42 days compared to 42 days in the prior year, while inventory turns are at 7.2 compared to 6.7 a year ago. The DSO exclude the impact of the finance contracts that have been generated during our CEREC promotions over the past year or so. These contracts will continue to be sold to our regular funding sources in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $98 million in the third quarter compared to $15 million in the year-earlier period. For the nine months, our cash flow from operations was $153 million compared to $72 million for the same period last year. Most of the change in operating cash flow for both the current and year-to-date periods resulted from the sale of finance contracts in the third quarter versus the build of contracts that we reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We are continuing to estimate that capital expenditures will total approximately $30 million to $35 million for the full year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we are negotiating the purchase of an existing facility that will accommodate the consolidation of several of our smaller Mid-Western distribution centers. This initiative is part of our continuing program to consolidate our distribution function. We had originally planned to build a suit project for fiscal 2011 and when an existing facility was identified, we decided to move the project forward into fiscal 2010. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to the conference operator for your prep questions. Damien?"

But we feel definitely that it has stabilized, and we think the worst is behind us in terms of the Basic Equipment business."
