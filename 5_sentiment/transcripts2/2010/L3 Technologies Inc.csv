Thanks for joining us for the fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin by thanking our employees who did a great job in the fourth quarter, and showed very strong commitment to our program performance and satisfying customer needs, as well as our group Presidents for their continued leadership and excellent performance.Overall we had a strong finish in 2009 and in overview, a good fourth quarter. Our sales were up 5% to $4.2 billion. Earnings per share grew to $1.93, but while reported GAAP earnings were down 11% when you compare it to last year's fourth quarter, operationally, earnings grew significantly. So in 2009, we had higher pension expense and a debt retirement charge. In 2008's fourth quarter, we had gains both from a divestiture and from an income tax matter that have closed. So when you net those two items out and you compare apples to apples, operationally, earnings were up 18% earnings per share.Overall, we saw some of the same business trends in Q4 that we saw all year. The ISR business continue to do very well with significant growth, about 17% in the quarter ahead of plan, and offsetting some of the weakness we saw in Government services in our commercial businesses.  In addition, a few business areas in Electronics Systems that were not in the commercial space also did very well. And by the way, as you noticed, we named specialized products Electronics Systems to better reflect the nature of our business, which has been growing to be more of a systems business than a product business.In the fourth quarter, though, in Electronic Systems, EO/IR  microwaves and precision engagement grew benefiting from the ISR surge, as well Telemetry, Power & Control systems and Marine services parts of the business. Declining in the fourth quarter, however, were our Combat Propulsion Systems and Simulation & Training sales due to funding cuts and other delays that we experienced earlier in 2009. In addition, sales also declined in Security & Detection systems, mostly due to timing, and display systems with fewer new military aircraft starts. And also aviation products were down because of the recession-induced commercial aviation downturn.Our backlog at December 31 was $10.9 billion, with fourth quarter orders of $4.2 billion, and our book to bill was slightly over 1% at 1.01%, reversing the below 1% book to bill ratios we had in both Q2 and Q3 of 2009. Our book to bill for the full year, however, was 0.94%. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $372 million.We had some significant wins in the fourth quarter, several of which were competitive. They include imagery analytical services, gunship modifications, the multinational forces, intel support services recompetition, the Maritime Security Enhancement Program for Equatorial Guinea and two large and important classified contracts that were both competitively won. In addition, we had a lot of follow-on orders on our important legacy programs, which included our UAV comp systems, our ROVER product, Phoenix systems, the Compass Call aircraft, CF-18s, LEP or the Law Enforcement Professionals training contract, contract field services, our Fort Rucker maintenance work on rotary-wing aircraft, Project Liberty and other small aircraft ISR programs, river joint, the P-3s, M734 Fuzes, AVCATTs, C-12 logistic services and the EO/IR turrets, of course. So there's a lot of activity.In terms of major recompetes, the only outstanding recompete continues to be the Special Operations Force Support contract known as JOG. Where that stands as of today is SOCOM is currently taking corrective action in response to our protests. They have indicated they will amend the RFP and will pay new proposals or amended proposals, I guess. Our period of performance is scheduled to end in February at the end of the month, but we're still awaiting an amended or extended contract. So our guidance currently anticipates about another three months. So it's in the numbers for 2010 through the end of May.As you know, the contract is worth up to $5 billion over 10 years. It's a very important program for us that we expect to see grow because of the work for Special Operating Forces. Some of the other high-profile large programs that I'm going to make some brief comments on are the JCA program. We still see significant support for JCA in both the House and Senate. The Army and National Guard have indicated that they would like more aircraft. The Air Force has also said that the 38 currently ordered will be the minimum buy. We expect orders for eight aircraft in the fiscal '10 DoD budget, and another eight in fiscal '11. We also expect to deliver four JCAs during 2010.We look at JCA as a very important, long-term program for us, and we expect more than 38 aircraft for the U.S. Military. The QDR [Quadrennial Defense Review] could also address the DoD-JCA strategy when that's released in the next couple of weeks. Also the strong FMS interest for JCA expressed by five international customers, that's Australia, Taiwan, Ghana, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with pricing and availability request received for a total of 33 aircraft. Just note that as with all international orders, the sales cycle is long, and I would not expect to see these impact 2010 from a sales perspective. Certainly at this point we don't see that happening, perhaps in the order side.Project Liberty, as you recall, we're modifying a total of 37 MC12W aircraft for the U.S. Air Force's fully-funded program. We delivered the first 10 aircraft on time. We are ahead of schedule. Our aircraft deliveries are surpassing our contractual scheduled, as I mentioned, and phase two aircraft deliveries, which is a new configuration that affects the aircraft eight through 31, are being accelerated at the customers' request. I would like to insert a special thank you to all the employees of Integrated Systems in Greenville and the other L-3 units that have been working on this program. They have been working 24/7 for about the last year on this program. So they've done a great job in responding to the customer request. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's experience to other small aircraft ISR programs.Aerial Common Sensor, which was a future program, it's expected to replace the Army's Guardrail and Airborne Reconnaissance Low, or ARL, ISR aircraft fleets. However, the Army is not proceeding with the ACS program in the near term as we understand it, and they're currently -- there's no funding for ACS in the DoD budget. Instead, the Army is significantly restructuring its reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition approach to focus on today's fight with some mission redefinition towards a regular warfare. The Army is currently proceeding with a comp competitive procurement, for which is known as EMARSS, for the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System, to focus on the regular missions. This is a real visible change in acquisition strategy, as the Secretary's been saying, to focus on fighting today's fight. So you can start to see some of the programs that are affected.The EMARSS configuration will be a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC12 platform. We expect a rapid acquisition process. A draft RFP was recently released, and a contract award is likely in Q3 of 2010. Initial buy is expected to be six aircraft, which could grow to about 30. We intend to bid this as a prime contractor.The U.K. Springtime, which we've been talking about for about two years now, also known as Nimrod, is still in process. As you recall, the Ministry of Defense have requested now a U.S. Air Force river joint aircraft as an FMS replacement for the U.K. Nimrod ISR aircraft. Where we are today is we expect the U.K. letter of authorization by the end of February next month after the MOD completes their proposed 2010 budget. The award has a high probability of recurring, but I have to caution, it's not a done deal because there is political process involved, and that could always be a wild card. That said, the contract happened in the second quarter, with the first aircraft being delivered in 2013, and our performance extending through December of 2016.The program was intended or will provide three U.K. river joint aircraft, plus ground training and equipment. The planes will come from the KC-135 tanker inventory; logistics and sustainment will be provided under a separate U.S. Air Force/MOD agreement. Our scope would be the ISR admission data systems, installation, logistic services and sustainment, with an estimated value of about $700 million over seven years. Our team does include U.K. industry partners and suppliers.Finally, I wanted to just mention, I'm sure you're going to have questions, this whole matter of Whole Body Imaging at airports. In response to the Christmas Day attempt at bombing of a U-S. bound passenger plane, the TSA and several foreign and international customers intends to increase their screening capabilities to detect more explosive threats with Whole Body Imaging systems, or what's becoming known as AIT, Advanced Imaging Technologies. Deployment strategies entailed more than just procuring these machines. Logistics and timing and training are also significant factors.On December 30 of the end of the year at 2009, we received a five-year IDIQ contract from TSA valued at up to $167 million, depending on quantities that are ordered. We recently booked about $17 million of orders from international customers. Our Whole Body Imaging sell price per system is approximately, this is an approximate number, because I know you'll ask, $150,000 depending on the configuration.  As a result, we expect to see some upside in WBI sales, but again, given the sell price, we have to deliver a lot of machines for it to start to make a difference in the numbers.  We had sales in 2009 of about $5 million in this space. We expect it to grow from $650 million to $660 million this year, and orders should exceed sales for the year. So again trend is up. The TSA is expected to deploy about 300 systems soon. As you probably note, there are only two TSA-qualified suppliers in this space. We are one of them. Our systems use millimeter wave technology and not x-ray.  WBI situation is unfolding, as you know, and we'll keep you posted as it evolves, but that's the best we know as of today. In terms of other new business for 2010, as I mentioned, EMARSS and Springtime, which I covered with you, there's significant training work in Afghanistan, especially with police force and the National Army. The worldwide biggest [ph] contract will be recompeted later this year. We expect it to be a multiple award ID/IQ contract. There's Department of State Civil Police Training, C-17 Training Systems and Sustainment, the U.S. Army's C-12 Logistic Services competition and the Army CCOMS CS32G [ph] competition, all would happen this year. The actual timing of these awards could be impacted by protests and other delays, but we'll keep you posted on these. These are some out-of-the-box ones that we're watching carefully.Getting back to the company in terms of its capital deployment and acquisitions, we bought about $909 million of stock in the fourth quarter, and just north of the upper [indiscernible] of the year, $505 million. Our remaining authorization is about $426 million at the end of last year. In the fourth quarter, as you probably have noticed, we also refinanced a significant portion of our debt, and we've produced our existing outstanding debt by $400 million, notwithstanding, we still ended 2009 with over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and we did get the upgrade  to investment grade, which we viewed as an important milestone for the company.With respect to the acquisition pipeline, we're seeing more activity, and in our evaluations of several companies, we currently have very good opportunities. We plan to invest more in 2010 than we have in the past two years. So we will see M&A this year. Overall, we're very happy with the balance sheet and liquidity positions.In terms of 2010 guidance, Ralph will take you through the details. As you've seen, we have increased modestly sales, EPS and cash flow for 2010. We do continue to take a conservative position with the SOFSA contract, only assuming it until the end of May. We do have upsides in its further extension, winning some for those new business opportunities I've discussed, a few which pertain to Afghanistan and from deploying our excess cash for M&A or further share repurchases. So the guidance today in our release was updated, increasing the earnings per share range to $8 to $8.20, up 6% at the midpoint versus 2009. We expect to see sales between $15.8 billion and $16 billion, up 2% at the midpoint. And of course, again, a factor in that number is that JOG is only in for half a year this year versus a full year last year, which is significant.So to wrap up, one of the things I wanted to mention is as we have been saying and as we said in our Investor Day in December, due to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the current global geopolitical environment, we did not see an occasion for significant reductions in defense spending. And I think that given the State of the Union last night and comments made by Secretary Gates back in January, when he met with an industry group, the AIA, the Aerospace Industry Association's Executive Committee, which is essentially the big aerospace and defense companies, that's pretty much been solidified. Some of the comments made were that it's important to see steady and consistent growth in the defense budget, and I interpret that to mean 2% to 3% above the inflation rate. It's been recognized in the DoD that the boom and busts of the past decade helped neither industry nor the government because of what they do to us in terms of planning resources and increasing costs. So it was a very, very positive meeting, recognizing that the partnership between industry and the DoD is critical to national security. It was all very, very positive. Therefore I'm expecting to see a stable environment, the defense spending going forward. And I think based on those remarks and our business plan for 2010, we are looking forward to another solid year for L-3. So with that, we'll turn it over to Ralph to give you some color on the numbers, and then we'll take questions."
93538,84104254,47481,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some key trends about the fourth quarter results. I'll discuss the updated 2010 guidance and concluded with some comments about our year end '09 balance sheet and capital structure. So for the fourth quarter, starting with",1095,"Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some key trends about the fourth quarter results. I'll discuss the updated 2010 guidance and concluded with some comments about our year end '09 balance sheet and capital structure. So for the fourth quarter, starting with diluted earnings per share, as Mike said, we had a very solid strong fourth quarter, with EPS of $1.93. There were several items between Q4 this of year and of last year that affected comparability of those earnings.With respect to sales, consolidated fourth quarter sales grew just about 5% or almost $200 million, both from acquisitions. Net of divestitures was $42 million or 1%. The C3IRS segment grew fastest. It was a little better than we planned, and it grew 17% or $123 million. Sales in the Government Services segment were flat in the fourth quarter. What happened there was a growth from acquisitions and on training services. That growth was offset by lower Iraq-related support services and lower subcontract or passthroughs on a large army contract or task quarter renewals have migrated to a new contract to a prime.  This change in contract vehicle will also reduce sales in 2010 versus 2009 by about $120 million.In the fourth quarter, Aircraft Modernization & Maintenance segment sales grew 1%, and what happened there was, growth on JCA, the Fort Rucker maintenance contract and modifications for the U.S. Navy P-3 aircraft were offset by lower expected sales on contract field services, which declined by $37 million. And finally, in Electronics Systems segment, sales grew a little more than 4% or $65 million. As Mike said, what happened there was the growth that we had in the EO/IR microwave, Communications and Power & Controls systems business areas were partially offset by declines in Propulsion systems, and in our simulation training devices, and that was due to the funding cuts and delays that we experienced in those areas earlier in 2009.Moving on to the operating margins, consolidated margin for the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 to 10.6%, and that was even though we had a higher pension expense in Q4 of '09, which reduced the operating income by $23 million and the operating margin by 50 basis points. So very good underlying operational performance in the margins in the fourth quarter, and for the whole year, for that matter.Cash flow for the fourth quarter was also very strong at $372 million up $85 million from Q4 of 2008. The cash flow increase was mostly due to lower receivables DSO, which declined by four days to 66 days, and also by lower CapEx. Free cash flow for the full year was $1.225 billion and $25 million better than we expected. Our free cash flow per share from 2009 was $10.34, up 8% versus 2008, and 36% higher than our GAAP EPS for 2009. So I think that underscores the powerful cash flow that we generate at L-3.Moving on to the guidance update for 2010. As Mike said, we increased the earnings per share range by $0.15 on both ends. It's now $8 to $8.20. Two items cost that increase. First, lower pension expense adds about $0.12, and it comes from the higher asset returns and a lower discount rate compared to what we assumed in our initial 2010 guidance. And secondly, the additional $100 million that we're assuming now on the SOFSA contract adds $0.03 EPS.On the sales guidance, we increased the range by $100 million from both ends. At the segment level, we increased sales guidance by $100 million in the C3ISR and the Aircraft Modernization & Maintenance segment and reduced it by $100 million in Electronics Systems. I just talked about the increase in the Aircraft Modernization & Maintenance segment which was the additional softer sales. And C3ISR raise relates to the continued strength that we see in our ISR businesses, again which was evidenced by our very strong results in the fourth quarter of 2009. And we continue to expect C3ISR to our fastest-growing segment in 2010.The $100 million decrease to the Electronic Systems segment is primarily due to the spillover or carryover effect from '09 where the sales were slightly lower than we expected, and we are also applying conservatism in several business areas in that segment for 2010. The operating margin for this year 2010 remained unchanged at 10.7%, which will be 10 basis points better than 2009. I'll tell you that we're being conservative on the margin, and we're going to try to do better.  The tax rate is going to be higher than it was in 2009, and that higher tax rate is an $0.18 headwind to earnings per share. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.25 billion. Major assumptions there include a $73 million increase in pension funding, so that's $140 million for 2010 and an increase in capital expenditures. Finally on the guidance. Looking at the first quarter of 2010, we currently expect sales to be close to $3.7 billion, with EPS of about $1.75 and free cash flow of about $100 million.Finally, a few points on the capital structure for the year-end balance sheet for 2009. As Mike said, conditions in the bond market have been attractive and early in the fourth quarter, we opportunistically redeemed our $750 million, 7 5/8 subordinated notes, and repaid our $650-million term loan with a new 10-year, $1 billion, 5.2% senior notes offering, plus cash on hand. Those new senior note represent L-3's first investment grade debt offering.Additionally, we also entered into a new three-year revolver in October, replacing the old one that was scheduled to mature on March 9 of this year and is for the same size at $1 billion. As Mike said, we ended the year with $1 billion of cash. We expect that to increased to about $1.7 billion during 2010, and that's after assuming $0.5 million of share repurchases and paying our dividend.  Bottom line is at least ample cash for us to either make acquisitions or to make more share purchases, and as Mike said, the debt decline by $400 million in '09. More importantly, with the refinancings that we did earlier in the fourth quarter, we significantly improved our debt maturity profile, and also gained access to a new source of capital with the investment grade debt market.We believe we have a very strong balance sheet and very strong liquidity. Again, with ample cash, free cash flow and the available revolver. That concludes my comments. Thank you. And I guess we'll go to the Q&A now."

And you have the Iraq elections that will happen next month, which will be an indicator of how stable and ready we are to transition and hand over operating control security, really, of the country.

The second slug of FY '10 may exceed expectations, the peace associated with the Afghan surge, and therefore for FY '11. On that note, I'd like to segue into the other question, which has to do with ISR aircraft. If you could talk a little bit about specifically the opportunities, how we should think about the complexities? You mentioned there are common sensor before. There's EPX, which has had a lot of headwind. How do you see the landscape evolving here? What are the other opportunities for Project Liberty-type ISR, et cetera?"

Of course, a number of things, ACS is just one indicator. I think you could EPX, the proposed EPX, the successor to the EP-3 in the same camp is that. And that trend is to rely more on both the UAVs and the small aircraft ISR, given the current position we are in as a nation and the conflicts that we're dealing with. In terms of the -- right, we're not just using fighters, we're using ISR. So it's a totally different mission to gather this information. And to operate in the theater as required needs numerous sensors and processing capability, data links, ground terminals, you name it. So that is a trend that we expect to continue that has been driving, and we expect to continue to drive the ISR space. And the most specific example I could give you was on the Aerial Common Sensor transitioning to this EMARSS capability, which is another small aircraft-based proposed ISR system. But I would say watch carefully what happens with EPX, whether that gets funded or that mission dissipates to UAVs and other small aircraft."

On the other hand, the view in this administration towards sole-source is not a good and more things are getting competed but not. So you're going to see more shifting of contracts around the industry. You're going to win some. You can probably win more and lose more as a result of that. I mean, that's just a fact of life. So I would tell you that our view is embodied in our guidance and the overall growth that was showing in ISR in certain product areas, such as our EO/IR and aircraft mod. Actually, if you look at that segment and you take the effect of JOG out, it's actually growing about 5%. And we view that as a market that we would like to see steadily grow for us because of the lack of new platforms and the need for upgrade and sustainment on existing. So both of them are growing markets, but trying to put a number around it is not something that I certainly have the ability to do right now."

One, the requirement hasn't gone away. You have Bradleys that need transmissions. The reason for the shift in funding  and the bump on the head, as you called it, was that Bradleys were not being used in Afghanistan, so it would no longer was a priority and the funding was moved to other miniature [ph] priorities. Now there is also a recognition that DoD, as said by Secretary Carter, Secretary Lynn and Secretary Gates that industrial base is important. We are the only supplier of transmissions to Bradleys. So I'm not yet ready to go knock on doors and say, ""Hey, if we don't order some, we're not going to have them anymore because we can't afford to keep the plant open."" It's just the volume issue right now. We expect the funding to eventually come back in that space. Now when you look at the broader vehicle market, it's certainly a space where L-3 would like have a bigger presence, and doing that in a way that did not necessitate us going out by a vehicle company. We're starting one because obviously that is not bet that we think is in the interest of our shareholders. But we also see opportunities in areas like electric propulsion. We have introduced our Integrated Starter Generator that is being trialed now on some of the vehicles that would've been in the form of future combat system but more than the new HumVee, as a matter of fact, as well suspensions. We're looking at the potential for assimilating some electronic components to come up with what I would refer to as a common vehicle electronics suite. So it's common from vehicle to vehicle. It's a debate whether that's vehicle-driven or soldier-driven. Where somebody comes in and plugs in their own device that takes care of things like GPS communications, night vision, threat detection and the like. So there's a lot of electronic content that could be developed and inserted in the family of new vehicles, and that is certainly a space that we will continue to look at and get into. And our electronic-actuated log [ph] transmission suspension systems are getting more noticed now because of the up armoring of everything. It's coursing center of gravity and tipping issues. So the Electronic Controlled Suspension System (sic) [Electronically Controlled Active Suspension System] or ECASS is starting to get a serious look as well. So there is upside there, but it's been a long road to get any traction in this area."

As you know, there were a couple of things going on last year. One, there was the concern about how the government would apply OCI rules that prevented some benefiting on certain work across the industry. Number two, there was a concern about what was known as the in-sourcing of contracts, where the stated objective of adding 30,000 to 40,000 people to the DoD would be taken from industry. There's been some clarity in those two areas. One, the OCI legislation that have been served up from the Hill is probably not going to be what gets done, which was very onerous for both the DoD and industry to live with. In fact, you saw a significant divestiture last year from one of the major players in that space. So there will be guidance that should come out, as I recall, next week. They said around February 1, that we think the DoD and the industry can live with. And with that clarity, we should be able to move forward a little bit better. In addition to in sourcing, well, at least 10,000 of those jobs have to do with cost estimators, contract specialists, accountants, attorneys, et cetera, that are not coming from the industry. In fact, they're new hires that are coming out of the non-contractual world [ph]. So that's taking a little pressure off of us on that as well. In terms of the competitiveness, I think that the government doesn't have to do anything because everybody in the industry seems to be showing up for every competition because the air was getting a little thin. And that aspect of it's been taking care of itself. Now having said that, our margins have been relatively stable, enough [ph] services, and has to do with the top of the type of services we offer, which I would call more in the non-commodity type work. It's not just body shop work, if you will. It's very specialized work, whether it's Military training, nation building or it has to do with some of the clearance cleared work that we do for the three-letter agencies or some of the scientific engineering work that we do in the U.S. I mean, this is a special workforce that we have. So we're able to pretty much not have to drop off pricing into the 3% and 4% range as you might see on our typical IT contracts. So I think our services will stabilize this year. We're hopeful to see how it develops throughout 2010."

Thanks for joining us for the fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin by thanking our employees who did a great job in the fourth quarter, and showed very strong commitment to our program performance and satisfying customer needs, as well as our group Presidents for their continued leadership and excellent performance.Overall we had a strong finish in 2009 and in overview, a good fourth quarter. Our sales were up 5% to $4.2 billion. Earnings per share grew to $1.93, but while reported GAAP earnings were down 11% when you compare it to last year's fourth quarter, operationally, earnings grew significantly. So in 2009, we had higher pension expense and a debt retirement charge. In 2008's fourth quarter, we had gains both from a divestiture and from an income tax matter that have closed. So when you net those two items out and you compare apples to apples, operationally, earnings were up 18% earnings per share.Overall, we saw some of the same business trends in Q4 that we saw all year. The ISR business continue to do very well with significant growth, about 17% in the quarter ahead of plan, and offsetting some of the weakness we saw in Government services in our commercial businesses.  In addition, a few business areas in Electronics Systems that were not in the commercial space also did very well. And by the way, as you noticed, we named specialized products Electronics Systems to better reflect the nature of our business, which has been growing to be more of a systems business than a product business.In the fourth quarter, though, in Electronic Systems, EO/IR  microwaves and precision engagement grew benefiting from the ISR surge, as well Telemetry, Power & Control systems and Marine services parts of the business. Declining in the fourth quarter, however, were our Combat Propulsion Systems and Simulation & Training sales due to funding cuts and other delays that we experienced earlier in 2009. In addition, sales also declined in Security & Detection systems, mostly due to timing, and display systems with fewer new military aircraft starts. And also aviation products were down because of the recession-induced commercial aviation downturn.Our backlog at December 31 was $10.9 billion, with fourth quarter orders of $4.2 billion, and our book to bill was slightly over 1% at 1.01%, reversing the below 1% book to bill ratios we had in both Q2 and Q3 of 2009. Our book to bill for the full year, however, was 0.94%. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $372 million.We had some significant wins in the fourth quarter, several of which were competitive. They include imagery analytical services, gunship modifications, the multinational forces, intel support services recompetition, the Maritime Security Enhancement Program for Equatorial Guinea and two large and important classified contracts that were both competitively won. In addition, we had a lot of follow-on orders on our important legacy programs, which included our UAV comp systems, our ROVER product, Phoenix systems, the Compass Call aircraft, CF-18s, LEP or the Law Enforcement Professionals training contract, contract field services, our Fort Rucker maintenance work on rotary-wing aircraft, Project Liberty and other small aircraft ISR programs, river joint, the P-3s, M734 Fuzes, AVCATTs, C-12 logistic services and the EO/IR turrets, of course. So there's a lot of activity.In terms of major recompetes, the only outstanding recompete continues to be the Special Operations Force Support contract known as JOG. Where that stands as of today is SOCOM is currently taking corrective action in response to our protests. They have indicated they will amend the RFP and will pay new proposals or amended proposals, I guess. Our period of performance is scheduled to end in February at the end of the month, but we're still awaiting an amended or extended contract. So our guidance currently anticipates about another three months. So it's in the numbers for 2010 through the end of May.As you know, the contract is worth up to $5 billion over 10 years. It's a very important program for us that we expect to see grow because of the work for Special Operating Forces. Some of the other high-profile large programs that I'm going to make some brief comments on are the JCA program. We still see significant support for JCA in both the House and Senate. The Army and National Guard have indicated that they would like more aircraft. The Air Force has also said that the 38 currently ordered will be the minimum buy. We expect orders for eight aircraft in the fiscal '10 DoD budget, and another eight in fiscal '11. We also expect to deliver four JCAs during 2010.We look at JCA as a very important, long-term program for us, and we expect more than 38 aircraft for the U.S. Military. The QDR [Quadrennial Defense Review] could also address the DoD-JCA strategy when that's released in the next couple of weeks. Also the strong FMS interest for JCA expressed by five international customers, that's Australia, Taiwan, Ghana, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with pricing and availability request received for a total of 33 aircraft. Just note that as with all international orders, the sales cycle is long, and I would not expect to see these impact 2010 from a sales perspective. Certainly at this point we don't see that happening, perhaps in the order side.Project Liberty, as you recall, we're modifying a total of 37 MC12W aircraft for the U.S. Air Force's fully-funded program. We delivered the first 10 aircraft on time. We are ahead of schedule. Our aircraft deliveries are surpassing our contractual scheduled, as I mentioned, and phase two aircraft deliveries, which is a new configuration that affects the aircraft eight through 31, are being accelerated at the customers' request. I would like to insert a special thank you to all the employees of Integrated Systems in Greenville and the other L-3 units that have been working on this program. They have been working 24/7 for about the last year on this program. So they've done a great job in responding to the customer request. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's experience to other small aircraft ISR programs.Aerial Common Sensor, which was a future program, it's expected to replace the Army's Guardrail and Airborne Reconnaissance Low, or ARL, ISR aircraft fleets. However, the Army is not proceeding with the ACS program in the near term as we understand it, and they're currently -- there's no funding for ACS in the DoD budget. Instead, the Army is significantly restructuring its reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition approach to focus on today's fight with some mission redefinition towards a regular warfare. The Army is currently proceeding with a comp competitive procurement, for which is known as EMARSS, for the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System, to focus on the regular missions. This is a real visible change in acquisition strategy, as the Secretary's been saying, to focus on fighting today's fight. So you can start to see some of the programs that are affected.The EMARSS configuration will be a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC12 platform. We expect a rapid acquisition process. A draft RFP was recently released, and a contract award is likely in Q3 of 2010. Initial buy is expected to be six aircraft, which could grow to about 30. We intend to bid this as a prime contractor.The U.K. Springtime, which we've been talking about for about two years now, also known as Nimrod, is still in process. As you recall, the Ministry of Defense have requested now a U.S. Air Force river joint aircraft as an FMS replacement for the U.K. Nimrod ISR aircraft. Where we are today is we expect the U.K. letter of authorization by the end of February next month after the MOD completes their proposed 2010 budget. The award has a high probability of recurring, but I have to caution, it's not a done deal because there is political process involved, and that could always be a wild card. That said, the contract happened in the second quarter, with the first aircraft being delivered in 2013, and our performance extending through December of 2016.The program was intended or will provide three U.K. river joint aircraft, plus ground training and equipment. The planes will come from the KC-135 tanker inventory; logistics and sustainment will be provided under a separate U.S. Air Force/MOD agreement. Our scope would be the ISR admission data systems, installation, logistic services and sustainment, with an estimated value of about $700 million over seven years. Our team does include U.K. industry partners and suppliers.Finally, I wanted to just mention, I'm sure you're going to have questions, this whole matter of Whole Body Imaging at airports. In response to the Christmas Day attempt at bombing of a U-S. bound passenger plane, the TSA and several foreign and international customers intends to increase their screening capabilities to detect more explosive threats with Whole Body Imaging systems, or what's becoming known as AIT, Advanced Imaging Technologies. Deployment strategies entailed more than just procuring these machines. Logistics and timing and training are also significant factors.On December 30 of the end of the year at 2009, we received a five-year IDIQ contract from TSA valued at up to $167 million, depending on quantities that are ordered. We recently booked about $17 million of orders from international customers. Our Whole Body Imaging sell price per system is approximately, this is an approximate number, because I know you'll ask, $150,000 depending on the configuration.  As a result, we expect to see some upside in WBI sales, but again, given the sell price, we have to deliver a lot of machines for it to start to make a difference in the numbers.  We had sales in 2009 of about $5 million in this space. We expect it to grow from $650 million to $660 million this year, and orders should exceed sales for the year. So again trend is up. The TSA is expected to deploy about 300 systems soon. As you probably note, there are only two TSA-qualified suppliers in this space. We are one of them. Our systems use millimeter wave technology and not x-ray.  WBI situation is unfolding, as you know, and we'll keep you posted as it evolves, but that's the best we know as of today. In terms of other new business for 2010, as I mentioned, EMARSS and Springtime, which I covered with you, there's significant training work in Afghanistan, especially with police force and the National Army. The worldwide biggest [ph] contract will be recompeted later this year. We expect it to be a multiple award ID/IQ contract. There's Department of State Civil Police Training, C-17 Training Systems and Sustainment, the U.S. Army's C-12 Logistic Services competition and the Army CCOMS CS32G [ph] competition, all would happen this year. The actual timing of these awards could be impacted by protests and other delays, but we'll keep you posted on these. These are some out-of-the-box ones that we're watching carefully.Getting back to the company in terms of its capital deployment and acquisitions, we bought about $909 million of stock in the fourth quarter, and just north of the upper [indiscernible] of the year, $505 million. Our remaining authorization is about $426 million at the end of last year. In the fourth quarter, as you probably have noticed, we also refinanced a significant portion of our debt, and we've produced our existing outstanding debt by $400 million, notwithstanding, we still ended 2009 with over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and we did get the upgrade  to investment grade, which we viewed as an important milestone for the company.With respect to the acquisition pipeline, we're seeing more activity, and in our evaluations of several companies, we currently have very good opportunities. We plan to invest more in 2010 than we have in the past two years. So we will see M&A this year. Overall, we're very happy with the balance sheet and liquidity positions.In terms of 2010 guidance, Ralph will take you through the details. As you've seen, we have increased modestly sales, EPS and cash flow for 2010. We do continue to take a conservative position with the SOFSA contract, only assuming it until the end of May. We do have upsides in its further extension, winning some for those new business opportunities I've discussed, a few which pertain to Afghanistan and from deploying our excess cash for M&A or further share repurchases. So the guidance today in our release was updated, increasing the earnings per share range to $8 to $8.20, up 6% at the midpoint versus 2009. We expect to see sales between $15.8 billion and $16 billion, up 2% at the midpoint. And of course, again, a factor in that number is that JOG is only in for half a year this year versus a full year last year, which is significant.So to wrap up, one of the things I wanted to mention is as we have been saying and as we said in our Investor Day in December, due to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the current global geopolitical environment, we did not see an occasion for significant reductions in defense spending. And I think that given the State of the Union last night and comments made by Secretary Gates back in January, when he met with an industry group, the AIA, the Aerospace Industry Association's Executive Committee, which is essentially the big aerospace and defense companies, that's pretty much been solidified. Some of the comments made were that it's important to see steady and consistent growth in the defense budget, and I interpret that to mean 2% to 3% above the inflation rate. It's been recognized in the DoD that the boom and busts of the past decade helped neither industry nor the government because of what they do to us in terms of planning resources and increasing costs. So it was a very, very positive meeting, recognizing that the partnership between industry and the DoD is critical to national security. It was all very, very positive. Therefore I'm expecting to see a stable environment, the defense spending going forward. And I think based on those remarks and our business plan for 2010, we are looking forward to another solid year for L-3. So with that, we'll turn it over to Ralph to give you some color on the numbers, and then we'll take questions."

I'll discuss the updated 2010 guidance and concluded with some comments about our year end '09 balance sheet and capital structure. So for the fourth quarter, starting with diluted earnings per share, as Mike said, we had a very solid strong fourth quarter, with EPS of $1.93. There were several items between Q4 this of year and of last year that affected comparability of those earnings.With respect to sales, consolidated fourth quarter sales grew just about 5% or almost $200 million, both from acquisitions. Net of divestitures was $42 million or 1%. The C3IRS segment grew fastest. It was a little better than we planned, and it grew 17% or $123 million. Sales in the Government Services segment were flat in the fourth quarter. What happened there was a growth from acquisitions and on training services. That growth was offset by lower Iraq-related support services and lower subcontract or passthroughs on a large army contract or task quarter renewals have migrated to a new contract to a prime.  This change in contract vehicle will also reduce sales in 2010 versus 2009 by about $120 million.In the fourth quarter, Aircraft Modernization & Maintenance segment sales grew 1%, and what happened there was, growth on JCA, the Fort Rucker maintenance contract and modifications for the U.S. Navy P-3 aircraft were offset by lower expected sales on contract field services, which declined by $37 million. And finally, in Electronics Systems segment, sales grew a little more than 4% or $65 million. As Mike said, what happened there was the growth that we had in the EO/IR microwave, Communications and Power & Controls systems business areas were partially offset by declines in Propulsion systems, and in our simulation training devices, and that was due to the funding cuts and delays that we experienced in those areas earlier in 2009.Moving on to the operating margins, consolidated margin for the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 to 10.6%, and that was even though we had a higher pension expense in Q4 of '09, which reduced the operating income by $23 million and the operating margin by 50 basis points. So very good underlying operational performance in the margins in the fourth quarter, and for the whole year, for that matter.Cash flow for the fourth quarter was also very strong at $372 million up $85 million from Q4 of 2008. The cash flow increase was mostly due to lower receivables DSO, which declined by four days to 66 days, and also by lower CapEx. Free cash flow for the full year was $1.225 billion and $25 million better than we expected. Our free cash flow per share from 2009 was $10.34, up 8% versus 2008, and 36% higher than our GAAP EPS for 2009. So I think that underscores the powerful cash flow that we generate at L-3.Moving on to the guidance update for 2010. As Mike said, we increased the earnings per share range by $0.15 on both ends. It's now $8 to $8.20. Two items cost that increase. First, lower pension expense adds about $0.12, and it comes from the higher asset returns and a lower discount rate compared to what we assumed in our initial 2010 guidance. And secondly, the additional $100 million that we're assuming now on the SOFSA contract adds $0.03 EPS.On the sales guidance, we increased the range by $100 million from both ends. At the segment level, we increased sales guidance by $100 million in the C3ISR and the Aircraft Modernization & Maintenance segment and reduced it by $100 million in Electronics Systems. I just talked about the increase in the Aircraft Modernization & Maintenance segment which was the additional softer sales. And C3ISR raise relates to the continued strength that we see in our ISR businesses, again which was evidenced by our very strong results in the fourth quarter of 2009. And we continue to expect C3ISR to our fastest-growing segment in 2010.The $100 million decrease to the Electronic Systems segment is primarily due to the spillover or carryover effect from '09 where the sales were slightly lower than we expected, and we are also applying conservatism in several business areas in that segment for 2010. The operating margin for this year 2010 remained unchanged at 10.7%, which will be 10 basis points better than 2009. I'll tell you that we're being conservative on the margin, and we're going to try to do better.  The tax rate is going to be higher than it was in 2009, and that higher tax rate is an $0.18 headwind to earnings per share. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.25 billion. Major assumptions there include a $73 million increase in pension funding, so that's $140 million for 2010 and an increase in capital expenditures. Finally on the guidance. Looking at the first quarter of 2010, we currently expect sales to be close to $3.7 billion, with EPS of about $1.75 and free cash flow of about $100 million.Finally, a few points on the capital structure for the year-end balance sheet for 2009. As Mike said, conditions in the bond market have been attractive and early in the fourth quarter, we opportunistically redeemed our $750 million, 7 5/8 subordinated notes, and repaid our $650-million term loan with a new 10-year, $1 billion, 5.2% senior notes offering, plus cash on hand. Those new senior note represent L-3's first investment grade debt offering.Additionally, we also entered into a new three-year revolver in October, replacing the old one that was scheduled to mature on March 9 of this year and is for the same size at $1 billion. As Mike said, we ended the year with $1 billion of cash. We expect that to increased to about $1.7 billion during 2010, and that's after assuming $0.5 million of share repurchases and paying our dividend.  Bottom line is at least ample cash for us to either make acquisitions or to make more share purchases, and as Mike said, the debt decline by $400 million in '09. More importantly, with the refinancings that we did earlier in the fourth quarter, we significantly improved our debt maturity profile, and also gained access to a new source of capital with the investment grade debt market.We believe we have a very strong balance sheet and very strong liquidity. Again, with ample cash, free cash flow and the available revolver. That concludes my comments. Thank you. And I guess we'll go to the Q&A now."

Of course, a number of things, ACS is just one indicator. I think you could EPX, the proposed EPX, the successor to the EP-3 in the same camp is that. And that trend is to rely more on both the UAVs and the small aircraft ISR, given the current position we are in as a nation and the conflicts that we're dealing with. In terms of the -- right, we're not just using fighters, we're using ISR. So it's a totally different mission to gather this information. And to operate in the theater as required needs numerous sensors and processing capability, data links, ground terminals, you name it. So that is a trend that we expect to continue that has been driving, and we expect to continue to drive the ISR space. And the most specific example I could give you was on the Aerial Common Sensor transitioning to this EMARSS capability, which is another small aircraft-based proposed ISR system. But I would say watch carefully what happens with EPX, whether that gets funded or that mission dissipates to UAVs and other small aircraft."

The Iraq work is comprised of ISR and Intel support activities at about almost $200 million, about $150 million in training and law enforcement work. I talked about $120 million for Linguist, and the balance would be equipment maintenance on the CFT, CFS programs and some sales related to SOFSA. The balance is about $200 million or so in a variety of product areas, namely communication terminals, some EO/IR turrets and the Tactical Quiet Generator or TQG. What's in the Afghanistan sales estimate is about $50 million for contract sales services, another $50 million for special operation forces support, $40 million for intel support, and then the rest of it is trading and law enforcement activities.

As I said, we have been reluctant over the past couple of years because of the disconnect between our trading multiple and what acquisitions cost. I mean you've seen it in play, where we certainly leaned heavier on share repurchases than acquisitions. But we see opportunities where that gap is closing. And I thought about that discussion because it is a very fundamental discussion on how we look at it. And some of it is science, but a little bit of it is art too. And I would say that if we we're in a situation, another I would say it, where the market is discounting aerospace and defense companies to the extent it has been 30% to 40% below the S&P multiples and a good company were to come along, would we just turn the other way and not pursue it even though it's in the long-term interest of L-3 to buy it? It's almost like cutting off your nose to spite your face in the sense that because the market's being inefficient or out of sync at the moment, that as you preclude an M&A deal that makes sense now.

So I would tell you that our view is embodied in our guidance and the overall growth that was showing in ISR in certain product areas, such as our EO/IR and aircraft mod. Actually, if you look at that segment and you take the effect of JOG out, it's actually growing about 5%. And we view that as a market that we would like to see steadily grow for us because of the lack of new platforms and the need for upgrade and sustainment on existing.

One, the requirement hasn't gone away. You have Bradleys that need transmissions. The reason for the shift in funding  and the bump on the head, as you called it, was that Bradleys were not being used in Afghanistan, so it would no longer was a priority and the funding was moved to other miniature [ph] priorities. Now there is also a recognition that DoD, as said by Secretary Carter, Secretary Lynn and Secretary Gates that industrial base is important. We are the only supplier of transmissions to Bradleys. So I'm not yet ready to go knock on doors and say, ""Hey, if we don't order some, we're not going to have them anymore because we can't afford to keep the plant open."" It's just the volume issue right now. We expect the funding to eventually come back in that space. Now when you look at the broader vehicle market, it's certainly a space where L-3 would like have a bigger presence, and doing that in a way that did not necessitate us going out by a vehicle company. We're starting one because obviously that is not bet that we think is in the interest of our shareholders. But we also see opportunities in areas like electric propulsion. We have introduced our Integrated Starter Generator that is being trialed now on some of the vehicles that would've been in the form of future combat system but more than the new HumVee, as a matter of fact, as well suspensions. We're looking at the potential for assimilating some electronic components to come up with what I would refer to as a common vehicle electronics suite. So it's common from vehicle to vehicle. It's a debate whether that's vehicle-driven or soldier-driven. Where somebody comes in and plugs in their own device that takes care of things like GPS communications, night vision, threat detection and the like. So there's a lot of electronic content that could be developed and inserted in the family of new vehicles, and that is certainly a space that we will continue to look at and get into. And our electronic-actuated log [ph] transmission suspension systems are getting more noticed now because of the up armoring of everything. It's coursing center of gravity and tipping issues. So the Electronic Controlled Suspension System (sic) [Electronically Controlled Active Suspension System] or ECASS is starting to get a serious look as well. So there is upside there, but it's been a long road to get any traction in this area."

As you know, there were a couple of things going on last year. One, there was the concern about how the government would apply OCI rules that prevented some benefiting on certain work across the industry. Number two, there was a concern about what was known as the in-sourcing of contracts, where the stated objective of adding 30,000 to 40,000 people to the DoD would be taken from industry. There's been some clarity in those two areas. One, the OCI legislation that have been served up from the Hill is probably not going to be what gets done, which was very onerous for both the DoD and industry to live with. In fact, you saw a significant divestiture last year from one of the major players in that space. So there will be guidance that should come out, as I recall, next week. They said around February 1, that we think the DoD and the industry can live with. And with that clarity, we should be able to move forward a little bit better. In addition to in sourcing, well, at least 10,000 of those jobs have to do with cost estimators, contract specialists, accountants, attorneys, et cetera, that are not coming from the industry. In fact, they're new hires that are coming out of the non-contractual world [ph]. So that's taking a little pressure off of us on that as well. In terms of the competitiveness, I think that the government doesn't have to do anything because everybody in the industry seems to be showing up for every competition because the air was getting a little thin. And that aspect of it's been taking care of itself. Now having said that, our margins have been relatively stable, enough [ph] services, and has to do with the top of the type of services we offer, which I would call more in the non-commodity type work. It's not just body shop work, if you will. It's very specialized work, whether it's Military training, nation building or it has to do with some of the clearance cleared work that we do for the three-letter agencies or some of the scientific engineering work that we do in the U.S. I mean, this is a special workforce that we have. So we're able to pretty much not have to drop off pricing into the 3% and 4% range as you might see on our typical IT contracts. So I think our services will stabilize this year. We're hopeful to see how it develops throughout 2010."

Thanks for joining us. I hope everyone has had a chance to read the earnings release. We had a good start to 2010, with a solid first quarter. Our earnings per share were up 13% to $1.87 per share, and that's even",2736,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I hope everyone has had a chance to read the earnings release. We had a good start to 2010, with a solid first quarter. Our earnings per share were up 13% to $1.87 per share, and that's even after a $0.04 per share charge related to that Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage compared to 2009's first quarter.
Overall, although sales were essentially flat at $3.6 billion, our ISR business continued to do very well, with significant growth offsetting declines in the other segments. ISR grew at approximately 11%. The flatness in sales were attributed to orders and sales that have moved from the first quarter out into probably the second quarter. Most notably, our order for the additional JCA, the Joint Cargo Aircraft, expected in March has moved out of the quarter, probably will come in the second quarter.
So at the end of the quarter, March 31, our backlog was at $10.8 billion. First quarter orders were $3.6 billion, which gave us a book-to-bill of 1. But that's even without this $233 million JCA order, so we are happy with the book-to-bill at 1. 
We had some significant wins in the quarter, several which we're competitive, including a NAVAIR systems engineering support contract and a U.S. Air Force Cybersecurity operations contract, as well as linguist services for a classified customer. We also had significant follow-on orders on several important legacy programs, including our UAV Communications Systems, EO/IR charts, our ROVER product, Phoenix communications systems, our Compass Call aircraft, the Canadian F-18 program, the Law Enforcement Professionals program, our Contract Field Services, maintenance work at Fort Rucker, the small ISR aircrafts such as Project Liberty, Rivet Joint work, U.S. Navy P-3s, AVCATTs and to the C-12 CLS, just to name a few. 
In terms of recompetitions, the only major outstanding recompete for us continues to be the Special Operations Support for support activity contractor JOG. Where that stands today is that SOCOM is currently taking corrective action in response to our protest. They said they expect to release a new RFP in April and make an award by next January. As of now, we still haven't received RFP. But in the meantime, the period of performance on our contract, the incumbent contract, has been extended to January 31, 2011. And our contract value has been increased by $400 million. We expect to see a new contract in this competition being worth up to $5 billion over 10 years, and this is obviously a very important program to us. And we await this competition and look forward to continuing on this, the incumbent of course. 
In terms of our significant programs, I'll name a few. In terms of the larger ones, I can give you some color. First of all, on JCA, the Joint Cargo Aircraft, we expect orders for eight aircraft during the fiscal '10 budget, which will bring our orders to date to 21 aircraft. Now that's the order that I mention slipped out in the first quarter, but we still expect it. It's in the budget, so we expect to see the money. I think it's a paperwork issue. We also expect eight more in fiscal '11. So the total U.S. Air Force buy is expected to be 38 aircraft with the final nine coming in fiscal '12.
This year, we expect to deliver four JCAs, bringing total deliveries inception to date to six. We've already delivered in the first quarter two of those four. So we're in good shape to make those deliveries this year. In addition, the National Guard is still projecting a need for additional aircraft and there's also a potential for a plus up in fiscal '12. So we remained optimistic on this program. And obviously, there's still several foreign military sales opportunities. I would not characterize them as being in the short term just because the sales cycle is longer internationally, but as this aircraft begins to get deployed, we expect to see more interest in it.
In terms of Project Liberty, we are modifying, as you know, a total of 37 MC-12W aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. So far, we've delivered 23 aircraft on time, on budget, and our deliveries are surpassing our contractual schedule. We expect to finish delivering all 37 aircraft this November. Not only was Liberty the fastest delivery by a defense contractor for our weapon system to the U.S. military since World War II, but also the aircraft's performance to date has been truly exceptional. We're very proud of the performance here. The fleet has flown more than 2,100 sorties over 7,000 hours with a mission availability rate exceeding 96%.
We look forward to continuing to fly L-3's expertise to other small aircraft ISR applications, both with the DoD, as well as international customers. For example, we currently expect the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by six airplanes, hopefully, later this year or fiscal '11. And several international customers are expressing strong interest. So there's a lot of activity in this space.
As you know, the Army is also proceeding with a competitive procurement for what's known as the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System or EMARSS. And that's an aircraft that focus on a regular warfare missions, communications, intelligence, electro-optical/infrared missions and communications. The EMARSS configuration will be a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12 platform. Draft RFP was already released and the final RFP is expected next month, with the contract award likely by the end of September. The initial buy is expected to be about six, probably four aircraft, I'd say, and could grow to 36 aircraft for the full program, the initial contract. L-3 is competing for EMARSS as a prime.
The U.K. Springtime contract, just remember, that was once known HELIX, now Springtime. The good news with Springtime is that the U.K. Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Air Force are going forward with the program. The letter of authorization for this foreign military sale was signed by the MOD and the U.S. Air Force last month in March. And as you know, we were selected to be the prime. 
It will be a significant program for L-3 with over $700 million over the next seven years. It consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod, ISR Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance aircraft. Although the program is going forward, which is a good news, it has been delayed per the LOA that was signed with the first delivery slipping 12 months to April 2014. We expect to begin negotiating our contract with the MOD soon, with the award happening we expect no later than the first quarter of 2011 and quite possibly later this year. And we could receive a long lead materials contract by the second quarter this year, which we are in.
So we expect to provide three Rivet Joint U.K. versions, plus ground training and training equipment. The logistics since sustained, part of that program will be provided under a separate agreement. So our scope today is the aircraft integration including the ISR and mission data systems installation, logistics services and sustainment.
Finally, the Whole Body Imaging product for airport checkpoint is finally getting a little bit of wind behind it. As we've previously said in December of 2009, we received the five-year IDIQ contract from the TSA, valued at up to $167 million depending on quantities ordered. In the first quarter, we also booked about $17 million of orders from international customers. The TSA is expected to deploy 300 of these systems soon. Today, there are only two qualified suppliers, it's L-3 and another company. Our system relies on millimeter wave, and it's not an X-ray. 
This morning, I'm pleased to tell you, we received the TSA order for the first 202 systems valued at $31.7 million. So they're drawing down on that IDIQ. The Whole Body Imaging situation is unfolding and we continue to keep you posted as those evolve. So I would be very hopeful that once they are deployed and used in airports, and hopefully, they will take advantage of the automated screening and there is no actual imaging or privacy concern. The travelers will become more comfortable. It will speed lines in airports and it will pick up the demand. I expect there to be at least the market for 2,000 of these systems, if not more. And you can define that market as every lane in every terminal in every airport. So it's a big market and we're optimistic that this will start to pick up speed as we go forward.
There's been a bunch of buzz in the press about the tanker opportunity with EADS. As you know, L-3 is always interested in expanding our program base when our capabilities are a good match. And we're also very eager to form strategic partnerships with regards to our business. This sounded like a potentially interesting opportunity for us, and we were considering a subcontractor position. We did evaluate carefully the opportunity and decided not to proceed being part of the team. The scope of work was not something that typically we would do in our Mission Integration business and it really didn't fit anywhere else for us. But the door is not closed forever. There's always an opportunity to start talks again someday. And of course, we still work with EADS on a number of other opportunities and wish them well in the competition. 
In terms of new business opportunities for 2010, other new business opportunities, what we're seeing generally is just a slippage of things by month, not by years, but the paperwork process, competitions, funding is delayed somewhat. So the EMARSS and Springtime programs I just talked about, you can see they moved little bit to the right. The Counter-Narcotics Afghan Police Training program competition is also been delayed because of a competitor's successful pre-award protest. It appears the Army may have to conduct a full and open competition pushing the award to the second half of 2010. 
Linguist, we're still waiting for INSCOM to issue the RFP for the worldwide linguist. Recompetition, the RFP, has been expected to be released in February. The new contract is expected to be a multiple award IDIQ and is now expected to be awarded in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, you can see things moving to the right in several places.
Other areas would be the Department of State Civilian Police Training program, C-17 training system sustainment contract, the U.S. Army C-12 contract logistics services competition and the Army CECOM S32G competition. That one is slipping until next year and will likely be broken into three to five elements. So not only is it going to slip, but it's going to be broken into smaller pieces.  The actual timing of these awards will be impacted by protest and other procurement delays, potentially, but we'll keep you posted on our quarterly calls and our press releases, of course.
In terms of capital deployment and acquisitions, this quarter, we repurchased $123 million of our stock in the first quarter. Our authorization that remains is about $300 million, and we expect to complete it this year, before the end of the year. With respect to acquisitions, we continue to evaluate several companies. Apparently, we have some very good opportunities and expect to invest more dollars in 2010. 
As you know, we announced the acquisition of Insight Technology and closed it last week. We think it's a great fit. As you know, we've been very selective in what we acquire. And it's been slow in the last couple of years because of the lack of qualified candidates in the general business environment. But I'm happy to say that Insight is the perfect type of acquisition that we look for. It broadened significantly our capability in EO/IR and Warrior Systems. And in fact, we are creating a new segment in our Electronic Systems area called L-3 Warrior Systems. It will be a $700 million operation that will include Insight, as well as our EOS or Electro-Optical Systems business, our Infrared Products business and EOTech business. And it accomplishes many of the things I've talked about regularly such as synergy among our pieces, getting better guide to our customers, consolidating and developing best-of-breed products. 
We're delighted that Ken Solinsky, who is the Founder and President of Insight, is staying with L-3 and will lead our new sector, known as Warrior Systems. The types of products and technology include laser aiming lights, target pointers, tactical illuminators, laser range finders, night vision devices, thermal imaging system, sensor fusion and a host of others. And again, we're very, very pleased to have completed this transaction in the first quarter or slightly after the first quarter. And we hope that we'll be able to announce a few more this year as well.
Overall, in terms of our liquidity and capital resources, our balance sheet continues to be very strong, as well as our liquidity position. As you know, within the last year, we were upgraded to investment grade if need to access the capital markets, particularly that debt market for a larger transaction, not much larger, but a larger transaction, we certainly could.
As you know, in our release this morning, we updated our 2010 guidance, increasing our earnings per share range to $8.13 to $8.33, that's up 8% at the midpoint. We expect to see sales between $16.2 billion and $16.3 billion. That's up 4% at the midpoint. The major increases to the guidance relates to the extension of the SOFSA contract, and for the full year now and the Insight Technology acquisition as well. We also have some upside from winning some of the new business opportunities I discussed earlier and from deploying more of our cash in strategic ways that will also increase our earnings.
The only item I could talk about is since the last call, the DoD budget was finalized, as well as the QDR. And our view is the budget remains healthy and robust, modest-based budget growth plus a large overseas contingency operation supplemental. As you know, Iraq and Afghanistan will continue to determine the near-term resource decisions. 
As for the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, it emphasizes the key objectives centered in the fiscal '10 proposed budget by Secretary Gates. And I view it as a balancing document. If you saw with the premise that our current core structure is more geared towards conventional or near peer type of warfare. You would look at this QDR as being a document that would balance that structure to one that's more towards today's engagements, meaning, asymmetrical regional warfare, willing to take a little bit of conventional risk and prepared to fight the fight we're going for. And you see that in the programs that we are working on. Notably, things like Liberty, the EMARSS competition and the training programs in Afghanistan. I mean that has become obviously the major focus. And looking to tomorrow's potential conflict, that's the way things are being structured. 
And we think that works very well for the way L-3 has put together in terms of our business areas, notably ISR, Electronic Systems. Both of them address these areas very well in terms of the things we do. And our services with the nation-building military training services, among others that we provide in the intelligence area and the AM&M taking today's platforms and making them more relevant for tomorrow's threats or taking small aircraft and converting them to ISR platforms quickly, rapidly, rapid deployment, these are all things that will be important as we go forward. So we are very confident with the L-3 business model going forward.
The budget, as you know, contains few new starts, and we expect to see some rationing and reprogramming to continue. But again, we think reprogramming areas, we are very strong player. 
So overall, I think the portfolio of businesses in L-3 and our capabilities, as well as the quick reaction culture that we demonstrated in the Project Liberty and other programs are very well positioned for the new evolving DoD QDR priorities. And with that, let me turn it over to Ralph to give you some of the financial details and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Go ahead Ralph."
93538,100421646,57206,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the first quarter results or give you the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments about our March balance sheet.As Mike said, overall, we had a very solid strong first quarter, which w",1122,"Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the first quarter results or give you the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments about our March balance sheet.
As Mike said, overall, we had a very solid strong first quarter, which was underscored with our diluted earnings per share of $1.87, which was up 13% or $0.21 over last year's first quarter. And the main driver of that EPS growth was higher margins. With respect to sales, in the first quarter, consolidated sales declined $12 million or about 0.3% to $3,624,000,000. 
C3ISR, that segment grew 11% and that growth was offset by declines in our other three segments. In those three segments, sales for the first quarter were about $70 million less than we expected due to a variety of delays on several programs and products, including Joint Cargo Aircraft, WIN-T, EP-3, eXaminer and Whole Body Imaging detection systems, CSEL terminals and also a large classified IT services contract that we competitively won end of last year, for which the start date moved to April because of a protest by an incumbent.
Another factor which also unfavorably impacted the first quarter sales growth rate is that when you look at all of our negative sales comparisons for 2010 versus 2009, they are more pronounced in the first half, and those include Linguist, the Army CECOM task orders and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. 
Now getting back to the segments, sales in Government Services declined 6% or $64 million, and that was driven by two items: Lower subcontract passthroughs on the Army CECOM SSES task orders, reduced sales by $45 million; and the Linguist Iraq subcontract, sales declined $22 million.
In Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance, sales were down about 2%. JCA was one of the main drivers there, which declined $6 million. And JCA sales were actually $25 million less than we expected for the first quarter because of the slip in the FY '10 aircraft award that Mike talked about.
In Electronic Systems, sales declined 1%. And what happened there was that growth in EO/IR Microwave Communications simulation and training in undersea warfare was offset by declines in Combat Propulsion Systems, due primarily to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and also declines in our Marine & Power Systems business areas, driven by the lower commercial ship building product sales and also lower U.S. Navy sales on the Virginia-class submarine. Also, sales of security and detection systems declined $12 million, and that was due mostly to lower international eXaminer sales. And what happened there was shipments that we planned for the first quarter slipped into the second quarter because the customers were simply not ready to receive the equipment. And lastly, Mike talked about the WBI order or Whole Body Imaging Systems, that was also delayed on the first quarter, and we're happy to have booked that order today.
Moving on to operating margin, consolidated margin was very strong, reaching 11.3%, up 100 basis points over the first quarter of 2009. Margins expanded significantly both in C3ISR and Electronic Systems. We had improvement in contact performance, meaning, direct labor and material costs, and continue the discipline on reducing overheads, plus better higher profit margins in the sales mix. Additionally, we had some favorable items which occurred early, including a contract modification adjustment and a supply agreement volume price adjustment. Those two improved the margins in the first quarter.
So the first quarter margins were unseasonably high for Q1. And we don't expect to repeat those 13% plus margins in those segments, C3ISR and Electronic Systems, for the balance of this year. Margin was weaker than expected in government services on couple of timing items concerning an award fee and a contract award. And we also had an unplanned charge on a security systems contract, which reduced the margins there by 40 basis points. But overall, we continue to make very good significant progress on our operating margins.
Free cash flow for the quarter was also very strong at $245 million, up $133 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Now moving on to the changes to our 2010 full year guidance, we raised EPS by $0.13 on both the high end and the low end of our range, making the new EPS range $8.13 to $8.33. Three items primarily caused the increase: First, the acquisition of Insight Technology, which was completed on April 14, that will add $0.12; the contract extension on SOFSA, taking it beyond May in our guidance, for the full year adds $0.05, and those were offset by $0.04 charge on the new healthcare law that was enacted last month. 
We increased our sales guidance by $400 million to $16.2 billion at the low end and by $300 million to $16.3 billion at the high end. At the segment level, we increased sales by $200 million in Electronic Systems for Insight and $200 million for the SOFSA extension and the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment. We tightened the consolidated sales guidance range by $100 million because of the store slower start in the first quarter and we also were on guard against any continued order and funding delays.
Consolidated operating margin was increased by 10 basis points to 10.8% due to the strength in C3ISR and Electronic Systems, and that strength is more than offsetting reduced margin expectations and the other two segments. Aircraft modernization and maintenance is down a bit because now we'll have SOFSA for the full year. And in government services, the pricing environment continues to be very challenging. Now the tax rate was increased 30 basis points, also related to that healthcare law. And our free cash flow guidance was raised slightly by $10 million to $1.26 billion. 
Finally, looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to be about $4 billion, with EPS of about $1.90 and free cash flow of about $200 million. Similar to the first quarter, we expect to have a challenging top line growth situation in the second quarter and that's due again mostly to those negative sales comparisons for the full year compared to 2009, which are more pronounced in the first half.
A couple of comments on the balance sheet. We ended March with $1.1 billion of cash, and we expect that to be about the same when we get to the end of the year after we pay for Insight due $500,000 share repurchases and pay our dividend. That will leave us with ample cash for more share repurchases and/or more business acquisitions. Overall, we think our balance sheet is very strong and that we have ample liquidity and cash to pursue growth opportunities. 
That concludes my comments, and we'll now go to the Q&A."

But even without EMARSS, our core business is extremely solid in this area. Unabated demand for 24/7 full-motion video is not going away, even in drawdown situations. That is a force multiplier that allows the remaining troops in place to stay safe and know what's going on. So I don't see that impacting us dramatically in terms of drawdown. The Rover product, for example, is still in production. We're going up to version six of Rover. And I see no slowdown there as well. When you take a look at Liberty, we think that even though we'll be delivering the 37th aircraft in November that there's the opportunity for several more orders another six or so. And there's additional capability that's being looked at based on the current fleet that's operating. Again, that's a new airplane doing special missions. And the operator's coming back with their experience with it in Zangie [ph] that we had this change, some of it's in the classified space. There's a potential to refit the existing 37 with advance mission systems, whether we drop things in in-theater or they comeback. So I view this as a long tail in this business area. It's consistent with what's in the budget. It's consistent with the strategy set forth for the QDR that the C3ISR area will continue to be a major focal area. And finally, the technology, George, in this space is moving quickly, whether it's smaller, faster, lighter, different waveforms, wider band, you can imagine the networks that are in place now. The demands on bandwidth are incredible. So it's driven by a bunch of things, the environment, the engagements, obviously, the technology changes and the threat environment.

Certainly, the IDIQ is structured that way, where you'll qualify multiple bidders. And to compete on work under the IDIQ contract, whichever particular contract it is. But then when the test quarters come through, it's price period because they have already qualified you. So we're still seeing a mix. The good news is we've seen it few come through as best value, which does not necessarily mean low-price. It means price, as well as the ability to deliver in low risk and past performance and technical capability. And given the areas where we compete, we think we have an edge. That helps us more than when it's simply price only because of our strong positions in past performance. So it's a mixed bag right now, and that depends on those, it swung all the way back to being best value. It's still a mix."

So I think what that means for our revenue base, the $800 million probably goes down to about $500 million or so. That's the additional downside that we see in the Iraq lead sales. And we also said that that could be offset by direct contracts with the Iraqi government, but none of that has happened yet. And that won't happen until a drawdown is completed.

There will come a point in time where the U.S. emissary will want to pick up the bill for the training now or not. Or should we withdraw our trainers. There'll certainly be an interest in maintaining the law and order and security that has been worked on over the last eight years, 10 years, which was our expectation to have that discussion. So again, I think that's a government-to-government conversation that will happen naturally as these bills have to continue to be paid. I'd also say that there is offsetting any drawdown though. As this equipment comes out, there's like millions of pieces of equipment that needs to get sorted out. So it's a big logistics problem right now that's mounting on sorting through what goes through Afghanistan and what comes home to us, if not serviceable. So that reset by-wave is kind of out there too. So we'll wait and see.

If you lose kind of workforce stays in place and they change contractors, as happened in Linguist. So we have been consolidating operations, as you know, in our Services segment. We have brought our intelligent solutions together with our IT business, which really is also it's not a seat-management business. It's government high-end IT business. It formed a unit that now is referred to as Stratus. It's a combination of those two business units that took out a complete layer of overhead from the timing of separate business unit infrastructure there. We are also going to work -- there's a kind of an integrated answer I'm going to give you. The OCI rules came out today, I believe they're being published today in the Federal Register. I wish I could talk to you more about them, but I haven't had the chance to read them yet this morning. But depending on where they -- I doubt we're going to have any divestiture from them. It could be something small, but nothing of. So assuming that there's not enough action there, what would happen would be the next step in Services will be to combine all the back-office operations for the entire $4 billion segment. We don't need to have multiple back-office operations. So there is low hanging fruit for us to go ahead and harvest, to make it more competitive. As you know, Ralph's been saying there's margin pressure here because they have to keep bidding low, and that's certainly the case. Similarly, in AM&M, we have been working the same overhead issues there. They are not the same consolidation opportunities there for facilities, because again these are field teams. So they're out in the field and they have to be where the customers are. So that becomes more a question of how much more can you take out at the group level than the corporate level there. And we've been trying to get some economies of scale between the Greenville operation and the Madison, Mississippi operation, which runs these contract field teams. That's kind of the old vertex business, the hub there. OCI, I'm dying to hear what came out this morning. Honestly, I am. In other words -- let me give you what the twist is. If there's mitigation plans that most companies can meet to avoid OCI problems, you will see less divestitures. If it's anything less than that, and it's going to call into question, or companies will be forced to choose whether to sell hardware or provide SETA services, you know, Systems, Engineering and Technical Assistance, or other type of procurement-related services, well, then you're going to see divestitures. And is that an opportunity for us? I'll give you a cautious yes because, obviously, we don't want to stub our toe and have a problem with our product business, which, obviously, is something we guard very carefully. It's very proprietary. We don't have the same competitive issues in terms of price, because we know we make the best data link in the world, and we do the best job in integrating aircraft and the like. We don't want to stub our toe and have those businesses disqualified because of OCI issues. This is something where we're going to be more prepared to talk about in the next quarter call. And again, I'm interested in seeing what the rules say today."

So what",434,"First of all, let me say yes, I agree, I heard the Secretary say that, with the industry has been complaining. And the background is that certain systems that we're not allowed to export are available commercially in the international marketplace. So what that means for us is that in the past, we may not have been be able to compete for subsystems on an international platform with some of our sensors because they were export control. And if those controls are relaxed in a sense, then we would be able to compete with them. So the space where it makes the most sense for us would be on international ISR platforms, unmanned and manned. Having said that, you can only go so far in this space before you're going to hit the export wall again, because we have very high-end systems that I could tell you no matter what kind of reform they do, they're not going outside the country and nor should they. So we are happy to participate. By the way, the bigger issue here is not so much we can sell systems to our allies or other friendly countries, but the bigger issue is how do you control the resale of that technology. And that's something that I have to be sympathetic to the folks in the State Department and the DoD that have to deal with this everyday is that that is a real issue. I'm sure there's no problem with many of the countries involved where -- that are asking for this technology, but the ability to control the resale is another story. And that many countries aren't willing to sign up to. So in other words, if a country is building the UAV system and we throw data links and answers on it for their own domestic, national security uses, that's probably not a problem. Now if they want to market that system on the international market, which many of them do, because there's smaller countries that would like to defray their cost, that becomes a problem. So I wouldn't see it as a windfall, but it would provide a modest upside for us.  Okay, well, thank you for joining us on the call. Again, it was a strong quarter.

Overall though sales were essentially flat at $3.6 billion, our ISR business continued to do very well with significant growth offsetting declines in the other segments, ISR grew at approximately 11%. The flatness in sales we attributed to orders and sales that have moved from the first quarter out into probably the second quarter; most notably are order for the additional JCA, the Joint Cargo Aircraft expected in March has moved out of the quarter, probably will come in the second quarter.
So at the end of the quarter March 31, our backlog was at $10.8 billion; first quarter orders were $3.6 billion, which gave us a book to bill of one but that's even without this $233 million JCA order. So we are happy with the book to bill at one.
We had some significant wins in the quarter, several which were competitive including a NAVAIR systems engineering support contract and a US Air Force Cyber Security Operations contract as well as linguist services for classified customer.
We also had significant follow-on orders on several important legacy programs including our UAV Communications Systems, EO/IR Charts, our rover product, Phoenix Communications Systems, our compass call aircraft, the Canadian F18 program, the Law Enforcement Professionals Program, our Contract Field Services, maintenance work at Fort Rutger, the small ISR Aircraft such as Project Liberty, River Joint work US Navy P3s, (ABCAPS) and to the C-12 CLS just to name a few. 
In terms of recompetitions, the only major outstanding recompete for us continues to be the special operations for support activity contract or job. Where that stands today is that SOCOM is currently taking corrective action in response to our protest. They said they expect to release a new RFP in April and they can award by next January.
As of now we still haven't received the RFP but in the meantime the period of performance on our contract, the incumbent contract has been extended to January 31, 2011 and our contract value has been increased by $400 million.
We expect to see a new contract in this competition being worth up to $5 billion over 10 years and this is obviously a very important program to us and we await this competition and look forward to continuing on as the incumbent force.
In terms of our significant programs I'll name a few in terms of the larger ones and give you some color. First of all on JCA, the Joint Cargo Aircraft, we expect orders for eight aircraft, they're in the fiscal ‘10 budget, which will bring our orders to date to 21 aircrafts; now that's the order that mentioned slipped out of the first quarter but we still expect it, it's in the budget so we expect to see the money, I think it's a paperwork issue. We also expect eight more in fiscal ’11. So the total US Air Force buy is expected to be 38 aircrafts with the final nine coming in fiscal ‘12.
This year we expect to deliver four JCAs bringing total deliveries inception to date to six. We've already delivered in the first quarter, two of those four, so we're in good shape to make those deliveries this year. In addition, the National Guard is still projecting a need for additional aircraft and there's also a potential for a plus up in fiscal ’12. So we remain optimistic on this program and obviously there are still several foreign military sales opportunities. I would not characterize them as being in the short term just because the sales cycle is longer internationally but as this aircraft begins to get deployed we expect to see more interest in it.
In terms of project liberty, we are modifying as you know a total of 37 MC12W aircraft for the US Air Force. So far we've delivered 23 aircraft on time on budget and our deliveries are surpassing our contractual schedule. We expect to finish delivering all 37 aircraft this November.
Not only was Liberty the fastest delivery of defense contractor, by a defense contractor for a weapons system to the US military since World War II but also the aircrafts performance to date has been truly exceptional; we're very proud of the performance here. The fleet has flown more than 2100 sorties over 7000 hours with a mission availability rate exceeding 96%.
We look forward to continuing to apply L-3’s expertise to other small aircraft ISR applications both with the DOD as well as international customers. For example we currently expect the air force to expand the Liberty fleet by six airplanes hopefully later this year or in fiscal ‘11 and several international customers are expressing strong interest. So there's a lot of activity in this space.
As you know, the army is also proceeding with a competitive procurement for what's known as the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System or EMARS and that's an aircraft to focus on a regular warfare missions, communications intelligence, Electro-Optical Infrared Missions and Communications. The EMARS configuration will be a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12 platform, draft RFP was already released and the final RFP is expected next month with a contract award likely by the end of September.
The initial buy is expected to be about six probably four aircraft I'd say and could go to 36 aircrafts for the full program, the initial contract. L3 is competing for EMARS as a prime.
The UK Springtime Project, as you remember that was once known as Helix now Springtime. The good news with Springtime is that the UK Ministry of Defense and the US Air Force are going forward with the program. A letter of authorization for this foreign military sale was signed by the MOD and the US Air Force last month in March and as you know, we were selected to be the prime.
There'll be a significant program for L-3 with over $700 million over the next seven years. It consists of three US Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the UK Nimrod, ISR Intelligence surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft. Although the program is going forward, which is the good news it has been delayed per the LOA that was signed with the first delivery slipping 12 months to April 2014. We expect to begin negotiating our contract with the MOD soon with the award happening, we expect no later than the first quarter of 2011 and quite possibly later this year and we could receive a long lead materials contract by the second quarter of this year, which we are in.
So we expect to provide three River Joint UK versions plus ground training and training equipment. The logistics and sustainment part of that program will be provided under a separate agreement. So our scope today is the aircraft integration including the ISR and mission data systems installation, logistic services and sustainment. 
Finally, the whole body imaging product for airport checkpoint is finally getting a little bit of wind behind it. As we previously said in December of 2009 we received a five-year IDIQ contract from the TSA, valued it up to $167 million depending on quantities ordered. In the first quarter we also booked about 17 million of orders from international customers. The TSA is expected to deploy 300 of these systems soon. Today there are only two qualified suppliers, it's L-3 and another company. Our system relies on millimeter wave and it's not an X-ray. 
This morning, I'm pleased to tell you we received the TSA order for the first 202 systems valued at $31.7 million, so they're drawing down on that IDIQ. The whole body imagining situation is unfolding and we continue to keep you posted as it does evolve. So I would be very hopeful that once they're deployed and used in airports and hopefully we'll take advantage of the automated screening and there is no actual imaging or privacy concern. The travellers will become more comfortable. It will speed lines at airports and it'll pick up the demand I expect there to be at least a market for 2000 of these systems if not more, and you can define that market as every lane and every terminal in every airport. So it's a big market and we're optimistic that this will start to pick up speed as we go forward.
There's been a bunch of buzz in the press about the tanker opportunity with EADS. As you know L-3 is always interested in expanding our program base when our capabilities are a good match and we're also very eager to forge strategic partnerships to advance our business. This sounded like a potentially interesting opportunity for us and we were considering a subcontract to position. We did evaluate carefully the opportunity and decided not to proceed. Being part of the team the scope of work was not something that typically we would do in our mission integration business and it really didn't fit anywhere else for us, but the door is not closed forever, there's always an opportunity to start talks again some day. And of course we still work with EADS on a number of other opportunities and we wish them well in the competition.
In terms of other new business opportunities for 2010, what we're seeing generally is just a slippage of things by month not by years but the paperwork process competitions funding is delayed somewhat. So the EMARS and Springtime Programs I just talked about, you could see they moved a little bit to the right.
The counter narcotics Afghan police training program competition is also being delayed because of competitors’ successful pre-award protest. It appears the army may have to conduct a full and open competition pushing the award into the second half of 2010. Linguist, we're still waiting for INSCOM to issue the RFP for the worldwide linguist re-competition. The RFP had been expected to be released in February. The new contract is expected to be a multiple award IDIQ and it’s now expected to be awarded in the fourth quarter of this year. So again you'd see things moving to the right in several places.
Other areas would be the Department of State Civilian Police Training Program, C-17 training system sustainment contract, the US army C-12, contract logistic services competition and the army CECOM S3-2G competition, that one is slipping till next year and will likely be broken into three to five elements, so not only is it going to slip but it's going to be broken into smaller pieces.
The actual timing of these awards will be impacted by protests and other procurement delays potentially but we will keep you posted on our quarterly calls and, you know, our press releases, of course.
In terms of capital deployment and acquisitions, this quarter we repurchased a $123 million of our stock in the first quarter. Our authorization that remains is about $300 million and we expect to complete it this year before the end of the year. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue to evaluate several companies; currently have some very good opportunities and expect to invest more dollars in 2010. As you know we announced the acquisition of Insight Technology and closed it last week. We think it's a great fit. As you know we've been very selective in what we acquire and it's been slow the last couple of years because of the lack of qualified candidates in the general business environment but I'm happy to say that Insight is the perfect type of acquisition that we look for. 
It broadens significantly our capability and EO/IR and warrior systems and in fact we are creating a new segment in our electronic systems area called L-3 Warrior Systems. It'll be a $700 million operation that'll include Insight as well as our EOS or Electro-Optical Systems business, our infrared products business and our (Reotech) business and it accomplishes many of the things I talk about regularly such as synergy among our pieces getting better value to our customers, consolidating and developing best of three products. We're delighted that Ken Solinsky who is the founder and President of Insight is staying with L-3 and will lead our new sector known as Warrior Systems.
The types of products and technology include laser aiming lights, target pointers, tactical illuminators, laser range finders, night vision devices, thermal imaging system, sensor fusion and a host of others and it's - again we're very, very pleased to have completed this transaction in the first quarter and slightly after the first quarter and we hope that we'll be able to announce a few more this year as well.
Overall in terms of our liquidity and capital resources, our balance sheet continues to be very strong as well as our liquidity position. As you know last year, we were upgraded to investment grade if we need to access the capital markets particularly that market for a larger transaction, not much larger but a larger transaction we certainly could.
As you know, in our release this morning we updated our 2010 guidance increasing our earnings per share range to $8.13 to $8.33; that's up 8% at the midpoint. We expect to see sales between $16.2 billion and $16.3 billion; that's up 4% at the midpoint. The major increases to the guidance relates to the extension of the (sourcer) contract and for the full year now and the Insight technology acquisition as well.
We also have some upside from winning some of the new business opportunities I discussed earlier and from deploying more of our cash in strategic ways that will also increase our earnings.
The only other item I talk about is since the last call, the DoD budget was finalized as well as the QDR and our view is the budget remains healthy and robust, modest space budget growth plus a large overseas contingency operation supplemental. As you know, the Iraq and Afghanistan will continue to determine the near-term resource decisions. 
As for the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, it emphasizes the key objective centered in the fiscal ‘10 proposed budget by secretary Gates and I view it as a balancing document if you start with the premise that our current force structure is more geared towards conventional or mere peer type warfare. You would look at this QDR as being a document that would balance that structure to one that's more towards today's engagements meaning asymmetrical, regional, warfare willing to take a little bit of conventional risk and prepared to fight the fight we're going to. 
You see that in the programs that we're working on notably things like Liberty, the EMARS Competition, the training programs in Afghanistan, I mean that has become obviously the major focus and looking to tomorrows potential conflicts, that's the way things are being structured.
We think that works very well for the way L-3 has put together in terms of our business areas notably ISR, electronic systems, both of them address these areas very well in terms of the things we do and our services with the nation building military training services among others that we provide in the intelligence area and the AM&M taking today's platforms and making them more relevant for tomorrow’s threats or taking small aircraft and converting them to ISR platforms quickly, rapidly, rapid deployment, these are all things that will be important as we go forward. So we're very confident of the L-3 business model going forward. 
The budget, as you know contains few new starts and we expect to see some rationing and reprogramming to continue but again we think reprogramming the areas we are a strong player.
So overall, I think the portfolio of businesses at L-3 and our capabilities as well as the quick reaction culture that we demonstrated in the Project Liberty and other programs are very well positioned for the new evolving DoD QDR priorities.
With that let me turn it over to Ralph to give you some of the financial details and then we'd be happy to take your questions.

93538,100421646,57270,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","I highlight some of the trends about the first quarter results, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments about our March balance sheet.As Mike said, overall we had a very solid strong first quarter, which was underscored wit",1133,"I highlight some of the trends about the first quarter results, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments about our March balance sheet.
As Mike said, overall we had a very solid strong first quarter, which was underscored with our diluted earnings per share of $1.87, which was up 13% or $0.21 over last years first quarter and the main driver of that EPS growth was higher margins. 
With respect to sales in the first quarter, consolidated sales declined $12 million or about 0.3% to $3.624 billion. C-Cubed ISR, that segment grew 11% and that growth was offset by declines in our other three segments. And those three segments’ sales for the first quarter were about $70 million less than we expected due to a variety of delays on several programs and products including Joint Cargo Aircraft, WIN-T, EP3, examiner and whole body imaging detection systems, C cell terminals and also a large classified IT services contract that we competitively won at the end of last year for which the start date moved to April because of a protest by an incumbent.
Another factor, which also unfavorably impacted the first quarter sales growth rate is that we look at all of our negative sales comparisons for 2010 versus 2009, they are more pronounced in the first half and those include Linguist, the army CECOM task orders and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
Getting back to the segments, sales in government services declined 6% or $64 million and that was driven by two items; lower subcontract pass throughs on the army CECOM SSES task orders reduced sales by $45 million and the Linguist Iraq subcontract sales declined $22 million.
In aircraft modernization and maintenance, sales were down about 2%. JCA was one of the main drivers there, which declined $6 million and JCA sales were actually $25 million less than we expected for the first quarter because of the slip in the FY10 aircraft order that Mike talked about.
In electronic systems, sales declined 1% and what happened there was that growth and EO/IR microwave communications, simulation and training in undersea warfare was offset by declines in combat repulsion systems due primarily to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and also declines in our marine and para systems business areas driven by the lower commercial ship building product sales and also lower US Navy sales on the Virginia class submarine.
Also sales of security and detection systems declined $12 million and that was due mostly to lower international examiner sales and what happened there was shipments that we planned for the first quarter slipped into the second quarter because the customers were simply not ready to receive the equipment. And lastly Mike talked about the WBI order or Whole Body Imaging systems, that was also delayed from the first quarter and we're happy to have booked that order today.
Moving on to operating margin, consolidated margin was very strong reaching 11.3%, up a 100 basis points over the first quarter of 2009. Margins expanded significantly both in C-cubed ISR and electronic systems. We had improvement in contract performance meaning direct labor and material cost and continued to discipline on reducing overheads plus better higher profit margins in the sales mix.
Additionally we had some favorable items which occurred early including a contract modification adjustment and a supply agreement volume price adjustment; those two improved the margins in the first quarter. 
So the first quarter margins were unseasonably high for Q1 and we don't expect to repeat those 13% plus margins in those segments C-cubed ISR and electronic systems for the balance of this year.
Margin was weaker than expected in government services on a couple of timing items concerning an award fee and a contract award and we also had an unplanned charge on a security systems contract, which reduced the margins there by 40 basis points. But overall we continue to make very good significant progress on our operating margins.
Free cash flow for the quarter was also very strong by $245 million, up $133 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Moving on to the changes to our 2010 full year guidance, we raised EPS by $0.13 on both the high end and the low end of our range making the new EPS range $8.13 to $8.33. Three items primarily caused the increase; first, the acquisition of Insight Technology, which was completed on April 14th, that'll add $0.12; the contract extension on SOFSA taking it beyond May in our guidance for the full year adds $0.05 and those were offset by the $0.04 charge on the new healthcare law that was enacted last month.
We increased our sales guidance by $400 million to $16.2 billion at low end and by $300 million to $16.3 billion at the high end. At the segment level we increased sales by $200 million in electronic systems for Insight and $200 million for SOFSA extension in the aircraft modernization and maintenance segment.
We tightened the consolidated sales guides range by $100 million because of the slower start we had in the first quarter and we also want to guard against any continued order and funding delays.
Consolidated operating margin was increased by 10 basis points to 10.8% due to the strength in C-cubed ISR and electronic systems and that strength is more than offsetting reduced margin expectations in the other two segments. Aircraft modernization and maintenance is down a bit because we now will have SOFSA for the full year and then government services. The pricing environment continues to be very challenging.
The tax rate was increased to 30 basis points also related to that healthcare law and our free cash flow guidance was raised slightly by $10 million to $1.26 billion.
Finally, looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to be about $4 billion with EPS of about $1.90 and free cash flow of about $200 million. Similar to the first quarter, we expect to have a challenging top line growth situation in the second quarter and that's due again mostly to those negative sales comparisons for the full year compared to 2009, which are more pronounced in the first half.
A couple of comments on the balance sheet. We ended March with $1.1 billion of cash and we expect that to be about the same when we get to the end of the year after we pay for Insight due a half a billion dollars of share purchases and pay our dividend. Now that will leave us with ample cash for more share purchases and/or more business acquisitions.
Overall, we think our balance sheet is very strong and that we have ample liquidity and cash to pursue growth opportunities. That concludes my comments and we'll now go to the Q&A.

Well, the EMARS would be a great win for us and as I said it could be actually the next aerial common sense for all we know. So that would certainly be incremental or additive. But even without EMARS our core business is extremely solid in this area. The other (inaudible) demand for 24x7 full motion video is not going away even in drawdown situations. That is a force multiplier that allows the remaining troops in place to stay safe and know what's going on. So I don’t see that impacting us dramatically in terms of drawdown. The Rover products, for example is still in production, we're going up to version 6 of Rover and I see no slowdown there as well.
When you take a look at Liberty, we think that even though we'll be delivering the 37th aircraft in November that there's the opportunity for several more orders, another six or so, and there's additional capability that's being looked at based on the current fleet that's operating that again is a new airplane doing special missions and the operators coming back with their experience with it and saying, “Gee, could we have this or change so much in the classified space.” 
There's a potential to refit the existing 37 with advanced mission systems whether we drop things in in theater or they come back. So I view this as a long tail in this business area. It's consistent with what's in the budget, it's consistent with the strategy set forth in the QDR that the C-cubed ISR area will continue to be a major focal area
And finally, the technology, George, in this space is moving quickly whether it’s smaller, faster, lighter, different wave forms, wider bands, you can imagine the networks that are in place now, the demands on bandwidth are incredible. So, you know, it's driven by a bunch of things, the environment, the engagements obviously, the technology changes in the threat environment. So we feel very solid about the ISR business going forward.

So, those sales were down a little bit in the first quarter and we expect sales to pick up there in the second half and Q3 and Q4. 
The ship building, maritime products are going to be the main driver of the lower sales, $75 million or so and those sales were down about 10% in the first quarter and trending to what we expected. 
The whole body imaging which is going to be about $50 million for the year in sales, I’m sure there could be some upside there, the combination of what we booked in the first quarter on the international orders plus this $32 million that we received today from TSA is going to get us there.

You're not seeing any -- it's like after 9/11 there was a big stampede to Homeland Security place and everybody stood up the Homeland Security Organization. 
Well, this is kind of a similar thing, I don't think it comes in a big bang, it's been a gradual ramping up in that space of capability. I know that there is an insatiable demand, to use the phrase again, for qualified network analysts that -- young people coming out of colleges and in fact that could be a business just being able to bring these people and train them and then send them over to work for the NSA or CIA or typically this is an NSA function. So there's plenty of activity but it's not the big bang everybody thought they were going to see.
The good news is we have several contract vehicles that are in the right place and we have several both products and services that we provide that are in that space. As Ralph mentioned it was a large classified program that we just got turned on for, it's about a billion dollar program. 
In terms of M&A in that space, well, you got to be careful, there's a lot of companies now, they got the buzz word cyber and cyber shows up on everybody's dossier as something that they do (inaudible) as you call it. And when you take a closer look, sometimes it’s there and sometimes it’s not but it's fair to assume that companies that have real cyber capability in this space will command a premium valuation for companies that do not and that is absolutely true.

Certainly the IDIQs are structured that way where they'll qualify multiple bidders and to be able to compete on work under the IDIQ contract, whichever particular contract it is, but then when it's task orders come through, it's price period because they've already qualified you
So we're still seeing a mix. The good news is we've seen a few come through as best value, which does not necessarily mean low price it means price as well as the ability to deliver in low risk and task performance with technical capability. And given the areas where we compete, we think we have an edge that helps us more than when its simply on price only because of our strong positions at task performance. So it's a mixed bag right now and it depends on, has swung all the way back for being best value, it's still a mix.

So I think what that means for our revenue base, the $800 million probably goes down to about half a billion. So that's the additional downside that we see in the Iraq related sales and we also said that that could be offset by direct contracts with the Iraqi government but none of that has happened yet and that won't happen until drawdown is completed. So that's how we see those Iraq revenues trending right now.

So again, I think that's a government to government conversation that'll happen naturally as these bills have to continue to be paid. I would also say that there is - offsetting any drawdown (inaudible) as this equipment comes out, this is like millions of pieces of equipment that needs to get sorted out, so there's a big logistics problem right now that's mounting on sorting through what goes to Afghanistan and what comes home (because) it's not serviceable in need, so that reset that way is kind of out there too. 
So, you know, we'll wait and see. It was almost two years ago I believe that there was supposed to be a contracting conference in Iraq that was postponed to this very topic that you're asking about. It's a two year slip.

On the cost competitiveness question, as you know first of all, the areas that we feel that are the most cost competitive are in the services such as our government services segment and AM&M, the contract field teams in particular where you'",627,"Sure, Howard. On the cost competitiveness question, as you know first of all, the areas that we feel that are the most cost competitive are in the services such as our government services segment and AM&M, the contract field teams in particular where you're always at risk of what I call a re-badging situation if you lose the kind of workforce stays in place and they change contractors as happened in linguist. 
So we have been consolidating operations as you know in our services segment. We have brought our intelligent solutions together with our IT business, which really is also -- it's not a seat management business it's government, you know, high end IT business, (inaudible) unit now is referred to as Stratis. It's a combination of those two business units that took out a complete layer of overhead from depriving a separate business unit infrastructure there. 
We are also going to work -- this is kind of an integrated answer I'm going to give you. The OCI rules came out today, I believe they're being published today in the federal register. I wish I could talk to you more about them but I haven't had a chance to read them yet this morning but depending on where they - I doubt we're going to have any divestiture from them, it could be something small but nothing of. So assuming that there's no action there what would happen would be the next step in services will be to combine all the back office operations for the entire $4 billion segment. We don't need to have multiple back office operations. 
So there is low hanging fruit for us to go ahead and harvest to make it more competitive. As you know, Ralph has been saying there's margin pressure here because we have to keep bidding low and that's certainly the case.
Similarly in AM&M, we have been working the same overhead issues there. They are not the same consolidation opportunities there for facilities because again these are field teams, so they're out in the field and they have to be where the customers are. So that becomes more a question of well how much more can you take out at the group level or the corporate level there and we've been trying to get some economies of scale between the Greenville operation and the Madison Mississippi operation, which runs these contract field teams that kind of the (inaudible) business, that's the hub there.
OCI, I'm dying to hear what came out this morning, honestly I am because in other words whether - so, let me give you what the twist is. If there's mitigation plans that most companies can meet to avoid OCI problems, you will see less divestitures. If it’s anything less than that and it’s going to call into question or companies will be forced to choose whether to sell hardware or provide SETA services, you Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance or other type procurement related services, well, then you're going to see divestitures and is that an opportunity for us? 
I'll give you a cautious yes because obviously we don't want to stub our toe and have a problem with our product business, which obviously is something we guard very carefully, it's very proprietary. We don't have the same competitive issues in terms of price because we know we make the best data link in the world and we do the best job at integrating aircraft and the likes. So we don't want to stub our toe and have those businesses disqualified because of OCI issues. So this is something we're going to be more prepared to talk about at the next quarter call and again, I'm interested in seeing what the rules say today.

So what that means for us is that in the past we may not have been able to compete for subsystems on an international platform with some of our sensors because they were export controlled and if those controls are relaxed in a sense then we would be able to compete with them. 
So the space where it makes the most sense for us would be on international ISR platforms, unmanned and manned. Having said that, you can only go so for in this space before you're going to hit the export wall again because we have very high end systems that I could tell you no matter what kind of reform they do, they're not going outside the country and why should they. 
So, we are happy to participate and by the way, the bigger issue here is not so much we can sell systems to our allies or other friendly countries but the bigger issue is how do you control the resale of that technology and that's something that I have to be sympathetic to the folks in the state department and in the DoD that have to deal with this everyday is that that is the real issue. 
I'm sure there's no problem with many of the countries involved where that are (inaudible) technology, but the ability to control the resale is another story that many countries aren't willing to sign up to. So in other words if a country is building a UAV system and we throw data links and sensors on it with their own domestic national security uses, that's probably not a problem. Now if they want to market that system on the international market, which many of them do because they're smaller countries that would like to defray their cost, that becomes a problem. So I wouldn't see it as a windfall but it would provide a modest upside for us.

That's up 22% over the 2009 second quarter resulting in a book",2446,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Overall, we had a good second quarter underscored by orders of approximately $4.1 billion. That's up 22% over the 2009 second quarter resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03, and our backlog grew to over $11 billion at the end of the quarter, about $11.1 billion. 
Our earnings per share were $1.95. That's up 7% compared to the 2009 second quarter, when you exclude the $0.09 per share charge we took for our successful debt refinancing, which we did back in May. Operating margins and cash flow, we were particularly happy with, which were very strong. 
Overall, sales were up about 1% to $4 billion, with C3ISR continuing to do very well with significant growth. JCA [Joint Cargo Aircraft] sales also grew. And together, these items increased -- sales increases rather, offset some of the declines we had in other areas of the business. 
Some of the more significant awards in the second quarter, several of which were competitive included the U.S. Army's C-12 logistics support contract, the space mission data module and the Apache data link. Also, we had numerous follow-on orders on several important legacy programs, including the JCA, UAV Communications Systems, a very strong growth in the EO/IR turrets, Rover ManPacks,  our Compass Call program, Afghan training, law enforcement professionals, the Whole Body Imaging systems for airport security, Contract Field Teams, Rivet Joint, the P-3s, Flight School XXI and continuing upticks in our helicopter cabin assemblies. 
In terms of major recompetes, we currently have no bids outstanding for major recompetes that will affect 2010 sales. On significant programs, on June 3, we received the fiscal '10 order for eight additional JCA aircrafts bringing the orders to date to 21 aircraft. That order was about $230 million. We expect another eight in fiscal '11. Total U.S. Air Force buy is expected to be 38 aircraft, with the final nine coming in fiscal '12. We expect to deliver four JCAs in 2010, of which two have already been made, bringing the total deliveries now to six airplanes.
We see continued interest, the National Guard is still projecting the need for additional aircraft, so there is a potential for plus ups in fiscal '12. We also feel strongly that if the JCA finds his way over to Afghanistan and gets put into the theater, that there will be continued interest once it gets to perform in the line of duty. There are also several foreign military sales opportunities for JCA, some of which are slipping out a little bit due to government fiscal pressures. But again, the program still has a lot of interest. 
For Project Liberty, as you recall, we're modifying 37 MC-12W aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. We have delivered 35 aircraft to date on time, on budget and our deliveries are surpassing the contractual schedule. We expect to deliver the final two aircrafts by October. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's experience to other small aircraft ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] applications, both within the U.S. DoD and with our international customers. 
For example, we are currently expecting the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by five aircraft sometime later this year for the fiscal '10 OCO [overseas contingency operations] request. We're also currently competing as a prime for the U.S. Army's EMARSS program. 
With regard to the 35 aircraft delivered, they're performing very well. We're told with over 98% mission availability, not one has been lost and we're very proud of that accomplishment, as are the Air Force folks that we're involved with this procurement,  so it's been a very successful program. 
I mentioned EMARSS, and as you know, the Army is currently proceeding with a competitive procurement for the Enhanced Medium-Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System to focus on a regular warfare missions, which includes SIGINT, COMINT, electro-optical, infrared sensors and communications equipment. EMARSS is the replacement for the canceled ACS, Aerial Common Sensor program, and the possible replacement for the aging Guardrail fleet. EMARSS is expected to be a $1.5 billion five-year program of record. 
The configuration is a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12. The initial buy is expected to be four EMD [Engineering and Manufacturing Development ] aircraft, with a four aircraft LRIP [Low Rate Initial Production] option. And it's expected to grow to at least 30 aircrafts, so this is a significant opportunity. Bids were submitted last month, and we expect the Army to make an award by the end of September. 
Moving on. The U.K. Air Seeker program, formerly known as Springtime, the letter authorization or LOA for this FFS [full-flight simulator] program was signed by the U.K. MoD [Ministry of Defence] and the U.S. Air Force in March. The Air Seeker will be a significant program for L-3 with $800 million volume over about seven years. The program consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod ISR fleet. The first aircraft delivered to the MoD is expected to be in April 2014. We expect to receive the first aircraft in Greenville in January 2011. So we're expecting to induct the first aircraft for conversion right after the first of the year. We are already beginning preliminary work on long lead items and planning. We're negotiating with the MoD and expect the conversion kit contract by early next year, and we have received the long lead  material contract in the second quarter. The program will be incrementally funded over the seven-year period of performance. In addition, there's expected to be logistics and sustainment activities that will be provided under a separate Air Force MoD agreement. The scope right now for L-3 is the ISR admission data systems, installation, logistics services and sustainment. 
In our airport security area, the Whole Body Imaging product is starting to really get a foothold at airport checkpoints. Today, as you know, there's only two qualified vendors in this space. One of them is us, of course. On April 27, we received the TSA [Transportation Security Administration] order for 202 systems valued at $31.7 million. This the first order placed on a five-year ID/IQ contract from the TSA. That whole contract is valued up to $167 million. All 202 of those systems, we expect to deliver in the second half of 2010. 
We also expect the next TSA order in the first quarter of 2011. The TSA is stating that future orders of WBI [Whole Body Imaging] systems, are dependent on the testing and acceptance of the order detect software, which is planned to be deployed in the first half of next year. This situation continues to evolve. Obviously, with a new product, and we'll keep you posted as more developments in that space. 
In terms of new business opportunities for 2010 and beyond, we continue to have several large new business opportunities, but several of them have moved a little bit to the right, so later in 2010 or the beginning of 2011 because of funding delays. They include EMARSS and the U.K. Air Seeker, which I just told you about; the CNTPO Afghan police training task order competition, which was delayed because of a competitor's successful pre-award protest, the RFP [request for proposal ] was withdrawn and the Army is conducting a full and open competition. The draft RFP for this new single award contract was issued on May 25. The final award is expected in November 2010, with work starting in January '11. 
We are evaluating whether to compete here as a prime or teaming as a sub. We'll certainly be in the competition either way. In terms of Linguist, the INSCOM [U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command] issued the draft RFP back in May, and we expect the final RFP to be released on or about July 30 for the worldwide linguist contract recompete. The new contract is expected to be a multiple award ID/IQ, with several task orders dependent by U.S. contingency operation requirements, which each will be competed. We still expect it to be awarded in the fourth quarter with work starting in March 2011. 
The U.S. Army C-12 CLS competition, the update there is we won this contract competitively on June 1. We expected to start the transition on June 2. However, there was a protest filed and it's now a with the GAO [Government Accountability Office]. However, we feel pretty confident that this will be sustained in our favor. Again, with protest, you'll never know. This one, is I'd say is on solid ground, I think. 
The Department of State Criminal Justice Programs Support, formerly known as Civilian Police Training.  We submitted our proposal last month. We expect an award sometime in the fourth quarter, with work beginning in February 2011. 
And finally, the Army CECOM [Communications-Electronics Command] S32G competition, which was slipping to next year and was likely to be segmented into three to five elements, including one element for our existing SSES [U.S. Army systems and software engineering and sustainment] prime contract. We now expect the existing CECOM SSES prime to be recompeted with RFP in November and an award in the first quarter of 2011. Of course, the timing of all these awards could be impacted by protests and procurement delays. So we'll keep you posted on this as more facts develop. 
In terms of our capital deployment, we repurchased $131 million of our stock in the second quarter. Our remaining authorization was about $172 million at the end of the quarter. On July 13, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that should cover us through December of 2012. So we surely will be active in being opportunistic in repurchasing our shares, when we believe they represent a good buying opportunity for the company. 
With respect to acquisitions, as you know, we acquired Insight Technology on April 14 for $613 million, and continue to evaluate several other companies. We currently have some very good opportunities, and we expect to have a couple of more acquisitions in 2010 just based on the pipeline, we're certainly in a different place from we were last year, where acquisitions all but ceased due to the market conditions. 
Overall, in terms of our balance sheet, our liquidity is excellent and even stronger with our recent debt refinancing of $800 million. So as you've seen, we've updated our 2010 guidance to date. The new EPS range is $8.05 to $8.25 a share, up 7% at the midpoint versus 2009. Ralph will take you through some of the details of on the update. Of course, it reflects the loss of the JOG [Joint Operations Group] program, as well as the charge for the debt refinancing. We're expecting sales to come in at about $16 billion to $16.1 billion, again up 3% at the midpoint. 
The other item I'd like to talk about, which is reflected in this, is the SSP [Special Support Programs] division or JOG temporary suspension and the Integrated Systems LP show clause. As we mentioned in our release this morning, we expect to execute an agreement with the Air Force today, under which the Air Force will lift the suspension of L-3 Special Support Programs division, and the Air Force will agree also to not suspend the Integrated Systems. I can tell you that agreement has already been executed this morning, and we're happy to have concluded that matter. 
As far as the DoD budget is concerned, the budget remains healthy and robust with modest base budget growth plus the OCO supplementals. Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to determine near-term resource decisions, and constraints continue as reflected by the fact that there are few new starts, and we expect future funding rationing and reprogramming to continue. The tightened budget situations has been underscored recently by Secretary of Defense Gates [Robert Gates]  And Under Sectary Carter's [Ashton Carter] comments. 
Back in May, in his Eisenhower Library speech, Secretary Gates said, that given America's difficult economic circumstances and fiscal conditions, military spending should expect closer, harsher scrutiny. The secretary wants to reduce overhead cost and transfer those savings to pay for future, force structure and modernization, and to accomplish the equivalent of Gates vision of 2% to 3% real budget growth for modernization and capability. 
Under Secretary Carter's acquisition memorandum, he focused on eliminating unproductive, low performing programs, redundant programs and low-value overhead. The objectives include delivering the needed war fighter capability within the DoD budget, as well as restoring affordability to defense procurement. In essence, doing more without more, and we support those efforts. 
More importantly, the objective here would be to avoid the program turbulence and the funding turbulence that causes these unexpected starts and stops and creates tremendous difficulty and inefficiency in our industry. And that goal is one that we really support, as does the whole industry. The ultimate goal of course is to maintain a vibrant and financially healthy defense industry in the U.S. 
The implication for the defense industry, therefore, is to be a responsible partner for the government, and the community must outperform our contract schedules and cost objectives. Of course, the geopolitical scene remains complex and fluid and will likely continue to require a healthy DoD budget, and I think we can all agree that national security is not an option. Therefore, the industry should be okay going forward, provided the defense community take a disciplined approach to Gates' comments and Secretary Carter's memorandum, which we will. 
Overall, L-3's portfolio of businesses and capabilities plus our strong program performance and quick-reaction culture are well positioned for the new and evolving DoD priorities and procurement processes. 
In conclusion, overall, we believe we'll continue to thrive and grow in a new emerging greater efficiency environment. Our culture and dedication to outstanding program performance, on meeting budgets, achieving and exceeding delivery schedules plus the quick-reaction capabilities that we demonstrated on Project Liberty positions us well.  Our strong ISR EO/IR and intelligence support market positions will continue to drive growth, as well our broad portfolio of products and services that sustain, maintain and upgrade and enhance existing platforms. 
Our balance sheet and cash flows as I said are very strong, and we can use them to augment our organic growth and increase shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend increases as we have been doing. So overall, we are positive on the outlook, and we think that growth will continue although at lower rates than we've been used to over the past decades. 
That concludes my remarks. Ralph will give you some financial detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'll highlight some key trends in the second quarter results, review the changes to our full year financial guidance and finish with some comments about the capital structure. We had a solid second quarter results attributable to good g",1090,"Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some key trends in the second quarter results, review the changes to our full year financial guidance and finish with some comments about the capital structure. 
We had a solid second quarter results attributable to good growth and operating income, which was up 6%. And that was driven primarily by very strong margin performance plus 1% sales growth. That growth in operating income drove increases in earnings per share and continued strong cash flow, which again, exceeded net income. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.95, and that included a debt refinancing charge and related incremental interest expense of $0.09 per share. Excluding these debt retirement costs, EPS was up 7% over last year's second quarter. 
With respect to sales, second quarter consolidated sales grew $37 million or 1% to $3,966,000,000. At the segment level, growth in C3ISR and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance was largely offset by declines in Government Services and Electronic Systems. 
C3ISR segment sales grew 7%, led by growth on Project Liberty. We expect growth to exceed 10% in the second half with increases on ROVER, Phoenix, small aircraft ISR programs and classified airborne ISR work. Our second quarter Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment sales grew 9% versus 2Q of last year and that was mostly due to the Joint Cargo Aircraft, which increased by $73 million. 
Additionally, gains on the Fort Rucker fleet support contract, MHP [Maritime Helicopter Project] and gunship  modifications were offset by declines on SOFSA [Special Operations Forces Support Activity] and Contract Field  Teams. The SOFSA contract loss will be a drag on second half sales growth, as will the quarterly timing on JCA sales. 
In Government Services, sales declined by 4%, and that was driven by two items. Again, we had the negative comparison on the lower subcontract pass through sales on the Army SSES task orders, as well as the lower sales on Linguist contract. We expect growth to improve in the second half because of easier comparisons versus 2009 for SSES  and Linguist. And also, growth from a large competitively won classified IT contract that we started working on in April. 
In Electronic Systems, sales decreased 2%. What happened there was growth in EO/IR, Security & Detection Systems and Microwave Communications was offset by declines in Combat Propulsion Systems due primarily to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle funding cuts, simulation and training, undersea warfare due to work near completion on certain contracts and also the Marine & Power Systems driven by lower commercial ship building product sales. Sales in Security &  Detection Systems increased by $16 million primarily due to the international eXaminer sales that slipped out in the first quarter into the second quarter. 
Moving on to operating margin. Consolidated margin was very strong at 11.1%, up 50 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. Margins expanded significantly in Electronic Systems. We had improvement in contract performance and continued better, higher profit margins sales mix. Margin was weaker in Government Services on some timing items and continued competitive pricing pressure that we're seeing in that segment. Overall, we continue to make good progress on expanding our margins. Free cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $281 million, and that's on track with our full year estimate of $1,260,000,000 of free cash flow. 
Moving on to the 2010 financial guidance update. We lowered our earnings per share estimate by $0.08 on both the low end and high end, making the new guidance range $8.05 to $8.25. 
At the midpoint, three items primarily caused the decrease: First, we had the debt redemption charges of $0.09; secondly, the SOFSA contract loss will subtract $0.04, and those two were partially offset by the higher estimated operating margins for Electronic Systems and C3ISR, which will increase EPS by $0.05. And on the debt retirement charges, I'll add, that prospectively, that refinancing is going to reduce our annual interest cost by about $11 million or $0.06 per share, and we'll see that fully once we get to next year. 
With respect to sales, we lowered our consolidated sales guidance by $200 million, making the new range $16.0 billion to $16.1 billion. At the segment level, we reduced sales guidance by $200 million for Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. That's due to the $150 million of lower sales that we expect to generate in the SOFSA contract, with it going away sooner than we expected. 
And we also lowered Electronic Systems segment sales by $100 million due to a few items: First, the recent weakening of the euro currency will cause us to translate euro-denominated sales into about $35 million less of U.S. dollar sales. And we also had some reductions coming from order and procurement delays that we're experiencing in the Training & Simulation Devices and Combat Propulsion Systems business areas, and it's both with DoD and foreign customers. And then lastly, there was a surprise funding cut on the profit program in our Microwave Communications business area. 
With respect to the operating margins, we raised the guidance by 10 basis points to 10.9% due to the strength in Electronic Systems and C3ISR, and so we now expect margins to expand by 30 basis points on a consolidated basis this year versus last year. 
Looking at the third quarter, we currently expect sales to be slightly above $4 billion, with earnings per share of about $2 and free cash flow of about $200 million. The third quarter will also include debt refinancing charges of $0.02 related to the $400 million of subordinated notes that we redeemed on July 15. 
The book to bill in the third quarter is going to be below 1.0, and we expected to rebound in the fourth quarter. It's due mostly to timing and anticipated orders in the second half. Also, our third quarter will close on September 24, leaving four business days on the month of September, moving into our Q4, and we expect to book a lot of orders toward the end of the month of September. And for the full year, we still expect the book-to-bill ratio to be about 1.0. 
Mike gave you the highlights on the balance sheet. We have ample cash. We expect to end the year with about $1 billion. That's after repurchasing $0.5 billion of our common stock, paying our dividends and paying for the Insight  acquisition. We have $1 billion revolver. So overall, we have a very strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. 
And that concludes my comments. We'll go now to the Q&A. Thank you."

So it's not going to be something that will happen next week, but it's something that I hope to see some activity by the end of the year. In terms of number of aircraft and the like, most initial buys are probably going to be for modest numbers, three, five or whatever, depending on the application. And by that, the applications are anything from border, coastal control, internal security, monitoring critical assets, power plants, water supply. Your imagination can kind of fill in the blanks on that. But we've been very pleased to see that there's been a growing interest."

I've quoted in terms of the level of interest, the number of aircrafts anywhere from say, 15 to 25 aircraft. But again, Rob, that's not a closed-in opportunity. That opportunity is going to be spread out over numbers of years. And of course, the production schedule, as we know it now, is essentially consumed by our U.S. customer, the U.S. Air Force, and they are top priority to get these planes delivered in accordance with the contract. So the result of that would be that these international opportunities would certainly fill the outyear pipeline, if you will, which we're happy with, and we'll see where that goes. But there's been numerous letters of interests coming from all parts of the world, certainly, places like Canada or Australia, places in Africa, et cetera, where the application has been everything from search and rescue to that west tactical mile transport and even the possibility of putting ISR packages on the airplane, as well as the potential for a gunship version for the U.S. So it's not only the international, but it's the varying potential even in the U.S. that should provide some legs to this. As you know, when the initial quantities got reduced from mid-70s to the current 37, 38 airplanes, our partner, Finmeccanica's decision was to not proceed with the production facility in Florida, and that has constrained the production capability, the quantity that you can produce in Europe for the short term, anyway. I'm hoping that, that gets readdressed given the interest we have, and that can get increased at some point in time. But right now, this is going to be slow and steady for a while."

But let me cover that for you. First of all, it means that neither SSPD or Integrated Systems will be prevented from pursuing any business opportunities or accepting new contracts, and we anticipate that the actual suspension of SSPD is going to be lifted today. What it means in terms of what we need to do is L-3 has agreed to conduct some additional training and provide certain reporting information to the Air Force during the three-year term of the agreement. And there's a number of things that we will do in support of that. I guess, I'd like to also point out that within the agreement, I mean, this is kind of an unfortunate set of circumstances, but I'm happy to tell you that although there is an ongoing investigation and evidence in the record to date indicates that government emails were not intentionally journaled and no L-3 employee reviewed, opened or used any government e-mails, and therefore, we expect this to be closed in time as the agencies do their jobs. But in terms of any penalties or fines, there aren't any, except we did agree to pay restitution for the employees' time spent and fee associated with these email issues of approximately $273,000, as well as reimbursing the Air Force for its investigative cost of about $60,000. So as you know, we take matters like this very seriously. Our people, including my office staff and part of this immediately, we don't like to hear things happening within the company. We pride ourselves on running a very tight ethics program but only in that, by having a very, very tied up. It's culture within L-3. So any type of issue like this comes up with deep concern to me personally, and I get in front of it. And I would have to credit not only our folks for their cooperation and support with the government in their investigation and getting this done, but also, the support and the cooperation and attention paid by the Air Force Office of the Deputy General Counsel and really working with us, and I'm talking about evenings and weekends to get this resolved and get the settlement in place. And I think we did as good as we could have done in the circumstances."

But as you know, we'll give you some solid guidance when we do our third quarter call in October. Then we'll give you the guidance when we see one in the Investor Day in December. But the things that are more problematic though, they're slipping to the right and everything were pushed. The services side where things are getting -- two things are going on there, maybe more than two things. One is everything is more competitive as everybody's competing on everything to the extent they can. And number two, a lot of the larger programs, when they come up to recompete are being broken up into IDIQs with past quarters. So it creates a much more competitive environment for lower dollar opportunities. AM&M, we're going to have a headwind from JOG for the next year, as you know. But if you break that segment into two pieces, the service side, if you will, the base support versus the actual life extension of an air frame and modernization, the modernization side should start to continue to grow in the mid-single digits, but we're going to have a negative on the service side. And products is mixed now. We have headwinds on the Marine & Power Systems because of the substantial slowdown in the commercial shipbuilding area. Only things that are showing signs of life at the moment are cruise ships and the offshore oil work. Compounding that is the euro weakening, which our operations are done in euros, so that's a bit of headwind. The Combat Propulsion Systems business with the Bradleys is also a headwind in the segment. But going the other way, there's strong growth in EO/IR and a number of other areas and products. So products should probably stay again, mid- to lower-single digits. So I gave you a lot of color and long answer. Where we are now is we continue to see low- to mid-single-digit growth looking out into 2011 at this point. And we'll be mindful that we're going to be updating that as we get to the third quarter because things can change depending on slippages and the like."

As you might know, last week was Farnborough [Farnborough Air Show], and I was over there for the week. And I'd like to tell you the mood is yes, people are worried about programs being canceled and renegotiated. However, the feedback that I have hearing on that this is a solid requirement that is supported and is going forward. It's also viewed by the MOD as a very necessary capability that they don't have anymore because that Nimrod fleet is being phased out. And in terms of alternatives, being part of a fleet of 20 airplanes -- consider the U.S. fleet of 17 plus the three we're to deliver, it's a much better leveraging of technology than trying to build a fleet of three. So on top of that, the U.K., the Royal Air Force personnel, are going to begin some training exercises with the U.S. Air Force, being resident on the U.S. Rivet Joint airplanes now, so that they'll be able to hit the ground running when these planes get delivered. And finally, I'm very confident, expressed my confidence in our Integrated Systems business unit's ability to deliver these programs to the U.K. on time and on budget, which is, as you know, important at a time when they're facing such fiscal constraints. So all in all, we think they recognized the value in this contract, and it's a capability that they will lose if this doesn't go forward. So I am confident."

Given that, I could tell you that there's nothing, at this point, that I would view as significant. But that could change because there is, I think, what you're going to see here some rationalization among companies where one contractor may decide that their business, their asset is worth more to somebody else, and rather trade out of something and trade into something where it's more core. And that's something that we're just starting to look at to see if there's anything there that makes sense. Of course, we're also looking to add to places like ISR, EO/IR systems, training and simulation, et cetera, areas that we have a very strong position in, in areas where we can buy something and actually make it more valuable.

In terms of pushing more risks to contractors in undefinitized contracts, we've been very disciplined over our lives here 12, 13 years on our program performance, and, knock on wood, where program performance has been pretty good over that period of time. I can't recall any major leaders, if you will, in programs. So I don't think that we're going to see wholesale pushdown of fixed price development work to companies because one, I don't think that we have that. The industry has the risk tolerance to do that, and at the same time, we're not going to take on that kind of risk and not get paid for it. But I would tell you, sometimes, no matter what the fee is, the risks would not be worthwhile. I will tell you though, I think that there's more rationality, that's what's going on at the Pentagon, and with the way they're looking at things, then I expect a reasonable approach. So what I mean by that is that the art here is where to draw the line between when a contract transitions from a cost-plus development to a production. And there's some tension on where that line should be drawn, and that, we're going to have to be disciplined with. And so the answer is we're going to stay focused on more margins and on program performance as we always have, and I don't see anything now that's going to cause any changes there for us."

More importantly, we're carefully watching the decisions being made about the government funding of this next-gen equipment, the equipment that goes on the airplane, as well as the Ground segment because we are a major supplier of the airborne equipment. This is for ADS-B [Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast], and we are hopeful that there'll be an acceleration in that capability, and we are prepared to ramp up if and when that happens. And I'm hoping we'll see it happen over the next six months. That's something -- it's done there. It's been on the table in Congress and at the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], and it is a good chance if that does happen. The Marine & Power Systems Group, it's more of a longer cycle because of the international nature of the shipbuilding. So we have plenty of lead time to start to ramp up, but right now, the way it is, the new orders for bulk carriers, if you will, and everything is slow because there's a lot of excess capacity. If you've looked outside of Singapore, it's a parking lot of cargo ship sitting there, and until they get back to work and operators start to see demand that warrants new shipbuilding, that's going to be slow. So the business isn't at zero. The business is still a significant business, but the growth is out of it for the short term anyway."

Our earnings per share were $1.95. That's up 7% compared to the 2009 second quarter, when you exclude the $0.09 per share charge we took for our successful debt refinancing, which we did back in May. Operating margins and cash flow, we were particularly happy with, which were very strong. 
Overall, sales were up about 1% to $4 billion, with C3ISR continuing to do very well with significant growth. JCA [Joint Cargo Aircraft] sales also grew. And together, these items increased -- sales increases rather, offset some of the declines we had in other areas of the business. 
Some of the more significant awards in the second quarter, several of which were competitive included the U.S. Army's C-12 logistics support contract, the space mission data module and the Apache data link. Also, we had numerous follow-on orders on several important legacy programs, including the JCA, UAV Communications Systems, a very strong growth in the EO/IR turrets, Rover ManPacks,  our Compass Call program, Afghan training, law enforcement professionals, the Whole Body Imaging systems for airport security, Contract Field Teams, Rivet Joint, the P-3s, Flight School XXI and continuing upticks in our helicopter cabin assemblies. 
In terms of major recompetes, we currently have no bids outstanding for major recompetes that will affect 2010 sales. On significant programs, on June 3, we received the fiscal '10 order for eight additional JCA aircrafts bringing the orders to date to 21 aircraft. That order was about $230 million. We expect another eight in fiscal '11. Total U.S. Air Force buy is expected to be 38 aircraft, with the final nine coming in fiscal '12. We expect to deliver four JCAs in 2010, of which two have already been made, bringing the total deliveries now to six airplanes.
We see continued interest, the National Guard is still projecting the need for additional aircraft, so there is a potential for plus ups in fiscal '12. We also feel strongly that if the JCA finds his way over to Afghanistan and gets put into the theater, that there will be continued interest once it gets to perform in the line of duty. There are also several foreign military sales opportunities for JCA, some of which are slipping out a little bit due to government fiscal pressures. But again, the program still has a lot of interest. 
For Project Liberty, as you recall, we're modifying 37 MC-12W aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. We have delivered 35 aircraft to date on time, on budget and our deliveries are surpassing the contractual schedule. We expect to deliver the final two aircrafts by October. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's experience to other small aircraft ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] applications, both within the U.S. DoD and with our international customers. 
For example, we are currently expecting the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by five aircraft sometime later this year for the fiscal '10 OCO [overseas contingency operations] request. We're also currently competing as a prime for the U.S. Army's EMARSS program. 
With regard to the 35 aircraft delivered, they're performing very well. We're told with over 98% mission availability, not one has been lost and we're very proud of that accomplishment, as are the Air Force folks that we're involved with this procurement,  so it's been a very successful program. 
I mentioned EMARSS, and as you know, the Army is currently proceeding with a competitive procurement for the Enhanced Medium-Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System to focus on a regular warfare missions, which includes SIGINT, COMINT, electro-optical, infrared sensors and communications equipment. EMARSS is the replacement for the canceled ACS, Aerial Common Sensor program, and the possible replacement for the aging Guardrail fleet. EMARSS is expected to be a $1.5 billion five-year program of record. 
The configuration is a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12. The initial buy is expected to be four EMD [Engineering and Manufacturing Development ] aircraft, with a four aircraft LRIP [Low Rate Initial Production] option. And it's expected to grow to at least 30 aircrafts, so this is a significant opportunity. Bids were submitted last month, and we expect the Army to make an award by the end of September. 
Moving on. The U.K. Air Seeker program, formerly known as Springtime, the letter authorization or LOA for this FFS [full-flight simulator] program was signed by the U.K. MoD [Ministry of Defence] and the U.S. Air Force in March. The Air Seeker will be a significant program for L-3 with $800 million volume over about seven years. The program consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod ISR fleet. The first aircraft delivered to the MoD is expected to be in April 2014. We expect to receive the first aircraft in Greenville in January 2011. So we're expecting to induct the first aircraft for conversion right after the first of the year. We are already beginning preliminary work on long lead items and planning. We're negotiating with the MoD and expect the conversion kit contract by early next year, and we have received the long lead  material contract in the second quarter. The program will be incrementally funded over the seven-year period of performance. In addition, there's expected to be logistics and sustainment activities that will be provided under a separate Air Force MoD agreement. The scope right now for L-3 is the ISR admission data systems, installation, logistics services and sustainment. 
In our airport security area, the Whole Body Imaging product is starting to really get a foothold at airport checkpoints. Today, as you know, there's only two qualified vendors in this space. One of them is us, of course. On April 27, we received the TSA [Transportation Security Administration] order for 202 systems valued at $31.7 million. This the first order placed on a five-year ID/IQ contract from the TSA. That whole contract is valued up to $167 million. All 202 of those systems, we expect to deliver in the second half of 2010. 
We also expect the next TSA order in the first quarter of 2011. The TSA is stating that future orders of WBI [Whole Body Imaging] systems, are dependent on the testing and acceptance of the order detect software, which is planned to be deployed in the first half of next year. This situation continues to evolve. Obviously, with a new product, and we'll keep you posted as more developments in that space. 
In terms of new business opportunities for 2010 and beyond, we continue to have several large new business opportunities, but several of them have moved a little bit to the right, so later in 2010 or the beginning of 2011 because of funding delays. They include EMARSS and the U.K. Air Seeker, which I just told you about; the CNTPO Afghan police training task order competition, which was delayed because of a competitor's successful pre-award protest, the RFP [request for proposal ] was withdrawn and the Army is conducting a full and open competition. The draft RFP for this new single award contract was issued on May 25. The final award is expected in November 2010, with work starting in January '11. 
We are evaluating whether to compete here as a prime or teaming as a sub. We'll certainly be in the competition either way. In terms of Linguist, the INSCOM [U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command] issued the draft RFP back in May, and we expect the final RFP to be released on or about July 30 for the worldwide linguist contract recompete. The new contract is expected to be a multiple award ID/IQ, with several task orders dependent by U.S. contingency operation requirements, which each will be competed. We still expect it to be awarded in the fourth quarter with work starting in March 2011. 
The U.S. Army C-12 CLS competition, the update there is we won this contract competitively on June 1. We expected to start the transition on June 2. However, there was a protest filed and it's now a with the GAO [Government Accountability Office]. However, we feel pretty confident that this will be sustained in our favor. Again, with protest, you'll never know. This one, is I'd say is on solid ground, I think. 
The Department of State Criminal Justice Programs Support, formerly known as Civilian Police Training.  We submitted our proposal last month. We expect an award sometime in the fourth quarter, with work beginning in February 2011. 
And finally, the Army CECOM [Communications-Electronics Command] S32G competition, which was slipping to next year and was likely to be segmented into three to five elements, including one element for our existing SSES [U.S. Army systems and software engineering and sustainment] prime contract. We now expect the existing CECOM SSES prime to be recompeted with RFP in November and an award in the first quarter of 2011. Of course, the timing of all these awards could be impacted by protests and procurement delays. So we'll keep you posted on this as more facts develop. 
In terms of our capital deployment, we repurchased $131 million of our stock in the second quarter. Our remaining authorization was about $172 million at the end of the quarter. On July 13, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that should cover us through December of 2012. So we surely will be active in being opportunistic in repurchasing our shares, when we believe they represent a good buying opportunity for the company. 
With respect to acquisitions, as you know, we acquired Insight Technology on April 14 for $613 million, and continue to evaluate several other companies. We currently have some very good opportunities, and we expect to have a couple of more acquisitions in 2010 just based on the pipeline, we're certainly in a different place from we were last year, where acquisitions all but ceased due to the market conditions. 
Overall, in terms of our balance sheet, our liquidity is excellent and even stronger with our recent debt refinancing of $800 million. So as you've seen, we've updated our 2010 guidance to date. The new EPS range is $8.05 to $8.25 a share, up 7% at the midpoint versus 2009. Ralph will take you through some of the details of on the update. Of course, it reflects the loss of the JOG [Joint Operations Group] program, as well as the charge for the debt refinancing. We're expecting sales to come in at about $16 billion to $16.1 billion, again up 3% at the midpoint. 
The other item I'd like to talk about, which is reflected in this, is the SSP [Special Support Programs] division or JOG temporary suspension and the Integrated Systems LP show clause. As we mentioned in our release this morning, we expect to execute an agreement with the Air Force today, under which the Air Force will lift the suspension of L-3 Special Support Programs division, and the Air Force will agree also to not suspend the Integrated Systems. I can tell you that agreement has already been executed this morning, and we're happy to have concluded that matter. 
As far as the DoD budget is concerned, the budget remains healthy and robust with modest base budget growth plus the OCO supplementals. Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to determine near-term resource decisions, and constraints continue as reflected by the fact that there are few new starts, and we expect future funding rationing and reprogramming to continue. The tightened budget situations has been underscored recently by Secretary of Defense Gates [Robert Gates]  And Under Sectary Carter's [Ashton Carter] comments. 
Back in May, in his Eisenhower Library speech, Secretary Gates said, that given America's difficult economic circumstances and fiscal conditions, military spending should expect closer, harsher scrutiny. The secretary wants to reduce overhead cost and transfer those savings to pay for future, force structure and modernization, and to accomplish the equivalent of Gates vision of 2% to 3% real budget growth for modernization and capability. 
Under Secretary Carter's acquisition memorandum, he focused on eliminating unproductive, low performing programs, redundant programs and low-value overhead. The objectives include delivering the needed war fighter capability within the DoD budget, as well as restoring affordability to defense procurement. In essence, doing more without more, and we support those efforts. 
More importantly, the objective here would be to avoid the program turbulence and the funding turbulence that causes these unexpected starts and stops and creates tremendous difficulty and inefficiency in our industry. And that goal is one that we really support, as does the whole industry. The ultimate goal of course is to maintain a vibrant and financially healthy defense industry in the U.S. 
The implication for the defense industry, therefore, is to be a responsible partner for the government, and the community must outperform our contract schedules and cost objectives. Of course, the geopolitical scene remains complex and fluid and will likely continue to require a healthy DoD budget, and I think we can all agree that national security is not an option. Therefore, the industry should be okay going forward, provided the defense community take a disciplined approach to Gates' comments and Secretary Carter's memorandum, which we will. 
Overall, L-3's portfolio of businesses and capabilities plus our strong program performance and quick-reaction culture are well positioned for the new and evolving DoD priorities and procurement processes. 
In conclusion, overall, we believe we'll continue to thrive and grow in a new emerging greater efficiency environment. Our culture and dedication to outstanding program performance, on meeting budgets, achieving and exceeding delivery schedules plus the quick-reaction capabilities that we demonstrated on Project Liberty positions us well.  Our strong ISR EO/IR and intelligence support market positions will continue to drive growth, as well our broad portfolio of products and services that sustain, maintain and upgrade and enhance existing platforms. 
Our balance sheet and cash flows as I said are very strong, and we can use them to augment our organic growth and increase shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend increases as we have been doing. So overall, we are positive on the outlook, and we think that growth will continue although at lower rates than we've been used to over the past decades. 
That concludes my remarks. Ralph will give you some financial detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.

I'll highlight some key trends in the second quarter results, review the changes to our full year financial guidance and finish with some comments about the capital structure. We had a solid second quarter results attributable to good g",1090,"Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some key trends in the second quarter results, review the changes to our full year financial guidance and finish with some comments about the capital structure. 
We had a solid second quarter results attributable to good growth and operating income, which was up 6%. And that was driven primarily by very strong margin performance plus 1% sales growth. That growth in operating income drove increases in earnings per share and continued strong cash flow, which again, exceeded net income. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.95, and that included a debt refinancing charge and related incremental interest expense of $0.09 per share. Excluding these debt retirement costs, EPS was up 7% over last year's second quarter. 
With respect to sales, second quarter consolidated sales grew $37 million or 1% to $3,966,000,000. At the segment level, growth in C3ISR and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance was largely offset by declines in Government Services and Electronic Systems. 
C3ISR segment sales grew 7%, led by growth on Project Liberty. We expect growth to exceed 10% in the second half with increases on ROVER, Phoenix, small aircraft ISR programs and classified airborne ISR work. Our second quarter Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment sales grew 9% versus 2Q of last year and that was mostly due to the Joint Cargo Aircraft, which increased by $73 million. 
Additionally, gains on the Fort Rucker fleet support contract, MHP [Maritime Helicopter Project] and gunship  modifications were offset by declines on SOFSA [Special Operations Forces Support Activity] and Contract Field  Teams. The SOFSA contract loss will be a drag on second half sales growth, as will the quarterly timing on JCA sales. 
In Government Services, sales declined by 4%, and that was driven by two items. Again, we had the negative comparison on the lower subcontract pass through sales on the Army SSES task orders, as well as the lower sales on Linguist contract. We expect growth to improve in the second half because of easier comparisons versus 2009 for SSES  and Linguist. And also, growth from a large competitively won classified IT contract that we started working on in April. 
In Electronic Systems, sales decreased 2%. What happened there was growth in EO/IR, Security & Detection Systems and Microwave Communications was offset by declines in Combat Propulsion Systems due primarily to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle funding cuts, simulation and training, undersea warfare due to work near completion on certain contracts and also the Marine & Power Systems driven by lower commercial ship building product sales. Sales in Security &  Detection Systems increased by $16 million primarily due to the international eXaminer sales that slipped out in the first quarter into the second quarter. 
Moving on to operating margin. Consolidated margin was very strong at 11.1%, up 50 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. Margins expanded significantly in Electronic Systems. We had improvement in contract performance and continued better, higher profit margins sales mix. Margin was weaker in Government Services on some timing items and continued competitive pricing pressure that we're seeing in that segment. Overall, we continue to make good progress on expanding our margins. Free cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $281 million, and that's on track with our full year estimate of $1,260,000,000 of free cash flow. 
Moving on to the 2010 financial guidance update. We lowered our earnings per share estimate by $0.08 on both the low end and high end, making the new guidance range $8.05 to $8.25. 
At the midpoint, three items primarily caused the decrease: First, we had the debt redemption charges of $0.09; secondly, the SOFSA contract loss will subtract $0.04, and those two were partially offset by the higher estimated operating margins for Electronic Systems and C3ISR, which will increase EPS by $0.05. And on the debt retirement charges, I'll add, that prospectively, that refinancing is going to reduce our annual interest cost by about $11 million or $0.06 per share, and we'll see that fully once we get to next year. 
With respect to sales, we lowered our consolidated sales guidance by $200 million, making the new range $16.0 billion to $16.1 billion. At the segment level, we reduced sales guidance by $200 million for Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. That's due to the $150 million of lower sales that we expect to generate in the SOFSA contract, with it going away sooner than we expected. 
And we also lowered Electronic Systems segment sales by $100 million due to a few items: First, the recent weakening of the euro currency will cause us to translate euro-denominated sales into about $35 million less of U.S. dollar sales. And we also had some reductions coming from order and procurement delays that we're experiencing in the Training & Simulation Devices and Combat Propulsion Systems business areas, and it's both with DoD and foreign customers. And then lastly, there was a surprise funding cut on the profit program in our Microwave Communications business area. 
With respect to the operating margins, we raised the guidance by 10 basis points to 10.9% due to the strength in Electronic Systems and C3ISR, and so we now expect margins to expand by 30 basis points on a consolidated basis this year versus last year. 
Looking at the third quarter, we currently expect sales to be slightly above $4 billion, with earnings per share of about $2 and free cash flow of about $200 million. The third quarter will also include debt refinancing charges of $0.02 related to the $400 million of subordinated notes that we redeemed on July 15. 
The book to bill in the third quarter is going to be below 1.0, and we expected to rebound in the fourth quarter. It's due mostly to timing and anticipated orders in the second half. Also, our third quarter will close on September 24, leaving four business days on the month of September, moving into our Q4, and we expect to book a lot of orders toward the end of the month of September. And for the full year, we still expect the book-to-bill ratio to be about 1.0. 
Mike gave you the highlights on the balance sheet. We have ample cash. We expect to end the year with about $1 billion. That's after repurchasing $0.5 billion of our common stock, paying our dividends and paying for the Insight  acquisition. We have $1 billion revolver. So overall, we have a very strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. 
And that concludes my comments. We'll go now to the Q&A. Thank you.

So it's not going to be something that will happen next week, but it's something that I hope to see some activity by the end of the year. In terms of number of aircraft and the like, most initial buys are probably going to be for modest numbers, three, five or whatever, depending on the application. And by that, the applications are anything from border, coastal control, internal security, monitoring critical assets, power plants, water supply. Your imagination can kind of fill in the blanks on that. But we've been very pleased to see that there's been a growing interest.

I've quoted in terms of the level of interest, the number of aircrafts anywhere from say, 15 to 25 aircraft. But again, Rob, that's not a closed-in opportunity. That opportunity is going to be spread out over numbers of years. And of course, the production schedule, as we know it now, is essentially consumed by our U.S. customer, the U.S. Air Force, and they are top priority to get these planes delivered in accordance with the contract. So the result of that would be that these international opportunities would certainly fill the outyear pipeline, if you will, which we're happy with, and we'll see where that goes. But there's been numerous letters of interests coming from all parts of the world, certainly, places like Canada or Australia, places in Africa, et cetera, where the application has been everything from search and rescue to that west tactical mile transport and even the possibility of putting ISR packages on the airplane, as well as the potential for a gunship version for the U.S. So it's not only the international, but it's the varying potential even in the U.S. that should provide some legs to this. As you know, when the initial quantities got reduced from mid-70s to the current 37, 38 airplanes, our partner, Finmeccanica's decision was to not proceed with the production facility in Florida, and that has constrained the production capability, the quantity that you can produce in Europe for the short term, anyway. I'm hoping that, that gets readdressed given the interest we have, and that can get increased at some point in time. But right now, this is going to be slow and steady for a while.

But let me cover that for you. First of all, it means that neither SSPD or Integrated Systems will be prevented from pursuing any business opportunities or accepting new contracts, and we anticipate that the actual suspension of SSPD is going to be lifted today. What it means in terms of what we need to do is L-3 has agreed to conduct some additional training and provide certain reporting information to the Air Force during the three-year term of the agreement. And there's a number of things that we will do in support of that. I guess, I'd like to also point out that within the agreement, I mean, this is kind of an unfortunate set of circumstances, but I'm happy to tell you that although there is an ongoing investigation and evidence in the record to date indicates that government emails were not intentionally journaled and no L-3 employee reviewed, opened or used any government e-mails, and therefore, we expect this to be closed in time as the agencies do their jobs. But in terms of any penalties or fines, there aren't any, except we did agree to pay restitution for the employees' time spent and fee associated with these email issues of approximately $273,000, as well as reimbursing the Air Force for its investigative cost of about $60,000. So as you know, we take matters like this very seriously. Our people, including my office staff and part of this immediately, we don't like to hear things happening within the company. We pride ourselves on running a very tight ethics program but only in that, by having a very, very tied up. It's culture within L-3. So any type of issue like this comes up with deep concern to me personally, and I get in front of it. And I would have to credit not only our folks for their cooperation and support with the government in their investigation and getting this done, but also, the support and the cooperation and attention paid by the Air Force Office of the Deputy General Counsel and really working with us, and I'm talking about evenings and weekends to get this resolved and get the settlement in place. And I think we did as good as we could have done in the circumstances.

I can't sign up to 8% to 10% yet. I think it'll stay close to double digits based on the level of activity we see today. But as you know, we'll give you some solid guidance when we do our third quarter call in October. Then we'll give you the guidance when we see one in the Investor Day in December. But the things that are more problematic though, they're slipping to the right and everything were pushed. The services side where things are getting -- two things are going on there, maybe more than two things. One is everything is more competitive as everybody's competing on everything to the extent they can. And number two, a lot of the larger programs, when they come up to recompete are being broken up into IDIQs with past quarters. So it creates a much more competitive environment for lower dollar opportunities. AM&M, we're going to have a headwind from JOG for the next year, as you know. But if you break that segment into two pieces, the service side, if you will, the base support versus the actual life extension of an air frame and modernization, the modernization side should start to continue to grow in the mid-single digits, but we're going to have a negative on the service side. And products is mixed now. We have headwinds on the Marine & Power Systems because of the substantial slowdown in the commercial shipbuilding area. Only things that are showing signs of life at the moment are cruise ships and the offshore oil work. Compounding that is the euro weakening, which our operations are done in euros, so that's a bit of headwind. The Combat Propulsion Systems business with the Bradleys is also a headwind in the segment. But going the other way, there's strong growth in EO/IR and a number of other areas and products. So products should probably stay again, mid- to lower-single digits. So I gave you a lot of color and long answer. Where we are now is we continue to see low- to mid-single-digit growth looking out into 2011 at this point. And we'll be mindful that we're going to be updating that as we get to the third quarter because things can change depending on slippages and the like.

As you might know, last week was Farnborough [Farnborough Air Show], and I was over there for the week. And I'd like to tell you the mood is yes, people are worried about programs being canceled and renegotiated. However, the feedback that I have hearing on that this is a solid requirement that is supported and is going forward. It's also viewed by the MOD as a very necessary capability that they don't have anymore because that Nimrod fleet is being phased out. And in terms of alternatives, being part of a fleet of 20 airplanes -- consider the U.S. fleet of 17 plus the three we're to deliver, it's a much better leveraging of technology than trying to build a fleet of three. So on top of that, the U.K., the Royal Air Force personnel, are going to begin some training exercises with the U.S. Air Force, being resident on the U.S. Rivet Joint airplanes now, so that they'll be able to hit the ground running when these planes get delivered. And finally, I'm very confident, expressed my confidence in our Integrated Systems business unit's ability to deliver these programs to the U.K. on time and on budget, which is, as you know, important at a time when they're facing such fiscal constraints. So all in all, we think they recognized the value in this contract, and it's a capability that they will lose if this doesn't go forward. So I am confident.

Given that, I could tell you that there's nothing, at this point, that I would view as significant. But that could change because there is, I think, what you're going to see here some rationalization among companies where one contractor may decide that their business, their asset is worth more to somebody else, and rather trade out of something and trade into something where it's more core. And that's something that we're just starting to look at to see if there's anything there that makes sense. Of course, we're also looking to add to places like ISR, EO/IR systems, training and simulation, et cetera, areas that we have a very strong position in, in areas where we can buy something and actually make it more valuable.

In terms of pushing more risks to contractors in undefinitized contracts, we've been very disciplined over our lives here 12, 13 years on our program performance, and, knock on wood, where program performance has been pretty good over that period of time. I can't recall any major leaders, if you will, in programs. So I don't think that we're going to see wholesale pushdown of fixed price development work to companies because one, I don't think that we have that. The industry has the risk tolerance to do that, and at the same time, we're not going to take on that kind of risk and not get paid for it. But I would tell you, sometimes, no matter what the fee is, the risks would not be worthwhile. I will tell you though, I think that there's more rationality, that's what's going on at the Pentagon, and with the way they're looking at things, then I expect a reasonable approach. So what I mean by that is that the art here is where to draw the line between when a contract transitions from a cost-plus development to a production. And there's some tension on where that line should be drawn, and that, we're going to have to be disciplined with. And so the answer is we're going to stay focused on more margins and on program performance as we always have, and I don't see anything now that's going to cause any changes there for us.

One, the commercial aviation or our Avionics segment is actually going to have a modest uptick this year. More importantly, we're carefully watching the decisions being made about the government funding of this next-gen equipment, the equipment that goes on the airplane, as well as the Ground segment because we are a major supplier of the airborne equipment. This is for ADS-B [Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast], and we are hopeful that there'll be an acceleration in that capability, and we are prepared to ramp up if and when that happens. And I'm hoping we'll see it happen over the next six months. That's something -- it's done there. It's been on the table in Congress and at the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], and it is a good chance if that does happen. The Marine & Power Systems Group, it's more of a longer cycle because of the international nature of the shipbuilding. So we have plenty of lead time to start to ramp up, but right now, the way it is, the new orders for bulk carriers, if you will, and everything is slow because there's a lot of excess capacity. If you've looked outside of Singapore, it's a parking lot of cargo ship sitting there, and until they get back to work and operators start to see demand that warrants new shipbuilding, that's going to be slow. So the business isn't at zero. The business is still a significant business, but the growth is out of it for the short term anyway.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll start by, of course, thanking our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to the program performance in satisfying our customers, and our Group Presidents for their continued leadership efforts. 
Overall, it was a solid third quarter. Earnings were up about 11% to $2.07 a share if you adjust for the debt refinance charge of about $0.03 that we had in this year's third quarter, and also adjust the $0.22 tax gain that was in the 2009 third quarter. Operating margins and cash flow continue to be strong. Sales were a little weaker than we expected. They were $3.8 billion. However, our C3ISR businesses continue to do very well with 8% growth, which had offset declines in A&M and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services segment grew at about 1%, but that reversed the trend of declining sales that we saw in the first half.
Orders grew at about 4% to $3.5 billion in the quarter versus 2009 third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92. Year-to-date, however, the book-to-bill is a 0.98, a little lower than the 1 that we would have liked to have seen, but still encouraging. Our funded backlog was $10.8 billion at the end of the quarter.
In terms of significant awards, there were several. First of all, the U.S. Army C-12 logistics support contract. Also with the Army, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle or ENVG contract. That's getting a slower start than was expected, however, because of a protest, which has now been resolved. Intelligence Support Services in Afghanistan, our Special Operating Forces Deployable Node-Lite or SDN-Lite contract. A recent win known as the Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System, or BAIS, for the U.S. Army and the Advanced Checkpoint Carry-on X-ray Screening Systems for TSA. On top of those wins, there was significant follow-on order activity as well, and it's a long list, but just to name a few, Project Liberty, our EO/IR turrets, Rover ManPacks, CF-18, Law Enforcement Professional Program, Rivet Joint work, more eXaminer work, Flight School XXI and C-12 Logistics Services, just to name a 
few.
In terms of the larger programs for JCA, total orders received to date are 21 aircraft. We're expecting another eight in fiscal '11. The total Air Force buys continue to be expected to be 38 aircraft, with the final mind coming in fiscal '12. We plan to deliver four in 2010, three are already delivered. That brings the total for the program will be six. The National Guard is still projecting the need for additional aircraft, and there is a potential for a plus up in fiscal '12 and beyond. And there are also still several foreign military sale opportunities, mostly those we see slipping to 2013 and 2014 due to government fiscal pressures and the fact that most of our production is dedicated to the U.S. delivery schedule as well.
For Project Liberty, we completed delivery of all 37 aircraft to the Air Force in August, and that was on budget and ahead of the contractual schedule. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's expertise to other small aircraft ISR applications, both within the U.S. DoD and with foreign customers. For example, we currently expect the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by five aircraft sometime later this year. That has slipped out from where we had expected it and probably part of the OCO request for fiscal '10. We also are currently competing as a prime, as I'm sure you know, for the U.S. Army's EMARSS program.
A few words about EMARSS, that is the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System. It's an aircraft that focus on the regular warfare mission, SIGINT, COMINT, EO/IR, and communications. It is the replacement for the canceled ACS program and a possible replacement for the aging Guardrail fleet, expected to be of $1.5 billion program of record. Configuration is a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12 platform. The initial buy is now anticipated to be 6 EMD aircraft, with a six aricraft LRIP option plus logistic services and is expected to further grow to at least 30 aircraft.
We expect the award decision before year end. Now that was expected at the end of September and then the end of October. So that's moved out, as I'm sure you've all read, that's a heavily-competed program of between major primes and ourselves. We think we have a good shot at it, but again, it's a heavily-competed program, and we look forward to hearing the results at the end of year.
U.K. Air Seeker, formerly known as Springtime, formerly known as HELIX and sometimes known as U.K. Rivet Joint, just all on the same page, that program has survived Britain's Strategic Defense and Security Review, and is expected to proceed. It's a significant program for L-3 worth over $800 million over seven years. It consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod ISR aircraft. The first aircraft delivery to the  MOD is anticipated in April 2014, and we expect to receive the first aircraft to induct it in our Greenville facility in January. We're already beginning preliminary work on long lead items and planning. But I think what's important to note here is, this is really a good example that shows, one, the importance of ISR; two, the confidence in L-3's reputation and our ability to deliver on time and on budget even during the significant budget cuts we saw in the U.K. So we are very happy that this is proceeding as scheduled. And we're currently negotiating with the MOD presently, and expect the conversion kit contract by early next year. The program will be incrementally funded over the seven-year period.
In the Whole Body Imaging airport checkpoint scanner program, there were only two qualified suppliers as you know. Back in April, we received the TSA order to deliver 202 systems. This was the first order placed on our five-year ID/IQ from the TSA, which was valued at up to $167 million. All 202 systems will be delivered by the end of this year. We delivered 135 of those systems during the third quarter and plan to ship the remaining 67 units in the fourth quarter. We expect the next TSA order in the first quarter of 2011. Future orders are dependent on the testing and acceptance of the auto-detect software, which is planned to be deployed in the first half of next year.
In terms of our capital deployment, we repurchased $215 million of stock in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $469 million. Our remaining authorization was about $957 million at the end of the quarter, and we now expect to repurchase about $800 million of our stock for 2010, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. We continue to believe our stock represents a good value. 
With respect to acquisitions, we acquired Airborne Technologies in August and 3DI Technologies in September for an aggregate price of $93 million. Both of those companies augment our existing capabilities. They were bought at attractive prices. They're already contributing to our operations.
We continue to evaluate several other companies. However, as you know, the valuation multiples for publicly-traded defense companies and those that are not are kind of out of balance, and we're being cautious in terms of valuations that are excessive compared to where the company trades in most cases.
Three acquisitions that were made to date that's worth noting, were all negotiated non-auction transactions, again, where we paid reasonable prices. In terms of our 2010 guidance, we provided an update today, maintaining our EPS range at $8.05 to $8.25 per share. At the midpoint, that represents about 7% growth from 2009. We lowered sales to $15.6 billion to $15.7 billion compared to our prior guidance, and that decrease is due to the continued procurement and funding delays we've experienced since the beginning of the year. However, margins are doing better and a little bit better in taxes, a little bit better on the share count, we've been able to maintain our earnings guidance.
I want to spend a couple minutes on the DoD budget and spending priorities before I get into the 2011 numbers. They've received a lot of press lately. Of course, overall, the budget's remain healthy and robust with modest base budget growth plus supplementals. However, be addressable DoD budget per industry, which include the investment account and the O&M account is essentially flat when you include the base of supplementals, and that is pressuring sales growth. If you look at the base budget, the O&M account is growing at about 8%. The 11 requests compared to fiscal '10 and the investment account or the hardware account is growing at about 2%, combined at about a 5% level. When you overlay, however, the decline in the supplemental, what it's doing is it's actually causing a 1% drop in the combined base plus supplemental addressable market. On balance, however, about 50% of our sales are coming out of the O&M account and on a base level. That does account for 8% growth and we will continue to do well with the way the company is positioned even in these flattening budget times. 
Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to determine the near-term resource decisions. We think that accounts, in some cases, to some of the slippage and reprioritization of funding, as well as lower new starts and the reprogramming. The tighter budget has been confronting the DoD and underscored repeatedly since May by Secretary Gates and Under Secretary Carter and Deputy Secretary Lynn. In May, it his Eisenhower Library Speech, Secretary Gates said that given America's difficult economic situations circumstances and fiscal conditions, military spending should expect closer, harsher scrutiny. And Secretary Gates wants to reduce DoD overhead costs and transfer those savings to pay for force structure and modernization in the DoD budget. What I'd like to underscore there is the requirement of force structure and modernization hasn't gone away, it's getting more and more difficult to fund, and it's certainly going to be stretched out over a longer period of time than we would of course like to see.
Following, we have Secretary Carter's acquisition memorandum that was issued last month, focusing on eliminating unproductive, low performing programs, redundant programs, low value overhead. And the objectives include delivering the needed war fighter capability within the budget, restoring affordability and doing more without more. The implication for industry of course is the need to be responsible partner and outperform negotiated costs and schedule. Notwithstanding that, the geopolitical scene confronting the U.S. and its allies remains complex and challenging and will likely continue to require a healthy DoD budget. Therefore, I think, on balance, industry should be okay. In general, I think L-3 will be better than okay as well.
To give you some sense for what we're seeing next year, I know you've seen our guidance in the release, but as you know, we will have an Investor Day that will be in December. We will provide a lot more granularity on guidance, but from a segment basis, we continue to see C3ISR leading the growth in the company. There continues to be strong demand for small aircraft via ISR and network communications, as well as the demand for international airborne ISR continues to grow.
With regard to AM&M, of course, we have a headwind in that segment with the loss of the SOFSA contract and a bit of price competition in the logistics work. However, the aging aircraft fleet that the U.S. has continues to present significant opportunities here at home. Internationally, there's been a bit of a slow down, of course, by physical fiscal constraints. Services, we're looking at an overall flat 2011 right now and a little bit of downside risk actually due to the competitive nature. However, I would stress in the Services segment that it has more opportunities for winning large programs than most other segments of our business areas right now. So acknowledging that reality, we are focusing some investment next year in cyber, indigent proposals and also the move of CECOM down to Aberdeen where we have a contract with a lot of content.
Electronic Systems, we expect to see modest growth in the diverse product portfolio we have. Of course, the reprogramming and cuts have affected several of our business areas. But what's growing would include EO/IR, Microwave, Aviation, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and detection; with Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion systems and Telemetry declining. 
As for the commercial markets, our commercial and international sales are about 16% to 17% of our consolidated sales and our commercial markets, currently, they have been declining both the avionics, as well as the equipment that we put on ships, both commercial and military. We're starting to see a rebound in avionics beginning in the latter part of this year and extending into 2011. 
On the Shipbuilding side, we expect to see a rebound in 2012. So that'll continue to be slow next year. The homeland security market continues to advance as we introduced new products. And in terms of foreign military, it's an uneven environment. There's a lot of growth in the Middle East and Asia, but much lower growth in Europe, U.K., Canada and Australia. 
When you look of course the company, let me to summarize what we're seeing. Again, the ISR segment to be growing next year. Services flat, AM&M will be down because of JOG [Joint Operations Group], but if you remove that effect, it is growing, and if you look at the Electronic Systems segment between the advancers and decliners, again, EO/IR, Microwave, Avionics, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and Detection collectively are growing at about 8%, but they're being offset by Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion and Telemetry and Advanced Technologies, which are declining by about 5%. And in terms of the reasons for the declines, I can hit them very quickly. But again, Marine & Power Systems is just the slowdown in the, primarily, the commercial shipbuilding area. And we see that recovering at the end of 2011. So we don't believe that's permanent or long term. Simulation and Training, it's really a function of reprogramming of funds in the U.S. and program slipping out of the year in the international marketplace. Propulsion systems is one program, it's funding for the Bradley that has been redeployed elsewhere since that is not a priority for Iraq and Afghanistan. It doesn't mean the requirements gone away, there are still a load of Bradley fighting vehicles that we are transmissions and reset work, so I believe that will recover in 2012, and the Telemetry Advanced Technology area again is one program there, a U.K. program that is going to experience of funding decline next year. So that's a broad summary of what we see for 2011.
In terms of the guidance, we were looking at the consolidated sales of between $15.7 billion and $15.9 billion, which is about 1% above what we saw in 2010. To remove the effects of JOG, the growth is about 3% to 4% that's going to be a big headwind next year. The earnings estimate for next year is in the range of about $8.40 to $8.60 before the pension charge or the increased pension expense, if you will, which will be up 4% at the midpoint compared to 2010. But we're expecting, if everything stays equal as we see it today that, that pension will run about $0.20 a share. So that's where we see 2011 from an early view. Again, there's an Investor Conference that we'll have as we always do in December. In fact, I'll give you the date. It should be on December 7, if you want to mark your calendars, starting at 8 a.m. at the Essex House here in New York. Sure you will receive an invitation.
To wrap up, we believe that L-3 will continue to thrive and grow in this new emerging greater efficiency environment with flattening budgets. I think that what will differentiate L-3 will be our culture and dedication to outstanding program performance, meeting budgets and exceeding delivery schedules plus our quick-reaction capabilities. Strong product areas in EO/IR, ISR, Intelligence Support will continue to lead growth, albeit probably at a slower pace. But again, we expect to see those areas all growing, and the broad product portfolio will continue to provide products to upgrade and enhance existing platforms. We continue to see that as a positive. In terms of our cash flow yield for 2010, it's going to approach about $11 a share representing a 15% yield compared to the market price of L-3 stock. The balance sheet and cash flow will continue to be strong, and we'll use them to and deploy the cash to continue to grow the company and increase shareholder value.
So with that, Ralph will give you some more color on the financials, and the we'll be happy to take your questions."
93538,113942739,82945,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure.As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales driven by strong margin per",1302,"Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure.
As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales driven by strong margin performance that drove operating income growth to 5%, as well as strong cash flow. Our diluted EPS was $2.07, and that included a $0.03 debt retirement charge. For our third quarter 2010 income tax rate was also lower than we planned, and that added about $0.05 or $0.06 to EPS in the quarter. With respect to sales, our third quarter sales were $3,835,000,000 or essentially flat versus the third quarter of last year. And at the segment level, growth in C3ISR was offset by declines in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services was up about 1%. In C3ISR, the growth was driven by ISR, Logistics Support and ISR Manpacks. Sales in Government Services increased 1%, driven by growth from a large competitively one classified IT contract that we began working on in April. And that offset lower subcontractor pass-throughs on the Army, SSES [systems and software engineering and sustainment] task orders.
In Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance, sales declined 5%. That was mostly due to the timing on that Joint Cargo Aircraft, which decreased $17 million, and we had some additional declines in contract field services and on the SOFSA contract. In the Electronics Systems segment, sales decreased 3%. What happened there was growth in EO/IR, Security & Detection systems and Microwave Communications was offset by declines in Marine & Power Systems driven by lower commercial shipbuilding sales, Combat Propulsion Systems due to less funding on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, as well as funding cuts and delays on Middle-Eastern engine programs and in Training and Simulation due to lower sales on AVCATT and the F/A-18 program where we saw reduced ECP-type funding, and also when Precision Engagement and in Marine services, due to a handful of contracts nearing completion. And finally, we also had some delays on some new starts, which affected sales in this segment. For example, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle protest delay and our recent win of the SOCOM SDN-Lite program, which happened later than we thought it was going to happen.
Moving on to operating margin. Consolidated margin was very strong at 11.4% in the third quarter, up 50 basis points over 3Q of last year, and that was driven by strength in the Electronic Systems segment. We had a continued favorable higher profit margin sales mix, which overcame lower sales in the segment. And we also had a $5 million pick up on the restructuring of a contract, which itself increased segment margins in ES by 15 basis points. Also within Government Services, we received an annual award fee in Q3 that we're anticipating in Q4 and that helped the margins in government services.
Our cash flow for the quarter was very strong. Our free cash flow was $367 million. Year-to-date, nine months, free cash flow was almost $900 million, up 5% versus the first nine months of last year. And we're on track with our full year estimated of $1,260,000,000 of free cash flow. 
With respect to the changes to our 2010 guidance, as Mike said, we maintained our EPS range, which is $8.05 to $8.25. And while the range remains the same, we had a few changes in the components of EPS, primarily comprised of three items: One, lower sales volumes are going to reduce EPS by about $0.24, and that's being offset by higher operating margin, again mostly in Electronic Systems, which is adding $0.15 and the lower tax rate, which is increasing EPS by about $0.14.
We lowered our 2010 sales guidance by $400 million to the new range of $15.6 billion to $15.7 billion. The lower sales are mostly due to continued procurement and funding delays on several programs, about which we also commented during the first and second quarter earnings conference calls. During the third quarter, those funding delays continued and in some cases, spreads in new programs and more business areas. We also experienced some funding cuts and some reprogramming actions. In any event, those funding delays are manifesting themselves in lower book-to-bill ratios, slower sales growth rates and lower sales levels. And we currently do not foresee a quick uptick in the order flow that would make up for the year-to-date delays that we've experienced. And we've updated these changes in our 2010 sales guidance.
At the segment level, with respect to sales. In C3ISR, we're now at the lower end of our range, and that's due to lower funding on Rivet Joint and the negative impacts of a few undefinitized contract actions. In Electronic Systems, we reduced the sales guidance by $200 million. That's due to the program delays and funding cuts that I talked about, and it's impacting the Training and simulation business area, Precision Engagement, Propulsion Systems, Undersea Warfare and Advanced Technologies. 
And finally, in the Government Services segment, we reduced our sales by $100 million in previous guidance. That's due to the loss of a training contract in Afghanistan and more-than-expected subcontract that are pass-through reductions on the SSES task orders. We've also seen some procurement delays on Afghanistan new business competitions, as well as some Intelligence work and reductions on certain Iraq and Afghanistan contracts.
Moving on to the consolidated operating margin guidance, we raised it by 20 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to Electronic Systems, and that's offsetting reduced expectations for C3ISR, Government Services and the Aircraft Mod and Maintenance segment. The lower tax rate, which is now 35% is due to true ups from filing last year's tax return, as well as lower taxes from foreign locations. Our tax guidance continues to assume that the federal R&E credit is retroactively enacted. Back to January 1, sometime in the fourth quarter, that is reducing our 2010 estimated tax rate by 110 basis points, and it adds $0.40 in EPS, which is in our guidance. So if the R&E credit is not extended, we'll be at the lower end of our EPS range.
A couple of comments on the fourth quarter. We expect sales to be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, with EPS of about $2.27 at the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance range. If you look at the margins, the year-to-date margins consolidated were 11.3%, and our updated guidance implies fourth quarter margin of approximately 10.7%. We expect margins to be lower in the fourth quarter because of a less favorable sales mix in Electronic Systems, and some lower prof rates on some new follow-on contracts in Government Services and on the Aircraft Logistics Support side.
We are intend to take somewhere between $10 million and $15 million of severance and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter to rightsize certain businesses for lower volumes in 2011. Those reductions in the fourth quarter margins are being offset by a technology license fee that's going to add $9 million.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We expect to end the year with about $650 million. That's after the increase and the share repurchases to $800 million and paying our dividend and the three acquisitions that we made. Regarding our debt, we have about $700 million of convertible notes that can be put to us on February 1 of next year. If that put occurs, we expect to refinance those convertible notes with new investment-grade senior notes. And we'll continue to be opportunistic in the debt capital markets. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and liquidity, and we'll continue to use our strong cash flow to increase shareholder value and grow the company. 
That includes my comments. Thank you. And we'll go to Q&A now."

And you're seeing that trend become a little bit of a net negative now because there's more things declining and advancing, and I think it's more sign of the times. I think that what we see now on a segment level is the ISR segment should well exceed one in the fourth quarter, probably closer to 1.15.

I'll tell you, it's a combination of three things: One, as we've been saying almost every quarter that the competition in Services was increasing and we are seeing margin pressure. So a piece of it are margins in Services. In addition, we are going to invest in the cyber center, which we've started to spend money on but that'll cost us a couple of points of margin. As well, we're going to deploy some more resources in the bids and proposal area, because this is a space that is really dominated by a lot of large-dollar contracts that I'd like to put more resources on because just a little more penetration in that area will help us a lot.

And what's happening in C3ISR, we have a changing sales mix where we're doing less equipment modification-type work and more logistics support work. I commented earlier about the undefinitized contract actions in the segment, and that's also putting some pressure on margins. And in Electronic Systems, it's also a changing mix situation within the EO/IR space. We talked about the Bradley fighting vehicle and in our training and simulation, this is an area we're doing more logistics works as opposed to equipment modification. So it's mostly a mix issue, and this year, we had a couple of pick ups, I talked about one in the third quarter, and one we had in the  first quarter.

There was a business unit there that is almost in a proxy structure, similar structure that you see where there's a foreign ownership and a special security agreement, which under current thinking qualifies as a valid mitigation tool for OCI. Given that we've moved contracts that have OCI potential into that vehicle. However, sales in that vehicle are between $100 million to $200 million. Not anywhere near the kind of the level of what you saw being sold earlier this year. As we look across the company and I guess we're alluding to services, again, our Services segment is I'd like to say, it's really two I guess your flavors, one of them is the direct support to the war fighter, that's primarily being delivered by experienced former military officers and physicist like MPRI. It's a unique business that provides a service that continues to earn good margins. And our Intelligence/Engineering Support business is mostly here in the states. Again, those are decent margins and is unique in terms of our workforce and clearances that we have. So our view is that they are non-commodity type businesses and given the pipeline that we see out there, notwithstanding OCI and not withstanding in-sourcing, we still see it as an area that can have continued growth. So from a capital deployment standpoint, we view the best value right now, candidly, is our own stock, which is where we've been directing most of our cash flow with the 15% yield, cash yield on our stock, we're returning almost 12% of that through our buyback and dividend. So I think right now, and of course, you're seeing that across the industry, that's kind of where I see it for now. It terms out.

If you look at where -- and I'd say that because the equity prices of defense companies. We're in pretty good shape in the first quarter and kind of deteriorated in the second and third, and I guess that's all the concern here about budget and margins and the like. Now having been in numerous meetings with Secretary Carter, Secretary Lynn and even Secretary Gates, the mantra has been we need a healthy defense industry. And they're really looking for efficiency versus margins. And I'm sure you've seen the September 14 memorandum of Secretary Carter, which kind of reiterates that. Now as well-intentioned supportive as we all are as an industry, to his objectives, and everybody is working hard to them, you can't help but be concerned that there will be a hit in margins in some way, shape or form. Companies are going to be able to respond differently to those requests. I think in our case, we are already a lean company. We are not sitting on a lot of excess or any excess capacity as far as I know actually. Maybe a little bit where we make Bradley transmissions right now because of the slowdown, but nothing that I would say is looming out there for us. And I would hope that this environment of increased competition could work in our favor. There'd be less tendency than for vertical integration, if they, DoD, will insist on more competitions for subsystems and a lot more milestone reviews, which is what they are saying. And I'll give you a negative. On the other hand, to the extent that the platform companies really get ratcheted down because the cost growth and cost concerns, they very well will turn around to their supplier community and put pressure as well. So that will be downside. The dependency there is, I mean, how much we're able to maintain our pricing. I think we do a pretty good job across the company in our -- but the more proprietary we are, the stronger our pricing is as you would expect. So when you put it all together what does it mean? It means it's not perfectly clear yet, but that's kind of our sense of some of the things that we're likely to be faced with going forward."

Expectations, now that we would have an RFP for that before the end of the year, and that there will be an award made sometime early next year, and that's going to be going from single award to multiple award ID/IQ, where you have more suppliers and they compete on each of the task orders. There's also a large Afghan training contract in-source selection right now, which was the old CNTPO that reincarnated itself is a new full and open competition. That's in-source selection, and there's supposed to be an award before year end.  So those are the bigger ones in Government Services. In the Aircraft Modification and Maintenance segment, we're going to be re-competing our P3 Sustainment Modification contract into next year. It's currently in-source selection, but they're making some amendments to it. And we expect that there'll be an award on that early to mid-2011.

Competitions are taking longer. Protests always slow things down, although I don't think that's a major driver here. I think this is a reprioritization that's going on continuously now, because -- Howard, you know the numbers as well as anyone. If you look at the supplemental, if you go just a couple of years, it went from a high of around $163 billion in '08 to the '11 request of $100 billion, that's $63 billion that's moved around, and we're still engaged albeit spending less in Iraq, spending more in Afghanistan. That money is getting pulled from somewhere. So our sense of it, and again, it's very hard to pin it down discretely, is that there is a broad reprioritization of funding going on and that is affecting numerous programs."

But an example is, there's a procurement that was floating around to the Iraqis to get a hold of some Russian helicopters for them to start to build out their own capabilities. And that's just starting. Once you start moving going that path, there's all kinds of requirements, basing, training, logistics, maintenance and support and the like.

I don't think that it's our belief that national security becomes an option. And given the condition of our equipment and the need for modernization and upgrades and reset, which is not factored anywhere in the budgets, I think, there's, I would like to believe, limited downside in where we can go as the budget. In terms of L-3, I think that we continue to be well-positioned, portfolio-wise, I think the clarity issue will take a little time in terms of budget priorities, in terms of programs and funding levels, as well as the future impact of Secretary Carter's initiatives, which again, industry is embracing, but it's going to be some pain in shaking out some of the redundancies and cost that they're alluding to.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll start by, of course, thanking our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to the program performance in satisfying our customers, and our Group Presidents for their continued leadership efforts. 
Overall, it was a solid third quarter. Earnings were up about 11% to $2.07 a share, if you adjust for the debt refinance charge of about $0.03 that we had in this year's third quarter, and also adjust the $0.22 tax gain that was in the 2009 third quarter. Operating margins and cash flow continue to be strong. Sales were a little weaker than we expected. They were $3.8 billion. However, our C3ISR businesses continue to do very well with 8% growth, which had offset declines in AM&M and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services segment grew at about 1%, but that reversed the trend of declining sales that we saw in the first half.
Orders grew at about 4% to $3.5 billion in the quarter versus 2009 third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92. Year-to-date, however, the book-to-bill is at 0.98, a little lower than the 1 that we would have liked to have seen, but still encouraging. Our funded backlog was $10.8 billion at the end of the quarter.
In terms of significant awards, there were several. First of all, the U.S. Army C-12 logistics support contract. Also with the Army, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle or ENVG contract. That's getting a slower start than was expected, however, because of a protest, which has now been resolved. Intelligence Support Services in Afghanistan, our Special Operating Forces Deployable Node-Lite or SDN-Lite contract. A recent win known as the Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System, or BAIS, for the U.S. Army and the Advanced Checkpoint Carry-on X-ray Screening Systems for TSA. On top of those wins, there was significant follow-on order activity as well, and it's a long list, but just to name a few, Project Liberty, our EO/IR turrets, Rover ManPacks, CF-18, Law Enforcement Professional Program, Rivet Joint work, more eXaminer work, Flight School XXI and C-12 logistics services, just to name a few.
In terms of the larger programs, for JCA total orders received to date are 21 aircraft. We're expecting another eight in fiscal '11. The total Air Force buys continue to be expected to be 38 aircraft, with the final nine coming in fiscal '12. We plan to deliver four in 2010. Three are already delivered. That brings the total for the program will be six. The National Guard is still projecting the need for additional aircraft, and there is a potential for a plus up in fiscal '12 and beyond. And there are also still several foreign military sale opportunities, mostly those we see slipping to 2013 and 2014 due to government fiscal pressures and the fact that most of our production is dedicated to the U.S. delivery schedule as well.
For Project Liberty, we completed delivery of all 37 aircraft to the Air Force in August, and that was on budget and ahead of the contractual schedule. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's expertise to other small aircraft ISR applications, both within the U.S. DoD and with foreign customers. For example, we currently expect the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by five aircraft sometime later this year. That has slipped out from where we had expected it and probably part of the OCO request for fiscal '10. We also are currently competing as a prime, as I'm sure you know, for the U.S. Army's EMARSS program.
A few words about EMARSS, that is the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System. It's an aircraft to focus irregular warfare missions, SIGINT, COMINT, EO/IR, and communications. It is the replacement for the canceled ACS program and a possible replacement for the aging Guardrail fleet, expected to be of $1.5 billion program of record. Configuration is a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12 platform. The initial buy is now anticipated to be six EMD aircraft, with a six aircraft LRIP option plus logistic services and is expected to further grow to at least 30 aircraft.
We expect the award decision before year end. Now that was expected at the end of September and then the end of October. So that's moved out, as I'm sure you've all read, that's a heavily-competed program between major primes and ourselves. We think we have a good shot at it, but again, it's a heavily-competed program, and we look forward to hearing the results at the end of year.
U.K. Air Seeker, formerly known as Springtime, formerly known as HELIX and sometimes known as U.K. Rivet Joint, just so we’re on the same page, that program has survived Britain's Strategic Defense and Security Review, and is expected to proceed. It's a significant program for L-3 worth over $800 million over seven years. It consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod ISR aircraft. The first aircraft delivery to the MOD is anticipated in April 2014, and we expect to receive the first aircraft to induct it in our Greenville facility in January. We're already beginning preliminary work on long lead items and planning. But I think what's important to note here is this is really a good example that shows, one, the importance of ISR; two, the confidence in L-3's reputation and our ability to deliver on time and on budget even during the significant budget cuts we saw in the U.K. So we are very happy that this is proceeding as scheduled. And we're currently negotiating with the MOD presently, and expect the conversion kit contract by early next year. The program will be incrementally funded over the seven-year period.
In the Whole Body Imaging airport checkpoint scanner program, there were only two qualified suppliers as you know. Back in April, we received the TSA order to deliver 202 systems. This was the first order placed on our five-year ID/IQ from the TSA, which was valued at up to $167 million. All 202 systems will be delivered by the end of this year. We delivered 135 of those systems during the third quarter and plan to ship the remaining 67 units in the fourth quarter. We expect the next TSA order in the first quarter of 2011. Future orders are dependent on the testing and acceptance of the auto-detect software, which is planned to be deployed in the first half of next year.
In terms of our capital deployment, we repurchased $215 million of stock in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $469 million. Our remaining authorization was about $957 million at the end of the quarter, and we now expect to repurchase about $800 million of our stock for 2010, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. We continue to believe our stock represents a good value. 
With respect to acquisitions, we acquired Airborne Technologies in August and 3Di Technologies in September for an aggregate price of $93 million. Both of those companies augment our existing capabilities. They were bought at attractive prices. They're already contributing to our operations.
We continue to evaluate several other companies. However, as you know, the valuation multiples for publicly-traded defense companies and those that are not are kind of out of balance, and we're being cautious in terms of valuations that are excessive compared to where the company trades in most cases.
Three acquisitions that were made to date that's worth noting, were all negotiated non-auction transactions, again, where we paid reasonable prices. In terms of our 2010 guidance, we provided an update today, maintaining our EPS range at $8.05 to $8.25 per share. At the midpoint, that represents about 7% growth from 2009. We lowered sales to $15.7 billion compared to our prior guidance, and that decrease is due to the continued procurement and funding delays we've experienced since the beginning of the year. However, margins are doing better and a little bit better in taxes, a little bit better on the share count. We've been able to maintain our earnings guidance.
I want to spend a couple minutes on the DoD budget and spending priorities before I get into the 2011 numbers. They've received a lot of press lately. Of course, overall, the budgets remain healthy and robust with modest base budget growth plus supplementals. However, the addressable DoD budget per industry, which include the investment account and the O&M account, is essentially flat when you include the base of supplementals, and that is pressuring sales growth. If you look at the base budget, the O&M account is growing at about 8%. The 11 requests compared to fiscal '10 and the investment account or the hardware account is growing at about 2%, combined at about a 5% level. When you overlay, however, the decline in the supplemental, what it's doing is it's actually causing a 1% drop in the combined base plus supplemental addressable market. On balance, however, about 50% of our sales are coming out of the O&M account and on a base level. That does account for an 8% growth and we will continue to do well with the way the company is positioned even in these flattening budget times. 
Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to determine the near-term resource decisions. We think that accounts, in some cases, to some of the slippage and reprioritization of funding, as well as lower new starts and the reprogramming. The tighter budget has been confronting the DoD and underscored repeatedly since May by Secretary Gates and Under Secretary Carter and Deputy Secretary Lynn. In May, in his Eisenhower Library speech, Secretary Gates said that given America's difficult economic situations circumstances and fiscal conditions, military spending should expect closer, harsher scrutiny. And Secretary Gates wants to reduce DoD overhead costs and transfer those savings to pay for force structure and modernization in the DoD budget. What I'd like to underscore there is the requirement of force structure and modernization hasn't gone away; it's getting more and more difficult to fund, and it's certainly going to be stretched out over a longer period of time than we would of course like to see.
Following, we have Secretary Carter's acquisition memorandum that was issued last month, focusing on eliminating unproductive, low performing programs, redundant programs, low value overhead. And the objectives include delivering the needed war fighter capability within the budget, restoring affordability and doing more without more. The implication for industry of course is the need to be a responsible partner and outperform negotiated costs and schedule. Notwithstanding that, the geopolitical scene confronting the U.S. and its allies remains complex and challenging and will likely continue to require a healthy DoD budget. Therefore, I think, on balance, industry should be okay. In general, I think L-3 will be better than okay as well.
To give you some sense for what we're seeing next year, I know you've seen our guidance in the release, but as you know, we will have an Investor Day that will be in December. We will provide a lot more granularity on guidance, but from a segment basis, we continue to see C3ISR leading the growth in the company. There continues to be strong demand for small aircraft ISR and network communications, as well as the demand for international airborne ISR continues to grow.
With regard to AM&M, of course, we have a headwind in that segment with the loss of the SOFSA contract and a bit of price competition in the logistics work. However, the aging aircraft fleet that the U.S. has continues to present significant opportunities here at home. Internationally, there's been a bit of a slowdown, of course, by fiscal constraints. Services, we're looking at an overall flat 2011 right now and a little bit of downside risk actually due to the competitive nature. However, I would stress in the Services segment that it has more opportunities for winning large programs than most other segments of our business areas right now. So acknowledging that reality, we are focusing some investment next year in cyber, indigent proposals and also the move of CECOM down to Aberdeen where we have a contract with a lot of content.
Electronic Systems, we expect to see modest growth in the diverse product portfolio we have. Of course, the reprogramming and cuts have affected several of our business areas. But what's growing would include EO/IR, Microwave, Aviation, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and detection; with Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion systems and Telemetry declining. 
As for the commercial markets, our commercial and international sales are about 16% to 17% of our consolidated sales and our commercial markets, currently, they have been declining both the avionics, as well as the equipment that we put on ships, both commercial and military. We're starting to see a rebound in avionics beginning in the latter part of this year and extending into 2011. 
On the shipbuilding side, we expect to see a rebound in 2012. So that'll continue to be slow next year. The homeland security market continues to advance as we introduce new products. And in terms of foreign military, it's an uneven environment. There's a lot of growth in the Middle East and Asia, but much lower growth in Europe, U.K., Canada and Australia. 
When you look of course the company, let me just summarize what we're seeing. Again, the ISR segment should be growing next year. Services flat, AM&M will be down because of JOG [Joint Operations Group], but if you remove that effect, it is growing, and if you look at the Electronic Systems segment between the advancers and the decliners, again, EO/IR, Microwave, Avionics, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and Detection collectively are growing at about 8%, but they're being offset by Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion and Telemetry and Advanced Technologies, which are declining by about 5%. And in terms of the reasons for the declines, I can hit them very quickly. But again, Marine & Power Systems is just the slowdown in the, primarily, the commercial shipbuilding area. And we see that recovering at the end of 2011. So we don't believe that's permanent or long term. Simulation and Training, it's really a function of reprogramming of funds in the U.S. and programs slipping out of the year in the international marketplace. Propulsion systems is one program, it's funding for the Bradley that has been redeployed elsewhere since that is not a priority for Iraq and Afghanistan. It doesn't mean the requirement’s gone away. There are still a load of Bradley Fighting Vehicles that need our transmissions and reset work, so I believe that will recover in 2012, and the telemetry advanced technology area again is one program there, a U.K. program that is going to experience a funding decline next year. So that's a broad summary of what we see for 2011.
In terms of the guidance, we were looking at the consolidated sales of between $15.7 billion and $15.9 billion, which is about 1% above what we saw in 2010. To remove the effects of JOG, the growth is about 3% to 4%, but that's going to be a big headwind next year. The earnings estimate for next year is in the range of about $8.40 to $8.60 before the pension charge or the increased pension expense, if you will, which will be up 4% at the midpoint compared to 2010. But we're expecting, if everything stays equal as we see it today, that that pension will run about $0.20 a share. So that's where we see 2011 from an early view. Again, there's an Investor Conference that we'll have as we always do in December. In fact, I'll give you the date. It should be on December 7, if you want to mark your calendars, starting at 8 a.m. at the Essex House here in New York. I’m sure you’ll all receive an invitation.
To wrap up, we believe that L-3 will continue to thrive and grow in this new, emerging, greater efficiency environment with flattening budgets. I think that what will differentiate L-3 will be our culture and dedication to outstanding program performance, meeting budgets and exceeding delivery schedules plus our quick-reaction capabilities. Strong product areas in EO/IR, ISR, Intelligence Support will continue to lead growth, albeit probably at a slower pace. But again, we expect to see those areas all growing, and the broad product portfolio will continue to provide products to upgrade and enhance existing platforms. We continue to see that as a positive. In terms of our cash flow yield for 2010, it's going to approach about $11 a share, representing a 15% yield compared to the market price of L-3 stock. The balance sheet and cash flow will continue to be strong, and we'll use them and deploy the cash to continue to grow the company and increase shareholder value.
So with that, Ralph will give you some more color on the financials, and then we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure.As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales, driven by strong margin pe",1303,"Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure.
As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales, driven by strong margin performance that drove operating income growth to 5%, as well as strong cash flow. Our diluted EPS was $2.07, and that included a $0.03 debt retirement charge. For our third quarter 2010 income tax rate was also lower than we planned, and that added about $0.05 or $0.06 to EPS in the quarter. With respect to sales, our third quarter sales were $3,835,000,000 or essentially flat versus the third quarter of last year. And at the segment level, growth in C3ISR was offset by declines in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services was up about 1%. In C3ISR, the growth was driven by ISR, Logistics Support and ISR ManPacks. Sales in Government Services increased 1%, driven by growth from a large competitively one classified IT contract that we began working on in April. And that offset lower subcontractor pass-throughs on the Army SSES [systems and software engineering and sustainment] task orders.
In Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance, sales declined 5%. That was mostly due to the timing on the Joint Cargo Aircraft, which decreased $17 million, and we had some additional declines in contract field services and on the SOFSA contract. In the Electronics Systems segment, sales decreased 3%. What happened there was growth in EO/IR, Security & Detection Systems and Microwave Communications was offset by declines in Marine & Power Systems driven by lower commercial shipbuilding sales, Combat Propulsion Systems due to less funding on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, as well as funding cuts and delays on Middle-Eastern engine programs and in Training and Simulation due to lower sales on AVCATT and the F/A-18 program where we saw reduced ECP-type funding, and also in Precision Engagement and in Marine Services, due to a handful of contracts nearing completion. And finally, we also had some delays on some new starts, which affected sales in this segment. For example, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle pro test delay and our recent win of the SOCOM SDN-Lite program, which happened later than we thought it was going to happen.
Moving on to operating margin. Consolidated margin was very strong at 11.4% in the third quarter, up 50 basis points over 3Q of last year, and that was driven by strength in the Electronic Systems segment. We had a continued favorable higher profit margin sales mix, which overcame lower sales in the segment. And we also had a $5 million pick up on the restructuring of a contract, which itself increased segment margins in ES by 15 basis points. Also within Government Services, we received an annual award fee in Q3 that we were anticipating in Q4 and that helped the margins in government services.
Our cash flow for the quarter was very strong. Our free cash flow was $367 million. Year-to-date, nine months free cash flow was almost $900 million, up 5% versus the first nine months of last year. And we're on track with our full year estimated of $1,260,000,000 of free cash flow. 
With respect to the changes to our 2010 guidance, as Mike said, we maintained our EPS range, which is $8.05 to $8.25. And while the range remains the same, we had a few changes in the components of EPS, primarily comprised of three items: One, lower sales volumes are going to reduce EPS by about $0.24, and that's being offset by higher operating margin, again mostly in Electronic Systems, which is adding $0.15 and the lower tax rate, which is increasing EPS by about $0.14.
We lowered our 2010 sales guidance by $400 million to the new range of $15.6 billion to $15.7 billion. The lower sales are mostly due to continued procurement and funding delays on several programs, about which we also commented during the first and second quarter earnings conference calls. During the third quarter, those funding delays continued and in some cases spread to new programs and more business areas. We also experienced some funding cuts and some reprogramming actions. In any event, those funding delays are manifesting themselves in lower book-to-bill ratios, slower sales growth rates and lower sales levels. And we currently do not foresee a quick uptick in the order flow that would make up for the year-to-date delays that we've experienced. And we've updated these changes in our 2010 sales guidance.
At the segment level, with respect to sales. In C3ISR, we're now at the lower end of our range, and that's due to lower funding on Rivet Joint and the negative impacts of a few undefinitized contract actions. In Electronic Systems, we reduced the sales guidance by $200 million. That's due to the program delays and funding cuts that I talked about, and it's impacting the Training and Simulation business area, Precision Engagement, Propulsion Systems, Undersea Warfare and Advanced Technologies. 
And finally, in the Government Services segment, we reduced our sales by $100 million than previous guidance. That's due to the loss of a training contract in Afghanistan and more-than-expected subcontract that are pass-through reductions on the SSES task orders. We've also seen some procurement delays on Afghanistan new business competitions, as well as some Intelligence work and reductions on certain Iraq and Afghanistan contracts.
Moving on to the consolidated operating margin guidance, we raised it by 20 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to Electronic Systems, and that's offsetting reduced expectations for C3ISR, Government Services and the Aircraft Mod and Maintenance segment. The lower tax rate, which is now 35% is due to true-ups from filing last year's tax return, as well as lower taxes from foreign locations. Our tax guidance continues to assume that the federal R&E credit is retroactively enacted. Back to January 1, sometime in the fourth quarter, that is reducing our 2010 estimated tax rate by 110 basis points, and it adds $0.40 in EPS, which is in our guidance. So if the R&E credit is not extended, we'll be at the lower end of our EPS range.
A couple of comments on the fourth quarter. We expect sales to be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, with EPS of about $2.27 at the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance range. If you look at the margins, the year-to-date margins consolidated were 11.3%, and our updated guidance implies fourth quarter margin of approximately 10.7%. We expect margins to be lower in the fourth quarter because of a less favorable sales mix in Electronic Systems, and some lower prof rates on some new follow-on contracts in Government Services and on the Aircraft Logistics Support side.
We also intend to take somewhere between $10 million and $15 million of severance and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter to rightsize certain businesses for lower volumes in 2011. Those reductions in the fourth quarter margins are being offset by a technology license fee that's going to add $9 million.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We expect to end the year with about $650 million. That's after the increase and the share repurchases to $800 million and paying our dividend and the three acquisitions that we made. Regarding our debt, we have about $700 million of convertible notes that can be put to us on February 1 of next year. If that put occurs, we expect to refinance those convertible notes with new investment-grade senior notes. And we'll continue to be opportunistic in the debt capital markets. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and liquidity, and we'll continue to use our strong cash flow to increase shareholder value and grow the company. 
That includes my comments. Thank you. And we'll go to Q&A now."

What's different is that normally, you've had puts and takes at the end of the day, but net-net, you'd be even or net positive. And you're seeing that trend become a little bit of a net negative now because there's more things declining and advancing, and I think it's more sign of the times. I think that what we see now on a segment level is the ISR segment should well exceed one in the fourth quarter, probably closer to 1.15. With services at about one, AM&M at about 0.88 and Electronic Systems at about the same place. So that would bring the year to the 0.98 that I had mentioned."

I'll tell you, it's a combination of three things: One, as we've been saying almost every quarter that the competition in Services was increasing and we are seeing margin pressure. So a piece of it are margins in Services. In addition, we are going to invest in the cyber center, which we've started to spend money on but that will cost us a couple of points of margin, as well. We're going to deploy some more resources in the bids and proposal area, because this is a space that is really dominated by a lot of large-dollar contracts that I'd like to put more resources on because just a little more penetration in that area will help us a lot.

I commented earlier about the undefinitized contract actions in the segment, and that's also putting some pressure on margins. And in Electronic Systems, it's also a changing mix situation within the EO/IR space. We talked about the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and in our training and simulation, this is an area we're doing more logistics works as opposed to equipment modification. So it's mostly a mix issue, and this year, we had a couple of pick-ups, I talked about one in the third quarter, and one we had in the first quarter.

I think, also, that there might be a bit of a difference in opinion between what one would think could be achieved in terms of the sell price today versus what I think would actually happen.

We expect to have some additional Liberty aircrafts that are currently in the second FY '10 supplemental, five additional aircraft, and we're also expecting to have significant deliveries of our Rover ManPack Systems in the fourth quarter, as well as data links on a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles.

But really, it's part of the Titan acquisition effect. It was five years ago now. There was a business unit there that is almost in a proxy structure, similar structure that you see where there's a foreign ownership and a special security agreement, which under current thinking qualifies as a valid mitigation tool for OCI. Given that we've moved contracts that have OCI potential into that vehicle. However, sales in that vehicle are between $100 million to $200 million, not anywhere near the kind of the level of what you saw being sold earlier this year. As we look across the company and I guess we're alluding to Services, again, our Services segment is I'd like to say, it's really two -- I guess your flavors, one of them is the direct support to the war fighter, that's primarily being delivered by experienced former military officers and businesses like MPRI. It's a unique business that provides a service that continues to earn good margins. And our Intelligence/Engineering Support business is mostly here in the States. Again, those are decent margins and is unique in terms of our workforce and clearances that we have. So our view is that they are non-commodity type businesses and given the pipeline that we see out there, notwithstanding OCI and not withstanding in-sourcing, we still see it as an area that can have continued growth. So from a capital deployment standpoint, we view the best value right now, candidly, is our own stock, which is where we've been directing most of our cash flow. With a 15% yield, cash yield on our stock, we're returning almost 12% of that through our buyback and our dividend. So I think right now -- and of course, you're seeing that across the industry, that's kind of where I see it for now. It terms out. If we got an offer, we decided to sell something at a very compelling multiple, would we evaluate it? Yes, it didn't hurt the long-term growth aspects of L-3 and was the best thing for shareholders, of course we'd evaluate it."

If you look at where -- and I'd say that because the equity prices of defense companies. We're in pretty good shape in the first quarter and kind of deteriorated in the second and third, and I guess that's all the concern here about budget and margins and the like. Now having been in numerous meetings with Secretary Carter, Secretary Lynn and even Secretary Gates, the mantra has been: We need a healthy defense industry. And they're really looking for efficiency versus margins. And I'm sure you've seen the September 14 memorandum of Secretary Carter, which kind of reiterates that. Now as well-intentioned, supportive as we all are as an industry to his objectives, and everybody is working hard to them, you can't help but be concerned that there will be a hit to margins in some way, shape or form. Companies are going to be able to respond differently to those requests.
I think in our case, we are already a lean company. We are not sitting on a lot of excess or any excess capacity as far as I know actually. Maybe a little bit where we make Bradley transmissions right now because of the slowdown, but nothing that I would say is looming out there for us. And I would hope that this environment of increased competition could work in our favor. There'd be less tendency than for vertical integration, if they, DoD, will insist on more competitions for subsystems and a lot more milestone reviews, which is what they are saying. And I'll give you a negative. On the other hand, to the extent that the platform companies really get ratcheted down because of cost growth and cost concerns, they very well will turn around to their supplier community and put pressure as well. So that will be a downside. The dependency there is, I mean, how much we're able to maintain our pricing. I think we do a pretty good job across the company in our -- but the more proprietary we are, the stronger our pricing is as you would expect. So when you put it all together what does it mean? It means it's not perfectly clear yet, but that's kind of our sense of some of the things that we're likely to be faced with going forward."

That's slipped from the earlier part of this year. Expectations are now that we would have an RFP for that before the end of the year, and that there will be an award made sometime early next year, and that's going to be going from single award to multiple award ID/IQ, where you have more suppliers and they compete on each of the task orders. There's also a large Afghan training contract in-source selection right now, which was the old CNTPO [ph] that reincarnated itself is a new full and open competition. That's in-source selection, and there's supposed to be an award before year end. So those are the bigger ones in Government Services. In the Aircraft Modification and Maintenance segment, we're going to be re-competing our P3 Sustainment Modification contract into next year. It's currently in-source selection, but they're making some amendments to it. And we expect that there'll be an award on that early to mid-2011. So that's the largest one there, and there really isn't any single large re-competition going on in Electronic Systems due to the diversity of that segment in terms of the number of businesses, the supplier versus prime situation, et cetera."

Competitions are taking longer. Protests always slow things down, although I don't think that's a major driver here. I think there’s a reprioritization that's going on continuously now, because -- Howard, you know the numbers as well as anyone. If you look at the supplemental, if you go just a couple of years, it went from a high of around $163 billion in '08 to the '11 request of $100 billion. That's $63 billion that's moved around, and we're still engaged albeit spending less in Iraq, but spending more in Afghanistan. That money is getting pulled from somewhere. So our sense of it, and again, it's very hard to pin it down very discretely, is that there is a broad reprioritization of funding going on and that is affecting numerous programs."

I mean this is only starting now and it'll be hard for me to quantify to anyone what it's worth. But an example is, there's a procurement that was floating around to the Iraqis to get a hold of some Russian helicopters for them to start to build out their own capabilities. And that's just starting. Once you start moving down that path, there's all kinds of requirements: basing, training, logistics, maintenance and support and the like. So we still think that that's an area where they'll be offset to the decline on the U.S. side, but it's been slow to take off."

It's not going to change in the short term. And number two, the geopolitical situation, which is complex, it's a longer list than before. And that's not changing either. And therein lies the tension. I don't think that it's our belief that national security becomes an option. And given the condition of our equipment and the need for modernization and upgrades and reset, which is not factored anywhere in the budgets, I think, there's, I would like to believe, limited downside in where we can go as the budget. In terms of L-3, I think that we continue to be well-positioned, portfolio-wise. I think the clarity issue will take a little time in terms of budget priorities, in terms of programs and funding levels, as well as the future impact of Secretary Carter's initiatives, which again, industry is embracing, but it's going to be some pain in shaking out some of the redundancies and cost that they're alluding to. But on balance, again, I think that we're well-positioned, not only in our business areas, but also in our performance history, in our ability to continue to deliver on time, on budget, listening to our customers and outperforming their expectations.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll start by, of course, thanking our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to the program performance in satisfying our customers, and our Group Presidents for their continued leadership efforts. 
Overall, it was a solid third quarter. Earnings were up about 11% to $2.07 a share, if you adjust for the debt refinance charge of about $0.03 that we had in this year's third quarter, and also adjust the $0.22 tax gain that was in the 2009 third quarter. Operating margins and cash flow continue to be strong. Sales were a little weaker than we expected. They were $3.8 billion. However, our C3ISR businesses continue to do very well with 8% growth, which had offset declines in AM&M and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services segment grew at about 1%, but that reversed the trend of declining sales that we saw in the first half.
Orders grew at about 4% to $3.5 billion in the quarter versus 2009 third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92. Year-to-date, however, the book-to-bill is at 0.98, a little lower than the 1 that we would have liked to have seen, but still encouraging. Our funded backlog was $10.8 billion at the end of the quarter.
In terms of significant awards, there were several. First of all, the U.S. Army C-12 logistics support contract. Also with the Army, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle or ENVG contract. That's getting a slower start than was expected, however, because of a protest, which has now been resolved. Intelligence Support Services in Afghanistan, our Special Operating Forces Deployable Node-Lite or SDN-Lite contract. A recent win known as the Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System, or BAIS, for the U.S. Army and the Advanced Checkpoint Carry-on X-ray Screening Systems for TSA. On top of those wins, there was significant follow-on order activity as well, and it's a long list, but just to name a few, Project Liberty, our EO/IR turrets, Rover ManPacks, CF-18, Law Enforcement Professional Program, Rivet Joint work, more eXaminer work, Flight School XXI and C-12 logistics services, just to name a few.
In terms of the larger programs, for JCA total orders received to date are 21 aircraft. We're expecting another eight in fiscal '11. The total Air Force buys continue to be expected to be 38 aircraft, with the final nine coming in fiscal '12. We plan to deliver four in 2010. Three are already delivered. That brings the total for the program will be six. The National Guard is still projecting the need for additional aircraft, and there is a potential for a plus up in fiscal '12 and beyond. And there are also still several foreign military sale opportunities, mostly those we see slipping to 2013 and 2014 due to government fiscal pressures and the fact that most of our production is dedicated to the U.S. delivery schedule as well.
For Project Liberty, we completed delivery of all 37 aircraft to the Air Force in August, and that was on budget and ahead of the contractual schedule. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's expertise to other small aircraft ISR applications, both within the U.S. DoD and with foreign customers. For example, we currently expect the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by five aircraft sometime later this year. That has slipped out from where we had expected it and probably part of the OCO request for fiscal '10. We also are currently competing as a prime, as I'm sure you know, for the U.S. Army's EMARSS program.
A few words about EMARSS, that is the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System. It's an aircraft to focus irregular warfare missions, SIGINT, COMINT, EO/IR, and communications. It is the replacement for the canceled ACS program and a possible replacement for the aging Guardrail fleet, expected to be of $1.5 billion program of record. Configuration is a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12 platform. The initial buy is now anticipated to be six EMD aircraft, with a six aircraft LRIP option plus logistic services and is expected to further grow to at least 30 aircraft.
We expect the award decision before year end. Now that was expected at the end of September and then the end of October. So that's moved out, as I'm sure you've all read, that's a heavily-competed program between major primes and ourselves. We think we have a good shot at it, but again, it's a heavily-competed program, and we look forward to hearing the results at the end of year.
U.K. Air Seeker, formerly known as Springtime, formerly known as HELIX and sometimes known as U.K. Rivet Joint, just so we’re on the same page, that program has survived Britain's Strategic Defense and Security Review, and is expected to proceed. It's a significant program for L-3 worth over $800 million over seven years. It consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod ISR aircraft. The first aircraft delivery to the MOD is anticipated in April 2014, and we expect to receive the first aircraft to induct it in our Greenville facility in January. We're already beginning preliminary work on long lead items and planning. But I think what's important to note here is this is really a good example that shows, one, the importance of ISR; two, the confidence in L-3's reputation and our ability to deliver on time and on budget even during the significant budget cuts we saw in the U.K. So we are very happy that this is proceeding as scheduled. And we're currently negotiating with the MOD presently, and expect the conversion kit contract by early next year. The program will be incrementally funded over the seven-year period.
In the Whole Body Imaging airport checkpoint scanner program, there were only two qualified suppliers as you know. Back in April, we received the TSA order to deliver 202 systems. This was the first order placed on our five-year ID/IQ from the TSA, which was valued at up to $167 million. All 202 systems will be delivered by the end of this year. We delivered 135 of those systems during the third quarter and plan to ship the remaining 67 units in the fourth quarter. We expect the next TSA order in the first quarter of 2011. Future orders are dependent on the testing and acceptance of the auto-detect software, which is planned to be deployed in the first half of next year.
In terms of our capital deployment, we repurchased $215 million of stock in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $469 million. Our remaining authorization was about $957 million at the end of the quarter, and we now expect to repurchase about $800 million of our stock for 2010, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. We continue to believe our stock represents a good value. 
With respect to acquisitions, we acquired Airborne Technologies in August and 3Di Technologies in September for an aggregate price of $93 million. Both of those companies augment our existing capabilities. They were bought at attractive prices. They're already contributing to our operations.
We continue to evaluate several other companies. However, as you know, the valuation multiples for publicly-traded defense companies and those that are not are kind of out of balance, and we're being cautious in terms of valuations that are excessive compared to where the company trades in most cases.
Three acquisitions that were made to date that's worth noting, were all negotiated non-auction transactions, again, where we paid reasonable prices. In terms of our 2010 guidance, we provided an update today, maintaining our EPS range at $8.05 to $8.25 per share. At the midpoint, that represents about 7% growth from 2009. We lowered sales to $15.7 billion compared to our prior guidance, and that decrease is due to the continued procurement and funding delays we've experienced since the beginning of the year. However, margins are doing better and a little bit better in taxes, a little bit better on the share count. We've been able to maintain our earnings guidance.
I want to spend a couple minutes on the DoD budget and spending priorities before I get into the 2011 numbers. They've received a lot of press lately. Of course, overall, the budgets remain healthy and robust with modest base budget growth plus supplementals. However, the addressable DoD budget per industry, which include the investment account and the O&M account, is essentially flat when you include the base of supplementals, and that is pressuring sales growth. If you look at the base budget, the O&M account is growing at about 8%. The 11 requests compared to fiscal '10 and the investment account or the hardware account is growing at about 2%, combined at about a 5% level. When you overlay, however, the decline in the supplemental, what it's doing is it's actually causing a 1% drop in the combined base plus supplemental addressable market. On balance, however, about 50% of our sales are coming out of the O&M account and on a base level. That does account for an 8% growth and we will continue to do well with the way the company is positioned even in these flattening budget times. 
Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to determine the near-term resource decisions. We think that accounts, in some cases, to some of the slippage and reprioritization of funding, as well as lower new starts and the reprogramming. The tighter budget has been confronting the DoD and underscored repeatedly since May by Secretary Gates and Under Secretary Carter and Deputy Secretary Lynn. In May, in his Eisenhower Library speech, Secretary Gates said that given America's difficult economic situations circumstances and fiscal conditions, military spending should expect closer, harsher scrutiny. And Secretary Gates wants to reduce DoD overhead costs and transfer those savings to pay for force structure and modernization in the DoD budget. What I'd like to underscore there is the requirement of force structure and modernization hasn't gone away; it's getting more and more difficult to fund, and it's certainly going to be stretched out over a longer period of time than we would of course like to see.
Following, we have Secretary Carter's acquisition memorandum that was issued last month, focusing on eliminating unproductive, low performing programs, redundant programs, low value overhead. And the objectives include delivering the needed war fighter capability within the budget, restoring affordability and doing more without more. The implication for industry of course is the need to be a responsible partner and outperform negotiated costs and schedule. Notwithstanding that, the geopolitical scene confronting the U.S. and its allies remains complex and challenging and will likely continue to require a healthy DoD budget. Therefore, I think, on balance, industry should be okay. In general, I think L-3 will be better than okay as well.
To give you some sense for what we're seeing next year, I know you've seen our guidance in the release, but as you know, we will have an Investor Day that will be in December. We will provide a lot more granularity on guidance, but from a segment basis, we continue to see C3ISR leading the growth in the company. There continues to be strong demand for small aircraft ISR and network communications, as well as the demand for international airborne ISR continues to grow.
With regard to AM&M, of course, we have a headwind in that segment with the loss of the SOFSA contract and a bit of price competition in the logistics work. However, the aging aircraft fleet that the U.S. has continues to present significant opportunities here at home. Internationally, there's been a bit of a slowdown, of course, by fiscal constraints. Services, we're looking at an overall flat 2011 right now and a little bit of downside risk actually due to the competitive nature. However, I would stress in the Services segment that it has more opportunities for winning large programs than most other segments of our business areas right now. So acknowledging that reality, we are focusing some investment next year in cyber, indigent proposals and also the move of CECOM down to Aberdeen where we have a contract with a lot of content.
Electronic Systems, we expect to see modest growth in the diverse product portfolio we have. Of course, the reprogramming and cuts have affected several of our business areas. But what's growing would include EO/IR, Microwave, Aviation, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and detection; with Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion systems and Telemetry declining. 
As for the commercial markets, our commercial and international sales are about 16% to 17% of our consolidated sales and our commercial markets, currently, they have been declining both the avionics, as well as the equipment that we put on ships, both commercial and military. We're starting to see a rebound in avionics beginning in the latter part of this year and extending into 2011. 
On the shipbuilding side, we expect to see a rebound in 2012. So that'll continue to be slow next year. The homeland security market continues to advance as we introduce new products. And in terms of foreign military, it's an uneven environment. There's a lot of growth in the Middle East and Asia, but much lower growth in Europe, U.K., Canada and Australia. 
When you look of course the company, let me just summarize what we're seeing. Again, the ISR segment should be growing next year. Services flat, AM&M will be down because of JOG [Joint Operations Group], but if you remove that effect, it is growing, and if you look at the Electronic Systems segment between the advancers and the decliners, again, EO/IR, Microwave, Avionics, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and Detection collectively are growing at about 8%, but they're being offset by Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion and Telemetry and Advanced Technologies, which are declining by about 5%. And in terms of the reasons for the declines, I can hit them very quickly. But again, Marine & Power Systems is just the slowdown in the, primarily, the commercial shipbuilding area. And we see that recovering at the end of 2011. So we don't believe that's permanent or long term. Simulation and Training, it's really a function of reprogramming of funds in the U.S. and programs slipping out of the year in the international marketplace. Propulsion systems is one program, it's funding for the Bradley that has been redeployed elsewhere since that is not a priority for Iraq and Afghanistan. It doesn't mean the requirement’s gone away. There are still a load of Bradley Fighting Vehicles that need our transmissions and reset work, so I believe that will recover in 2012, and the telemetry advanced technology area again is one program there, a U.K. program that is going to experience a funding decline next year. So that's a broad summary of what we see for 2011.
In terms of the guidance, we were looking at the consolidated sales of between $15.7 billion and $15.9 billion, which is about 1% above what we saw in 2010. To remove the effects of JOG, the growth is about 3% to 4%, but that's going to be a big headwind next year. The earnings estimate for next year is in the range of about $8.40 to $8.60 before the pension charge or the increased pension expense, if you will, which will be up 4% at the midpoint compared to 2010. But we're expecting, if everything stays equal as we see it today, that that pension will run about $0.20 a share. So that's where we see 2011 from an early view. Again, there's an Investor Conference that we'll have as we always do in December. In fact, I'll give you the date. It should be on December 7, if you want to mark your calendars, starting at 8 a.m. at the Essex House here in New York. I’m sure you’ll all receive an invitation.
To wrap up, we believe that L-3 will continue to thrive and grow in this new, emerging, greater efficiency environment with flattening budgets. I think that what will differentiate L-3 will be our culture and dedication to outstanding program performance, meeting budgets and exceeding delivery schedules plus our quick-reaction capabilities. Strong product areas in EO/IR, ISR, Intelligence Support will continue to lead growth, albeit probably at a slower pace. But again, we expect to see those areas all growing, and the broad product portfolio will continue to provide products to upgrade and enhance existing platforms. We continue to see that as a positive. In terms of our cash flow yield for 2010, it's going to approach about $11 a share, representing a 15% yield compared to the market price of L-3 stock. The balance sheet and cash flow will continue to be strong, and we'll use them and deploy the cash to continue to grow the company and increase shareholder value.
So with that, Ralph will give you some more color on the financials, and then we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure.
As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales, driven by strong margin performance that drove operating income growth to 5%, as well as strong cash flow. Our diluted EPS was $2.07, and that included a $0.03 debt retirement charge. For our third quarter 2010 income tax rate was also lower than we planned, and that added about $0.05 or $0.06 to EPS in the quarter. With respect to sales, our third quarter sales were $3,835,000,000 or essentially flat versus the third quarter of last year. And at the segment level, growth in C3ISR was offset by declines in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services was up about 1%. In C3ISR, the growth was driven by ISR, Logistics Support and ISR ManPacks. Sales in Government Services increased 1%, driven by growth from a large competitively one classified IT contract that we began working on in April. And that offset lower subcontractor pass-throughs on the Army SSES [systems and software engineering and sustainment] task orders.
In Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance, sales declined 5%. That was mostly due to the timing on the Joint Cargo Aircraft, which decreased $17 million, and we had some additional declines in contract field services and on the SOFSA contract. In the Electronics Systems segment, sales decreased 3%. What happened there was growth in EO/IR, Security & Detection Systems and Microwave Communications was offset by declines in Marine & Power Systems driven by lower commercial shipbuilding sales, Combat Propulsion Systems due to less funding on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, as well as funding cuts and delays on Middle-Eastern engine programs and in Training and Simulation due to lower sales on AVCATT and the F/A-18 program where we saw reduced ECP-type funding, and also in Precision Engagement and in Marine Services, due to a handful of contracts nearing completion. And finally, we also had some delays on some new starts, which affected sales in this segment. For example, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle protest delay and our recent win of the SOCOM SDN-Lite program, which happened later than we thought it was going to happen.
Moving on to operating margin. Consolidated margin was very strong at 11.4% in the third quarter, up 50 basis points over 3Q of last year, and that was driven by strength in the Electronic Systems segment. We had a continued favorable higher profit margin sales mix, which overcame lower sales in the segment. And we also had a $5 million pick up on the restructuring of a contract, which itself increased segment margins in ES by 15 basis points. Also within Government Services, we received an annual award fee in Q3 that we were anticipating in Q4 and that helped the margins in government services.
Our cash flow for the quarter was very strong. Our free cash flow was $367 million. Year-to-date, nine months free cash flow was almost $900 million, up 5% versus the first nine months of last year. And we're on track with our full year estimated of $1,260,000,000 of free cash flow. 
With respect to the changes to our 2010 guidance, as Mike said, we maintained our EPS range, which is $8.05 to $8.25. And while the range remains the same, we had a few changes in the components of EPS, primarily comprised of three items: One, lower sales volumes are going to reduce EPS by about $0.24, and that's being offset by higher operating margin, again mostly in Electronic Systems, which is adding $0.15 and the lower tax rate, which is increasing EPS by about $0.14.
We lowered our 2010 sales guidance by $400 million to the new range of $15.6 billion to $15.7 billion. The lower sales are mostly due to continued procurement and funding delays on several programs, about which we also commented during the first and second quarter earnings conference calls. During the third quarter, those funding delays continued and in some cases spread to new programs and more business areas. We also experienced some funding cuts and some reprogramming actions. In any event, those funding delays are manifesting themselves in lower book-to-bill ratios, slower sales growth rates and lower sales levels. And we currently do not foresee a quick uptick in the order flow that would make up for the year-to-date delays that we've experienced. And we've updated these changes in our 2010 sales guidance.
At the segment level, with respect to sales. In C3ISR, we're now at the lower end of our range, and that's due to lower funding on Rivet Joint and the negative impacts of a few undefinitized contract actions. In Electronic Systems, we reduced the sales guidance by $200 million. That's due to the program delays and funding cuts that I talked about, and it's impacting the Training and Simulation business area, Precision Engagement, Propulsion Systems, Undersea Warfare and Advanced Technologies. 
And finally, in the Government Services segment, we reduced our sales by $100 million than previous guidance. That's due to the loss of a training contract in Afghanistan and more-than-expected subcontract that are pass-through reductions on the SSES task orders. We've also seen some procurement delays on Afghanistan new business competitions, as well as some Intelligence work and reductions on certain Iraq and Afghanistan contracts.
Moving on to the consolidated operating margin guidance, we raised it by 20 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to Electronic Systems, and that's offsetting reduced expectations for C3ISR, Government Services and the Aircraft Mod and Maintenance segment. The lower tax rate, which is now 35% is due to true-ups from filing last year's tax return, as well as lower taxes from foreign locations. Our tax guidance continues to assume that the federal R&E credit is retroactively enacted. Back to January 1, sometime in the fourth quarter, that is reducing our 2010 estimated tax rate by 110 basis points, and it adds $0.40 in EPS, which is in our guidance. So if the R&E credit is not extended, we'll be at the lower end of our EPS range.
A couple of comments on the fourth quarter. We expect sales to be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, with EPS of about $2.27 at the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance range. If you look at the margins, the year-to-date margins consolidated were 11.3%, and our updated guidance implies fourth quarter margin of approximately 10.7%. We expect margins to be lower in the fourth quarter because of a less favorable sales mix in Electronic Systems, and some lower prof rates on some new follow-on contracts in Government Services and on the Aircraft Logistics Support side.
We also intend to take somewhere between $10 million and $15 million of severance and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter to rightsize certain businesses for lower volumes in 2011. Those reductions in the fourth quarter margins are being offset by a technology license fee that's going to add $9 million.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We expect to end the year with about $650 million. That's after the increase and the share repurchases to $800 million and paying our dividend and the three acquisitions that we made. Regarding our debt, we have about $700 million of convertible notes that can be put to us on February 1 of next year. If that put occurs, we expect to refinance those convertible notes with new investment-grade senior notes. And we'll continue to be opportunistic in the debt capital markets. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and liquidity, and we'll continue to use our strong cash flow to increase shareholder value and grow the company. 
That includes my comments. Thank you. And we'll go to Q&A now."

What's different is that normally, you've had puts and takes at the end of the day, but net-net, you'd be even or net positive. And you're seeing that trend become a little bit of a net negative now because there's more things declining and advancing, and I think it's more sign of the times. I think that what we see now on a segment level is the ISR segment should well exceed one in the fourth quarter, probably closer to 1.15. With services at about one, AM&M at about 0.88 and Electronic Systems at about the same place. So that would bring the year to the 0.98 that I had mentioned."

I'll tell you, it's a combination of three things: One, as we've been saying almost every quarter that the competition in Services was increasing and we are seeing margin pressure. So a piece of it are margins in Services. In addition, we are going to invest in the cyber center, which we've started to spend money on but that will cost us a couple of points of margin, as well. We're going to deploy some more resources in the bids and proposal area, because this is a space that is really dominated by a lot of large-dollar contracts that I'd like to put more resources on because just a little more penetration in that area will help us a lot.

I commented earlier about the undefinitized contract actions in the segment, and that's also putting some pressure on margins. And in Electronic Systems, it's also a changing mix situation within the EO/IR space. We talked about the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and in our training and simulation, this is an area we're doing more logistics works as opposed to equipment modification. So it's mostly a mix issue, and this year, we had a couple of pick-ups, I talked about one in the third quarter, and one we had in the first quarter.

We expect to have some additional Liberty aircrafts that are currently in the second FY '10 supplemental, five additional aircraft, and we're also expecting to have significant deliveries of our Rover ManPack Systems in the fourth quarter, as well as data links on a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles. So that's what's causing the uptick in sales that we anticipate in that segment, George."

But really, it's part of the Titan acquisition effect. It was five years ago now. There was a business unit there that is almost in a proxy structure, similar structure that you see where there's a foreign ownership and a special security agreement, which under current thinking qualifies as a valid mitigation tool for OCI. Given that we've moved contracts that have OCI potential into that vehicle. However, sales in that vehicle are between $100 million to $200 million, not anywhere near the kind of the level of what you saw being sold earlier this year. As we look across the company and I guess we're alluding to Services, again, our Services segment is I'd like to say, it's really two -- I guess your flavors, one of them is the direct support to the war fighter, that's primarily being delivered by experienced former military officers and businesses like MPRI. It's a unique business that provides a service that continues to earn good margins. And our Intelligence/Engineering Support business is mostly here in the States. Again, those are decent margins and is unique in terms of our workforce and clearances that we have. So our view is that they are non-commodity type businesses and given the pipeline that we see out there, notwithstanding OCI and not withstanding in-sourcing, we still see it as an area that can have continued growth. So from a capital deployment standpoint, we view the best value right now, candidly, is our own stock, which is where we've been directing most of our cash flow. With a 15% yield, cash yield on our stock, we're returning almost 12% of that through our buyback and our dividend. So I think right now -- and of course, you're seeing that across the industry, that's kind of where I see it for now. It terms out. If we got an offer, we decided to sell something at a very compelling multiple, would we evaluate it? Yes, it didn't hurt the long-term growth aspects of L-3 and was the best thing for shareholders, of course we'd evaluate it."

If you look at where -- and I'd say that because the equity prices of defense companies. We're in pretty good shape in the first quarter and kind of deteriorated in the second and third, and I guess that's all the concern here about budget and margins and the like. Now having been in numerous meetings with Secretary Carter, Secretary Lynn and even Secretary Gates, the mantra has been: We need a healthy defense industry. And they're really looking for efficiency versus margins. And I'm sure you've seen the September 14 memorandum of Secretary Carter, which kind of reiterates that. Now as well-intentioned, supportive as we all are as an industry to his objectives, and everybody is working hard to them, you can't help but be concerned that there will be a hit to margins in some way, shape or form. Companies are going to be able to respond differently to those requests.
I think in our case, we are already a lean company. We are not sitting on a lot of excess or any excess capacity as far as I know actually. Maybe a little bit where we make Bradley transmissions right now because of the slowdown, but nothing that I would say is looming out there for us. And I would hope that this environment of increased competition could work in our favor. There'd be less tendency than for vertical integration, if they, DoD, will insist on more competitions for subsystems and a lot more milestone reviews, which is what they are saying. And I'll give you a negative. On the other hand, to the extent that the platform companies really get ratcheted down because of cost growth and cost concerns, they very well will turn around to their supplier community and put pressure as well. So that will be a downside. The dependency there is, I mean, how much we're able to maintain our pricing. I think we do a pretty good job across the company in our -- but the more proprietary we are, the stronger our pricing is as you would expect. So when you put it all together what does it mean? It means it's not perfectly clear yet, but that's kind of our sense of some of the things that we're likely to be faced with going forward."

That's slipped from the earlier part of this year. Expectations are now that we would have an RFP for that before the end of the year, and that there will be an award made sometime early next year, and that's going to be going from single award to multiple award ID/IQ, where you have more suppliers and they compete on each of the task orders. There's also a large Afghan training contract in-source selection right now, which was the old CNTPO [ph] that reincarnated itself is a new full and open competition. That's in-source selection, and there's supposed to be an award before year end. So those are the bigger ones in Government Services. In the Aircraft Modification and Maintenance segment, we're going to be re-competing our P3 Sustainment Modification contract into next year. It's currently in-source selection, but they're making some amendments to it. And we expect that there'll be an award on that early to mid-2011. So that's the largest one there, and there really isn't any single large re-competition going on in Electronic Systems due to the diversity of that segment in terms of the number of businesses, the supplier versus prime situation, et cetera."

I think there’s a reprioritization that's going on continuously now, because -- Howard, you know the numbers as well as anyone. If you look at the supplemental, if you go just a couple of years, it went from a high of around $163 billion in '08 to the '11 request of $100 billion. That's $63 billion that's moved around, and we're still engaged albeit spending less in Iraq, but spending more in Afghanistan. That money is getting pulled from somewhere. So our sense of it, and again, it's very hard to pin it down very discretely, is that there is a broad reprioritization of funding going on and that is affecting numerous programs."

But an example is, there's a procurement that was floating around to the Iraqis to get a hold of some Russian helicopters for them to start to build out their own capabilities. And that's just starting. Once you start moving down that path, there's all kinds of requirements: basing, training, logistics, maintenance and support and the like. So we still think that that's an area where they'll be offset to the decline on the U.S. side, but it's been slow to take off."

I don't think that it's our belief that national security becomes an option. And given the condition of our equipment and the need for modernization and upgrades and reset, which is not factored anywhere in the budgets, I think, there's, I would like to believe, limited downside in where we can go as the budget.

I think the clarity issue will take a little time in terms of budget priorities, in terms of programs and funding levels, as well as the future impact of Secretary Carter's initiatives, which again, industry is embracing, but it's going to be some pain in shaking out some of the redundancies and cost that they're alluding to.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll start by, of course, thanking our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to the program performance in satisfying our customers, and our Group Presidents for their continued leadership efforts.
 Overall, it was a solid third quarter. Earnings were up about 11% to $2.07 a share if you adjust for the debt refinance charge of about $0.03 that we had in this year's third quarter, and also adjust the $0.22 tax gain that was in the 2009 third quarter. Operating margins and cash flow continue to be strong. Sales were a little weaker than we expected. They were $3.8 billion. However, our C3ISR businesses continue to do very well with 8% growth, which had offset declines in A&M and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services segment grew at about 1%, but that reversed the trend of declining sales that we saw in the first half.
 Orders grew at about 4% to $3.5 billion in the quarter versus 2009 third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92. Year-to-date, however, the book-to-bill is a 0.98, a little lower than the 1 that we would have liked to have seen, but still encouraging. Our funded backlog was $10.8 billion at the end of the quarter.
 In terms of significant awards, there were several. First of all, the U.S. Army C-12 logistics support contract. Also with the Army, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle or ENVG contract. That's getting a slower start than was expected, however, because of a protest, which has now been resolved. Intelligence Support Services in Afghanistan, our Special Operating Forces Deployable Node-Lite or SDN-Lite contract. A recent win known as the Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System, or BAIS, for the U.S. Army and the Advanced Checkpoint Carry-on X-ray Screening Systems for TSA. On top of those wins, there was significant follow-on order activity as well, and it's a long list, but just to name a few, Project Liberty, our EO/IR turrets, Rover ManPacks, CF-18, Law Enforcement Professional Program, Rivet Joint work, more eXaminer work, Flight School XXI and C-12 Logistics Services, just to name a
 few.
 In terms of the larger programs for JCA, total orders received to date are 21 aircraft. We're expecting another eight in fiscal '11. The total Air Force buys continue to be expected to be 38 aircraft, with the final mind coming in fiscal '12. We plan to deliver four in 2010, three are already delivered. That brings the total for the program will be six. The National Guard is still projecting the need for additional aircraft, and there is a potential for a plus up in fiscal '12 and beyond. And there are also still several foreign military sale opportunities, mostly those we see slipping to 2013 and 2014 due to government fiscal pressures and the fact that most of our production is dedicated to the U.S. delivery schedule as well.
 For Project Liberty, we completed delivery of all 37 aircraft to the Air Force in August, and that was on budget and ahead of the contractual schedule. We look forward to continuing to apply L-3's expertise to other small aircraft ISR applications, both within the U.S. DoD and with foreign customers. For example, we currently expect the Air Force to expand the Liberty fleet by five aircraft sometime later this year. That has slipped out from where we had expected it and probably part of the OCO request for fiscal '10. We also are currently competing as a prime, as I'm sure you know, for the U.S. Army's EMARSS program.
 A few words about EMARSS, that is the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System. It's an aircraft that focus on the regular warfare mission, SIGINT, COMINT, EO/IR, and communications. It is the replacement for the canceled ACS program and a possible replacement for the aging Guardrail fleet, expected to be of $1.5 billion program of record. Configuration is a small aircraft similar to the Liberty MC-12 platform. The initial buy is now anticipated to be 6 EMD aircraft, with a six aricraft LRIP option plus logistic services and is expected to further grow to at least 30 aircraft.
 We expect the award decision before year end. Now that was expected at the end of September and then the end of October. So that's moved out, as I'm sure you've all read, that's a heavily-competed program of between major primes and ourselves. We think we have a good shot at it, but again, it's a heavily-competed program, and we look forward to hearing the results at the end of year.
 U.K. Air Seeker, formerly known as Springtime, formerly known as HELIX and sometimes known as U.K. Rivet Joint, just all on the same page, that program has survived Britain's Strategic Defense and Security Review, and is expected to proceed. It's a significant program for L-3 worth over $800 million over seven years. It consists of three U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft to replace the U.K. Nimrod ISR aircraft. The first aircraft delivery to the  MOD is anticipated in April 2014, and we expect to receive the first aircraft to induct it in our Greenville facility in January. We're already beginning preliminary work on long lead items and planning. But I think what's important to note here is, this is really a good example that shows, one, the importance of ISR; two, the confidence in L-3's reputation and our ability to deliver on time and on budget even during the significant budget cuts we saw in the U.K. So we are very happy that this is proceeding as scheduled. And we're currently negotiating with the MOD presently, and expect the conversion kit contract by early next year. The program will be incrementally funded over the seven-year period.
 In the Whole Body Imaging airport checkpoint scanner program, there were only two qualified suppliers as you know. Back in April, we received the TSA order to deliver 202 systems. This was the first order placed on our five-year ID/IQ from the TSA, which was valued at up to $167 million. All 202 systems will be delivered by the end of this year. We delivered 135 of those systems during the third quarter and plan to ship the remaining 67 units in the fourth quarter. We expect the next TSA order in the first quarter of 2011. Future orders are dependent on the testing and acceptance of the auto-detect software, which is planned to be deployed in the first half of next year.
 In terms of our capital deployment, we repurchased $215 million of stock in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $469 million. Our remaining authorization was about $957 million at the end of the quarter, and we now expect to repurchase about $800 million of our stock for 2010, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. We continue to believe our stock represents a good value.
 With respect to acquisitions, we acquired Airborne Technologies in August and 3DI Technologies in September for an aggregate price of $93 million. Both of those companies augment our existing capabilities. They were bought at attractive prices. They're already contributing to our operations.
 We continue to evaluate several other companies. However, as you know, the valuation multiples for publicly-traded defense companies and those that are not are kind of out of balance, and we're being cautious in terms of valuations that are excessive compared to where the company trades in most cases.
 Three acquisitions that were made to date that's worth noting, were all negotiated non-auction transactions, again, where we paid reasonable prices. In terms of our 2010 guidance, we provided an update today, maintaining our EPS range at $8.05 to $8.25 per share. At the midpoint, that represents about 7% growth from 2009. We lowered sales to $15.6 billion to $15.7 billion compared to our prior guidance, and that decrease is due to the continued procurement and funding delays we've experienced since the beginning of the year. However, margins are doing better and a little bit better in taxes, a little bit better on the share count, we've been able to maintain our earnings guidance.
 I want to spend a couple minutes on the DoD budget and spending priorities before I get into the 2011 numbers. They've received a lot of press lately. Of course, overall, the budget's remain healthy and robust with modest base budget growth plus supplementals. However, be addressable DoD budget per industry, which include the investment account and the O&M account is essentially flat when you include the base of supplementals, and that is pressuring sales growth. If you look at the base budget, the O&M account is growing at about 8%. The 11 requests compared to fiscal '10 and the investment account or the hardware account is growing at about 2%, combined at about a 5% level. When you overlay, however, the decline in the supplemental, what it's doing is it's actually causing a 1% drop in the combined base plus supplemental addressable market. On balance, however, about 50% of our sales are coming out of the O&M account and on a base level. That does account for 8% growth and we will continue to do well with the way the company is positioned even in these flattening budget times.
 Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan continue to determine the near-term resource decisions. We think that accounts, in some cases, to some of the slippage and reprioritization of funding, as well as lower new starts and the reprogramming. The tighter budget has been confronting the DoD and underscored repeatedly since May by Secretary Gates and Under Secretary Carter and Deputy Secretary Lynn. In May, it his Eisenhower Library Speech, Secretary Gates said that given America's difficult economic situations circumstances and fiscal conditions, military spending should expect closer, harsher scrutiny. And Secretary Gates wants to reduce DoD overhead costs and transfer those savings to pay for force structure and modernization in the DoD budget. What I'd like to underscore there is the requirement of force structure and modernization hasn't gone away, it's getting more and more difficult to fund, and it's certainly going to be stretched out over a longer period of time than we would of course like to see.
 Following, we have Secretary Carter's acquisition memorandum that was issued last month, focusing on eliminating unproductive, low performing programs, redundant programs, low value overhead. And the objectives include delivering the needed war fighter capability within the budget, restoring affordability and doing more without more. The implication for industry of course is the need to be responsible partner and outperform negotiated costs and schedule. Notwithstanding that, the geopolitical scene confronting the U.S. and its allies remains complex and challenging and will likely continue to require a healthy DoD budget. Therefore, I think, on balance, industry should be okay. In general, I think L-3 will be better than okay as well.
 To give you some sense for what we're seeing next year, I know you've seen our guidance in the release, but as you know, we will have an Investor Day that will be in December. We will provide a lot more granularity on guidance, but from a segment basis, we continue to see C3ISR leading the growth in the company. There continues to be strong demand for small aircraft via ISR and network communications, as well as the demand for international airborne ISR continues to grow.
 With regard to AM&M, of course, we have a headwind in that segment with the loss of the SOFSA contract and a bit of price competition in the logistics work. However, the aging aircraft fleet that the U.S. has continues to present significant opportunities here at home. Internationally, there's been a bit of a slow down, of course, by physical fiscal constraints. Services, we're looking at an overall flat 2011 right now and a little bit of downside risk actually due to the competitive nature. However, I would stress in the Services segment that it has more opportunities for winning large programs than most other segments of our business areas right now. So acknowledging that reality, we are focusing some investment next year in cyber, indigent proposals and also the move of CECOM down to Aberdeen where we have a contract with a lot of content.
 Electronic Systems, we expect to see modest growth in the diverse product portfolio we have. Of course, the reprogramming and cuts have affected several of our business areas. But what's growing would include EO/IR, Microwave, Aviation, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and detection; with Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion systems and Telemetry declining.
 As for the commercial markets, our commercial and international sales are about 16% to 17% of our consolidated sales and our commercial markets, currently, they have been declining both the avionics, as well as the equipment that we put on ships, both commercial and military. We're starting to see a rebound in avionics beginning in the latter part of this year and extending into 2011.
 On the Shipbuilding side, we expect to see a rebound in 2012. So that'll continue to be slow next year. The homeland security market continues to advance as we introduced new products. And in terms of foreign military, it's an uneven environment. There's a lot of growth in the Middle East and Asia, but much lower growth in Europe, U.K., Canada and Australia.
 When you look of course the company, let me to summarize what we're seeing. Again, the ISR segment to be growing next year. Services flat, AM&M will be down because of JOG [Joint Operations Group], but if you remove that effect, it is growing, and if you look at the Electronic Systems segment between the advancers and decliners, again, EO/IR, Microwave, Avionics, Displays, Precision Engagement, Security and Detection collectively are growing at about 8%, but they're being offset by Marine & Power Systems, Simulation and Training, Propulsion and Telemetry and Advanced Technologies, which are declining by about 5%. And in terms of the reasons for the declines, I can hit them very quickly. But again, Marine & Power Systems is just the slowdown in the, primarily, the commercial shipbuilding area. And we see that recovering at the end of 2011. So we don't believe that's permanent or long term. Simulation and Training, it's really a function of reprogramming of funds in the U.S. and program slipping out of the year in the international marketplace. Propulsion systems is one program, it's funding for the Bradley that has been redeployed elsewhere since that is not a priority for Iraq and Afghanistan. It doesn't mean the requirements gone away, there are still a load of Bradley fighting vehicles that we are transmissions and reset work, so I believe that will recover in 2012, and the Telemetry Advanced Technology area again is one program there, a U.K. program that is going to experience of funding decline next year. So that's a broad summary of what we see for 2011.
 In terms of the guidance, we were looking at the consolidated sales of between $15.7 billion and $15.9 billion, which is about 1% above what we saw in 2010. To remove the effects of JOG, the growth is about 3% to 4% that's going to be a big headwind next year. The earnings estimate for next year is in the range of about $8.40 to $8.60 before the pension charge or the increased pension expense, if you will, which will be up 4% at the midpoint compared to 2010. But we're expecting, if everything stays equal as we see it today that, that pension will run about $0.20 a share. So that's where we see 2011 from an early view. Again, there's an Investor Conference that we'll have as we always do in December. In fact, I'll give you the date. It should be on December 7, if you want to mark your calendars, starting at 8 a.m. at the Essex House here in New York. Sure you will receive an invitation.
 To wrap up, we believe that L-3 will continue to thrive and grow in this new emerging greater efficiency environment with flattening budgets. I think that what will differentiate L-3 will be our culture and dedication to outstanding program performance, meeting budgets and exceeding delivery schedules plus our quick-reaction capabilities. Strong product areas in EO/IR, ISR, Intelligence Support will continue to lead growth, albeit probably at a slower pace. But again, we expect to see those areas all growing, and the broad product portfolio will continue to provide products to upgrade and enhance existing platforms. We continue to see that as a positive. In terms of our cash flow yield for 2010, it's going to approach about $11 a share representing a 15% yield compared to the market price of L-3 stock. The balance sheet and cash flow will continue to be strong, and we'll use them to and deploy the cash to continue to grow the company and increase shareholder value.
 So with that, Ralph will give you some more color on the financials, and the we'll be happy to take your questions.

93538,113942739,86271,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives"," Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure. As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales driven by strong margin p",1302," Thank you, Mike. I'll highlight some trends about the third quarter, review the changes to our 2010 guidance and finish with some comments on our capital structure.
 As Mike said, we had a solid third quarter despite flat sales driven by strong margin performance that drove operating income growth to 5%, as well as strong cash flow. Our diluted EPS was $2.07, and that included a $0.03 debt retirement charge. For our third quarter 2010 income tax rate was also lower than we planned, and that added about $0.05 or $0.06 to EPS in the quarter. With respect to sales, our third quarter sales were $3,835,000,000 or essentially flat versus the third quarter of last year. And at the segment level, growth in C3ISR was offset by declines in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and Electronic Systems. Our Government Services was up about 1%. In C3ISR, the growth was driven by ISR, Logistics Support and ISR Manpacks. Sales in Government Services increased 1%, driven by growth from a large competitively one classified IT contract that we began working on in April. And that offset lower subcontractor pass-throughs on the Army, SSES [systems and software engineering and sustainment] task orders.
 In Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance, sales declined 5%. That was mostly due to the timing on that Joint Cargo Aircraft, which decreased $17 million, and we had some additional declines in contract field services and on the SOFSA contract. In the Electronics Systems segment, sales decreased 3%. What happened there was growth in EO/IR, Security & Detection systems and Microwave Communications was offset by declines in Marine & Power Systems driven by lower commercial shipbuilding sales, Combat Propulsion Systems due to less funding on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, as well as funding cuts and delays on Middle-Eastern engine programs and in Training and Simulation due to lower sales on AVCATT and the F/A-18 program where we saw reduced ECP-type funding, and also when Precision Engagement and in Marine services, due to a handful of contracts nearing completion. And finally, we also had some delays on some new starts, which affected sales in this segment. For example, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle protest delay and our recent win of the SOCOM SDN-Lite program, which happened later than we thought it was going to happen.
 Moving on to operating margin. Consolidated margin was very strong at 11.4% in the third quarter, up 50 basis points over 3Q of last year, and that was driven by strength in the Electronic Systems segment. We had a continued favorable higher profit margin sales mix, which overcame lower sales in the segment. And we also had a $5 million pick up on the restructuring of a contract, which itself increased segment margins in ES by 15 basis points. Also within Government Services, we received an annual award fee in Q3 that we're anticipating in Q4 and that helped the margins in government services.
 Our cash flow for the quarter was very strong. Our free cash flow was $367 million. Year-to-date, nine months, free cash flow was almost $900 million, up 5% versus the first nine months of last year. And we're on track with our full year estimated of $1,260,000,000 of free cash flow.
 With respect to the changes to our 2010 guidance, as Mike said, we maintained our EPS range, which is $8.05 to $8.25. And while the range remains the same, we had a few changes in the components of EPS, primarily comprised of three items: One, lower sales volumes are going to reduce EPS by about $0.24, and that's being offset by higher operating margin, again mostly in Electronic Systems, which is adding $0.15 and the lower tax rate, which is increasing EPS by about $0.14.
 We lowered our 2010 sales guidance by $400 million to the new range of $15.6 billion to $15.7 billion. The lower sales are mostly due to continued procurement and funding delays on several programs, about which we also commented during the first and second quarter earnings conference calls. During the third quarter, those funding delays continued and in some cases, spreads in new programs and more business areas. We also experienced some funding cuts and some reprogramming actions. In any event, those funding delays are manifesting themselves in lower book-to-bill ratios, slower sales growth rates and lower sales levels. And we currently do not foresee a quick uptick in the order flow that would make up for the year-to-date delays that we've experienced. And we've updated these changes in our 2010 sales guidance.
 At the segment level, with respect to sales. In C3ISR, we're now at the lower end of our range, and that's due to lower funding on Rivet Joint and the negative impacts of a few undefinitized contract actions. In Electronic Systems, we reduced the sales guidance by $200 million. That's due to the program delays and funding cuts that I talked about, and it's impacting the Training and simulation business area, Precision Engagement, Propulsion Systems, Undersea Warfare and Advanced Technologies.
 And finally, in the Government Services segment, we reduced our sales by $100 million in previous guidance. That's due to the loss of a training contract in Afghanistan and more-than-expected subcontract that are pass-through reductions on the SSES task orders. We've also seen some procurement delays on Afghanistan new business competitions, as well as some Intelligence work and reductions on certain Iraq and Afghanistan contracts.
 Moving on to the consolidated operating margin guidance, we raised it by 20 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to Electronic Systems, and that's offsetting reduced expectations for C3ISR, Government Services and the Aircraft Mod and Maintenance segment. The lower tax rate, which is now 35% is due to true ups from filing last year's tax return, as well as lower taxes from foreign locations. Our tax guidance continues to assume that the federal R&E credit is retroactively enacted. Back to January 1, sometime in the fourth quarter, that is reducing our 2010 estimated tax rate by 110 basis points, and it adds $0.40 in EPS, which is in our guidance. So if the R&E credit is not extended, we'll be at the lower end of our EPS range.
 A couple of comments on the fourth quarter. We expect sales to be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, with EPS of about $2.27 at the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance range. If you look at the margins, the year-to-date margins consolidated were 11.3%, and our updated guidance implies fourth quarter margin of approximately 10.7%. We expect margins to be lower in the fourth quarter because of a less favorable sales mix in Electronic Systems, and some lower prof rates on some new follow-on contracts in Government Services and on the Aircraft Logistics Support side.
 We are intend to take somewhere between $10 million and $15 million of severance and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter to rightsize certain businesses for lower volumes in 2011. Those reductions in the fourth quarter margins are being offset by a technology license fee that's going to add $9 million.
 Moving onto the balance sheet. We expect to end the year with about $650 million. That's after the increase and the share repurchases to $800 million and paying our dividend and the three acquisitions that we made. Regarding our debt, we have about $700 million of convertible notes that can be put to us on February 1 of next year. If that put occurs, we expect to refinance those convertible notes with new investment-grade senior notes. And we'll continue to be opportunistic in the debt capital markets. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and liquidity, and we'll continue to use our strong cash flow to increase shareholder value and grow the company.
 That includes my comments. Thank you. And we'll go to Q&A now.

What's different is that normally, you've had puts and takes at the end of the day, but net-net, you'd be even or net positive. And you're seeing that trend become a little bit of a net negative now because there's more things declining and advancing, and I think it's more sign of the times. I think that what we see now on a segment level is the ISR segment should well exceed one in the fourth quarter, probably closer to 1.15. With services at about 1, AM&M at about 0.88 and Electronic Systems at about the same place. So that would bring the year to the 0.98 that I had mentioned.

I'll tell you, it's a combination of three things: One, as we've been saying almost every quarter that the competition in Services was increasing and we are seeing margin pressure. So a piece of it are margins in Services. In addition, we are going to invest in the cyber center, which we've started to spend money on but that'll cost us a couple of points of margin. As well, we're going to deploy some more resources in the bids and proposal area, because this is a space that is really dominated by a lot of large-dollar contracts that I'd like to put more resources on because just a little more penetration in that area will help us a lot.

And what's happening in C3ISR, we have a changing sales mix where we're doing less equipment modification-type work and more logistics support work. I commented earlier about the undefinitized contract actions in the segment, and that's also putting some pressure on margins. And in Electronic Systems, it's also a changing mix situation within the EO/IR space. We talked about the Bradley fighting vehicle and in our training and simulation, this is an area we're doing more logistics works as opposed to equipment modification. So it's mostly a mix issue, and this year, we had a couple of pick ups, I talked about one in the third quarter, and one we had in the  first quarter. But most of the margin pressure continues to be in the Government Services area that Mike talked about.

A good example of that would be some of the slippage that we've seen on Rivet Joint, for example. Yet we're seeing increased demand from communication systems and EO/IR equipment and the like.

But really, it's part of the tightened acquisition. It was five years ago now. There was a business unit there that is almost in a proxy structure, similar structure that you see where there's a foreign ownership and a special security agreement, which under current thinking qualifies as a valid mitigation tool for OCI. Given that we've moved contracts that have OCI potential into that vehicle. However, sales in that vehicle are between $100 million to $200 million. Not anywhere near the kind of the level of what you saw being sold earlier this year. As we look across the company and I guess we're alluding to services, again, our Services segment is I'd like to say, it's really two I guess your flavors, one of them is the direct support to the war fighter, that's primarily being delivered by experienced former military officers and physicist like MPRI. It's a unique business that provides a service that continues to earn good margins. And our Intelligence/Engineering Support business is mostly here in the states. Again, those are decent margins and is unique in terms of our workforce and clearances that we have. So our view is that they are non-commodity type businesses and given the pipeline that we see out there, notwithstanding OCI and not withstanding in-sourcing, we still see it as an area that can have continued growth. So from a capital deployment standpoint, we view the best value right now, candidly, is our own stock, which is where we've been directing most of our cash flow with the 15% yield, cash yield on our stock, we're returning almost 12% of that through our buyback and dividend. So I think right now, and of course, you're seeing that across the industry, that's kind of where I see it for now. It terms out. We got an offer, we decided to sell something at a very compelling multiple, would we evaluate it? Yes, it didn't hurt the long-term growth aspects of L-3 and was the best thing for shareholders, of course, we'd evaluate it.

If you look at where -- and I'd say that because the equity prices of defense companies. We're in pretty good shape in the first quarter and kind of deteriorated in the second and third, and I guess that's all the concern here about budget and margins and the like. Now having been in numerous meetings with Secretary Carter, Secretary Lynn and even Secretary Gates, the mantra has been we need a healthy defense industry. And they're really looking for efficiency versus margins. And I'm sure you've seen the September 14 memorandum of Secretary Carter, which kind of reiterates that. Now as well-intentioned supportive as we all are as an industry, to his objectives, and everybody is working hard to them, you can't help but be concerned that there will be a hit in margins in some way, shape or form. Companies are going to be able to respond differently to those requests. I think in our case, we are already a lean company. We are not sitting on a lot of excess or any excess capacity as far as I know actually. Maybe a little bit where we make Bradley transmissions right now because of the slowdown, but nothing that I would say is looming out there for us. And I would hope that this environment of increased competition could work in our favor. There'd be less tendency than for vertical integration, if they, DoD, will insist on more competitions for subsystems and a lot more milestone reviews, which is what they are saying. And I'll give you a negative. On the other hand, to the extent that the platform companies really get ratcheted down because the cost growth and cost concerns, they very well will turn around to their supplier community and put pressure as well. So that will be downside. The dependency there is, I mean, how much we're able to maintain our pricing. I think we do a pretty good job across the company in our -- but the more proprietary we are, the stronger our pricing is as you would expect. So when you put it all together what does it mean? It means it's not perfectly clear yet, but that's kind of our sense of some of the things that we're likely to be faced with going forward.

Yes, a little bit. But there could be margin pressure off the road. I don't see anything now that's worrying us, and I feel good about next year's guidance. But again, weren't in an environment now that has got uncertainty in it, and I think we're talking about at least another year, year and a half's worth of work before it really shakes out in terms of priorities, programs, funding levels and the impact of the cost, the affordability initiatives, because they're only in their infancy right now.

In fact it's one of the few new starts that's happening in that whole space. Within Government Services, at some point, they're going to re-compete the worldwide Linguist contract that's slipped from the earlier part of this year. Expectations, now that we would have an RFP for that before the end of the year, and that there will be an award made sometime early next year, and that's going to be going from single award to multiple award ID/IQ, where you have more suppliers and they compete on each of the task orders. There's also a large Afghan training contract in-source selection right now, which was the old CNTPO that reincarnated itself is a new full and open competition. That's in-source selection, and there's supposed to be an award before year end.  So those are the bigger ones in Government Services. In the Aircraft Modification and Maintenance segment, we're going to be re-competing our P3 Sustainment Modification contract into next year. It's currently in-source selection, but they're making some amendments to it. And we expect that there'll be an award on that early to mid-2011. So that's the largest one there, and there really isn't any single large re-competition going on in Electronic Systems due to the adversity of that segment in terms of the number of businesses, the supplier versus prime situation, et cetera.

Really, in terms of red programs, we're not know for them. So we operate very well. I got to tell you, we spent a lot of time on your question on that topic, because I asked the same question. Why are we seeing this? And we went through every single business unit, and we see little disruptions everywhere. And that, again, to give everyone -- to let you see what we're seeing, I mean that's why I'm sharing this with you, is that it is pervasive and I think some of it is just backlog of paper. Competitions are taking longer. Protests always slow things down, although I don't think that's a major driver here. I think this is a reprioritization that's going on continuously now, because -- Howard, you know the numbers as well as anyone. If you look at the supplemental, if you go just a couple of years, it went from a high of around $163 billion in '08 to the '11 request of $100 billion, that's $63 billion that's moved around, and we're still engaged albeit spending less in Iraq, spending more in Afghanistan. That money is getting pulled from somewhere. So our sense of it, and again, it's very hard to pin it down discretely, is that there is a broad reprioritization of funding going on and that is affecting numerous programs.

And yes it has. And what has been slow to materialize though has been direct contracts with the government of Iraq for some of the training and leadership development and putting in an acquisition capability and equipment maintenance, et cetera. I mean this is only starting now and it'll be hard for me to quantify to any one what it's worth. But an example is, there's a procurement that was floating around to the Iraqis to get a hold of some Russian helicopters for them to start to build out their own capabilities. And that's just starting. Once you start moving going that path, there's all kinds of requirements, basing, training, logistics, maintenance and support and the like. So we still think that that's an area where they'll be offset to the decline on the U.S. side, but it's been slow to take off.

Obviously, cash performance is generally the distinguisher for you guys versus others in terms of the cash flow conversion. Part of the initiatives, kind of the efficiency initiatives, are for the customer to be a smarter buyer and it's also delving into the area of smarter on cash terms as well looking at progress payments, milestone payments and not necessarily making it more difficult for your contractors, but using it more as a carrot on a stick. I'm wondering if you see that playing out now or is this still too early in the game and we might see that more into the longer-term horizon?

But again, just implementing, those principles have not been tested yet, and my sense is it's not going to be a significant driver to our cash flow in the future.

On the working capital, and here is just taking every working capital as well as action liability count and aggregating them together, it's going to be about use of cash of $100 million this year. A lot of it is that we've been deliberately making advanced procurement buys on some inventories on some of these quick-churn items, and then We'll be shipping in the fourth quarter and into next year. So next year, we see less of a working capital to use for next year. It's probably going to be $10 million to $20 million of working capital, use of cash for 2011.

Well, I think that brings us to a conclusion. Just a couple of parting thoughts. The two constants here that we're dealing with as an industry and of course as L-3 are the: One, the budget situation here in the U.S. is tight, it's going to have effects. It's not going to change in the short term. And number two, the geopolitical situation, which is complex, it's a longer list than before. And that's not changing either. And therein lies the tension. I don't think that it's our belief that national security becomes an option. And given the condition of our equipment and the need for modernization and upgrades and reset, which is not factored anywhere in the budgets, I think, there's, I would like to believe, limited downside in where we can go as the budget. In terms of L-3, I think that we continue to be well-positioned, portfolio-wise, I think the clarity issue will take a little time in terms of budget priorities, in terms of programs and funding levels, as well as the future impact of Secretary Carter's initiatives, which again, industry is embracing, but it's going to be some pain in shaking out some of the redundancies and cost that they're alluding to. But on balance, again, I think that we're well positioned, not only in our business areas, but also in our performance history, in our ability to continue to deliver on time, on budget, listening to our customers and outperforming their expectations. It does give us an edge on our area. And with that, thanks for joining us and again, I hope to be able to see you all at the Investor Day on December 7. And thank you. Bye, bye.
