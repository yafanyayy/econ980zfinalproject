We made substantial progress in our business, including advancing our biogenerics program and launching our first major Paragraph IV drug in the U.S., oxaliplatin solution. We kicked off Project Fuel, a corporate-wide optimization initiative to drive long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value, and we met the commitment we set forth for 2009.Financially, net sales of $3.9 billion represented an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Driving these results was stellar growth in our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical product line. Adjusted gross margin reached 40%. Adjusted operating margin increased by more than 100 basis points, and we generated healthy cash flow from operations of $945 million. Despite the pressures of the global economic recession and several disposals of non-strategic assets, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 23% to $3.11.We are on our way to achieving our ultimate goal of becoming a consistent top-quartile performer and are excited about the prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. In the fourth quarter, we once again exceeded the $1 billion mark in net sales, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 represented growth of 12% over fourth quarter 2008 EPS of $0.78. Driving our net sales growth was strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals, primarily the result of our third quarter U.S. launch of oxaliplatin and strong demand for Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent.Our laser focus on advancing the business resulted in many significant achievements in 2009. We were the first market entrant with the generic solution presentation of oxaliplatin in the U.S. As a result of our flawless execution, we captured a significant share of the market for this very large drug and experienced exceptionally high levels of demand for our product. We announced our intent to acquire the generic injectable pharmaceutical asset of Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, a leading Indian injectable manufacturer and developer of beta-lactams. Through this transaction, we fulfill a key capability gap in our SIP portfolio and establish a direct presence in India providing a platform for future growth.We launched six new high dosage presentations of therapeutic heparin in single and multi-dose vials, expanding our portfolio and helping to meet an important need for our customers. We received European marketing authorization for the launch of generic docetaxel, a major drug used in the treatment of various cancers. The drug had branded sales in Europe in 2008 of approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to launch docetaxel across most of Europe by the end of 2010.We also continued our successful roll outs of several drugs in EMEA and Asia Pac, including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam and we launched a total of 23 compounds already in the market in new countries around the world during the year. Our biogenerics program continues to progress as well. We gained momentum with Retacrit, our biogeneric erythropoietin. Retacrit is currently available in 16 countries throughout Europe and has captured more than 40% of the short-acting biogeneric EPO market in the region. We acquired from PLIVA worldwide rights to a biogeneric version of filgrastim and an affiliated manufacturing facility in Croatia. This gives us development and manufacturing capabilities for our  filgrastim and pegfilgrastim pipeline products as well as potential future by biogenerics.We finalized an agreement with Celltrion, a South Korea-based pharmaceutical company, which strengthens our presence in the global biogeneric market. With the addition of five new biogeneric drugs from the agreement, the number of compounds in our biogenerics pipeline has almost doubled to 11, giving us one of the largest pipeline in the industry with the local branded value of $34 billion.In Medication Management Systems, our other strategic product line, we acquired TheraDoc, the gold standard in enterprise-wide clinical surveillance and decision support. Through this acquisition, we are advancing the quality and safety of patient care through sophisticated technology used to monitor hospital-acquired infections.We extended Hospira's portfolio of MMS products with the introduction in the Middle East of Plum A+ with MedNet safety software. This marks the first time Middle East healthcare facilities can access these types of advanced integrated technologies from one company. We also launched our first Symbiq device in Canada. In our EMEA region, we signed a 10-year contract with the Royal Marsden Hospital National Health Service Trust in the U.K. to be its provider of aseptic compounding services. This is the largest outsourced compounding contract awarded by Royal Marsden and builds on the compounding capabilities we acquired with Mayne Pharma.In Asia Pac, we established a direct presence in Seoul, South Korea focus primarily on distribution of our oncology portfolio. This brings our direct sales presence to nine markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We received a credit rating upgrade from both Standard & Poor's rating service and Moody's Investors Service. Standard & Poor's upgraded our rating from BBB to BBB+ and Moody's from Baa3 negative to Baa3 stable. We reduced our debt by approximately $425 million during the year, including an early pay down of $370 million of debt that was due in March of 2010. Last but certainly not least, we introduced and made significant progress on Project Fuel. With regards to optimizing our product line, we have identified approximately 55% of our original 7,000-plus SKUs or list numbers that can be eliminated over time. To date, we have eliminated more than 35% of the total SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced on our last quarterly earnings call. We also continued to progress in streamlining our organizational structure. Of the targeted 1,400 to 1,500 physician reduction goal, we have notified approximately 75% of the people who's positions are being eliminated.In the area of evaluating non-strategic assets, we made several asset disposals including the sale of two product lines, our critical care products to ICU Medical and our brain function monitoring products to SEDLine, a sub of Masimo and the sale of two contract manufacturing facilities, our Salisbury, Australia manufacturing facility to HalcyGenPharmaceuticals and most recently, our Wasserburg, Germany manufacturing to Recipharm AB. Both of these facilities came with our acquisition of Mayne in 2007. These asset disposals advanced our efforts to simplify our product line and focus on our key strategic areas, better enabling us to drive future growth.We have met our Project Fuel commitments in 2009, aggressively driving transformation throughout the organization and building momentum going into 2010. In procurement, we pursued over 150 strategic sourcing programs to identify best cost suppliers and lower total cost of ownership. In finance, we redesigned our annual plan process, saving 100 of employees hours, improving the quality of the process. In sales and marketing, we developed a go to market strategy to improve the effectiveness of our U.S. sales force through focused and alignment to our key strategic growth areas SIP and MMS. In R&D, we enhanced the milestone review process for new development programs to streamline the process, lower risk and improve the predictability of success. And in IT, we established strategic outsourcing partnerships to provide greater oversight and maximize the value attained from our global IT service providers.Efforts such as these will optimize our productivity and allow us to free up additional funds for investment in our business, driving even better execution of our longer-term financial targets and business goals. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Terry for more details on sales for the quarter. Terry?"

I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanyi",1255,"Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. Global net sales grew 11% in the quarter and 9% for the full year, exceeding our most recent annual guidance of 5% to 7% growth. Both of our key strategic areas, SIP and MMS performed well across all three segments: The Americas, EMEA and APAC. I'll now discuss results by product line for each segment, focusing most of my remarks on the results for the quarter.Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical net sales in the Americas were up over 25% in the quarter and more than 20% for the full year, primarily attributable to greater-than-anticipated performance in oxaliplatin and strength in Precedex. Regarding oxaliplatin, the fourth quarter performance for the drug was impacted by two major factors. The first, which accounted for nearly 75% of the drug results related to the difference between the estimated and actual charge back amounts as a result of stronger than anticipated end user pricing. As a point of reference, the charge-back provision is the difference between the amount we charge wholesalers and the amount end-user customers pay at the time of purchase.Secondly, we had anticipated that given exceptionally high level of wholesaler demand right of the gate, fourth quarter sales were accelerated into the third quarter. Thus, we project little if no sales of the drug for the fourth quarter. However, given the limited amount of actual competitors during the quarter, price erosion was less than expected and additional demand for the drug drove incremental oxaliplatin sales in the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors contributed to the fourth quarter's positive oxaliplatin performance.In addition to oxaliplatin, Precedex performed extremely well. Precedex had a very strong year enhanced by several factors, including the efforts of our expanded sales force, positive response to the expanded label for the procedural indication and the article in JAMA early in 2009. This popular sedation agent exceeded annual global revenues of $100 million this quarter, much earlier than anticipated. Heparin also contributed to the positive quarter's SIP performance as a result of strong demand for our new high dosage presentation that we recently launched. We are pleased that we're able to address this substantial market need, and believe we'll continue to gain momentum for the products throughout the course of 2010.Moving to EMEA, net sales of Specialty Injectables in the European region increased 10% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Driving the quarter's positive results was strong demand for several new product launch molecules including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Momentum for Retacrit continues to build. We ended the year with strong top and bottom line performance, achieving our breakeven goal for the biogeneric. We continue to gain market share with our share of the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe surpassing 40%. Net sales of Specialty Injectables of APAC increased 1% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Driving the growth was the ongoing strength in proprietary pharmaceuticals in Australia as well as strength in Precedex across the region. Our launch of gemcitabine in Australia in the first half of the year has exceeded our expectation as we have captured the largest unit market share of this important generic chemotherapy agent. We are continuing to roll the drug out to additional countries in this region in 2010.Moving now to devices, net sales of Global Medication Management systems increased more than 5% in the quarter and more than 2% for the full year with positive contributions from all three regions. And despite continued hospital capital spending constraints, we recorded an increase in our overall pump placements contributing to a year-over-year growth of 8% in our global install base.In the Americas, net MMS sales increased over 3% in the quarter and 1% for the full year. Both our Plum and Symbiq devices performed favorably in the quarter. Several strategic orders that we have been cultivating throughout the year shipped in the fourth quarter contributing to the strong year end performance. We also believe that our broad product portfolio continues to be a significant advantage in today's market.You may recall that at the beginning of the year, we had anticipated that placements would be down as a result of the constrained capital spending environment. While placements for large volume infusion devices were up slightly year-over-year, we saw a shift towards a lower-priced Plum pumps versus Symbiq. Price-sensitive consumers can purchase our traditional Plum device today and with the interoperability of our MedNet safety software, they can easily upgrade to our higher technology Symbiq device in the future.For the Symbiq devices that we are placing, we continued to see strong competitive captures with over 80% of our Symbiq placements for the year coming from competitive accounts. In EMEA, MMS net sales increased 19% during the quarter and 9% for the full year due to favorable performance in both our Plum and GemStar devices and dedicated set sales. Growth during the quarter was aided by our recent tender award for Plum A+ with MedNet in a key hospital account in Saudi Arabia. MMS net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 25% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. Strong pump and set growth for GemStar drove both the quarter and full year results with Plum A+ also contributing to performance. In addition, the fourth quarter achieved a significant milestone with the introduction of GemStar and Plum A+ into the Japanese market. The initial response has been very positive, particularly for GemStar. We expect adoption of our MMS platform to continue in 2010 not only in Japan but in China and Australia as well, all key countries in the region. Before turning the call over to Tom, I'll provide an update on our drug pipelines, which we do an annual basis during this call. At December 31, 2009, our small molecule pipeline totaled 39 compounds, which represents a total 65 regional launches including 30 in the United States. The global branded market value of a small molecule pipeline is approximately $15 billion. Of the pipelines compounds, currently 21 have been submitted for approval in one or more regulatory agencies. The local market value of the filed compounds is approximately $7.9 billion. Of that dollar value, roughly 50% relates to compounds where we are currently challenging the patents or where there is some uncertainty associated with launch timing.In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly 45% of the total pipeline compounds are related to oncology and beta-lactams. These reflects the investments we have been making through acquisitions to become fundamental in these two important areas. Relative to launch timing, approximately 18 drugs are expected to launch in various regions over 2010 and 2011 with the split between the two years roughly equivalent. As was the case last year, our launches in 2010 and 2011 combined larger drugs with significant potential and smaller drugs that helped drive growth and scale.Regarding our biogenerics pipeline, as Chris mentioned, with the addition of five new biogenerics drug with the agreement with Celltrion, our biogenerics pipeline now has 11 compounds. One of the largest pipelines in the industry with a local branded value of $34 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for a review of the rest of our financial results and guidance for 2010.

First, I'll take you through the details on our Q4 and 2009 financial results and then we'll move to guidance.Adjusted gross margin was 40.5% in the fourth quarter. More favorable product mix and improvements resulting from the company's Project Fuel optimization initiatives were somewhat offset by costs related to product-corrective actions, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted gross margin of 40% represented a 70 basis point improvement over full year 2008. R&D expense in the quarter was $80 million, up from $53 million in the first quarter of 2008. For the full year, R&D increased 14% to $241 million. The increase for both the quarter and the full year was primarily related to our investment in various new product development programs in both SIP and MMS product lines, as well as the upfront payments to ChemGenex and the impact of foreign exchange.SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $165 million, up 18% from $139 million for the same period last year mainly a function of legal costs, the timing of expenses, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these factors were our Project Fuel cost-reduction efforts. For the full year, SG&A was $619 million, up 5% from the $590 million in 2008. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $204 million versus $188 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 19%, up 120 basis points versus last year's 17.8%. Interest expense decreased 10% for the quarter, 9% for the full year primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate notes, as well as lower debt levels.Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis for the full year was 20.3%, nearly four percentage points lower than our 2008 adjusted effective tax rate. Driving the majority of 2009's lower rate were various tax benefits recognized throughout the course of 2009. Moving to our EPS performance. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% in the fourth quarter to $0.87 compared to $0.78 last year. As was the case with the third quarter, when we increased our guidance by $0.10, most of the EPS favorability this quarter relative to consensus was due to oxaliplatin. Full year 2009 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.11 per share, an increase of 23% over 2008. Several charges were excluded from our adjusted EPS namely, Project Fuel charges, including project-related impairment and other asset charges of $0.12 a share in the quarter and $0.69 a share for the full year.  Next, charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, which totaled $0.03 per share in the quarter or $0.12 for the full year. Next, intangible amortization related to the Mayne Pharma acquisition totaled $0.07 per share in the quarter or $0.23 for the full year. Also, a research and development milestone payment for omacetaxine which totaled $0.07 per share for both the quarter and the full year.  In addition, the full year EPS excludes $0.10 per share related to the impairment of marketable equity securities and a $0.57 per share benefit related to the resolution of various IRS tax audits. In aggregate, these items totaled $0.29 for the quarter and $0.64 for the full year. Next, turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $404 million, a 58% improvement over last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $945 million compared to $584 million in 2008, driven primarily by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items as well as the timing of cash flows associated with the launch of generic oxaliplatin and some other favorable changes in working capital.At December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $946 million compared to $921 million at September 30, 2009 and $484 million at the end of last year. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures also improved for the year. Free cash flow as a percent of sales was 20% in 2009 versus 12% in 2008. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $41 million versus $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, capital spending totaled $159 million, down from $164 million in 2008. The decrease mostly reflects lower spending in 2009 versus 2008 related to our facilities optimization initiatives and spending restrictions we put in place in late 2008.Depreciation and amortization were $58 million in the quarter compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization totaled $230 million, including $62 million of intangibles amortization. This compares to depreciation and amortization of $252 million in 2008. Now from a liquidity perspective, as of year-end 2009, we had paid down a cumulative total of approximately $925 million of debt since we began paying down Mayne-related acquisition debt in 2007, a net of $425 million of which we paid in 2009. The net $425 million of debt we paid down in 2009 included an early redemption on our $375 million notes that were due in March of 2010. Our next scheduled debt payment is not due until 2012.Also, the net $425 million debt pay down also factored in the $250 million six-year notes we issued in 2009, which were priced with a coupon of 6.4%. So in addition to cash on hand, we also have a committed bank revolver of $700 million upon which to draw. So combined with our year-end cash balance of $946 million, this gives us access if needed to approximately $1.6 billion in liquidity to meet our future needs.Next, I'd like to turn to our guidance for 2010. As Chris and Terry have both stated, we made major strides in 2009 to transform and redefine our business through the various programs of Project Fuel, including the non-strategic asset disposals we mentioned. But we're excited that the guidance we'll be providing will show that we expect to be achieving our Project Fuel-related goals of a low 40% for adjusted gross margin and the low 20% for the adjusted operating margin goal, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The impact of the asset disposals, however, plus the projected decline in U.S. oxaliplatin sales will make for some difficult and potentially confusing year-over-year comparisons. Now underlying our guidance for 2010 is expected growth in our base businesses, the impact of expected new product launches, continued progress on Project Fuel, a heavier investment in R&D funded by better-than-expected savings from Project Fuel, as well as the impact of any disposals or acquisitions of businesses that were completed by January 31 of this year. Specifically, guidance will reflect the disposals of both the Salisbury and Wasserburg contract manufacturing facilities, the disposal of the critical care product line and the acquisition of TheraDoc. Globally, the disposals accounted for $134 million in 2009 sales. That's $134 million and about $0.10 in EPS. The sales were mostly recorded in our other pharma and other device product lines in each of our three geographic regions, with a more pronounced impact of these disposals on a percentage basis outside the U.S. TheraDoc sales in 2009 were not significant.One other item, the acquisition of Orchid's injectable business, which is expected to close later this quarter is not included in our guidance. Also excluded from the guidance is any impact from the proposed United States healthcare reform given the current uncertainty of the reform's outcome.So in the interest of transparency as well as ease of comparability, our revenue guidance will have statements relative to expected year-over-year growth both with and without the impact of the disposals that have been completed. But all comments will be on a constant currency basis unless we note otherwise. Significant expected new product launches will be discussed by region, as well the expected year-over-year decline in the United States relative to our 2009 launch of oxaliplatin. Given the complexity of the oxaliplatin discussion, we will start our guidance by segment with EMEA then move to APAC and conclude with the Americas. So starting with EMEA. Sales in EMEA, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 17% and 19%. However, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the region by almost 10 full percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 7% and 9%.Topline growth in the region is highly dependent on a robust new product pipeline. Investments we have made over the last couple of years to expand our pipeline are coming to fruition in 2010. We're particularly excited about the prospects for docetaxel. We expect to launch this major chemotherapy agent across most of Europe throughout the year with the five major European countries in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, we'll be launching two other important oncology products in the region. Mid-year, we plan to launch filgrastim, our second biogeneric used for the treatment of low white blood cells in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Then toward the end of the year, we expect to launch omacetaxine, a proprietary cytotoxic and oncology pharmaceutical product used in the treatment of leukemia, which we in license from ChemGenex in 2009.These products will add to our strong oncology portfolio and will augment our presence in hematology, as well as leverage the expertise and customer relationships of the biogenerics sales force we put in place in EMEA for Retacrit. We also expect our 2009 launches, including gemcitabine,  Piperacillin/Tazobactam to contribute to EMEA results for the year, and we anticipate continued growth of both sales and market share for Retacrit as it gains further acceptance and as we obtain approval for our subcutaneous renal indication this year. For MMS, we anticipate a milestone for MedNet in the region, with the expected introduction of the first language translation of Hospira MedNet into Spanish. We are also promoting our MMS portfolio aggressively in the Middle East, a growing market and one which values the medication safety features of our smart infusion systems.Next moving to APAC. Sales in APAC, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 13% and 15%. As with EMEA, however, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the APAC region by almost 11 percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 2% and 4%. We expect the trends driving the region's positive growth in 2009 will continue throughout 2010. On the pharma side, our specialty proprietary products in Australia particularly the oncology drugs, are expected to be drivers of growth as well as Precedex, which we expect to be a driver across the region. We're also excited about the anticipated approval and launch of Precedex in Korea later this year. And in Australia, we expect approval and launch of filgrastim in the second half of the year. This will mark the first launch of a biogeneric in APAC, expanding our biogenerics commercialization to two of the company's three regions. On the device side, we expect another good year in the region in 2010 with continued strength in GemStar and Plum in our major markets including Australia, Japan and Korea. 2010 will mark the introduction of Symbiq into the region as well. We were very pleased to have recently signed the first contract for Symbiq in a large hospital in Queensland, Australia.Next moving to the Americas. Before discussing the overall guidance for the region, I'd like to walk you through our MMS and SIP product categories, starting with MMS. Then I will touch on the impact of the disposals primarily to the other device and other pharma product lines followed by a discussion of SIP and the impact of the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the United States and its impact on the SIP business.In MMS, assuming continued constrained hospital capital spending environment, we're anticipating limited growth for devices. However, on the new product front, we are planning a limited rollout of our integrated Symbiq and EndoTool platform, which was recently submitted to FDA for approval. We will also receive a full year benefit from TheraDoc sales, our recently acquired clinical decision support platform and applications. So that growth in America's MMS is expected to be in the 5% to 7% range. Regarding the asset disposal impact, it was close to 2% of total Americas net sales in 2009, affecting both the other pharma and other device product lines. Moving now to Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals in the Americas. We expect to see 5% to 7% growth in the base business as we continue to grow faster than the overall market. We're planning to launch two beta-lactam products, imipenem and meropenem in 2010, which are partnered products with Orchid and have a combined 2008 local branded market value of approximately $400 million. We also anticipate building momentum in 2010 for the new high-dose presentations of heparin that we launched in 2009. However, the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the U.S. that we've assumed in our plan will more than offset our expected total growth. As the early benefit we saw with our 2009 launch will face increased competition and price erosion in 2010. Therefore, after factoring in the projected decline in sales of oxaliplatin, which we assumed in our plan, we expect that SIP sales in the Americas are expected to actually show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. Note, we haven't included generics, Zosyn, docetaxel or gemcitabine in our guidance for Americas SIP sales in 2010.So to summarize for the Americas, excluding the impacts of the asset disposals and the projected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales, total net sales in the Americas are expected to increase 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. But after factoring in the asset disposal and oxaliplatin impacts, 2010 total net sales in the Americas are expected to show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. To give you an idea of how that complex discussion impacts our total global revenue growth, excluding the impact of the disposals and year-over-year expected change in oxaliplatin, again this is excluding, we expect sales on a constant currency basis to increase by 6% to 8% or 7% to 9% including the impact of foreign currency. However, after factoring in the disposals and the projected oxaliplatin impact, we expect that reported constant currency sales will be fairly flat with 2009 but slightly up after including the expected impact of foreign currency. I know that's a little bit complex and should you have questions, I'm sure we'll be glad to deal with them in the Q&A session following our prepared comments.  In terms of calendarization for the total company, quarterly sales in 2010 should be similar in pattern to what we saw in 2009 relative to total year sales. Although the ramp up will be a bit flatter than in 2009, with first half 2010 sales representing a slightly higher percentage of full year sales than in 2009. Next, I'd like to run you through how we see the rest of the income statement, as well as cash flow shaping up for 2010. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we made significant progress with Project Fuel in 2009, and the savings associated with the project contributed a fairly equal amount to cost of goods sold and SG&A. In 2010, however, we expect the lions share of the savings from Project Fuel to favorably impact cost of goods sold and therefore, gross margin, helping along with better product mix and manufacturing performance to drive our adjusted gross margins to between 42% and 43%, a 250 basis point improvement over last year. As you recall, when we announced Project Fuel almost a year ago, we committed that when the project was completed in 2011 that we expected the gross margins would progress into the low 40% range. As you can see from our guidance, we're expecting to track way ahead with our progress. This allows us to take R&D spending up by approximately 80 to 100 basis points in 2010, while still on track to meet our 2010 commitment of $70 million to $80 million in pretax savings from Project Fuel. SG&A expense is expected to remain relatively flat as savings from Project Fuel, primarily in administrators spending are offset by additional sales and marketing expense related to new product launches and strong performance by Precedex. We expect to attain adjusted operating margins of 20% to 21% in 2010, a 100 to 200 basis point improvement over 2009. Now below the operating line, we're forecasting adjusted net interest and other non-operating items in aggregate to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. We're currently estimating the adjusted tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23% due to a shift in the mix of earnings versus 2009, as well as the expiration of the R&D tax credit.Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be $166 million in the year. As a point of reference, the collective impact on EPS of our higher tax rate, higher share count, lower interest expense and greater interest income is $0.13 per share or about four percentage points of negative impact on EPS. The disposals and the expected lower oxaliplatin sales this year will also have a drag on our bottom line. But we're still projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35, which when excluding the impact of the disposals and oxaliplatin represents significant earnings growth, exceeding for 2010 our long-term goals and demonstrating a much improved profile, one that better positions us to invest for the future. The adjusted earnings exclude the charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, as well as the intangibles amortization associated with the Mayne acquisition and any one-time charges related to Project Fuel.In terms of calendarization, quarterly EPS in 2010 is expected to follow a very similar pattern to 2009 with first and second half EPS representing similar portions relative to full year EPS. Gross margin should be stronger in the back half of the year as Project Fuel savings accelerate, and operating margins are expected to progress gradually each quarter. We estimate cash flow from operations for 2010 to be between $600 million and $650 million. The decrease relative to 2009 due primarily to the estimated timing of oxaliplatin sales from the wholesaler to the end user. We expect to see a year-over-year decline in cash flow from operations as the charge backs and rebates accrued at the end of last year are paid out this year.Capital spending is projected to range between $195 million and $215 million primarily related to IT projects associated with Project Fuel, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be $235 million to $245 million. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris for some final comments."

So you'll see an uptick in capital spending. But in terms of operating cash flow, it's down about $300 million. Net income year-over-year, when you sort through all one timers and whatnot, it should add about $40 million to $50 million. So basically, there's three components. The lion's share of it, I'd say 80% of the delta year-over-year is this chargeback in rebate impact of oxaliplatin. So we sold the product in the back part of 2009 but we're just continuing to pay the charge backs and rebates into 2010. So you get a complete reversal. So the number sort of has 2x impact. The positive impact in 2009 completely reversing into 2010, based on the assumptions we've made. So that's most of it and then there'll be some slight increases in inventory and receivables given the mix of sales growth outside the U.S., where DSO is a little bit higher. So it's pretty much if you wanted to pin it down to one thing, it's really the impact of oxaliplatin and sort of the reversal of fortune there with respect to the cash involves with charge backs and rebates."

And then we believe, we've hit it right in the middle of the fairway, once I go through the upside and downside, I think you'll feel the same way. So let me go through that. From an upside standpoint, we believe potential upside would be greater than expected benefit from Project Fuel. And as you were just stating and as we made an operating comments, another potential upside will be the positive developments related to those litigation in the U.S. I will remind, though, everyone that if you look at the patent and you look at pediatric exclusivity, we're talking about being on the market for approximately a month or a month and a half if, everything were to go well. And so, that's a potential upside and as the year unfolds, we'll continue to monitor the litigation status and if appropriate, get ready for a launch. But clearly, right now, that does not make sense to put into our guidance. And then FDA approval, we're assuming no approval. And so, if we ended up with approval, that's an upside. From what we're hearing right now, it's very difficult for us to peg when that might occur. We tried pegging it probably for the past two years actually and have been wrong with all of our assumptions. So we believe it's best to not have it in there. There are product mix that will be in the upside as well. As we already covered, Orchid and not from an EPS standpoint because we said Orchid would be neutral in 2010, but it would have a revenue uptick. Just to refresh what I said earlier on an annual basis, the revenue approximately $110 million on an annual basis. And then faster than expected recovery from hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010 would have a positive impact on MMS. And so that's another upside as you look at how we forecast it. Now going through the downsides, we've done as an organization a great job of implementing Project Fuel. The numbers get bigger in 2010. And so, if we were not able to execute Project Fuel exactly as we have it laid out, that obviously is the downside, and the numbers are bigger in 2010 than they are in 2009. The further increases in unemployment loss healthcare coverage. We're beginning to see in this country of flattening all the job loss year-to-year. It's not totally flat. But we're seeing its improving and that needs to continue. But the longer people are without jobs, the coverage et cetera disappears. And so that's a potential downside. And then any of the new products that we have in our forecast that Terry recovered from an SIP standpoint and MMS standpoint, if we ended up having delays from the regulatory approval standpoint, that would negatively impact our revenue and our profit. Then the final one, I'm going to give little bit color on this one is the uncertainty around healthcare reform and particularly for 2010 as it relates to the cost side. And have in nothing from the increased tax rebate or filing fee standpoint. And as you recall, one of the things that was heavily talked about in the House bill was the tax from a device standpoint. If healthcare reform gets through and there is a tax from the device standpoint and if it were to get implemented in 2010. If it were to get implemented, the way it's been talked about our second House bill, that's an impact from the negative standpoint of anywhere between approximately $0.07 to $0.10 of EPS on an annual basis. There is in both bills, pharmaceutical rebates and in the most recent budget that President Obama has taken forward, there is talk about generic drug filing fees, which we haven't contemplated and don't have to contemplate what that cost would be. And so, we take all those pluses and minuses and I think from what we know today, we've had this forecast in guidance pretty much in the middle of the fairway."

And we've had both solution providers, as well as providers so there's a number of forms that will compete against each other. So we do expect in our forecast would call for increased competition, as well as increased price erosion to a point where we believe that towards through the year, we're going to start to see typical pricing that we see in any other generic launch this marketplace. So fairly aggressive price erosion through the year."

And we were presently surprised in 2009 because we had called for placements that down year-on-year. Then again, we were surprised by actually relatively flat places but we're calling for the same outcome in 2010. And I recognize that there's been a lot of people quoting some upticks in various financial metrics for hospitals and so forth and so on. Our take is that although there are positive indicators, for the most part, it's only very pre-conservative. And it relates back to what we saw in 2009 were there still delays in decision and some deferrals of decision. I think hospital CEO and CFOs and the like would like to going to see a trend in data points to get confident that purchase decision. So that's really our thinking. As was mentioned, an upside to be those data points still stay robust to the first half of the year. Maybe it will lose a little bit. But again, I think we have it fairly well called because we really see a whole lot of change in the economic environment for hospitals at least early in 2010 period of time."

And obviously, we will do anything we can to help assist the FDA from a question standpoint and information standpoint and also ease of the submission, eligibility and ability to read it.

It would be hard obviously to forecast any type of increase because we never know when someone is going to end up having a supply issue. And then on Lovenox is not in our forecast. We've got quite a bit of additional work that we need to do. And so it's very appropriate not to have it in our forecast in the near term this year.

We made substantial progress in our business, including advancing our biogenerics program and launching our first major Paragraph IV drug in the U.S., oxaliplatin solution. We kicked off Project Fuel, a corporate-wide optimization initiative to drive long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value, and we met the commitment we set forth for 2009.Financially, net sales of $3.9 billion represented an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Driving these results was stellar growth in our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical product line. Adjusted gross margin reached 40%. Adjusted operating margin increased by more than 100 basis points, and we generated healthy cash flow from operations of $945 million. Despite the pressures of the global economic recession and several disposals of non-strategic assets, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 23% to $3.11.We are on our way to achieving our ultimate goal of becoming a consistent top-quartile performer and are excited about the prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. In the fourth quarter, we once again exceeded the $1 billion mark in net sales, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 represented growth of 12% over fourth quarter 2008 EPS of $0.78. Driving our net sales growth was strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals, primarily the result of our third quarter U.S. launch of oxaliplatin and strong demand for Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent.Our laser focus on advancing the business resulted in many significant achievements in 2009. We were the first market entrant with the generic solution presentation of oxaliplatin in the U.S. As a result of our flawless execution, we captured a significant share of the market for this very large drug and experienced exceptionally high levels of demand for our product. We announced our intent to acquire the generic injectable pharmaceutical asset of Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, a leading Indian injectable manufacturer and developer of beta-lactams. Through this transaction, we fulfill a key capability gap in our SIP portfolio and establish a direct presence in India providing a platform for future growth.We launched six new high dosage presentations of therapeutic heparin in single and multi-dose vials, expanding our portfolio and helping to meet an important need for our customers. We received European marketing authorization for the launch of generic docetaxel, a major drug used in the treatment of various cancers. The drug had branded sales in Europe in 2008 of approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to launch docetaxel across most of Europe by the end of 2010.We also continued our successful roll outs of several drugs in EMEA and Asia Pac, including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam and we launched a total of 23 compounds already in the market in new countries around the world during the year. Our biogenerics program continues to progress as well. We gained momentum with Retacrit, our biogeneric erythropoietin. Retacrit is currently available in 16 countries throughout Europe and has captured more than 40% of the short-acting biogeneric EPO market in the region. We acquired from PLIVA worldwide rights to a biogeneric version of filgrastim and an affiliated manufacturing facility in Croatia. This gives us development and manufacturing capabilities for our  filgrastim and pegfilgrastim pipeline products as well as potential future by biogenerics.We finalized an agreement with Celltrion, a South Korea-based pharmaceutical company, which strengthens our presence in the global biogeneric market. With the addition of five new biogeneric drugs from the agreement, the number of compounds in our biogenerics pipeline has almost doubled to 11, giving us one of the largest pipeline in the industry with the local branded value of $34 billion.In Medication Management Systems, our other strategic product line, we acquired TheraDoc, the gold standard in enterprise-wide clinical surveillance and decision support. Through this acquisition, we are advancing the quality and safety of patient care through sophisticated technology used to monitor hospital-acquired infections.We extended Hospira's portfolio of MMS products with the introduction in the Middle East of Plum A+ with MedNet safety software. This marks the first time Middle East healthcare facilities can access these types of advanced integrated technologies from one company. We also launched our first Symbiq device in Canada. In our EMEA region, we signed a 10-year contract with the Royal Marsden Hospital National Health Service Trust in the U.K. to be its provider of aseptic compounding services. This is the largest outsourced compounding contract awarded by Royal Marsden and builds on the compounding capabilities we acquired with Mayne Pharma.In Asia Pac, we established a direct presence in Seoul, South Korea focus primarily on distribution of our oncology portfolio. This brings our direct sales presence to nine markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We received a credit rating upgrade from both Standard & Poor's rating service and Moody's Investors Service. Standard & Poor's upgraded our rating from BBB to BBB+ and Moody's from Baa3 negative to Baa3 stable. We reduced our debt by approximately $425 million during the year, including an early pay down of $370 million of debt that was due in March of 2010. Last, but certainly not least, we introduced and made significant progress on Project Fuel. With regards to optimizing our product line, we have identified approximately 55% of our original 7,000-plus SKUs or list numbers that can be eliminated over time. To date, we have eliminated more than 35% of the total SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced on our last quarterly earnings call. We also continued to progress in streamlining our organizational structure. Of the targeted 1,400 to 1,500 physician reduction goal, we have notified approximately 75% of the people whose positions are being eliminated.In the area of evaluating non-strategic assets, we made several asset disposals, including the sale of two product lines, our critical care products to ICU Medical and our brain function monitoring products to SEDLine, a sub of Masimo and the sale of two contract manufacturing facilities, our Salisbury, Australia manufacturing facility to HalcyGenPharmaceuticals and most recently, our Wasserburg, Germany manufacturing to Recipharm AB. Both of these facilities came with our acquisition of Mayne in 2007. These asset disposals advance our efforts to simplify our product line and focus on our key strategic areas, better enabling us to drive future growth.We have met our Project Fuel commitments in 2009, aggressively driving transformation throughout the organization, and building momentum going into 2010. In procurement, we pursued over 150 strategic sourcing programs to identify best cost suppliers and lower total cost of ownership. In finance, we redesigned our annual plan process, saving 100 of employees' hours, improving the quality of the process. In sales and marketing, we developed a go to market strategy to improve the effectiveness of our U.S. sales force through focused and alignment to our key strategic growth areas SIP and MMS. In R&D, we enhanced the milestone review process for new development programs to streamline the process, lower risk and improve the predictability of success. And in IT, we established strategic outsourcing partnerships to provide greater oversight and maximize the value attained from our global IT service providers.Efforts such as these will optimize our productivity and allow us to free up additional funds for investment in our business, driving even better execution of our longer-term financial targets and business goals. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Terry for more details on sales for the quarter. Terry?"

I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompany",1256,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. Global net sales grew 11% in the quarter, and 9% for the full year, exceeding our most recent annual guidance of 5% to 7% growth. Both of our key strategic areas, SIP and MMS, performed well across all three segments: The Americas, EMEA and APAC. I'll now discuss results by product line for each segment, focusing most of my remarks on the results for the quarter.Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical net sales in the Americas were up over 25% in the quarter, and more than 20% for the full year, primarily attributable to greater-than-anticipated performance in oxaliplatin and strength in Precedex. Regarding oxaliplatin, the fourth quarter performance for the drug was impacted by two major factors. The first, which accounted for nearly 75% of the drug results, related to the difference between the estimated and actual charge back amounts as a result of stronger than anticipated end user pricing. As a point of reference, the charge-back provision is the difference between the amount we charge wholesalers and the amount end-user customers pay at the time of purchase.Secondly, we had anticipated that given the exceptionally high level of wholesaler demand right of the gate, fourth quarter sales were accelerated into the third quarter. Thus, we projected little if no sales of the drug for the fourth quarter. However, given the limited amount of actual competitors during the quarter, price erosion was less than expected and additional demand for the drug drove incremental oxaliplatin sales in the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors contributed to the fourth quarter's positive oxaliplatin performance.In addition to oxaliplatin, Precedex performed extremely well. Precedex had a very strong year enhanced by several factors, including the efforts of our expanded sales force, positive response to the expanded label for the procedural indication and the article in JAMA early in 2009. This popular sedation agent exceeded annual global revenues of $100 million this quarter, much earlier than anticipated. Heparin also contributed to the positive quarter's SIP performance as a result of strong demand for our new high dosage presentation that we recently launched. We are pleased that we're able to address this substantial market need, and believe we'll continue to gain momentum for the products throughout the course of 2010.Moving to EMEA, net sales of Specialty Injectables in the European region increased 10% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Driving the quarter's positive results was strong demand for several new product launch molecules including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Momentum for Retacrit continues to build. We ended the year with strong top and bottom line performance, achieving our breakeven goal for the biogeneric. We continue to gain market share with our share of the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe surpassing 40%. Net sales of Specialty Injectables of APAC increased 1% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Driving the growth was the ongoing strength in proprietary pharmaceuticals in Australia as well as strength in Precedex across the region. Our launch of gemcitabine in Australia in the first half of the year has exceeded our expectation as we have captured the largest unit market share of this important generic chemotherapy agent. We are continuing to roll the drug out to additional countries in this region in 2010.Moving now to devices, net sales of Global Medication Management systems increased more than 5% in the quarter and more than 2% for the full year with positive contributions from all three regions. And despite continued hospital capital spending constraints, we recorded an increase in our overall pump placements contributing to a year-over-year growth of 8% in our global install base.In the Americas, net MMS sales increased over 3% in the quarter and 1% for the full year. Both our Plum and Symbiq devices performed favorably in the quarter. Several strategic orders that we have been cultivating throughout the year shipped in the fourth quarter contributing to the strong year end performance. We also believe that our broad product portfolio continues to be a significant advantage in today's market.You may recall that at the beginning of the year, we had anticipated that placements would be down as a result of the constrained capital spending environment. While placements for large volume infusion devices were up slightly year-over-year, we saw a shift towards a lower-priced Plum pumps versus Symbiq. Price-sensitive consumers can purchase our traditional Plum device today and with the interoperability of our MedNet safety software, they can easily upgrade to our higher technology Symbiq device in the future.For the Symbiq devices that we are placing, we continued to see strong competitive captures with over 80% of our Symbiq placements for the year coming from competitive accounts. In EMEA, MMS net sales increased 19% during the quarter and 9% for the full year due to favorable performance in both our Plum and GemStar devices and dedicated set sales. Growth during the quarter was aided by our recent tender award for Plum A+ with MedNet in a key hospital account in Saudi Arabia. MMS net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 25% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. Strong pump and set growth for GemStar drove both the quarter and full year results with Plum A+ also contributing to performance. In addition, the fourth quarter achieved a significant milestone with the introduction of GemStar and Plum A+ into the Japanese market. The initial response has been very positive, particularly for GemStar. We expect adoption of our MMS platform to continue in 2010 not only in Japan but in China and Australia as well, all key countries in the region. Before turning the call over to Tom, I'll provide an update on our drug pipelines, which we do an annual basis during this call. At December 31, 2009, our small molecule pipeline totaled 39 compounds, which represents a total 65 regional launches including 30 in the United States. The global branded market value of a small molecule pipeline is approximately $15 billion. Of the pipelines compounds, currently 21 have been submitted for approval in one or more regulatory agencies. The local market value of the filed compounds is approximately $7.9 billion. Of that dollar value, roughly 50% relates to compounds where we are currently challenging the patents or where there is some uncertainty associated with launch timing.In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly 45% of the total pipeline compounds are related to oncology and beta-lactams. These reflects the investments we have been making through acquisitions to become fundamental in these two important areas. Relative to launch timing, approximately 18 drugs are expected to launch in various regions over 2010 and 2011 with the split between the two years roughly equivalent. As was the case last year, our launches in 2010 and 2011 combined larger drugs with significant potential and smaller drugs that helped drive growth and scale.Regarding our biogenerics pipeline, as Chris mentioned, with the addition of five new biogenerics drug with the agreement with Celltrion, our biogenerics pipeline now has 11 compounds. One of the largest pipelines in the industry with a local branded value of $34 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for a review of the rest of our financial results and guidance for 2010.

First, I'll take you through the details on our Q4 and 2009 financial results and then we'll move to guidance.Adjusted gross margin was 40.5% in the fourth quarter. More favorable product mix and improvements resulting from the company's Project Fuel optimization initiatives were somewhat offset by costs related to product-corrective actions, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted gross margin of 40% represented a 70 basis point improvement over full year 2008. R&D expense in the quarter was $80 million, up from $53 million in the first quarter of 2008. For the full year, R&D increased 14% to $241 million. The increase for both the quarter and the full year was primarily related to our investment in various new product development programs in both SIP and MMS product lines, as well as the upfront payments to ChemGenex and the impact of foreign exchange.SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $165 million, up 18% from $139 million for the same period last year mainly a function of legal costs, the timing of expenses, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these factors were our Project Fuel cost-reduction efforts. For the full year, SG&A was $619 million, up 5% from the $590 million in 2008. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $204 million versus $188 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 19%, up 120 basis points versus last year's 17.8%. Interest expense decreased 10% for the quarter, 9% for the full year primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate notes, as well as lower debt levels.Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis for the full year was 20.3%, nearly four percentage points lower than our 2008 adjusted effective tax rate. Driving the majority of 2009's lower rate were various tax benefits recognized throughout the course of 2009. Moving to our EPS performance. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% in the fourth quarter to $0.87 compared to $0.78 last year. As was the case with the third quarter, when we increased our guidance by $0.10, most of the EPS favorability this quarter relative to consensus was due to oxaliplatin. Full year 2009 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.11 per share, an increase of 23% over 2008. Several charges were excluded from our adjusted EPS namely, Project Fuel charges, including project-related impairment and other asset charges of $0.12 a share in the quarter and $0.69 a share for the full year.  Next, charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, which totaled $0.03 per share in the quarter or $0.12 for the full year. Next, intangible amortization related to the Mayne Pharma acquisition totaled $0.07 per share in the quarter or $0.23 for the full year. Also, a research and development milestone payment for omacetaxine which totaled $0.07 per share for both the quarter and the full year.  In addition, the full year EPS excludes $0.10 per share related to the impairment of marketable equity securities and a $0.57 per share benefit related to the resolution of various IRS tax audits. In aggregate, these items totaled $0.29 for the quarter and $0.64 for the full year. Next, turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $404 million, a 58% improvement over last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $945 million compared to $584 million in 2008, driven primarily by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items as well as the timing of cash flows associated with the launch of generic oxaliplatin and some other favorable changes in working capital.At December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $946 million compared to $921 million at September 30, 2009 and $484 million at the end of last year. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures also improved for the year. Free cash flow as a percent of sales was 20% in 2009 versus 12% in 2008. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $41 million versus $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, capital spending totaled $159 million, down from $164 million in 2008. The decrease mostly reflects lower spending in 2009 versus 2008 related to our facilities optimization initiatives, and spending restrictions we put in place in late 2008.Depreciation and amortization were $58 million in the quarter compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization totaled $230 million, including $62 million of intangibles amortization. This compares to depreciation and amortization of $252 million in 2008. Now from a liquidity perspective, as of year-end 2009, we had paid down a cumulative total of approximately $925 million of debt since we began paying down Mayne-related acquisition debt in 2007, a net of $425 million of which we paid in 2009. The net $425 million of debt we paid down in 2009 included an early redemption on our $375 million notes that were due in March of 2010. Our next scheduled debt payment is not due until 2012.Also, the net $425 million debt pay down also factored in the $250 million six-year notes we issued in 2009, which were priced with a coupon of 6.4%. So in addition to cash on hand, we also have a committed bank revolver of $700 million upon which to draw. So combined with our year-end cash balance of $946 million, this gives us access if needed to approximately $1.6 billion in liquidity to meet our future needs.Next, I'd like to turn to our guidance for 2010. As Chris and Terry have both stated, we made major strides in 2009 to transform and redefine our business through the various programs of Project Fuel, including the non-strategic asset disposals we mentioned. But we're excited that the guidance we'll be providing will show that we expect to be achieving our Project Fuel-related goals of the low 40%s for adjusted gross margin, and the low 20%s for the adjusted operating margin goal, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The impact of the asset disposals, however, plus the projected decline in U.S. oxaliplatin sales will make for some difficult and potentially confusing year-over-year comparisons. Now underlying our guidance for 2010 is expected growth in our base businesses, the impact of expected new product launches, continued progress on Project Fuel, a heavier investment in R&D funded by better-than-expected savings from Project Fuel, as well as the impact of any disposals or acquisitions of businesses that were completed by January 31 of this year. Specifically, guidance will reflect the disposals of both the Salisbury and Wasserburg contract manufacturing facilities, the disposal of the critical care product line and the acquisition of TheraDoc. Globally, the disposals accounted for $134 million in 2009 sales. That's $134 million and about $0.10 in EPS. The sales were mostly recorded in our other pharma and other device product lines in each of our three geographic regions, with a more pronounced impact of these disposals on a percentage basis outside the U.S. TheraDoc sales in 2009 were not significant.One other item, the acquisition of Orchid's injectable business, which is expected to close later this quarter is not included in our guidance. Also excluded from the guidance is any impact from the proposed United States healthcare reform given the current uncertainty of the reform's outcome.So in the interest of transparency as well as ease of comparability, our revenue guidance will have statements relative to expected year-over-year growth both with and without the impact of the disposals that have been completed. But all comments will be on a constant currency basis unless we note otherwise. Significant expected new product launches will be discussed by region, as well the expected year-over-year decline in the United States relative to our 2009 launch of oxaliplatin. Given the complexity of the oxaliplatin discussion, we will start our guidance by segment with EMEA then move to APAC and conclude with the Americas. So starting with EMEA. Sales in EMEA, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 17% and 19%. However, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the region by almost 10 full percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 7% and 9%.Topline growth in the region is highly dependent on a robust new product pipeline. Investments we have made over the last couple of years to expand our pipeline are coming to fruition in 2010. We're particularly excited about the prospects for docetaxel. We expect to launch this major chemotherapy agent across most of Europe throughout the year with the five major European countries in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, we'll be launching two other important oncology products in the region. Mid-year, we plan to launch filgrastim, our second biogeneric used for the treatment of low white blood cells in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Then toward the end of the year, we expect to launch omacetaxine, a proprietary cytotoxic and oncology pharmaceutical product used in the treatment of leukemia, which we in license from ChemGenex in 2009.These products will add to our strong oncology portfolio and will augment our presence in hematology, as well as leverage the expertise and customer relationships of the biogenerics sales force we put in place in EMEA for Retacrit. We also expect our 2009 launches, including gemcitabine,  Piperacillin/Tazobactam to contribute to EMEA results for the year, and we anticipate continued growth of both sales and market share for Retacrit as it gains further acceptance and as we obtain approval for our subcutaneous renal indication this year. For MMS, we anticipate a milestone for MedNet in the region, with the expected introduction of the first language translation of Hospira MedNet into Spanish. We are also promoting our MMS portfolio aggressively in the Middle East, a growing market and one which values the medication safety features of our smart infusion systems.Next moving to APAC. Sales in APAC, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 13% and 15%. As with EMEA, however, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the APAC region by almost 11 percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 2% and 4%. We expect the trends driving the region's positive growth in 2009 will continue throughout 2010. On the pharma side, our specialty proprietary products in Australia particularly the oncology drugs, are expected to be drivers of growth as well as Precedex, which we expect to be a driver across the region. We're also excited about the anticipated approval and launch of Precedex in Korea later this year. And in Australia, we expect approval and launch of filgrastim in the second half of the year. This will mark the first launch of a biogeneric in APAC, expanding our biogenerics commercialization to two of the company's three regions. On the device side, we expect another good year in the region in 2010 with continued strength in GemStar and Plum in our major markets including Australia, Japan and Korea. 2010 will mark the introduction of Symbiq into the region as well. We were very pleased to have recently signed the first contract for Symbiq in a large hospital in Queensland, Australia.Next moving to the Americas. Now before discussing the overall guidance for the region, I'd like to walk you through our MMS and SIP product categories, starting with MMS. Then I will touch on the impact of the disposals primarily to the other device and other pharma product lines, followed by a discussion of SIP and the impact of the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the United States and its impact on the SIP business.In MMS, assuming continued constrained hospital capital spending environment, we're anticipating limited growth for devices. However, on the new product front, we are planning a limited rollout of our integrated Symbiq and EndoTool platform, which was recently submitted to FDA for approval. We will also receive a full year benefit from TheraDoc sales, our recently acquired clinical decision support platform and applications. So that growth in America's MMS is expected to be in the 5% to 7% range. Regarding the asset disposal impact, it was close to 2% of total Americas net sales in 2009, affecting both the other pharma and other device product lines. Moving now to Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals in the Americas. We expect to see 5% to 7% growth in the base business as we continue to grow faster than the overall market. We're planning to launch two beta-lactam products, imipenem and meropenem in 2010, which are partnered products with Orchid and have a combined 2008 local branded market value of approximately $400 million. We also anticipate building momentum in 2010 for the new high-dose presentations of heparin that we launched in 2009. However, the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the U.S. that we've assumed in our plan will more than offset our expected total growth. As the early benefit we saw with our 2009 launch will face increased competition and price erosion in 2010. Therefore, after factoring in the projected decline in sales of oxaliplatin, which we assumed in our plan, we expect that SIP sales in the Americas are expected to actually show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. Note, we haven't included generics, Zosyn, docetaxel or gemcitabine in our guidance for Americas SIP sales in 2010.So to summarize for the Americas, excluding the impacts of the asset disposals and the projected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales, total net sales in the Americas are expected to increase 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. But after factoring in the asset disposal and oxaliplatin impacts, 2010 total net sales in the Americas are expected to show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. To give you an idea of how that complex discussion impacts our total global revenue growth, excluding the impact of the disposals and year-over-year expected change in oxaliplatin, again this is excluding, we expect sales on a constant currency basis to increase by 6% to 8% or 7% to 9% including the impact of foreign currency. However, after factoring in the disposals and the projected oxaliplatin impact, we expect that reported constant currency sales will be fairly flat with 2009 but slightly up after including the expected impact of foreign currency. I know that's a little bit complex and should you have questions, I'm sure we'll be glad to deal with them in the Q&A session following our prepared comments.  In terms of calendarization for the total company, quarterly sales in 2010 should be similar in pattern to what we saw in 2009 relative to total year sales. Although the ramp up will be a bit flatter than in 2009, with first half 2010 sales representing a slightly higher percentage of full year sales than in 2009. Next, I'd like to run you through how we see the rest of the income statement, as well as cash flow shaping up for 2010. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we made significant progress with Project Fuel in 2009, and the savings associated with the project contributed a fairly equal amount to cost of goods sold and SG&A. In 2010, however, we expect the lions share of the savings from Project Fuel to favorably impact cost of goods sold and therefore, gross margin, helping along with better product mix and manufacturing performance to drive our adjusted gross margins to between 42% and 43%, a 250 basis point improvement over last year. As you recall, when we announced Project Fuel almost a year ago, we committed that when the project was completed in 2011 that we expected the gross margins would progress into the low 40% range. As you can see from our guidance, we're expecting to track way ahead with our progress. This allows us to take R&D spending up by approximately 80 to 100 basis points in 2010, while still on track to meet our 2010 commitment of $70 million to $80 million in pretax savings from Project Fuel. SG&A expense is expected to remain relatively flat as savings from Project Fuel, primarily in administrators spending are offset by additional sales and marketing expense related to new product launches and strong performance by Precedex. We expect to attain adjusted operating margins of 20% to 21% in 2010, a 100 to 200 basis point improvement over 2009. Now below the operating line, we're forecasting adjusted net interest and other non-operating items in aggregate to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. We're currently estimating the adjusted tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23% due to a shift in the mix of earnings versus 2009, as well as the expiration of the R&D tax credit.Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be $166 million in the year. As a point of reference, the collective impact on EPS of our higher tax rate, higher share count, lower interest expense and greater interest income is $0.13 per share or about four percentage points of negative impact on EPS. The disposals and the expected lower oxaliplatin sales this year will also have a drag on our bottom line. But we're still projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35, which when excluding the impact of the disposals and oxaliplatin represents significant earnings growth, exceeding for 2010 our long-term goals and demonstrating a much improved profile, one that better positions us to invest for the future. The adjusted earnings exclude the charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, as well as the intangibles amortization associated with the Mayne acquisition and any one-time charges related to Project Fuel.In terms of calendarization, quarterly EPS in 2010 is expected to follow a very similar pattern to 2009 with first and second half EPS representing similar portions relative to full year EPS. Gross margin should be stronger in the back half of the year as Project Fuel savings accelerate, and operating margins are expected to progress gradually each quarter. We estimate cash flow from operations for 2010 to be between $600 million and $650 million. The decrease relative to 2009 due primarily to the estimated timing of oxaliplatin sales from the wholesaler to the end user. We expect to see a year-over-year decline in cash flow from operations as the charge backs and rebates accrued at the end of last year are paid out this year.Capital spending is projected to range between $195 million and $215 million primarily related to IT projects associated with Project Fuel, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be $235 million to $245 million. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris for some final comments."

As we look at rates today, I looked at them this morning, we're pretty close with what we've assumed.

So you'll see an uptick in capital spending. But in terms of operating cash flow, it's down about $300 million. Net income year-over-year, when you sort through all one timers and whatnot, it should add about $40 million to $50 million. So basically, there's three components. The lion's share of it, I'd say 80% of the delta year-over-year is this chargeback in rebate impact of oxaliplatin. So we sold the product in the back part of 2009 but we're just continuing to pay the charge backs and rebates into 2010. So you get a complete reversal. So the number sort of has 2x impact. The positive impact in 2009 completely reversing into 2010, based on the assumptions we've made. So that's most of it and then there'll be some slight increases in inventory and receivables given the mix of sales growth outside the U.S., where DSO is a little bit higher. So it's pretty much if you wanted to pin it down to one thing, it's really the impact of oxaliplatin and sort of the reversal of fortune there with respect to the cash involves with charge backs and rebates."

Let me respond to that and I appreciate the statement you just made. But in that statement I think there's a question that I need to cover, and that is, is as we look at our 2010 guidance, what are the upsides and downsides to the 201",760,"Rick, this is Chris. Let me respond to that and I appreciate the statement you just made. But in that statement I think there's a question that I need to cover, and that is, is as we look at our 2010 guidance, what are the upsides and downsides to the 2010 guidance which I think could add additional color to the statement that you're making. And then we believe we've hit it right in the middle of the fairway, and I think once I go through the upsides and downsides, I think you'll feel the same way. So let me go through them. From an upside standpoint, we believe potential upside would be greater than expected benefit from Project Fuel. And as you were just stating, and as we made in our opening comments, another potential upside would be any positive developments related to docetaxel or gemcitabine litigation in the U.S. I will remind, though, everyone that if you look at the patent and you look at pediatric exclusivity, we're talking about being on the market for approximately a month or a month and a half, if everything were to go well. And so, that's a potential upside and as the year unfolds, we'll continue to monitor the litigation status and if appropriate, get ready for a launch. But clearly, right now, that does not make sense to put into our guidance. And then FDA approval of Zosyn, we're assuming no approval of Zosyn. And so if we ended up with an approval Zosyn, that's an upside. From what we're hearing right now, it's very difficult for us to peg when that might occur. We tried pegging it probably the past two years actually and have been wrong with all of our assumptions around Zosyn. And so we believe it's best to not have it in there. And then any better product mix that would be on the upside as well. As we already covered, Orchid and not from an EPS standpoint because we said Orchid would be neutral in 2010, but it would have a revenue uptick. And just to refresh what I said earlier on an annual basis, the revenue approximately $110 million on an annual basis. And then faster than expected recovery from hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010 would have a positive impact on MMS. And so that's another upside as you look at how we forecast it. Now going through the downsides, we've done as an organization a great job of implementing Project Fuel. The numbers get bigger in 2010. And so, if we were not able to execute Project Fuel exactly as we have it laid out, that obviously is the downside, and the numbers are bigger in 2010 than they are in 2009. The further increases in unemployment loss healthcare coverage. We're beginning to see in this country of flattening all the job loss year-to-year. It's not totally flat. But we're seeing its improving and that needs to continue. But the longer people are without jobs, the coverage et cetera disappears. And so that's a potential downside. And then any of the new products that we have in our forecast that Terry recovered from an SIP standpoint and MMS standpoint, if we ended up having delays from the regulatory approval standpoint, that would negatively impact our revenue and our profit. Then the final one, I'm going to give little bit color on this one is the uncertainty around healthcare reform and particularly for 2010 as it relates to the cost side. And have in nothing from the increased tax rebate or filing fee standpoint. And as you recall, one of the things that was heavily talked about in the House bill was the tax from a device standpoint. If healthcare reform gets through and there is a tax from the device standpoint and if it were to get implemented in 2010. If it were to get implemented, the way it's been talked about our second House bill, that's an impact from the negative standpoint of anywhere between approximately $0.07 to $0.10 of EPS on an annual basis. There is in both bills, pharmaceutical rebates and in the most recent budget that President Obama has taken forward, there is talk about generic drug filing fees, which we haven't contemplated and don't have to contemplate what that cost would be. And so, we take all those pluses and minuses and I think from what we know today, we've had this forecast in guidance pretty much in the middle of the fairway."

And we were presently surprised in 2009 because we had called for placements that down year-on-year.

And I recognize that there's been a lot of people quoting some upticks in various financial metrics for hospitals and so forth and so on. Our take is that although there are positive indicators, for the most part, it's only very pre-conservative. And it relates back to what we saw in 2009 were there still delays in decision and some deferrals of decision. I think hospital CEO and CFOs and the like would like to going to see a trend in data points to get confident that purchase decision. So that's really our thinking. As was mentioned, an upside to be those data points still stay robust to the first half of the year. Maybe it will lose a little bit. But again, I think we have it fairly well called because we really see a whole lot of change in the economic environment for hospitals at least early in 2010 period of time."

We made substantial progress in our business, including advancing our biogenerics program and launching our first major Paragraph IV drug in the U.S., oxaliplatin solution. We kicked off Project Fuel, a corporate-wide optimization initiative to drive long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value, and we met the commitment we set forth for 2009.Financially, net sales of $3.9 billion represented an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Driving these results was stellar growth in our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical product line. Adjusted gross margin reached 40%. Adjusted operating margin increased by more than 100 basis points, and we generated healthy cash flow from operations of $945 million. Despite the pressures of the global economic recession and several disposals of non-strategic assets, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 23% to $3.11.We are on our way to achieving our ultimate goal of becoming a consistent top-quartile performer and are excited about the prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. In the fourth quarter, we once again exceeded the $1 billion mark in net sales, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 represented growth of 12% over fourth quarter 2008 EPS of $0.78. Driving our net sales growth was strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals, primarily the result of our third quarter U.S. launch of oxaliplatin and strong demand for Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent.Our laser focus on advancing the business resulted in many significant achievements in 2009. We were the first market entrant with the generic solution presentation of oxaliplatin in the U.S. As a result of our flawless execution, we captured a significant share of the market for this very large drug and experienced exceptionally high levels of demand for our product. We announced our intent to acquire the generic injectable pharmaceutical asset of Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, a leading Indian injectable manufacturer and developer of beta-lactams. Through this transaction, we fulfill a key capability gap in our SIP portfolio and establish a direct presence in India providing a platform for future growth.We launched six new high dosage presentations of therapeutic heparin in single and multi-dose vials, expanding our portfolio and helping to meet an important need for our customers. We received European marketing authorization for the launch of generic docetaxel, a major drug used in the treatment of various cancers. The drug had branded sales in Europe in 2008 of approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to launch docetaxel across most of Europe by the end of 2010.We also continued our successful roll outs of several drugs in EMEA and Asia Pac, including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam and we launched a total of 23 compounds already in the market in new countries around the world during the year. Our biogenerics program continues to progress as well. We gained momentum with Retacrit, our biogeneric erythropoietin. Retacrit is currently available in 16 countries throughout Europe and has captured more than 40% of the short-acting biogeneric EPO market in the region. We acquired from PLIVA worldwide rights to a biogeneric version of filgrastim and an affiliated manufacturing facility in Croatia. This gives us development and manufacturing capabilities for our  filgrastim and pegfilgrastim pipeline products as well as potential future by biogenerics.We finalized an agreement with Celltrion, a South Korea-based pharmaceutical company, which strengthens our presence in the global biogeneric market. With the addition of five new biogeneric drugs from the agreement, the number of compounds in our biogenerics pipeline has almost doubled to 11, giving us one of the largest pipeline in the industry with the local branded value of $34 billion.In Medication Management Systems, our other strategic product line, we acquired TheraDoc, the gold standard in enterprise-wide clinical surveillance and decision support. Through this acquisition, we are advancing the quality and safety of patient care through sophisticated technology used to monitor hospital-acquired infections.We extended Hospira's portfolio of MMS products with the introduction in the Middle East of Plum A+ with MedNet safety software. This marks the first time Middle East healthcare facilities can access these types of advanced integrated technologies from one company. We also launched our first Symbiq device in Canada. In our EMEA region, we signed a 10-year contract with the Royal Marsden Hospital National Health Service Trust in the U.K. to be its provider of aseptic compounding services. This is the largest outsourced compounding contract awarded by Royal Marsden and builds on the compounding capabilities we acquired with Mayne Pharma.In Asia Pac, we established a direct presence in Seoul, South Korea focus primarily on distribution of our oncology portfolio. This brings our direct sales presence to nine markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We received a credit rating upgrade from both Standard & Poor's rating service and Moody's Investors Service. Standard & Poor's upgraded our rating from BBB to BBB+ and Moody's from Baa3 negative to Baa3 stable. We reduced our debt by approximately $425 million during the year, including an early pay down of $370 million of debt that was due in March of 2010. Last, but certainly not least, we introduced and made significant progress on Project Fuel. With regards to optimizing our product line, we have identified approximately 55% of our original 7,000-plus SKUs or list numbers that can be eliminated over time. To date, we have eliminated more than 35% of the total SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced on our last quarterly earnings call. We also continued to progress in streamlining our organizational structure. Of the targeted 1,400 to 1,500 physician reduction goal, we have notified approximately 75% of the people whose positions are being eliminated.In the area of evaluating non-strategic assets, we made several asset disposals, including the sale of two product lines, our critical care products to ICU Medical and our brain function monitoring products to SEDLine, a sub of Masimo and the sale of two contract manufacturing facilities, our Salisbury, Australia manufacturing facility to HalcyGenPharmaceuticals and most recently, our Wasserburg, Germany manufacturing to Recipharm AB. Both of these facilities came with our acquisition of Mayne in 2007. These asset disposals advance our efforts to simplify our product line and focus on our key strategic areas, better enabling us to drive future growth.We have met our Project Fuel commitments in 2009, aggressively driving transformation throughout the organization, and building momentum going into 2010. In procurement, we pursued over 150 strategic sourcing programs to identify best cost suppliers and lower total cost of ownership. In finance, we redesigned our annual plan process, saving 100 of employees' hours, improving the quality of the process. In sales and marketing, we developed a go to market strategy to improve the effectiveness of our U.S. sales force through focused and alignment to our key strategic growth areas SIP and MMS. In R&D, we enhanced the milestone review process for new development programs to streamline the process, lower risk and improve the predictability of success. And in IT, we established strategic outsourcing partnerships to provide greater oversight and maximize the value attained from our global IT service providers.Efforts such as these will optimize our productivity and allow us to free up additional funds for investment in our business, driving even better execution of our longer-term financial targets and business goals. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Terry for more details on sales for the quarter. Terry?"
9681063,83245995,55262,"Hospira Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompany",1256,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. Global net sales grew 11% in the quarter, and 9% for the full year, exceeding our most recent annual guidance of 5% to 7% growth. Both of our key strategic areas, SIP and MMS, performed well across all three segments: The Americas, EMEA and APAC. I'll now discuss results by product line for each segment, focusing most of my remarks on the results for the quarter.Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical net sales in the Americas were up over 25% in the quarter, and more than 20% for the full year, primarily attributable to greater-than-anticipated performance in oxaliplatin and strength in Precedex. Regarding oxaliplatin, the fourth quarter performance for the drug was impacted by two major factors. The first, which accounted for nearly 75% of the drug results, related to the difference between the estimated and actual charge back amounts as a result of stronger than anticipated end user pricing. As a point of reference, the charge-back provision is the difference between the amount we charge wholesalers and the amount end-user customers pay at the time of purchase.Secondly, we had anticipated that given the exceptionally high level of wholesaler demand right of the gate, fourth quarter sales were accelerated into the third quarter. Thus, we projected little if no sales of the drug for the fourth quarter. However, given the limited amount of actual competitors during the quarter, price erosion was less than expected and additional demand for the drug drove incremental oxaliplatin sales in the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors contributed to the fourth quarter's positive oxaliplatin performance.In addition to oxaliplatin, Precedex performed extremely well. Precedex had a very strong year enhanced by several factors, including the efforts of our expanded sales force, positive response to the expanded label for the procedural indication and the article in JAMA early in 2009. This popular sedation agent exceeded annual global revenues of $100 million this quarter, much earlier than anticipated. Heparin also contributed to the positive quarter's SIP performance as a result of strong demand for our new high dosage presentation that we recently launched. We are pleased that we're able to address this substantial market need, and believe we'll continue to gain momentum for the products throughout the course of 2010.Moving to EMEA, net sales of Specialty Injectables in the European region increased 10% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Driving the quarter's positive results was strong demand for several new product launch molecules including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Momentum for Retacrit continues to build. We ended the year with strong top and bottom line performance, achieving our breakeven goal for the biogeneric. We continue to gain market share with our share of the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe surpassing 40%. Net sales of Specialty Injectables of APAC increased 1% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Driving the growth was the ongoing strength in proprietary pharmaceuticals in Australia as well as strength in Precedex across the region. Our launch of gemcitabine in Australia in the first half of the year has exceeded our expectation as we have captured the largest unit market share of this important generic chemotherapy agent. We are continuing to roll the drug out to additional countries in this region in 2010.Moving now to devices, net sales of Global Medication Management systems increased more than 5% in the quarter and more than 2% for the full year with positive contributions from all three regions. And despite continued hospital capital spending constraints, we recorded an increase in our overall pump placements contributing to a year-over-year growth of 8% in our global install base.In the Americas, net MMS sales increased over 3% in the quarter and 1% for the full year. Both our Plum and Symbiq devices performed favorably in the quarter. Several strategic orders that we have been cultivating throughout the year shipped in the fourth quarter contributing to the strong year end performance. We also believe that our broad product portfolio continues to be a significant advantage in today's market.You may recall that at the beginning of the year, we had anticipated that placements would be down as a result of the constrained capital spending environment. While placements for large volume infusion devices were up slightly year-over-year, we saw a shift towards a lower-priced Plum pumps versus Symbiq. Price-sensitive consumers can purchase our traditional Plum device today and with the interoperability of our MedNet safety software, they can easily upgrade to our higher technology Symbiq device in the future.For the Symbiq devices that we are placing, we continued to see strong competitive captures with over 80% of our Symbiq placements for the year coming from competitive accounts. In EMEA, MMS net sales increased 19% during the quarter and 9% for the full year due to favorable performance in both our Plum and GemStar devices and dedicated set sales. Growth during the quarter was aided by our recent tender award for Plum A+ with MedNet in a key hospital account in Saudi Arabia. MMS net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 25% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. Strong pump and set growth for GemStar drove both the quarter and full year results with Plum A+ also contributing to performance. In addition, the fourth quarter achieved a significant milestone with the introduction of GemStar and Plum A+ into the Japanese market. The initial response has been very positive, particularly for GemStar. We expect adoption of our MMS platform to continue in 2010 not only in Japan but in China and Australia as well, all key countries in the region. Before turning the call over to Tom, I'll provide an update on our drug pipelines, which we do an annual basis during this call. At December 31, 2009, our small molecule pipeline totaled 39 compounds, which represents a total 65 regional launches including 30 in the United States. The global branded market value of a small molecule pipeline is approximately $15 billion. Of the pipelines compounds, currently 21 have been submitted for approval in one or more regulatory agencies. The local market value of the filed compounds is approximately $7.9 billion. Of that dollar value, roughly 50% relates to compounds where we are currently challenging the patents or where there is some uncertainty associated with launch timing.In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly 45% of the total pipeline compounds are related to oncology and beta-lactams. These reflects the investments we have been making through acquisitions to become fundamental in these two important areas. Relative to launch timing, approximately 18 drugs are expected to launch in various regions over 2010 and 2011 with the split between the two years roughly equivalent. As was the case last year, our launches in 2010 and 2011 combined larger drugs with significant potential and smaller drugs that helped drive growth and scale.Regarding our biogenerics pipeline, as Chris mentioned, with the addition of five new biogenerics drug with the agreement with Celltrion, our biogenerics pipeline now has 11 compounds. One of the largest pipelines in the industry with a local branded value of $34 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for a review of the rest of our financial results and guidance for 2010.

First, I'll take you through the details on our Q4 and 2009 financial results and then we'll move to guidance.Adjusted gross margin was 40.5% in the fourth quarter. More favorable product mix and improvements resulting from the company's Project Fuel optimization initiatives were somewhat offset by costs related to product-corrective actions, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted gross margin of 40% represented a 70 basis point improvement over full year 2008. R&D expense in the quarter was $80 million, up from $53 million in the first quarter of 2008. For the full year, R&D increased 14% to $241 million. The increase for both the quarter and the full year was primarily related to our investment in various new product development programs in both SIP and MMS product lines, as well as the upfront payments to ChemGenex and the impact of foreign exchange.SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $165 million, up 18% from $139 million for the same period last year mainly a function of legal costs, the timing of expenses, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these factors were our Project Fuel cost-reduction efforts. For the full year, SG&A was $619 million, up 5% from the $590 million in 2008. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $204 million versus $188 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 19%, up 120 basis points versus last year's 17.8%. Interest expense decreased 10% for the quarter, 9% for the full year primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate notes, as well as lower debt levels.Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis for the full year was 20.3%, nearly four percentage points lower than our 2008 adjusted effective tax rate. Driving the majority of 2009's lower rate were various tax benefits recognized throughout the course of 2009. Moving to our EPS performance. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% in the fourth quarter to $0.87 compared to $0.78 last year. As was the case with the third quarter, when we increased our guidance by $0.10, most of the EPS favorability this quarter relative to consensus was due to oxaliplatin. Full year 2009 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.11 per share, an increase of 23% over 2008. Several charges were excluded from our adjusted EPS namely, Project Fuel charges, including project-related impairment and other asset charges of $0.12 a share in the quarter and $0.69 a share for the full year.  Next, charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, which totaled $0.03 per share in the quarter or $0.12 for the full year. Next, intangible amortization related to the Mayne Pharma acquisition totaled $0.07 per share in the quarter or $0.23 for the full year. Also, a research and development milestone payment for omacetaxine which totaled $0.07 per share for both the quarter and the full year.  In addition, the full year EPS excludes $0.10 per share related to the impairment of marketable equity securities and a $0.57 per share benefit related to the resolution of various IRS tax audits. In aggregate, these items totaled $0.29 for the quarter and $0.64 for the full year. Next, turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $404 million, a 58% improvement over last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $945 million compared to $584 million in 2008, driven primarily by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items as well as the timing of cash flows associated with the launch of generic oxaliplatin and some other favorable changes in working capital.At December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $946 million compared to $921 million at September 30, 2009 and $484 million at the end of last year. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures also improved for the year. Free cash flow as a percent of sales was 20% in 2009 versus 12% in 2008. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $41 million versus $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, capital spending totaled $159 million, down from $164 million in 2008. The decrease mostly reflects lower spending in 2009 versus 2008 related to our facilities optimization initiatives, and spending restrictions we put in place in late 2008.Depreciation and amortization were $58 million in the quarter compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization totaled $230 million, including $62 million of intangibles amortization. This compares to depreciation and amortization of $252 million in 2008. Now from a liquidity perspective, as of year-end 2009, we had paid down a cumulative total of approximately $925 million of debt since we began paying down Mayne-related acquisition debt in 2007, a net of $425 million of which we paid in 2009. The net $425 million of debt we paid down in 2009 included an early redemption on our $375 million notes that were due in March of 2010. Our next scheduled debt payment is not due until 2012.Also, the net $425 million debt pay down also factored in the $250 million six-year notes we issued in 2009, which were priced with a coupon of 6.4%. So in addition to cash on hand, we also have a committed bank revolver of $700 million upon which to draw. So combined with our year-end cash balance of $946 million, this gives us access if needed to approximately $1.6 billion in liquidity to meet our future needs.Next, I'd like to turn to our guidance for 2010. As Chris and Terry have both stated, we made major strides in 2009 to transform and redefine our business through the various programs of Project Fuel, including the non-strategic asset disposals we mentioned. But we're excited that the guidance we'll be providing will show that we expect to be achieving our Project Fuel-related goals of the low 40%s for adjusted gross margin, and the low 20%s for the adjusted operating margin goal, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The impact of the asset disposals, however, plus the projected decline in U.S. oxaliplatin sales will make for some difficult and potentially confusing year-over-year comparisons. Now underlying our guidance for 2010 is expected growth in our base businesses, the impact of expected new product launches, continued progress on Project Fuel, a heavier investment in R&D funded by better-than-expected savings from Project Fuel, as well as the impact of any disposals or acquisitions of businesses that were completed by January 31 of this year. Specifically, guidance will reflect the disposals of both the Salisbury and Wasserburg contract manufacturing facilities, the disposal of the critical care product line and the acquisition of TheraDoc. Globally, the disposals accounted for $134 million in 2009 sales. That's $134 million and about $0.10 in EPS. The sales were mostly recorded in our other pharma and other device product lines in each of our three geographic regions, with a more pronounced impact of these disposals on a percentage basis outside the U.S. TheraDoc sales in 2009 were not significant.One other item, the acquisition of Orchid's injectable business, which is expected to close later this quarter is not included in our guidance. Also excluded from the guidance is any impact from the proposed United States healthcare reform given the current uncertainty of the reform's outcome.So in the interest of transparency as well as ease of comparability, our revenue guidance will have statements relative to expected year-over-year growth both with and without the impact of the disposals that have been completed. But all comments will be on a constant currency basis unless we note otherwise. Significant expected new product launches will be discussed by region, as well the expected year-over-year decline in the United States relative to our 2009 launch of oxaliplatin. Given the complexity of the oxaliplatin discussion, we will start our guidance by segment with EMEA then move to APAC and conclude with the Americas. So starting with EMEA. Sales in EMEA, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 17% and 19%. However, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the region by almost 10 full percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 7% and 9%.Topline growth in the region is highly dependent on a robust new product pipeline. Investments we have made over the last couple of years to expand our pipeline are coming to fruition in 2010. We're particularly excited about the prospects for docetaxel. We expect to launch this major chemotherapy agent across most of Europe throughout the year with the five major European countries in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, we'll be launching two other important oncology products in the region. Mid-year, we plan to launch filgrastim, our second biogeneric used for the treatment of low white blood cells in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Then toward the end of the year, we expect to launch omacetaxine, a proprietary cytotoxic and oncology pharmaceutical product used in the treatment of leukemia, which we in license from ChemGenex in 2009.These products will add to our strong oncology portfolio and will augment our presence in hematology, as well as leverage the expertise and customer relationships of the biogenerics sales force we put in place in EMEA for Retacrit. We also expect our 2009 launches, including gemcitabine,  Piperacillin/Tazobactam to contribute to EMEA results for the year, and we anticipate continued growth of both sales and market share for Retacrit as it gains further acceptance and as we obtain approval for our subcutaneous renal indication this year. For MMS, we anticipate a milestone for MedNet in the region, with the expected introduction of the first language translation of Hospira MedNet into Spanish. We are also promoting our MMS portfolio aggressively in the Middle East, a growing market and one which values the medication safety features of our smart infusion systems.Next moving to APAC. Sales in APAC, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 13% and 15%. As with EMEA, however, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the APAC region by almost 11 percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 2% and 4%. We expect the trends driving the region's positive growth in 2009 will continue throughout 2010. On the pharma side, our specialty proprietary products in Australia particularly the oncology drugs, are expected to be drivers of growth as well as Precedex, which we expect to be a driver across the region. We're also excited about the anticipated approval and launch of Precedex in Korea later this year. And in Australia, we expect approval and launch of filgrastim in the second half of the year. This will mark the first launch of a biogeneric in APAC, expanding our biogenerics commercialization to two of the company's three regions. On the device side, we expect another good year in the region in 2010 with continued strength in GemStar and Plum in our major markets including Australia, Japan and Korea. 2010 will mark the introduction of Symbiq into the region as well. We were very pleased to have recently signed the first contract for Symbiq in a large hospital in Queensland, Australia.Next moving to the Americas. Now before discussing the overall guidance for the region, I'd like to walk you through our MMS and SIP product categories, starting with MMS. Then I will touch on the impact of the disposals primarily to the other device and other pharma product lines, followed by a discussion of SIP and the impact of the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the United States and its impact on the SIP business.In MMS, assuming continued constrained hospital capital spending environment, we're anticipating limited growth for devices. However, on the new product front, we are planning a limited rollout of our integrated Symbiq and EndoTool platform, which was recently submitted to FDA for approval. We will also receive a full year benefit from TheraDoc sales, our recently acquired clinical decision support platform and applications. So that growth in America's MMS is expected to be in the 5% to 7% range. Regarding the asset disposal impact, it was close to 2% of total Americas net sales in 2009, affecting both the other pharma and other device product lines. Moving now to Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals in the Americas. We expect to see 5% to 7% growth in the base business as we continue to grow faster than the overall market. We're planning to launch two beta-lactam products, imipenem and meropenem in 2010, which are partnered products with Orchid and have a combined 2008 local branded market value of approximately $400 million. We also anticipate building momentum in 2010 for the new high-dose presentations of heparin that we launched in 2009. However, the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the U.S. that we've assumed in our plan will more than offset our expected total growth. As the early benefit we saw with our 2009 launch will face increased competition and price erosion in 2010. Therefore, after factoring in the projected decline in sales of oxaliplatin, which we assumed in our plan, we expect that SIP sales in the Americas are expected to actually show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. Note, we haven't included generics, Zosyn, docetaxel or gemcitabine in our guidance for Americas SIP sales in 2010.So to summarize for the Americas, excluding the impacts of the asset disposals and the projected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales, total net sales in the Americas are expected to increase 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. But after factoring in the asset disposal and oxaliplatin impacts, 2010 total net sales in the Americas are expected to show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. To give you an idea of how that complex discussion impacts our total global revenue growth, excluding the impact of the disposals and year-over-year expected change in oxaliplatin, again this is excluding, we expect sales on a constant currency basis to increase by 6% to 8% or 7% to 9% including the impact of foreign currency. However, after factoring in the disposals and the projected oxaliplatin impact, we expect that reported constant currency sales will be fairly flat with 2009 but slightly up after including the expected impact of foreign currency. I know that's a little bit complex and should you have questions, I'm sure we'll be glad to deal with them in the Q&A session following our prepared comments.  In terms of calendarization for the total company, quarterly sales in 2010 should be similar in pattern to what we saw in 2009 relative to total year sales. Although the ramp up will be a bit flatter than in 2009, with first half 2010 sales representing a slightly higher percentage of full year sales than in 2009. Next, I'd like to run you through how we see the rest of the income statement, as well as cash flow shaping up for 2010. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we made significant progress with Project Fuel in 2009, and the savings associated with the project contributed a fairly equal amount to cost of goods sold and SG&A. In 2010, however, we expect the lions share of the savings from Project Fuel to favorably impact cost of goods sold and therefore, gross margin, helping along with better product mix and manufacturing performance to drive our adjusted gross margins to between 42% and 43%, a 250 basis point improvement over last year. As you recall, when we announced Project Fuel almost a year ago, we committed that when the project was completed in 2011 that we expected the gross margins would progress into the low 40% range. As you can see from our guidance, we're expecting to track way ahead with our progress. This allows us to take R&D spending up by approximately 80 to 100 basis points in 2010, while still on track to meet our 2010 commitment of $70 million to $80 million in pretax savings from Project Fuel. SG&A expense is expected to remain relatively flat as savings from Project Fuel, primarily in administrators spending are offset by additional sales and marketing expense related to new product launches and strong performance by Precedex. We expect to attain adjusted operating margins of 20% to 21% in 2010, a 100 to 200 basis point improvement over 2009. Now below the operating line, we're forecasting adjusted net interest and other non-operating items in aggregate to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. We're currently estimating the adjusted tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23% due to a shift in the mix of earnings versus 2009, as well as the expiration of the R&D tax credit.Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be $166 million in the year. As a point of reference, the collective impact on EPS of our higher tax rate, higher share count, lower interest expense and greater interest income is $0.13 per share or about four percentage points of negative impact on EPS. The disposals and the expected lower oxaliplatin sales this year will also have a drag on our bottom line. But we're still projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35, which when excluding the impact of the disposals and oxaliplatin represents significant earnings growth, exceeding for 2010 our long-term goals and demonstrating a much improved profile, one that better positions us to invest for the future. The adjusted earnings exclude the charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, as well as the intangibles amortization associated with the Mayne acquisition and any one-time charges related to Project Fuel.In terms of calendarization, quarterly EPS in 2010 is expected to follow a very similar pattern to 2009 with first and second half EPS representing similar portions relative to full year EPS. Gross margin should be stronger in the back half of the year as Project Fuel savings accelerate, and operating margins are expected to progress gradually each quarter. We estimate cash flow from operations for 2010 to be between $600 million and $650 million. The decrease relative to 2009 due primarily to the estimated timing of oxaliplatin sales from the wholesaler to the end user. We expect to see a year-over-year decline in cash flow from operations as the charge backs and rebates accrued at the end of last year are paid out this year.Capital spending is projected to range between $195 million and $215 million primarily related to IT projects associated with Project Fuel, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be $235 million to $245 million. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris for some final comments."

So you'll see an uptick in capital spending. But in terms of operating cash flow, it's down about $300 million. Net income, year-over-year, when you sort through all of one-timers and what not, it should add about $40 million to $50 million. So basically, there's three components. The lion's share of it, I'd say 80% of the delta year-over-year is this chargeback and rebate impact of oxaliplatin. So we sold the product in the back part of 2009, but we're just continuing to pay the chargebacks and rebates into 2010. So you get a complete reversal. So the number sort of has 2x impact. The positive impact in 2009 completely reversing into 2010 based on the assumptions we've made. So that's most of it and then there'll be some slight increases in inventory and receivables given the mix of sales growth outside the U.S., where DSO is a little bit higher. So it's pretty much, if you wanted to pin it down to one thing. It's really the impact of oxaliplatin and sort of the reversal of fortune there with respect to the cash involved with chargebacks and rebates."

Slightly less than that because we'll sell some in 2010, but as we said with much higher competition and higher price erosion."

Let me respond to that and I appreciate the statement you just made. But in that statement I think there's a question that I need to cover, and that is, is as we look at our 2010 guidance, what are the upsides and downsides to the 201",775,"Rick, this is Chris. Let me respond to that and I appreciate the statement you just made. But in that statement I think there's a question that I need to cover, and that is, is as we look at our 2010 guidance, what are the upsides and downsides to the 2010 guidance which I think could add additional color to the statement that you're making. And then we believe we've hit it right in the middle of the fairway, and I think once I go through the upsides and downsides, I think you'll feel the same way. So let me go through them. From an upside standpoint, we believe potential upside would be greater than expected benefit from Project Fuel. And as you were just stating, and as we made in our opening comments, another potential upside would be any positive developments related to docetaxel or gemcitabine litigation in the U.S. I will remind, though, everyone that if you look at the patent and you look at pediatric exclusivity, we're talking about being on the market for approximately a month or a month and a half, if everything were to go well. And so that's a potential upside and as the year unfolds, we'll continue to monitor the litigation status and if appropriate, get ready for a launch. But clearly, right now, that does not make sense to put into our guidance. And then FDA approval of Zosyn, we're assuming no approval of Zosyn. And so if we ended up with an approval Zosyn, that's an upside. From what we're hearing right now, it's very difficult for us to peg when that might occur. We tried pegging it probably the past two years actually and have been wrong with all of our assumptions around Zosyn. And so we believe it's best to not have it in there. And then any better product mix would be on the upside as well. As we already covered, Orchid and not from an EPS standpoint because we've said Orchid would be neutral in 2010, but it would have a revenue uptick. And just to refresh what I said earlier on an annual basis, the revenue is approximately $110 million on an annual basis. And then faster-than-expected recovery from hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010 would have a positive impact on MMS. And so that's another upside as you look at how we forecast it. Now going through the downsides, we've done as an organization a great job of implementing Project Fuel. The numbers get bigger in 2010. And so if we were not able to execute Project Fuel exactly as we have it laid out, that obviously is the downside, and the numbers are bigger in 2010 than they are in 2009. That further increases in unemployment and loss in healthcare coverage. We're beginning to see in this country of flattening of the jobs loss year-to-year. It's not totally flat, but we're seeing is improving, that needs to continue. But the longer people are without jobs, the COBRA coverage et cetera disappears. And so that's a potential downside. And then any of the new products that we have in our forecast that Terry recovered from an SIP standpoint and MMS standpoint, if we ended up having delays from a regulatory approval standpoint, that would negatively impact our revenue and our profit. And then the final one, and I'm going to give a little bit color on this one is uncertainty around healthcare reform, particularly for 2010 as it relates to the cost side, all right. And we have dialed in nothing from an increased tax rebate or filing fee standpoint. And as you recall, one of the things that was heavily talked about and it's in the Senate and the House bill was the tax from a device standpoint. If healthcare reform gets through and there is a tax from a device standpoint and if it were to get implemented in 2010, and if it were to get implemented, the way it's been talked about in the Senate or House bill, that's an impact from a negative standpoint of anywhere between approximately $0.07 to $0.10 of EPS on an annual basis. There is in both bills, pharmaceutical rebates and in the most recent budget that President Obama has taken forward. There is talk about generic drug filing fees, which we haven't contemplated and don't have an update to contemplate what that cost would be. And so we take all those pluses and minuses and I think from what we know today, we've hit this forecast and guidance pretty much in the middle of the fairway."

And we've had both solution providers, as well as freeze-dried providers so there's a number of forms that will compete against each other.

Then again, we were surprised by actually relatively flat placements, but we're calling for the same outcome in 2010. And I recognize that there's been a lot of people quoting some upticks in various financial metrics for hospitals and so forth and so on. And our take is the filing is at -- although there are some positive indicators, for the most part, the tone is very still pretty conservative and it relates back to what we saw in 2009 where there still delays in decisions and some deferrals of decisions. I think hospital CEOs and CFOs and the like, you're going have to see a longer trend and more data points to get confident in that purchase decision. So that's really our thinking. And as Chris mentioned, an upside could be if those data points still stay robust through the first half of the year. Maybe the purse strings will lose a little bit, we'll see more activity. But again, I think we have it fairly well called because we really don't see a whole lot of change in the economic environment for hospitals at least early in 2010 period of time."

Is that a good basis to think about them as the 60 versus the 40?"

In some markets I think that does happen, but I would tell you that, where we have our biggest market penetration is in Germany, and we don't have a very good SIP business in Germany because of the level of competition in there. So it doesn't necessarily always correlate directly to how well you do in your generic SIP business. It really comes down to the dedicated sales force that we have invested and our ability to promote the product into individual prescribers. A little different to process than what you might see with a typical bid and tender situation. Relative to, we believe we are the market leader in short-acting EPO biogenerics at 40%. So I wouldn't peg Sandoz at 60. I'm not sure where the numbers come from, but I can't really correlate that from what we know. So again, everything that we have from an IMS perspective and our internal intelligence says that, we are the market leader across the continent. And so I wouldn't -- and I know there's other competitors other than the Sandoz out there that we compete with. So I don't know, I can't confirm the information that you have."

So those are some of the negatives and then that would we re-base the 3 11 down to a more normalized number. And then year-over-year, we've got an additional, depending on how you count it, $60 million to $70 million in net Project Fuel savings. But I would say that, those savings are probably more in the $90 million to $100 million because we're able to increase our R&D profile by 80 to 100 basis points year-over-year.

We made substantial progress in our business, including advancing our biogenerics program and launching our first major Paragraph IV drug in the U.S., oxaliplatin solution. We kicked off Project Fuel, a corporate-wide optimization initiative to drive long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value, and we met the commitment we set forth for 2009.Financially, net sales of $3.9 billion represented an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Driving these results was stellar growth in our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical product line. Adjusted gross margin reached 40%. Adjusted operating margin increased by more than 100 basis points, and we generated healthy cash flow from operations of $945 million. Despite the pressures of the global economic recession and several disposals of non-strategic assets, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 23% to $3.11.We are on our way to achieving our ultimate goal of becoming a consistent top-quartile performer and are excited about the prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. In the fourth quarter, we once again exceeded the $1 billion mark in net sales, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 represented growth of 12% over fourth quarter 2008 EPS of $0.78. Driving our net sales growth was strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals, primarily the result of our third quarter U.S. launch of oxaliplatin and strong demand for Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent.Our laser focus on advancing the business resulted in many significant achievements in 2009. We were the first market entrant with the generic solution presentation of oxaliplatin in the U.S. As a result of our flawless execution, we captured a significant share of the market for this very large drug and experienced exceptionally high levels of demand for our product. We announced our intent to acquire the generic injectable pharmaceutical asset of Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, a leading Indian injectable manufacturer and developer of beta-lactams. Through this transaction, we fulfill a key capability gap in our SIP portfolio and establish a direct presence in India providing a platform for future growth.We launched six new high dosage presentations of therapeutic heparin in single and multi-dose vials, expanding our portfolio and helping to meet an important need for our customers. We received European marketing authorization for the launch of generic docetaxel, a major drug used in the treatment of various cancers. The drug had branded sales in Europe in 2008 of approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to launch docetaxel across most of Europe by the end of 2010.We also continued our successful roll outs of several drugs in EMEA and Asia Pac, including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam and we launched a total of 23 compounds already in the market in new countries around the world during the year. Our biogenerics program continues to progress as well. We gained momentum with Retacrit, our biogeneric erythropoietin. Retacrit is currently available in 16 countries throughout Europe and has captured more than 40% of the short-acting biogeneric EPO market in the region. We acquired from PLIVA worldwide rights to a biogeneric version of filgrastim and an affiliated manufacturing facility in Croatia. This gives us development and manufacturing capabilities for our  filgrastim and pegfilgrastim pipeline products as well as potential future by biogenerics.We finalized an agreement with Celltrion, a South Korea-based pharmaceutical company, which strengthens our presence in the global biogeneric market. With the addition of five new biogeneric drugs from the agreement, the number of compounds in our biogenerics pipeline has almost doubled to 11, giving us one of the largest pipeline in the industry with the local branded value of $34 billion.In Medication Management Systems, our other strategic product line, we acquired TheraDoc, the gold standard in enterprise-wide clinical surveillance and decision support. Through this acquisition, we are advancing the quality and safety of patient care through sophisticated technology used to monitor hospital-acquired infections.We extended Hospira's portfolio of MMS products with the introduction in the Middle East of Plum A+ with MedNet safety software. This marks the first time Middle East healthcare facilities can access these types of advanced integrated technologies from one company. We also launched our first Symbiq device in Canada. In our EMEA region, we signed a 10-year contract with the Royal Marsden Hospital National Health Service Trust in the U.K. to be its provider of aseptic compounding services. This is the largest outsourced compounding contract awarded by Royal Marsden and builds on the compounding capabilities we acquired with Mayne Pharma.In Asia Pac, we established a direct presence in Seoul, South Korea focus primarily on distribution of our oncology portfolio. This brings our direct sales presence to nine markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We received a credit rating upgrade from both Standard & Poor's rating service and Moody's Investors Service. Standard & Poor's upgraded our rating from BBB to BBB+ and Moody's from Baa3 negative to Baa3 stable. We reduced our debt by approximately $425 million during the year, including an early pay down of $370 million of debt that was due in March of 2010. Last, but certainly not least, we introduced and made significant progress on Project Fuel. With regards to optimizing our product line, we have identified approximately 55% of our original 7,000-plus SKUs or list numbers that can be eliminated over time. To date, we have eliminated more than 35% of the total SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced on our last quarterly earnings call. We also continued to progress in streamlining our organizational structure. Of the targeted 1,400 to 1,500 physician reduction goal, we have notified approximately 75% of the people whose positions are being eliminated.In the area of evaluating non-strategic assets, we made several asset disposals, including the sale of two product lines, our critical care products to ICU Medical and our brain function monitoring products to SEDLine, a sub of Masimo and the sale of two contract manufacturing facilities, our Salisbury, Australia manufacturing facility to HalcyGenPharmaceuticals and most recently, our Wasserburg, Germany manufacturing to Recipharm AB. Both of these facilities came with our acquisition of Mayne in 2007. These asset disposals advance our efforts to simplify our product line and focus on our key strategic areas, better enabling us to drive future growth.We have met our Project Fuel commitments in 2009, aggressively driving transformation throughout the organization, and building momentum going into 2010. In procurement, we pursued over 150 strategic sourcing programs to identify best cost suppliers and lower total cost of ownership. In finance, we redesigned our annual plan process, saving 100 of employees' hours, improving the quality of the process. In sales and marketing, we developed a go to market strategy to improve the effectiveness of our U.S. sales force through focused and alignment to our key strategic growth areas SIP and MMS. In R&D, we enhanced the milestone review process for new development programs to streamline the process, lower risk and improve the predictability of success. And in IT, we established strategic outsourcing partnerships to provide greater oversight and maximize the value attained from our global IT service providers.Efforts such as these will optimize our productivity and allow us to free up additional funds for investment in our business, driving even better execution of our longer-term financial targets and business goals. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Terry for more details on sales for the quarter. Terry?"

I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompany",1256,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. Global net sales grew 11% in the quarter, and 9% for the full year, exceeding our most recent annual guidance of 5% to 7% growth. Both of our key strategic areas, SIP and MMS, performed well across all three segments: The Americas, EMEA and APAC. I'll now discuss results by product line for each segment, focusing most of my remarks on the results for the quarter.Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical net sales in the Americas were up over 25% in the quarter, and more than 20% for the full year, primarily attributable to greater-than-anticipated performance in oxaliplatin and strength in Precedex. Regarding oxaliplatin, the fourth quarter performance for the drug was impacted by two major factors. The first, which accounted for nearly 75% of the drug results, related to the difference between the estimated and actual charge back amounts as a result of stronger than anticipated end user pricing. As a point of reference, the charge-back provision is the difference between the amount we charge wholesalers and the amount end-user customers pay at the time of purchase.Secondly, we had anticipated that given the exceptionally high level of wholesaler demand right of the gate, fourth quarter sales were accelerated into the third quarter. Thus, we projected little if no sales of the drug for the fourth quarter. However, given the limited amount of actual competitors during the quarter, price erosion was less than expected and additional demand for the drug drove incremental oxaliplatin sales in the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors contributed to the fourth quarter's positive oxaliplatin performance.In addition to oxaliplatin, Precedex performed extremely well. Precedex had a very strong year enhanced by several factors, including the efforts of our expanded sales force, positive response to the expanded label for the procedural indication and the article in JAMA early in 2009. This popular sedation agent exceeded annual global revenues of $100 million this quarter, much earlier than anticipated. Heparin also contributed to the positive quarter's SIP performance as a result of strong demand for our new high dosage presentation that we recently launched. We are pleased that we're able to address this substantial market need, and believe we'll continue to gain momentum for the products throughout the course of 2010.Moving to EMEA, net sales of Specialty Injectables in the European region increased 10% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Driving the quarter's positive results was strong demand for several new product launch molecules including gemcitabine and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Momentum for Retacrit continues to build. We ended the year with strong top and bottom line performance, achieving our breakeven goal for the biogeneric. We continue to gain market share with our share of the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe surpassing 40%. Net sales of Specialty Injectables of APAC increased 1% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Driving the growth was the ongoing strength in proprietary pharmaceuticals in Australia as well as strength in Precedex across the region. Our launch of gemcitabine in Australia in the first half of the year has exceeded our expectation as we have captured the largest unit market share of this important generic chemotherapy agent. We are continuing to roll the drug out to additional countries in this region in 2010.Moving now to devices, net sales of Global Medication Management systems increased more than 5% in the quarter and more than 2% for the full year with positive contributions from all three regions. And despite continued hospital capital spending constraints, we recorded an increase in our overall pump placements contributing to a year-over-year growth of 8% in our global install base.In the Americas, net MMS sales increased over 3% in the quarter and 1% for the full year. Both our Plum and Symbiq devices performed favorably in the quarter. Several strategic orders that we have been cultivating throughout the year shipped in the fourth quarter contributing to the strong year end performance. We also believe that our broad product portfolio continues to be a significant advantage in today's market.You may recall that at the beginning of the year, we had anticipated that placements would be down as a result of the constrained capital spending environment. While placements for large volume infusion devices were up slightly year-over-year, we saw a shift towards a lower-priced Plum pumps versus Symbiq. Price-sensitive consumers can purchase our traditional Plum device today and with the interoperability of our MedNet safety software, they can easily upgrade to our higher technology Symbiq device in the future.For the Symbiq devices that we are placing, we continued to see strong competitive captures with over 80% of our Symbiq placements for the year coming from competitive accounts. In EMEA, MMS net sales increased 19% during the quarter and 9% for the full year due to favorable performance in both our Plum and GemStar devices and dedicated set sales. Growth during the quarter was aided by our recent tender award for Plum A+ with MedNet in a key hospital account in Saudi Arabia. MMS net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 25% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. Strong pump and set growth for GemStar drove both the quarter and full year results with Plum A+ also contributing to performance. In addition, the fourth quarter achieved a significant milestone with the introduction of GemStar and Plum A+ into the Japanese market. The initial response has been very positive, particularly for GemStar. We expect adoption of our MMS platform to continue in 2010 not only in Japan but in China and Australia as well, all key countries in the region. Before turning the call over to Tom, I'll provide an update on our drug pipelines, which we do an annual basis during this call. At December 31, 2009, our small molecule pipeline totaled 39 compounds, which represents a total 65 regional launches including 30 in the United States. The global branded market value of a small molecule pipeline is approximately $15 billion. Of the pipelines compounds, currently 21 have been submitted for approval in one or more regulatory agencies. The local market value of the filed compounds is approximately $7.9 billion. Of that dollar value, roughly 50% relates to compounds where we are currently challenging the patents or where there is some uncertainty associated with launch timing.In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly 45% of the total pipeline compounds are related to oncology and beta-lactams. These reflects the investments we have been making through acquisitions to become fundamental in these two important areas. Relative to launch timing, approximately 18 drugs are expected to launch in various regions over 2010 and 2011 with the split between the two years roughly equivalent. As was the case last year, our launches in 2010 and 2011 combined larger drugs with significant potential and smaller drugs that helped drive growth and scale.Regarding our biogenerics pipeline, as Chris mentioned, with the addition of five new biogenerics drug with the agreement with Celltrion, our biogenerics pipeline now has 11 compounds. One of the largest pipelines in the industry with a local branded value of $34 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for a review of the rest of our financial results and guidance for 2010.

First, I'll take you through the details on our Q4 and 2009 financial results and then we'll move to guidance.Adjusted gross margin was 40.5% in the fourth quarter. More favorable product mix and improvements resulting from the company's Project Fuel optimization initiatives were somewhat offset by costs related to product-corrective actions, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted gross margin of 40% represented a 70 basis point improvement over full year 2008. R&D expense in the quarter was $80 million, up from $53 million in the first quarter of 2008. For the full year, R&D increased 14% to $241 million. The increase for both the quarter and the full year was primarily related to our investment in various new product development programs in both SIP and MMS product lines, as well as the upfront payments to ChemGenex and the impact of foreign exchange.SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $165 million, up 18% from $139 million for the same period last year mainly a function of legal costs, the timing of expenses, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these factors were our Project Fuel cost-reduction efforts. For the full year, SG&A was $619 million, up 5% from the $590 million in 2008. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $204 million versus $188 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue was 19%, up 120 basis points versus last year's 17.8%. Interest expense decreased 10% for the quarter, 9% for the full year primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate notes, as well as lower debt levels.Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis for the full year was 20.3%, nearly four percentage points lower than our 2008 adjusted effective tax rate. Driving the majority of 2009's lower rate were various tax benefits recognized throughout the course of 2009. Moving to our EPS performance. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% in the fourth quarter to $0.87 compared to $0.78 last year. As was the case with the third quarter, when we increased our guidance by $0.10, most of the EPS favorability this quarter relative to consensus was due to oxaliplatin. Full year 2009 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.11 per share, an increase of 23% over 2008. Several charges were excluded from our adjusted EPS namely, Project Fuel charges, including project-related impairment and other asset charges of $0.12 a share in the quarter and $0.69 a share for the full year.  Next, charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, which totaled $0.03 per share in the quarter or $0.12 for the full year. Next, intangible amortization related to the Mayne Pharma acquisition totaled $0.07 per share in the quarter or $0.23 for the full year. Also, a research and development milestone payment for omacetaxine which totaled $0.07 per share for both the quarter and the full year.  In addition, the full year EPS excludes $0.10 per share related to the impairment of marketable equity securities and a $0.57 per share benefit related to the resolution of various IRS tax audits. In aggregate, these items totaled $0.29 for the quarter and $0.64 for the full year. Next, turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $404 million, a 58% improvement over last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $945 million compared to $584 million in 2008, driven primarily by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items as well as the timing of cash flows associated with the launch of generic oxaliplatin and some other favorable changes in working capital.At December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $946 million compared to $921 million at September 30, 2009 and $484 million at the end of last year. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures also improved for the year. Free cash flow as a percent of sales was 20% in 2009 versus 12% in 2008. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $41 million versus $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, capital spending totaled $159 million, down from $164 million in 2008. The decrease mostly reflects lower spending in 2009 versus 2008 related to our facilities optimization initiatives, and spending restrictions we put in place in late 2008.Depreciation and amortization were $58 million in the quarter compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization totaled $230 million, including $62 million of intangibles amortization. This compares to depreciation and amortization of $252 million in 2008. Now from a liquidity perspective, as of year-end 2009, we had paid down a cumulative total of approximately $925 million of debt since we began paying down Mayne-related acquisition debt in 2007, a net of $425 million of which we paid in 2009. The net $425 million of debt we paid down in 2009 included an early redemption on our $375 million notes that were due in March of 2010. Our next scheduled debt payment is not due until 2012.Also, the net $425 million debt pay down also factored in the $250 million six-year notes we issued in 2009, which were priced with a coupon of 6.4%. So in addition to cash on hand, we also have a committed bank revolver of $700 million upon which to draw. So combined with our year-end cash balance of $946 million, this gives us access if needed to approximately $1.6 billion in liquidity to meet our future needs.Next, I'd like to turn to our guidance for 2010. As Chris and Terry have both stated, we made major strides in 2009 to transform and redefine our business through the various programs of Project Fuel, including the non-strategic asset disposals we mentioned. But we're excited that the guidance we'll be providing will show that we expect to be achieving our Project Fuel-related goals of the low 40%s for adjusted gross margin, and the low 20%s for the adjusted operating margin goal, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The impact of the asset disposals, however, plus the projected decline in U.S. oxaliplatin sales will make for some difficult and potentially confusing year-over-year comparisons. Now underlying our guidance for 2010 is expected growth in our base businesses, the impact of expected new product launches, continued progress on Project Fuel, a heavier investment in R&D funded by better-than-expected savings from Project Fuel, as well as the impact of any disposals or acquisitions of businesses that were completed by January 31 of this year. Specifically, guidance will reflect the disposals of both the Salisbury and Wasserburg contract manufacturing facilities, the disposal of the critical care product line and the acquisition of TheraDoc. Globally, the disposals accounted for $134 million in 2009 sales. That's $134 million and about $0.10 in EPS. The sales were mostly recorded in our other pharma and other device product lines in each of our three geographic regions, with a more pronounced impact of these disposals on a percentage basis outside the U.S. TheraDoc sales in 2009 were not significant.One other item, the acquisition of Orchid's injectable business, which is expected to close later this quarter is not included in our guidance. Also excluded from the guidance is any impact from the proposed United States healthcare reform given the current uncertainty of the reform's outcome.So in the interest of transparency as well as ease of comparability, our revenue guidance will have statements relative to expected year-over-year growth both with and without the impact of the disposals that have been completed. But all comments will be on a constant currency basis unless we note otherwise. Significant expected new product launches will be discussed by region, as well the expected year-over-year decline in the United States relative to our 2009 launch of oxaliplatin. Given the complexity of the oxaliplatin discussion, we will start our guidance by segment with EMEA then move to APAC and conclude with the Americas. So starting with EMEA. Sales in EMEA, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 17% and 19%. However, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the region by almost 10 full percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 7% and 9%.Topline growth in the region is highly dependent on a robust new product pipeline. Investments we have made over the last couple of years to expand our pipeline are coming to fruition in 2010. We're particularly excited about the prospects for docetaxel. We expect to launch this major chemotherapy agent across most of Europe throughout the year with the five major European countries in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, we'll be launching two other important oncology products in the region. Mid-year, we plan to launch filgrastim, our second biogeneric used for the treatment of low white blood cells in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Then toward the end of the year, we expect to launch omacetaxine, a proprietary cytotoxic and oncology pharmaceutical product used in the treatment of leukemia, which we in license from ChemGenex in 2009.These products will add to our strong oncology portfolio and will augment our presence in hematology, as well as leverage the expertise and customer relationships of the biogenerics sales force we put in place in EMEA for Retacrit. We also expect our 2009 launches, including gemcitabine,  Piperacillin/Tazobactam to contribute to EMEA results for the year, and we anticipate continued growth of both sales and market share for Retacrit as it gains further acceptance and as we obtain approval for our subcutaneous renal indication this year. For MMS, we anticipate a milestone for MedNet in the region, with the expected introduction of the first language translation of Hospira MedNet into Spanish. We are also promoting our MMS portfolio aggressively in the Middle East, a growing market and one which values the medication safety features of our smart infusion systems.Next moving to APAC. Sales in APAC, excluding the impact of the various disposals are expected to grow between 13% and 15%. As with EMEA, however, the disposals impacting the other pharma and other device product lines will reduce overall growth in the APAC region by almost 11 percentage points. So that constant currency sales growth in the region is expected to be between 2% and 4%. We expect the trends driving the region's positive growth in 2009 will continue throughout 2010. On the pharma side, our specialty proprietary products in Australia particularly the oncology drugs, are expected to be drivers of growth as well as Precedex, which we expect to be a driver across the region. We're also excited about the anticipated approval and launch of Precedex in Korea later this year. And in Australia, we expect approval and launch of filgrastim in the second half of the year. This will mark the first launch of a biogeneric in APAC, expanding our biogenerics commercialization to two of the company's three regions. On the device side, we expect another good year in the region in 2010 with continued strength in GemStar and Plum in our major markets including Australia, Japan and Korea. 2010 will mark the introduction of Symbiq into the region as well. We were very pleased to have recently signed the first contract for Symbiq in a large hospital in Queensland, Australia.Next moving to the Americas. Now before discussing the overall guidance for the region, I'd like to walk you through our MMS and SIP product categories, starting with MMS. Then I will touch on the impact of the disposals primarily to the other device and other pharma product lines, followed by a discussion of SIP and the impact of the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the United States and its impact on the SIP business.In MMS, assuming continued constrained hospital capital spending environment, we're anticipating limited growth for devices. However, on the new product front, we are planning a limited rollout of our integrated Symbiq and EndoTool platform, which was recently submitted to FDA for approval. We will also receive a full year benefit from TheraDoc sales, our recently acquired clinical decision support platform and applications. So that growth in America's MMS is expected to be in the 5% to 7% range. Regarding the asset disposal impact, it was close to 2% of total Americas net sales in 2009, affecting both the other pharma and other device product lines. Moving now to Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals in the Americas. We expect to see 5% to 7% growth in the base business as we continue to grow faster than the overall market. We're planning to launch two beta-lactam products, imipenem and meropenem in 2010, which are partnered products with Orchid and have a combined 2008 local branded market value of approximately $400 million. We also anticipate building momentum in 2010 for the new high-dose presentations of heparin that we launched in 2009. However, the expected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales in the U.S. that we've assumed in our plan will more than offset our expected total growth. As the early benefit we saw with our 2009 launch will face increased competition and price erosion in 2010. Therefore, after factoring in the projected decline in sales of oxaliplatin, which we assumed in our plan, we expect that SIP sales in the Americas are expected to actually show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. Note, we haven't included generics, Zosyn, docetaxel or gemcitabine in our guidance for Americas SIP sales in 2010.So to summarize for the Americas, excluding the impacts of the asset disposals and the projected year-over-year decline in oxaliplatin sales, total net sales in the Americas are expected to increase 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. But after factoring in the asset disposal and oxaliplatin impacts, 2010 total net sales in the Americas are expected to show a decline of 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. To give you an idea of how that complex discussion impacts our total global revenue growth, excluding the impact of the disposals and year-over-year expected change in oxaliplatin, again this is excluding, we expect sales on a constant currency basis to increase by 6% to 8% or 7% to 9% including the impact of foreign currency. However, after factoring in the disposals and the projected oxaliplatin impact, we expect that reported constant currency sales will be fairly flat with 2009 but slightly up after including the expected impact of foreign currency. I know that's a little bit complex and should you have questions, I'm sure we'll be glad to deal with them in the Q&A session following our prepared comments.  In terms of calendarization for the total company, quarterly sales in 2010 should be similar in pattern to what we saw in 2009 relative to total year sales. Although the ramp up will be a bit flatter than in 2009, with first half 2010 sales representing a slightly higher percentage of full year sales than in 2009. Next, I'd like to run you through how we see the rest of the income statement, as well as cash flow shaping up for 2010. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we made significant progress with Project Fuel in 2009, and the savings associated with the project contributed a fairly equal amount to cost of goods sold and SG&A. In 2010, however, we expect the lions share of the savings from Project Fuel to favorably impact cost of goods sold and therefore, gross margin, helping along with better product mix and manufacturing performance to drive our adjusted gross margins to between 42% and 43%, a 250 basis point improvement over last year. As you recall, when we announced Project Fuel almost a year ago, we committed that when the project was completed in 2011 that we expected the gross margins would progress into the low 40% range. As you can see from our guidance, we're expecting to track way ahead with our progress. This allows us to take R&D spending up by approximately 80 to 100 basis points in 2010, while still on track to meet our 2010 commitment of $70 million to $80 million in pretax savings from Project Fuel. SG&A expense is expected to remain relatively flat as savings from Project Fuel, primarily in administrators spending are offset by additional sales and marketing expense related to new product launches and strong performance by Precedex. We expect to attain adjusted operating margins of 20% to 21% in 2010, a 100 to 200 basis point improvement over 2009. Now below the operating line, we're forecasting adjusted net interest and other non-operating items in aggregate to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. We're currently estimating the adjusted tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23% due to a shift in the mix of earnings versus 2009, as well as the expiration of the R&D tax credit.Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be $166 million in the year. As a point of reference, the collective impact on EPS of our higher tax rate, higher share count, lower interest expense and greater interest income is $0.13 per share or about four percentage points of negative impact on EPS. The disposals and the expected lower oxaliplatin sales this year will also have a drag on our bottom line. But we're still projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35, which when excluding the impact of the disposals and oxaliplatin represents significant earnings growth, exceeding for 2010 our long-term goals and demonstrating a much improved profile, one that better positions us to invest for the future. The adjusted earnings exclude the charges related to our facilities optimization initiatives, as well as the intangibles amortization associated with the Mayne acquisition and any one-time charges related to Project Fuel.In terms of calendarization, quarterly EPS in 2010 is expected to follow a very similar pattern to 2009 with first and second half EPS representing similar portions relative to full year EPS. Gross margin should be stronger in the back half of the year as Project Fuel savings accelerate, and operating margins are expected to progress gradually each quarter. We estimate cash flow from operations for 2010 to be between $600 million and $650 million. The decrease relative to 2009 due primarily to the estimated timing of oxaliplatin sales from the wholesaler to the end user. We expect to see a year-over-year decline in cash flow from operations as the charge backs and rebates accrued at the end of last year are paid out this year.Capital spending is projected to range between $195 million and $215 million primarily related to IT projects associated with Project Fuel, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be $235 million to $245 million.

The far-reaching changes we've made with Project Fuel have not only improved our operations, they have significantly changed the profitability profile. We've substantially improved gross margins and have made substantial investments in R&D. We've eliminated low growth, non-strategic assets. In short, we've changed Hospira for the better. The significant momentum we in generated in 2009 paves the way for continued progress in 2010. We expect to drive increased deficiencies this year through Project Fuel as we continue to position Hospira for long-term sustainable growth.

So other companies I think have factored in a little bit more, but because of the Australian dollar situation, the way our currency is mixed out is it only looks to be about 1%. As we look at rates today, I looked at them this morning, we're pretty close with what we've assumed. The rates actually kind of moved up a little bit and then they moved the other way, such that we're back fairly close to what we assumed in October, but they way of mix is out is about 1%."

So you'll see an uptick in capital spending. But in terms of operating cash flow, it's down about $300 million. Net income, year-over-year, when you sort through all of one-timers and what not, it should add about $40 million to $50 million. So basically, there's three components. The lion's share of it, I'd say 80% of the delta year-over-year is this chargeback and rebate impact of oxaliplatin. So we sold the product in the back part of 2009, but we're just continuing to pay the chargebacks and rebates into 2010. So you get a complete reversal. So the number sort of has 2x impact. The positive impact in 2009 completely reversing into 2010 based on the assumptions we've made. So that's most of it and then there'll be some slight increases in inventory and receivables given the mix of sales growth outside the U.S., where DSO is a little bit higher. So it's pretty much, if you wanted to pin it down to one thing. It's really the impact of oxaliplatin and sort of the reversal of fortune there with respect to the cash involved with chargebacks and rebates."

Let me respond to that and I appreciate the statement you just made. But in that statement I think there's a question that I need to cover, and that is, is as we look at our 2010 guidance, what are the upsides and downsides to the 201",775,"Rick, this is Chris. Let me respond to that and I appreciate the statement you just made. But in that statement I think there's a question that I need to cover, and that is, is as we look at our 2010 guidance, what are the upsides and downsides to the 2010 guidance which I think could add additional color to the statement that you're making. And then we believe we've hit it right in the middle of the fairway, and I think once I go through the upsides and downsides, I think you'll feel the same way. So let me go through them. From an upside standpoint, we believe potential upside would be greater than expected benefit from Project Fuel. And as you were just stating, and as we made in our opening comments, another potential upside would be any positive developments related to docetaxel or gemcitabine litigation in the U.S. I will remind, though, everyone that if you look at the patent and you look at pediatric exclusivity, we're talking about being on the market for approximately a month or a month and a half, if everything were to go well. And so that's a potential upside and as the year unfolds, we'll continue to monitor the litigation status and if appropriate, get ready for a launch. But clearly, right now, that does not make sense to put into our guidance. And then FDA approval of Zosyn, we're assuming no approval of Zosyn. And so if we ended up with an approval Zosyn, that's an upside. From what we're hearing right now, it's very difficult for us to peg when that might occur. We tried pegging it probably the past two years actually and have been wrong with all of our assumptions around Zosyn. And so we believe it's best to not have it in there. And then any better product mix would be on the upside as well. As we already covered, Orchid and not from an EPS standpoint because we've said Orchid would be neutral in 2010, but it would have a revenue uptick. And just to refresh what I said earlier on an annual basis, the revenue is approximately $110 million on an annual basis. And then faster-than-expected recovery from hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010 would have a positive impact on MMS. And so that's another upside as you look at how we forecast it. Now going through the downsides, we've done as an organization a great job of implementing Project Fuel. The numbers get bigger in 2010. And so if we were not able to execute Project Fuel exactly as we have it laid out, that obviously is the downside, and the numbers are bigger in 2010 than they are in 2009. That further increases in unemployment and loss in healthcare coverage. We're beginning to see in this country of flattening of the jobs loss year-to-year. It's not totally flat, but we're seeing is improving, that needs to continue. But the longer people are without jobs, the COBRA coverage et cetera disappears. And so that's a potential downside. And then any of the new products that we have in our forecast that Terry recovered from an SIP standpoint and MMS standpoint, if we ended up having delays from a regulatory approval standpoint, that would negatively impact our revenue and our profit. And then the final one, and I'm going to give a little bit color on this one is uncertainty around healthcare reform, particularly for 2010 as it relates to the cost side, all right. And we have dialed in nothing from an increased tax rebate or filing fee standpoint. And as you recall, one of the things that was heavily talked about and it's in the Senate and the House bill was the tax from a device standpoint. If healthcare reform gets through and there is a tax from a device standpoint and if it were to get implemented in 2010, and if it were to get implemented, the way it's been talked about in the Senate or House bill, that's an impact from a negative standpoint of anywhere between approximately $0.07 to $0.10 of EPS on an annual basis. There is in both bills, pharmaceutical rebates and in the most recent budget that President Obama has taken forward. There is talk about generic drug filing fees, which we haven't contemplated and don't have an update to contemplate what that cost would be. And so we take all those pluses and minuses and I think from what we know today, we've hit this forecast and guidance pretty much in the middle of the fairway."

But again going forward, we have 12 months to deal with, and we do expect that competition will continue to ramp up. And we've had both solution providers, as well as freeze-dried providers so there's a number of forms that will compete against each other. So we do expect in our forecast with a call forward increased competition, as well as increased price erosion to a point where we believe that towards -- through the year, we're going to start to see typical pricing that we typically see with any other generic launch in this marketplace. So fairly aggressive price erosion throughout the year."

And I recognize that there's been a lot of people quoting some upticks in various financial metrics for hospitals and so forth and so on. And our take is the filing is at -- although there are some positive indicators, for the most part, the tone is very still pretty conservative and it relates back to what we saw in 2009 where there still delays in decisions and some deferrals of decisions. I think hospital CEOs and CFOs and the like, you're going have to see a longer trend and more data points to get confident in that purchase decision. So that's really our thinking. And as Chris mentioned, an upside could be if those data points still stay robust through the first half of the year. Maybe the purse strings will lose a little bit, we'll see more activity. But again, I think we have it fairly well called because we really don't see a whole lot of change in the economic environment for hospitals at least early in 2010 period of time."

A little different to process than what you might see with a typical bid and tender situation. Relative to, we believe we are the market leader in short-acting EPO biogenerics at 40%.

And as it relates to the timing of approvals on the new products side, one of the things that we constantly do is monitor that and then adjust our time frames of when we submit and when we plan on launching it. And so I think, we've got in our models all that fairly current because we have a very disciplined approach that I talked about before our Hospira product review committee and so those are current. And obviously, we will do anything we can to help assist the FDA from a question standpoint and information standpoint and also ease of the submission, eligibility and ability to read it. And so I think we're on top of it, and so I don't mean to put it aside but it's not something that keeps me up at night. The organization here is very well aware of the importance of working with the FDA and changing as their requirements change."

We started out the year with very strong sales and profitability, driven mainly by continued strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals. The majority of the contribution came from oxaliplatin, a major oncology drug use in the treatment of colon cancer, and Precedex, our proprietary sedation engine.
Net sales topped $1 billion this quarter, increasing 17% year-over-year or 13% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 represents a growth of 57% over the first quarter of 2009 EPS of $0.60. The first quarter included several significant developments for Hospira. We completed the acquisition of Orchid generic injectable pharmaceuticals business. Integration of Orchid Chemicals injectable formulation business represents a strong strategic fit.
Through this acquisition, we have enhanced our SIP portfolio by fulfilling a key manufacturing and development capability gap, and adding new beta-lactam antibiotic compounds to our portfolio. It also establishes a direct presence for us in India, providing a platform for future growth.
We reached a positive agreement on our oxaliplatin patent challenge since the third quarter 2009 launch of generic oxaliplatin in solution. We have seen extremely high levels of demand with only a limited number of competitors offering a solution product. This has resulted in extremely favorable performance over the past several quarters. However, ongoing litigation continued to provide uncertainty as to future prospects. By settling the litigation, we eliminate any litigation risk while we secure the right to relaunch our product in 2012 in advance of patent expiry.
On the biogenerics front, we were very pleased to be the first biogeneric to receive approval for subcutaneous use of Retacrit in renal anemia from the European Community. This development allows us to serve a broader base of the fast acting EPO market in Europe, where the subcutaneous indication of the drug represents more than half of the renal usage of the product.
More recently, we entered into a merger agreement and commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Javelin Pharmaceuticals. Once approved the acquisition of Javelin will allow us to capitalize on the synergies between Javelin’s main product candidate, Dyloject, a post-operative pain management drug and Precedex. Both drugs are marketed to anesthesiologists, and will be sold through our Precedex sales force upon completion of the acquisition.
Finally, last week the US District Court for the Northern district of Illinois ruled in our favor in the ERISA lawsuit related to the spin-off of Hospira from Abbott. We are pleased with the court’s ruling, which validated our long-held position that Hospira had acted in compliance with the law at all times.
So, our list of achievements continues to grow, however, we have had our fair share of challenges as well. As you know, two weeks ago we received a warning letter from the US FDA related to the inspections earlier this year of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mount, both located in North Carolina.
While the letter does not restrict production of shipment of our products from these facilities, it does address topics related to documentation policies and procedures and validation and investigation practices. More specifically, the FDA cites failure to adequately validate the processes used to manufacture products at Rocky Mount facility. Deficiencies related to particulate in certain emulsion products, namely Propofol and Liposyn at the Clayton facility and corporate oversight.
We take these actions very seriously. We are committed to filing the FDA’s regulations and company operating procedures to ensure that we address the FDA’s specific observations and overall expectations and timelines, we are working very closely with the agency, as well as with third party consultants. We are confident we can demonstrate to the agency our ability and commitment to not only implement these corrective actions, but also to ensure the global application of all improvements.
I am personally engaged in the process and committed to driving a positive resolution to this issue. Quite simply, we built Hospira on a strong foundation of quality and we intend to stay that course. That is part of the reason we elected to put a temporary hold on new shipments of Propofol and Liposyn products. As you may know, we have had challenges with these emulsion products, which are difficult to manufacture. We have submitted improvements to the manufacturing process for these products to the agency, including the installation of a smaller micron filter designed to filter out the microscopic particulate.
While we have manufactured both Propofol and Liposyn using the improved process, we will not ship any of the products manufactured under the new process until we receive the agency’s concurrence with our approach to addressing this issue. The FDA's increased focus on managing the safety and quality of health care is raising the bar, and we are raising our bar internally. To that end, we are looking across our global manufacturing operations to ensure that we meet the highest level of compliance with both our pharmaceutical and device products.
On the device side of the business, we continually monitor and evaluate our infusion devices to determine whether changes are needed to improve the quality of the systems. We pay close attention to customer feedback, and take action when we see heightened levels of activity. For example, we have recently seen an increase in customer complaints related to the failure of (inaudible) at the end of infusion therapy in certain conditions. Regardless of the clinical practice, we need to make certain our pumps have the appropriate safeguards and interfaces under all conditions to achieve the highest level of safety and efficacy.
As a result, we have decided to hold new customer shipments of the Symbiq devices until our investigation is complete. While we make the appropriate modifications to the product, we have alerted our customers of the end of infusion condition. This voluntary shipping hold is another step that demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement.
Turning now to Project Fuel. We remain on track with our optimization program, which is designed to simplify our business and drive quality and operational excellence to obtain top tier financial performance. Since the initiative’s inception a year ago, we have eliminated approximately 45% of the total identified list number of SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced in early February. And we continue to progress in streamlining our organizational structure, having notified over 80% of the people impacted by our target reduction goal of 1400 to 1500 physicians.
Furthermore, bolstered by the strong progress and gains from Project Fuel, we have recently made some leadership changes to increase our focus. First, Terry Kearney, our chief operating officer, continues to lead the global operations organization, but now is focused on driving improved quality, efficiency and collaboration across the supply chain and manufacturing organizations. Although he will no longer be joining us on our quarterly conference calls, he remains a key member of our leadership team, spearheading our lean initiatives and driving optimization through the entire business.
Ron Squarer, previously in charge of our global marketing and corporate development activities has moved into the newly created role of chief commercial officer. In this new role, Ron is responsible for delivering long-term sustainable revenue growth across our three regions and our contract manufacturing business.
Finally, before turning the call over to Tom, I like to touch on a key development during the quarter, the passage of healthcare reform legislation in the US, which brings increased access to healthcare for millions of Americans. On the whole, we believe the legislation represents a positive opportunity for Hospira. It is focused on the key areas of quality of care, cost containment and enhanced productivity is the foundation of what we do at Hospira.
And unlike many large pharmaceutical companies, our focus on genetic injectable products for the acute care non-retail market means we do not expect a significant impact from the changes to Medicaid that resulted from the legislation. Where we do expect an impact, a positive impact, is in the establishment of a regulatory pathway for biogenerics in the United States. Hospira has long championed for a biogenerics pathway in the interests of bringing lower cost, high quality biogenerics to the American public. So we were pleased that this was incorporated into the healthcare reform legislation.
Overall, we believe the bill is sound with the exception of the ever greening provision, which as currently written will allow for an additional period of exclusivity as a result of minor modifications to an existing drug, thus creating a potential monopoly for branded biologics. We will continue to work to improve the biogenerics legislation, just as Hatch-Waxman has evolved favorably for small molecule generics since it was passed 25 years ago.
The 12-year exclusivity period in the bill will allow for other innovative life-saving products come to market, which might not have otherwise been available. It will not impact any of the 11 biogenerics in our current pipeline, and will ensure a robust future pipeline for Hospira. We are working at full speed to be able to launch biogeneric products in the United States, when the branded biologics patents expire.
Finally on the device side, that will be an impact from the medical device excise tax component of healthcare legislation. The 2.3% tax will affect a smaller subset of our total revenue beginning in 2013, when we expect the tax will result in an annual after-tax impact of less than $0.10 per share.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom.

Since I'm now going to now cover everything from sales to earnings, the format of our call will be slightly different than in the past. I encourage you to use the complementary material that Karen referenced earlier as support for some of the statements I will be making.
I will remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table in the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line.
Global net sales grew 13% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, mainly the result of strong performance from global specialty injectables, which increased 37% during the first quarter. In the Americas, specialty injectables net sales were up 43%, primarily attributable to greater than anticipated performance of oxaliplatin and Precedex. Excluding the impact of oxaliplatin, the base business grew in the high single digits.
Due to limited competition and continued strong demand for oxaliplatin solution, both volume and price in the quarter were better than we had anticipated, resulting in stronger sales and a favorable adjustment to our charge back provision recorded in previous quarters. During the quarter, approximately three quarters of the oxaliplatin sales were related to wholesaler demand with the remaining one quarter from this change to our original charge back estimate, reflecting more stable and pricing than our original projections.
Looking forward, we have been monitoring market behavior and price erosion over the past month since we announced the settlement. Today, we have sold around half of the allotted volume agreed upon in the settlement at prices reflecting a more stable price environment. We anticipate selling the remaining volume during the second quarter, as our end date to sell product is June 30.
Today the erosion rate of the branded price remains at approximately 65% to 75% depending on the channel, which is in line with what we saw in the first quarter. Also contributing to the positive quarter’s SIP performance was strong demand and momentum for both Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent, and a new high dosage heparin [ph] presentations we launched in the third quarter last year.
Moving now to EMEA, net sales of specialty injectables in the region increased 13% in the quarter, driven by continued momentum in many of our recently launched molecules.
We had another strong quarter for Retacrit, with our share of the total short acting biogeneric market in Europe increasing to more than 50%, and we also introduced docetaxel to various smaller countries throughout Europe.
In Asia Pacific, net sales of specialty injectables increased 19% over prior year first quarter driven by solid growth in Australia in what is traditionally a sluggish quarter for generics in the region, as well as strength in gemcitabine.
Moving now to devices, net sales of global medication management systems were up slightly versus the first quarter of 2009. In the Americas, net MMS sales grew 2% in the quarter, placements were up significantly on a year-over-year basis with competitive capture rates remaining strong at 70%. We continue to see positive demand for Plum, driven by price sensitive customers who remain capital constrained.
In EMEA and APAC, first of all in EMEA, MMS net sales decreased 6%, and they were flat in Asia Pacific, mainly due to the timing of certain contracts. Dedicated set sales continue to remain favorable providing a consistent stream of revenue. Sales in both other pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter. This was primarily due to the divestitures of two of our contract manufacturing facilities in Salisbury, Australia and Wasserburg, Germany, as well as the sale of our critical care product line.
Moving down the rest of the income statement, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 45.1%, up 560 basis points compared to 39.5% in the first quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement were favorable product mix driven by oxaliplatin, as well as improvements to manufacturing productivity mainly as a result of Project Fuel efforts.
R&D expense in the quarter was 52 million, up 3% over the first quarter of 2009. As a percentage of net sales R&D was 5.1% versus 5.8% in the first quarter of 2009. This was less than we anticipated, but it is primarily related to the timing of projects pending, which will occur later in the year.
SG&A expense for the first quarter was 179 million, up 23% from 146 million from the same period last year. The increase reflects temporary spending associated with Project Fuel optimization initiatives, as well as additional expenses related to the Precedex sales force expansion, intellectual property legal expenses, partially offset by Project Fuel cost reduction efforts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 17.7% compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of 2009.
Adjusted operating income increased 60% to 240 million versus 150 million in the first quarter last year. Operating margin adjusted at 23.8% improved by almost 640 basis points versus 17.4% in last year's first quarter. Interest expense decreased 13% to 23 million in the first quarter, down from 27 million last year. This primarily reflecting the 2009 pay down of debt related to the main acquisition.
Now our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 27%, up from our first quarter 2009 rate of 21.5%. While the increase reflects a slight shift in the mix of earnings versus the first quarter of 2009, somewhat due to oxaliplatin, it is more due to the impact of the failure by our federal government to renew several tax extender bills that we expected to be enacted in the first quarter of 2010. This was contrary to what we had expected, but we do believe that the extenders will be renewed in the second quarter of 2010. Therefore we are still comfortable with our original guidance for an adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23%.
Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.94 compared to $0.60 last year, an increase of 57%. Turning briefly to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was actually an outflow of 6 million versus an inflow of 89 million last year. This is primarily due to the expected payout of chargebacks during the quarter, as the sales of oxaliplatin moved from wholesaler to end-user.
Our cash balance at March 31 was 646 million compared to 946 million at the end of last year, and 529 million at March 31, 2009. As expected the decline was primarily related to the acquisition of Orchid Pharmaceuticals' injectable business.
Capital spending in the quarter was 41 million compared to 34 million in the same period last year as a result of Project Fuel related spending.
Finally moving to guidance, moving to our full-year projections on our fourth quarter 2009 and year-end earnings call in February, we projected 2010 global net sales to be relatively flat on a constant currency basis or flat to slightly up on a reported basis. We also projected EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share. Since the time of the call, several variables have surfaced that could positively or negatively impact guidance.
I'm going to walk you through each of these variables, which ultimately will result in an increase in both sales and adjusted EPS guidance relative to our prior guidance. Starting with the positive variables, first the Orchid acquisition. When we provided full-year guidance on our fourth quarter call, we indicated that our sales guidance did not include sales associated with the as yet not closed acquisition of Orchid’s generic injectable pharmaceutical business. Now having completed the acquisition last month, we are updating 2010 guidance, net sales of Orchid for the nine months of 2010 since the close date will add about 55 million to our sales, distributed fairly evenly through the remaining three quarters.
In addition to Orchid, the other positive factor relative to our full-year guidance is oxaliplatin. There are two dynamics that we have to consider when discussing oxaliplatin that being timing and pricing. Our initial projection for oxaliplatin in 2010 assumes continued price erosion throughout the year, with sales relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter. The terms of the recent settlement, however, calls for us to stop selling oxaliplatin on June 30, 2010. So we now anticipate that the sales we had previously assumed for the second half of the year will be accelerated into the first half.
And in the first quarter we experienced very little price erosion to oxaliplatin compared to fourth-quarter pricing levels. Since we had assumed greater erosion rates throughout the course of the year, the increase in volume at higher price levels in the first quarter had a significant impact for us. As a result, we are modifying our full year guidance based on these factors.
Now offsetting these possible contributors are the voluntary actions we have decided to take that may have a negative financial impact to future results. First, as Chris discussed with you earlier our recent warning letter from the FDA and what we are doing to bring the issues identified to a positive resolution. While we are in the process of implementing corrective actions and are manufacturing Propofol and Liposyn today, we will not start shipping these products until we receive the agency’s concurrence with our approach to addressing this issue.
We recognize there is a market shortage of these important drugs and are hopeful that we will be able to demonstrate resolution to FDA quickly. However, to be as transparent as possible we have chosen to remove future sales of both Propofol and Liposyn from our full year 2010 guidance.
Second, the voluntary hold we placed on shipments of Symbiq to new customers. The pumps will remain on hold until we can complete our investigation, and make the appropriate modifications. While we are working diligently on the issue, we can't predict the timing of resolution. As a result we are removing future sales of Symbiq devices from our full year 2010 guidance.
Between the addition of Orchid sales and better anticipated performance of oxaliplatin in the first quarter, partially offset by certain product shipping holds, we are still increasing our guidance for global net sales to 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis with foreign exchange contributing a positive 1%. As most of the impact will be to the Americas region, we are increasing net sales in the Americas to 2% to 4%. Net sales guidance for EMEA and APAC will remain at the previously disclosed ranges of 7% to 9% for EMEA, and 2% to 4% for Asia-Pacific.
Margin contribution from oxaliplatin will be partially offset by the ship hold issues, as well as increased R&D spending in the back part of the year from the acquisition of Orchid, and increased Project Fuel IT expenses. Accordingly, gross margin and operating margin percent guidance will remain unchanged.
I mentioned earlier in my discussion that we are maintaining our adjusted tax rate guidance of 22% to 23% for 2010. We do believe that the extender bills will be renewed in the second quarter of 2010 having a favorable impact on our second quarter tax rate as we bring the year-to-date to our initial guidance.
Moving finally to EPS and then cash flow, while the Orchid transaction is immaterial to EPS in 2010, the results of strong performance with oxaliplatin, offset by the product shipping holds still will result in an increase in full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance now to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, an 8% to 11% growth rate over the prior year.
We expect that second-quarter EPS will be the softest quarter with sequential earnings growth in the latter half of the year. We are also increasing our guidance for cash flow from operations up to $625 million to $675 million due to strong US oxaliplatin sales in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization will increase to $250 million to $260 million mostly as a result of the Orchid acquisition and guidance for capital spending remains unchanged.
With that I will turn the call back to Chris.

We are committed to delivering our increased full year guidance for sales and adjusted EPS, and we are on track for another positive year. I look forward to sharing our progress with you on next quarter’s call.
With that we are now ready to take questions. Operator.

We will have to see how the second quarter plays out with respect to price erosion, and then as you know at June 30 we are done. So, you know hopefully we don't have any spillover for charge back adjustments into the third quarter, but you know the amount of product that has been purchased by the wholesalers, it is pretty difficult to tell exactly when it is going to run out, when the chargebacks are going to come in.
But as you look at EPS, you know, we're up a dime, and I will just kind of take you through the major pieces and you know without specifically quantifying oxali, I think those here on the call can probably piece it together. So first thing that we have, I guess, called in correctly was our share count. And you may note in our 10-Q that we have slightly changed the language on the share buyback authorization.
Our shares are up almost 8 million shares from the first quarter of last year. They were at 161. They are now up to 169 million. So we are going to begin to evaluate whether there is some steps we can take to at least stabilize the share count. As it stands, the assumption right now is that the share count won't get any higher and the increase obviously is related to the high level of option exercises.
If the share count doesn't get any higher that is about a negative $0.08 per share impact, and that is just - it was hard to estimate the number of exercises. Collectively, the product holds and the costs that we believe are necessary to get things fixed. That is about a quarter of negative, and then between oxaliplatin and some other moving pieces in various parts of the business, primarily in the US and in EMEA that is sort of a delta that would allow us to take the guidance up about a dime.
And the positive oxaliplatin is a large portion of it, but it is not the only item that is swinging in our favor.

As we said in the prepared comments, earnings in the second quarter would be the softest for the year, and that's going to be driven by lower margins. So we had to sort of wind off of oxaliplatin. There will be you know, much less of oxaliplatin recorded in the second quarter, and then margins will begin to rebound in the back part of the year, aided by better manufacturing performance, as well as increased savings from Project Fuel.
Within the quarter, you know, I went back yesterday and did an analysis that took the oxaliplatin, and put the charge back adjustments into the correct quarter, and as we said today it's about 25% to 30% of what we recorded this quarter was chargeback related, but as you recall, we sold very little product in the fourth quarter. So most of the chargeback goes back to the initial bunch of sales that we did in the third quarter of last year. So when you get the chargebacks into the right period, margins have been pretty stable and we had taken some reserves in the third and fourth quarter last year related to some of these product actions, Propofol, Liposyn and some other things to power cord [ph] as well, and you know, when you clean that out margins look fairly stable. So the 45% this quarter if you get the chargeback out of there, you know, it's not 45%, you know, it is 200 some basis points less than that. So Q2 will drop-down and then, we’ll begin to progress back up and still be able to hit the 42% to 43% for the year.

First of all, let me give a little context to the Symbiq ship hold. First of all, in 2009 if you looked at our shipments of infusion pumps, approximately 80% of them were our Plum technology-base and about 20% we Symbiq. For the first quarter, we've seen a shift to 90% Plum, 10% Symbiq, and the primary reason for that shift is we're beginning to see the availability of capital with our customers, but the amount of capital that is available is less.
So capital is beginning to free up but they are really looking for a lower price point than where Symbiq was, and so for Q1 we ran a 90:10 split of the two different technologies, all right. And on Symbiq specifically, let me give some additional color. The ship hold is a very recent occurrence, and it occurred because we were monitoring our data from our customers, okay, their complaint data, and we saw a spike in our (inaudible) complaints from you know, certain clinical practices, and we really believe when we saw that that we needed to take a deep breath and do a thorough investigation to make sure that we understand how perhaps clinical practices have shifted or how Symbiq might be used in the clinic versus other infusion pump technology.
And so we have underway a thorough investigation to better understand this and then we've been dialoguing with the FDA ever since we saw the spike, and then subsequently when we put the product on hold towards the end of last week. And so we don't have an answer yet at this point in time. The other thing I would share with you though is we do believe it is something that we can solve. We actually have a newer version of software with Symbiq, which is scheduled to go into the FDA towards the end of this quarter. And so what we're targeting is to have our investigation completed, understand if there is any changes that need to be made or further education with the customer base, and then if a change needs to be made to incorporate it into that new software version that we plan on following at the end of Q2.
Then obviously because it is a new filing, it's got to go through all of the processes that a new product would, you know, with the FDA, and we believe it was a prudent thing to do because of the nature of the event and we did it before the FDA went public with this increased, heightened awareness around infusion pumps, okay. And so it's not a reaction to that, but obviously I think we did the right thing in trying to make sure that we understand this and that we have the very best product out there for all different types of clinical applications.

And so what the industry is doing from a drug library standpoint is fantastic, all right, and so what we need to do is increase the adoption of that in the marketplace and perhaps get some regulations, whether it's state or federal to drive the increased usage of drug libraries, because what they're talking about, at least on the surface you know, a drug library implemented appropriately and that worked with a hospital pharmacy system and a barcode system would take care of those misadventures, and as we talked about you know, with our analysts, with our shareholders, our employees, and quite candidly our customers, this whole issue of drug misadventures is not a new one at all, okay.
It's something that we are highly focused on.

You know, and obviously it has not closed yet, but it is something that we are very pleased with the opportunity and we believe it will close and we believe it fits perfectly, and with what we've talked about in our doing as it relates to proprietary products in the acute care, you know, space. And it's very, very, very synergistic with our Precedex sales organization, and we believe from the clinical data that we've had an opportunity to review thoroughly that Dyloject you know, can be an excellent product for us, and for those listeners who aren’t as familiar with it, it is a pain drug, okay.
And as you look at the pain marketplace, there is really three different segments to the pain marketplace; mild, moderate, and severe, and, you know, the mild, you know, market is taken care of by things like Tylenol, you know, Advil, et cetera. It's not a market that interest us whatsoever, but the moderate to severe is one that is right in our wheelhouse, because it's what takes place from a hospital standpoint, and from everything that we can tell on Dyloject, you know, it does a good job of taking care of both the moderate and severe pain segments, and it doesn't have the side effects that are associated with opioid drug products such as nausea and constipation, because this is a non-opiate pain product.
And the other beauty of it is it's not an infused product, it's a syringe push product. So the delivery of it and the convenience of it, you know, is much nicer for our customers. From a potential standpoint, we see this with a similar type of potential as what Precedex has, and quite candidly we keep raising the bar and the performance level on Precedex as it is being accepted more in the US, and quite candidly around the world where, you know, we believe you know, Precedex and Dyloject have the potential of generating northward you know, of $150 million worth of sales.

Not just hospital infusion devices, but you know, infusion devices associated with delivering insulin for people who are diabetic, and it all ties I think perfectly to, you know, the report that was done you know, several years ago around the level of misadventures that occur in drug delivery, and that occurs on the injectable side, but it also occurs on the oral solid side and our biggest interest is in the injectable side.
And, you know, the very high level are heard [ph] as two things. We keep the high cost of proprietary products down with our generic portfolio and the other thing we do is we reduced our medication errors. And so that is part of what we do. It's part of the fabric of our culture and you know, we will do whatever it takes from a technology, you know, quality improvement you know, standpoint to make sure that we are able to deliver the best product out there.
You know, it's interesting. We now have, I believe it's either, I think it's free now, sites up and running with auto programming, where the infusion pump is actually automatically programmed by the wireless network system in the hospital, and what the nurse does is she walks up, reads what’s in the pump, confirms it and hits run. And so if you think about that from a reduction of misadventures from a drug delivery standpoint, it's perfect and it's also perfect from a productivity enhancement.

Any positive developments related to docetaxel and/or gemcitabine litigation in the US, also an upside lesser than assumed price erosion for oxaliplatin, FDA approval of Zosyn, since Zosyn is not in the guidance that we just covered, the release of ship hold for Propofol and/or Liposyn since both of those products are taken out of the new guidance, better overall product mix and faster than expected recovery of hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010 as it relates to our overall pump business.
And then from a downside standpoint, any further negative developments related to the warning letters or costs associated with the warning letters, greater than assumed price erosion for oxaliplatin and the ability to execute Project Fuel.

We started out the year with very strong sales and profitability, proven mainly by continued strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals. The majority of the contribution came from oxaliplatin, a major oncology drug used in the treatment of colon cancer; and Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent. 
Net sales topped $1 billion this quarter, increasing 17% year-over-year or 13% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 represent a growth of 57% over the first quarter of 2009 EPS of $0.60.
The first quarter included several significant developments for Hospira. We completed the acquisition of Orchid's Generic Injectable Pharmaceuticals business. Integration of Orchid's Injectables Formulation business represents a strong strategic fit. Through this acquisition, we have enhanced our SIP portfolio by fulfilling a key manufacturing and development capability gap in adding new beta-lactam antibiotic compounds to our portfolio.
It also establishes a direct presence for us in India, providing a platform for future growth. We reached the positive agreement on our oxaliplatin patent challenge. Since our third quarter 2009 launch of generic oxaliplatin and solution, we have seen extremely high levels of demand, with only a limited number of competitors offering a solution product. This has resulted in extremely favorable performance over the past several quarters. However, ongoing litigation continued to provide uncertainty as to future prospects. By settling the litigation, we eliminate any litigation risks while securing the right to relaunch our product in 2012 in advance of patent expiry.
On the biogenerics front, we were very pleased to be the first biogeneric to receive approval for subcutaneous use of Retacrit in renal anemia from the European community. This development allows us to serve a broader base of the fast-acting EPO market in Europe, where the subcutaneous indication of the drug represents more than half of the renal usage of the product.
More recently, we entered into a merger agreement and commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares at Javelin Pharmaceuticals. Once approved, the acquisition of Javelin will allow us to capitalize on the synergies between Javelin's main product candidate, Dyloject, a post-operative pain management drug; and Precedex. Both drugs are marketed to anesthesiologists and will be sold through our Precedex sales force upon completion of the acquisition.
Finally, last week, the U.S. district court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in our favor in the ERISA lawsuit related to the spin-off of Hospira from Abbott. We are pleased with the court's ruling, which have validated our long-held position that Hospira had acted in compliance with the law at all times.
So our list of achievements continues to grow. However, we have had our fair share of challenges as well. As you know, two weeks ago, we received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to the inspections earlier this year of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mount, both located in North Carolina.
While the letter does not restrict production or shipment of our products from these facilities, it does address topics related to documentation policies and procedures and validation and investigation practices. More specifically, the FDA cites failure to adequately validate the processes used to manufacture products at Rocky Mount facility; deficiencies related to particulate in certain emulsion products, namely propofol and Liposyn, at the Clayton facility and corporate oversight.
We take these actions very seriously. We are committed to following the FDA's regulations and company operating procedures. To ensure that we address the FDA specific observations and overall expectations and timelines, we are working very closely with the agency, as well as with third-party consultants.
We are confident we can demonstrate to the agency our ability and commitment to not only implement this corrective actions, but also to ensure the global application of all improvements. I am personally engaged in the process and committed to driving a positive resolution to this issue. Quite simply, we built Hospira on a strong foundation of quality, and we intend to stay that course.
That's part of the reason we elected to put a temporary hold on new shipments of propofol and Liposyn products. As you may know, we have had challenges with these emulsion products, which are difficult to manufacture. We have submitted improvements to the manufacturing process for these products to the agency, including the installation of a smaller micron filter designed to filter out the microscopic particulate. 
While we have manufactured both propofol and Liposyn using the improved process, we will not ship any of the products manufactured under the new process until we receive the agency's concurrence with our approach to addressing this issue. The FDA's increased focused on managing the safety and quality of healthcare is raising the bar, and we are raising our bar internally. To that end, we are looking across our global manufacturing operations to ensure that we meet the highest level of compliance with both our pharmaceutical and device products.
On the device side of the business, we continually monitor and evaluate our infusion devices to determine whether changes are needed to improve the quality of the systems. We pay close attention to customer feedback and take action when we see heightened levels of activity. For example, we have recently seen an increase in customer complaints related to the failure of Symbiq to alarm at the end of infusion therapy in certain conditions. 
Regardless of the clinical practice, we need to make certain our pumps have the appropriate safeguards and interfaces under all conditions to achieve the highest level of safety and efficacious. As a result, we have decided to hold new customer shipments of the Symbiq devices until our investigation is complete. While we make the appropriate modifications to the product, we have alerted our customers of the end of infusion condition. This voluntary shipping hold is another step that demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement.
Turning now to Project Fuel. We remain on track with our optimization program, which is designed to simplify our business and drive quality and operational excellence to obtain top-tier financial performance. Since the initiative's inception a year ago, we have eliminated approximately 45% of the total identified list numbers, or SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced in early February. And we continue to progress in streamlining our organizational structure, having notified over 80% of the people impacted by our targeted reduction goal of 1,400 to 1,500 positions.
Furthermore, bolstered by the strong progress and gains from Project Fuel, we have recently made some leadership changes to increase our focus. First, Terry Kearney, our Chief Operating Officer, continues to lead the global operations organization, but now is focused on driving improved quality, efficiencies and collaboration across the supply chain and manufacturing organizations. Although he will no longer be joining us on our quarterly conference calls, he remains a key member of our leadership team, spearheading our lean initiatives and driving optimization through the entire business.
Ron Squarer, previously in charge of our global marketing and corporate development activities, has moved into the newly-created role of Chief Commercial Officer. In this new role, Ron is responsible for delivering long-term sustainable revenue growth across our three regions and our Contract Manufacturing business.
Finally, before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to touch on a key development during the quarter, the passage of healthcare reform legislation in the U.S., which brings increased access to health care for millions of Americans. On the whole, we believe the legislation represents a positive opportunity for Hospira. Its focus on the key areas of quality of care, cost containment and enhanced productivity, is the foundation of what we do at Hospira. And unlike many large pharmaceutical companies, our focus on generic injectable products for the acute care non-retail market means we do not expect a significant impact from the changes to Medicaid that resulted from the legislation.
Where we do expect an impact, a positive impact, is in the establishment of a regulatory pathway for biogenerics in the United States. Hospira has long championed for a biogenerics pathway in the interest of bringing lower-cost, high-quality biogenerics to the American public. So we were pleased that this was incorporated into the healthcare reform legislation.
Overall, we believe the bill is sound, with the exception of the evergreening provision, which as currently written, will allow for an additional period of exclusivity, as a result of minor modifications to an existing drug, thus creating a potential monopoly for branded biologics. We will continue to work to improve the biogenerics legislation, just as Hatch-Waxman has evolved favorably for a small molecule generics since it was passed 25 years ago.
The 12-year exclusivity period in the bill will allow for other innovative life-saving products come to market, which might not have otherwise been available. It will not impact any of the 11 biogenerics in our current pipeline and will ensure a robust future pipeline for Hospira. We are working at full speed to be able to launch biogeneric products in the United States, when the branded biologic patents expire.
Finally, on the device side. There will be an impact from the medical device excise tax component of healthcare legislation. The 2.3% tax will affect a smaller subset of our total revenue beginning in 2013, when we expect the tax will result in an annual after-tax impact of less than $0.10 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,99984481,58153,"Hospira Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Since I'm going to now cover everything from sales to earnings, the format of our call will be slightly different than in the past. I encourage you to use the complementary material that Karen referenced earlier as s",2010,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Since I'm going to now cover everything from sales to earnings, the format of our call will be slightly different than in the past. I encourage you to use the complementary material that Karen referenced earlier as support for some of the statements I'll be making.
I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line.
Global net sales grew 13% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, mainly the result of strong performance from global specialty injectables, which increased 37% during the first quarter. In the Americas, Specialty Injectables net sales were up 43%, primarily attributable to greater-than-anticipated performance of oxaliplatin and Precedex. Excluding the impact of oxaliplatin, the base business grew in the high single digits.
Due to limited competition and continued strong demand for oxaliplatin solution, both volume and price in the quarter were better than we had anticipated, resulting in stronger sales and a favorable adjustment to our chargeback provision recorded in previous quarters. During the quarter, approximately three quarters of the oxaliplatin sales were related to wholesaler demand, with the remaining one quarter resulting from this change to our original chargeback estimate, reflecting more stable end pricing than our original projections.
Looking forward, we've been monitoring market behavior and price erosion over the past month, since we announced the settlement. To date, we've sold over half of the allotted volume agreed upon in the settlement at prices reflecting a more stable price environment. We anticipate selling the remaining volume during the second quarter, as our end date to sell product is June 30. Today, the erosion rate off the branded price remains at approximately 65% to 75%, depending on the channel, which is in line with what we saw in the first quarter. Also contributing to the positive quarter's SIP performance was strong demand and momentum for both Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent, and the new high-dosage heparin presentations we launched in the third quarter of last year.
Moving now to EMEA. Net sales of Specialty Injectables in the region increased 13% in the quarter, driven by continued momentum in many of our recently-launched molecules. We had another strong quarter for Retacrit, with our share of the total short-acting biogeneric market in Europe increasing to more than 50%. And we also introduced docetaxel to various smaller countries throughout Europe. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales of Specialty Injectables increased 19% over prior-year first quarter, driven by solid growth in Australia in what's traditionally a sluggish quarter for generics in the region, as well as strength gemcitabine.
Moving now to devices. Net sales of global Medication Management Systems were up slightly versus the first quarter of 2009. In the Americas, net MMS sales grew 2% in the quarter. Placements were up significantly on a year-over-year basis, with competitive capture rates remaining strong at 70%. We continue to see positive demand for Plum, driven by price-sensitive customers who remain capital constrained.
In EMEA and APAC, first of all, in the EMEA, MMS net sales decreased 6% and they were flat in Asia-Pacific, mainly due to the timing of certain contracts. Dedicated set sales continue to remain favorable, providing a consistent stream of revenue.
Sales in both other pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter. This was primarily due to the divestitures of two of our contract manufacturing facilities in Salisbury, Australia and Wasserburg, Germany, as well as the sale of our critical care product line.
Moving down to the rest of the income statement. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 45.1%, up 560 basis points compared to 39.5% in the first quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement were favorable product mix driven by oxaliplatin, as well as improvements to manufacturing productivity, mainly as a result of Project Fuel efforts.
R&D expense in the quarter was $52 million, up 3% over the first quarter of 2009. As a percentage of net sales, R&D was 5.1% versus 5.8% in the first quarter of 2009. This was less than we anticipated, but it's primarily related to the timing of project spending, which will occur later in the year.
SG&A expense for the first quarter was $179 million, up 23% from $146 million from the same period last year. The increase reflects temporary spending associated with Project Fuel optimization initiatives, as well as additional expenses related to the Precedex sales force expansion, intellectual property, legal expenses, partially offset by Project Fuel cost reduction efforts. SG&A, as a percentage of net sales was 17.7% compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of 2009.
Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $240 million versus $150 million in the first quarter last year. Operating margin adjusted at 23.8% improved by almost 640 basis points versus 17.4% in last year's first quarter. Interest expense decreased 13% to $23 million in the first quarter, down from $27 million last year. This is primarily reflecting the 2009 pay down of debt related to the Mayne acquisition.
Now our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 27%, up from our first quarter 2009 rate of 21.5%. While the increase reflects a slight shift in the mix of earnings versus the first quarter of 2009 somewhat due to oxaliplatin, it's more due to the impact of the failure by our federal government to renew several tax extender bills that we expected to be enacted in the first quarter of 2010. This was contrary to what we had expected. But we do believe that the extenders will be renewed in the second quarter of 2010. Therefore, we're still comfortable with our original guidance for an adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23%.
Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.94 compared to $0.60 last year, an increase of 57%. Turning briefly to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was actually an outflow of $6 million versus an inflow of $89 million last year. This is primarily due to the expected payout of chargebacks during the quarter, as the sales of oxaliplatin moved from wholesaler to end user.
Our cash balance at March 31 was $646 million compared to $946 million at the end of last year and $529 million at March 31 in 2009. As expected, the decline was primarily related to the acquisition of Orchid Pharmaceuticals' Injectable business.
Capital spending in the quarter was $41 million compared to $34 million in the same period last year, as a result of Project Fuel-related spending.
Finally, moving to guidance. Moving to our full year projections, on our fourth quarter 2009 and year-end earnings call in February, we projected 2010 global net sales to be relatively flat on a constant-currency basis or flat to slightly up on a reported basis. We also projected EPS in a range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share. Since the time of the call, several variables have surfaced that could positively or negatively impact guidance. I'm going to walk you through each of these variables, which ultimately will result in an increase in both sales and adjusted EPS guidance relative to our prior guidance.
Starting with the positive variables. First, the Orchid acquisition. When we provided full year guidance on our fourth quarter call, we indicated that our sales guidance did not include sales associated with the as yet not closed acquisition of Orchid's Generic Injectable Pharmaceutical business. Now having completed the acquisition last month, we're updating 2010 guidance. Net sales of Orchid for the nine months of 2010 since the close date will add about $55 million to our sales, distributed fairly evenly between the remaining three quarters.
In addition to Orchid, the other positive factor relative to our full year guidance is oxaliplatin. There are two dynamics that we have to consider when discussing oxaliplatin, that being timing and pricing. Our initial projection for oxaliplatin in 2010 assumes continued price erosion throughout the year with sales relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter.
The terms of the recent settlement, however, call for us to stop selling oxaliplatin on June 30, 2010. So we now anticipate that the sales we have previously assumed for the second half of the year will be accelerated into the first half. And in the first quarter, we experienced very little price erosion to oxaliplatin compared to fourth quarter pricing levels. Since we had assumed greater erosion rates throughout the course of the year, the increase in volume at higher price levels in the first quarter had a significant impact for us. As a result, we're modifying our full year guidance based on these factors.
Now offsetting these positive contributors are the voluntary actions we've decided to take that may have a negative financial impact to future results. First, as Chris discussed with you earlier, our recent warning letter from the FDA and what we're doing to bring the issues identified to a positive resolution. While we're in the process of implementing corrective actions in our manufacturing propofol and Liposyn today, we will not start shipping these products until we receive the agency's concurrence with our approach to addressing this issue.
We recognize there's a market shortage of these important drugs and are hopeful that we'll be able to demonstrate resolution to FDA quickly. However, to be as transparent as possible, we've chosen to remove future sales of both propofol and Liposyn from our full year 2010 guidance. Second, the voluntary hold we placed on shipments of Symbiq to new customers. The pumps will remain on hold until we can complete our investigation and make the appropriate modifications. 
While we're working diligently on the issue, we can't predict the timing of resolution. As a result, we're removing future sales of Symbiq devices from our full year 2010 guidance. Between the addition of Orchid sales and better-than-anticipated performance of oxaliplatin in the first quarter, partially offset by certain product shipping holds, we're still increasing our guidance for global net sales to 3% to 5% on a constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange contributing a positive 1%.
As most of the impact will be to the Americas region, we're increasing net sales in the Americas to 2% to 4%. Net sales guidance for EMEA and APAC will remain at the previously-disclosed ranges of 7% to 9% for EMEA and 2% to 4% for Asia-Pacific. Margin contribution from oxaliplatin will be partially offset by the ship hold issues, as well as increased R&D spending in the back part of the year from the acquisition of Orchid and increased Project Fuel IT expenses.
Accordingly, gross margin and operating margin percent guidance will remain unchanged. I mentioned earlier in my discussion that we're maintaining our adjusted tax rate guidance of 22% to 23% for 2010. We do believe that the extender bills will be renewed in the second quarter of 2010, having a favorable impact on our second quarter tax rate, as we bring the year-to-date rate to our initial guidance.
Moving finally to EPS and then cash flow. While the Orchid transaction is immaterial to EPS in 2010, the result of strong performance with oxaliplatin, offset by the product shipping holds, still will result in an increase in full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance, now to a range of $3.35 to $3.45% per share, an 8% to 11% growth rate over the prior year.
We expect that second quarter EPS will be the softest quarter, with sequential earnings growth in the latter half of the year. We're also increasing our guidance for cash flow from operations up to $625 million to $675 million due to the strong U.S. oxaliplatin sales in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization will increase to $250 million to $260 million, also as a result of the Orchid acquisition and guidance for capital spending remains unchanged. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

We'll have to see how the second quarter plays out with respect to price erosion, and then as you know, at June 30 we're done. So hopefully, we don't have any spillover for chargeback adjustments into the third quarter. But the amount of product that's been purchased by the wholesalers, it's pretty difficult to tell exactly when it's going to run out, when the chargebacks are going to come in. But as you look at EPS, we're up a $0.10, and I'll just kind of take you through the major pieces and without specifically quantifying oxali, I think those here on the call can probably piece it together. So first thing that we've, I guess, called incorrectly was our share count. And you may note in our 10-Q that we've slightly changed the language on the share buyback authorization. Our shares are up almost eight million shares from the first quarter of last year. They were at 161 million, they're now up to 169 million. So we're going to begin to evaluate whether there's some steps we can take to at least stabilize the share count. As it stands, the assumption right now is that the share count won't get any higher and the increase obviously is related to the high level of option exercises. If the share count doesn't get any higher, that's about a negative $0.08 per share impact, and that's just -- it was hard to estimate the number of exercises. Collectively, the product holds and the costs that we believe are necessary to get things fixed, that's about a quarter of negative. And then between oxaliplatin and some other moving pieces in various parts of the business, primarily in the U.S. and in EMEA, that's sort of the delta that would allow us to take the guidance up about a $0.10. And of the positive oxaliplatin is a large portion of it, but it's not the only item that's swinging in our favor."

As we said in the prepared comments, earnings in the second quarter would be the softest for the year, and that's going to be driven by lower margins. So we have to sort of wind off of oxaliplatin. There'll be much less of oxaliplatin recorded in the second quarter, and then margins will begin to rebound in the back part of the year, aided by better margin performance, as well as increased savings from Project Fuel. Within the quarter, I went back yesterday and did an analysis that took the oxaliplatin, and put the chargeback adjustments into the correct quarter. And as we said today, it's about 25% to 30% of what we recorded this quarter was chargeback related, but as you recall, we sold very little product in the fourth quarter. So most of the chargeback goes back to the initial bunch of sales that we did in the third quarter of last year. So when you get the chargebacks into the right period, margins had been pretty stable and we had taken some reserves in the third and fourth quarter last year, related to some of these product actions propofol, Liposyn and some of other things, the power cord as well, and when you clean that out margins look fairly stable. So the 45% this quarter, if you get the chargeback out of there, it's not 45%, it's 200-some basis points, less than that. So Q2 will drop down, and then we'll begin to progress back up and still be able to hit the 42% to 43% for the year."

The ship hold is a very recent occurrence, and it occurred because we were monitoring our data from our customers, okay, our complaint data, and we saw a spike in our airline [ph] complaints from certain clinical practices, and we really believe when we saw that, that we needed to take a deep breath and do a thorough investigation to make sure that we understand how perhaps clinical practices have shifted or how Symbiq might be used in the clinic versus other infusion pump technology. And so we have underway a thorough investigation to better understand this, and then we've been dialoguing with the FDA ever since we saw the spike. And then subsequently, when we put the product on hold towards the end of last week. And so we don't have an answer yet at this point in time. The other thing I will share with you though, is we do believe it is something that we can solve. We actually have a newer version of software with Symbiq, which is scheduled to go into the FDA towards the end of this quarter. And so what we're targeting is to have our investigation completed, understand, if there's any changes that need to be made or further education with the customer base. And then, if a change needs to be made, to incorporate it into that new software version that we plan on filing at the end of Q2. Then obviously, because it is a new filing, it's got to go through all the processes that a new product would, with the FDA, and we believe it was a prudent thing to do because of the nature of the event. And we did it before the FDA went public with this increased, heightened awareness around infusion pumps, okay. And so it's not a reaction to that, but obviously, I think we did the right thing in trying to make sure that we understand this and that we have the very best product out there for all different types of clinical applications."

And so obviously, the more we can do to improve patient safety, and if you think about it, I was thinking about this last night, as you read through their press release and the guidance document, drug libraries fit perfectly into what they're talking about, all right, because the incidences that they're giving are the wrong drug being delivered at wrong patient or the wrong amount. And so what the industry is doing from a drug library standpoint is fantastic, all right, and so what we need to do is increase the adoption of that in the marketplace and perhaps, get some regulations whether it's State or Federal to drive the increased usage of drug libraries. Because what they're talking about, at least on the surface, a drug library implemented appropriately and that worked with a hospital pharmacy system and a barcode system would take care of those misadventures. And as we talked about, with our analysts, with our shareholders, our employees and quite candidly our customers, this whole issue of drug misadventure is not a new one at all, okay. It's something that we're highly focused on. It's why we've made some of the investments that we've made and some of the call it fringe software technologies to incorporate those into our infusion pump technology.

And it's very, very synergistic with our Precedex sales organization. And we believe from the clinical data that we've had an opportunity to review thoroughly that Dyloject can be an excellent product for us, and for those listeners who aren't as familiar with it, it is a pain drug, okay. And as you look at the pain marketplace, there's really three different segments to the pain marketplace: Mild, moderate and severe. And the mild market is taken care of by things like Tylenol, Advil, et cetera. It's not a market that interests us whatsoever, but the moderate to severe is one that is right in our wheelhouse, because it's what takes place from a hospital standpoint. And from everything that we can tell on Dyloject, it does a good job of taking care of both the moderate and severe pain segments, and it doesn't have the side effects that are associated with opioid drug products, such as nausea and constipation, because this is a non-opiate pain product. And the other beauty of it is, it's not an infused product, it's a syringe push product. So the delivery of it and the convenience of it is much nicer for our customers. From a potential standpoint, we see this with the similar type of potential as what Precedex has, and quite candidly, we keep raising the bar and the performance level on Precedex, as it's being accepted more in the U.S. and quite candidly around the world where we believe Precedex and Dyloject have the potential of generating northward of $150 million worth of sales."

Not just hospital infusion devices, but infusion devices associated with delivering insulin for people who are diabetic. And it all ties, I think perfectly to the report that was done several years ago around the level of misadventures that occur in drug delivery, and that occurs on the injectable side, but it also occurs on the oral solid side and our biggest interest is in the injectable side. And the very high level, Hospira does two things. We keep the high cost of proprietary products down with our generic portfolio, and the other thing we do is we reduce medication errors. And so that is part of what we do, it's part of the fabric of our culture. And we will do whatever it takes from a technology quality improvement standpoint to make sure that we are able to deliver the best product out there. It's interesting, we now have, I believe it's either, I think it's free now, sites up and running with auto programming, where the infusion pump is actually automatically programmed by the wireless network system in the hospital, and what the nurse does is she walks up, reads what's in the pump, confirms it and hits run.

The following are the upsides that we see potentially: Any positive developments related to docetaxel and/or gemcitabine litigation in the U.S.; also an upside lesser-than-assumed price erosion for oxaliplatin; FDA approval of Zosyn, since Zosyn is not in the guidance that we just covered; the release of ship hold for propofol and/or Liposyn, since both of those products are taken out of the new guidance; better overall product mix; and faster-than-expected recovery of hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010 as it relates to overall pump business. 
And then from a downside standpoint: Any further negative developments related to the warning letters or costs associated with the warning letters; greater-than-assumed price erosion for oxaliplatin;  And ability to execute Project Fuel.

We started out the year with very strong sales and profitability, proven mainly by continued strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals. The majority of the contribution came from oxaliplatin, a major oncology drug used in the treatment of colon cancer; and Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent. 
Net sales topped $1 billion this quarter, increasing 17% year-over-year or 13% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 represent a growth of 57% over the first quarter of 2009 EPS of $0.60.
The first quarter included several significant developments for Hospira. We completed the acquisition of Orchid's Generic Injectable Pharmaceuticals business. Integration of Orchid's Injectables Formulation business represents a strong strategic fit. Through this acquisition, we have enhanced our SIP portfolio by fulfilling a key manufacturing and development capability gap in adding new beta-lactam antibiotic compounds to our portfolio.
It also establishes a direct presence for us in India, providing a platform for future growth. We reached the positive agreement on our oxaliplatin patent challenge. Since our third quarter 2009 launch of generic oxaliplatin in solution, we have seen extremely high levels of demand, with only a limited number of competitors offering a solution product. This has resulted in extremely favorable performance over the past several quarters. However, ongoing litigation continued to provide uncertainty as to future prospects. By settling the litigation, we eliminate any litigation risk while securing the right to relaunch our product in 2012 in advance of patent expiry.
On the biogenerics front, we were very pleased to be the first biogeneric to receive approval for subcutaneous use of Retacrit in renal anemia from the European community. This development allows us to serve a broader base of the fast-acting EPO [erythropoietin] market in Europe, where the subcutaneous indication of the drug represents more than half of the renal usage of the product.
More recently, we entered into a merger agreement and commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares at Javelin Pharmaceuticals. Once approved, the acquisition of Javelin will allow us to capitalize on the synergies between Javelin's main product candidate, Dyloject, a postoperative pain management drug, and Precedex. Both drugs are marketed to anesthesiologists and will be sold through our Precedex sales force upon completion of the acquisition.
Finally, last week, the U.S. district court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in our favor in the ERISA lawsuit related to the spin-off of Hospira from Abbott. We are pleased with the court's ruling, which have validated our long-held position that Hospira had acted in compliance with the law at all times.
So our list of achievements continues to grow. However, we have had our fair share of challenges as well. As you know, two weeks ago, we received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to the inspections earlier this year of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mount, both located in North Carolina.
While the letter does not restrict production or shipment of our products from these facilities, it does address topics related to documentation policies and procedures and validation and investigation practices. More specifically, the FDA cites failure to adequately validate the processes used to manufacture products at Rocky Mount facility; deficiencies related to particulate in certain emulsion products, namely propofol and Liposyn, at the Clayton facility and corporate oversight.
We take these actions very seriously. We are committed to following the FDA's regulations and company operating procedures. To ensure that we address the FDA specific observations and overall expectations and timelines, we are working very closely with the agency, as well as with third-party consultants.
We are confident we can demonstrate to the agency our ability and commitment to not only implement this corrective actions, but also to ensure the global application of all improvements. I am personally engaged in the process and committed to driving a positive resolution to this issue. Quite simply, we built Hospira on a strong foundation of quality, and we intend to stay that course.
That's part of the reason we elected to put a temporary hold on new shipments of propofol and Liposyn products. As you may know, we have had challenges with these emulsion products, which are difficult to manufacture. We have submitted improvements to the manufacturing process for these products to the agency, including the installation of a smaller micron filter designed to filter out the microscopic particulate. 
While we have manufactured both propofol and Liposyn using the improved process, we will not ship any of the products manufactured under the new process until we receive the agency's concurrence with our approach to addressing this issue. The FDA's increased focused on managing the safety and quality of healthcare is raising the bar, and we are raising our bar internally. To that end, we are looking across our global manufacturing operations to ensure that we meet the highest level of compliance with both our pharmaceutical and device products.
On the device side of the business, we continually monitor and evaluate our infusion devices to determine whether changes are needed to improve the quality of the systems. We pay close attention to customer feedback and take action when we see heightened levels of activity. For example, we have recently seen an increase in customer complaints related to the failure of Symbiq to alarm at the end of infusion therapy in certain conditions. 
Regardless of the clinical practice, we need to make certain our pumps have the appropriate safeguards and interfaces under all conditions to achieve the highest level of safety and efficacious. As a result, we have decided to hold new customer shipments of the Symbiq devices until our investigation is complete. While we make the appropriate modifications to the product, we have alerted our customers of the end of infusion condition. This voluntary shipping hold is another step that demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement.
Turning now to Project Fuel. We remain on track with our optimization program, which is designed to simplify our business and drive quality and operational excellence to obtain top-tier financial performance. Since the initiative's inception a year ago, we have eliminated approximately 45% of the total identified list numbers, or SKUs, which compares to the 30% we announced in early February. And we continue to progress in streamlining our organizational structure, having notified over 80% of the people impacted by our targeted reduction goal of 1,400 to 1,500 positions.
Furthermore, bolstered by the strong progress and gains from Project Fuel, we have recently made some leadership changes to increase our focus. First, Terry Kearney, our Chief Operating Officer, continues to lead the global operations organization, but now is focused on driving improved quality, efficiencies and collaboration across the supply chain and manufacturing organizations. Although he will no longer be joining us on our quarterly conference calls, he remains a key member of our leadership team, spearheading our lean initiatives and driving optimization through the entire business.
Ron Squarer, previously in charge of our global marketing and corporate development activities, has moved into the newly-created role of Chief Commercial Officer. In this new role, Ron is responsible for delivering long-term sustainable revenue growth across our three regions and our Contract Manufacturing business.
Finally, before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to touch on a key development during the quarter, the passage of healthcare reform legislation in the U.S., which brings increased access to health care for millions of Americans. On the whole, we believe the legislation represents a positive opportunity for Hospira. Its focus on the key areas of quality of care, cost containment and enhanced productivity, is the foundation of what we do at Hospira. And unlike many large pharmaceutical companies, our focus on generic injectable products for the acute care non-retail market means we do not expect a significant impact from the changes to Medicaid that resulted from the legislation.
Where we do expect an impact, a positive impact, is in the establishment of a regulatory pathway for biogenerics in the United States. Hospira has long championed for a biogenerics pathway in the interest of bringing lower-cost, high-quality biogenerics to the American public. So we were pleased that this was incorporated into the healthcare reform legislation.
Overall, we believe the bill is sound, with the exception of the evergreening provision, which as currently written, will allow for an additional period of exclusivity, as a result of minor modifications to an existing drug, thus creating a potential monopoly for branded biologics. We will continue to work to improve the biogenerics legislation, just as Hatch-Waxman has evolved favorably for a small molecule generics since it was passed 25 years ago.
The 12-year exclusivity period in the bill will allow for other innovative life-saving products come to market, which might not have otherwise been available. It will not impact any of the 11 biogenerics in our current pipeline and will ensure a robust future pipeline for Hospira. We are working at full speed to be able to launch biogeneric products in the United States, when the branded biologic patents expire.
Finally, on the device side. There will be an impact from the medical device excise tax component of healthcare legislation. The 2.3% tax will affect a smaller subset of our total revenue beginning in 2013, when we expect the tax will result in an annual after-tax impact of less than $0.10 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,99984481,61279,"Hospira Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone.

Since I'm going to now cover everything from sales to earnings, the format of our call will be slightly different than in the past. I encourage you to use the complementary material that Karen referenced earlier as support for some of the statements I'll be making.
I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line.
Global net sales grew 13% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, mainly the result of strong performance from global specialty injectables, which increased 37% during the first quarter. In the Americas, Specialty Injectables net sales were up 43%, primarily attributable to greater-than-anticipated performance of oxaliplatin and Precedex. Excluding the impact of oxaliplatin, the base business grew in the high single digits.
Due to limited competition and continued strong demand for oxaliplatin solution, both volume and price in the quarter were better than we had anticipated, resulting in stronger sales and a favorable adjustment to our chargeback provision recorded in previous quarters. During the quarter, approximately three quarters of the oxaliplatin sales were related to wholesaler demand, with the remaining one quarter resulting from this change to our original chargeback estimate, reflecting more stable end pricing than our original projections.
Looking forward, we've been monitoring market behavior and price erosion over the past month, since we announced the settlement. To date, we've sold over half of the allotted volume agreed upon in the settlement at prices reflecting a more stable price environment. We anticipate selling the remaining volume during the second quarter, as our end date to sell product is June 30. 
Today, the erosion rate off the branded price remains at approximately 65% to 75%, depending on the channel, which is in line with what we saw in the first quarter. Also contributing to the positive quarter's SIP performance was strong demand and momentum for both Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent, and the new high-dosage heparin presentations we launched in the third quarter of last year.
Moving now to EMEA. Net sales of Specialty Injectables in the region increased 13% in the quarter, driven by continued momentum in many of our recently-launched molecules. We had another strong quarter for Retacrit, with our share of the total short-acting biogeneric market in Europe increasing to more than 50%. And we also introduced docetaxel to various smaller countries throughout Europe. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales of Specialty Injectables increased 19% over prior-year first quarter, driven by solid growth in Australia in what's traditionally a sluggish quarter for generics in the region, as well as strength in gemcitabine.  
Moving now to devices. Net sales of global Medication Management Systems were up slightly versus the first quarter of 2009. In the Americas, net MMS sales grew 2% in the quarter. Placements were up significantly on a year-over-year basis, with competitive capture rates remaining strong at 70%. We continue to see positive demand for Plum, driven by price-sensitive customers who remain capital constrained.
In EMEA and APAC, first of all, in the EMEA, MMS net sales decreased 6% and they were flat in Asia-Pacific, mainly due to the timing of certain contracts. Dedicated set sales continue to remain favorable, providing a consistent stream of revenue.
Sales in both other pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter. This was primarily due to the divestitures of two of our contract manufacturing facilities in Salisbury, Australia and Wasserburg, Germany, as well as the sale of our critical care product line.
Moving down, the rest of the income statement. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 45.1%, up 560 basis points compared to 39.5% in the first quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement were favorable product mix driven by oxaliplatin, as well as improvements to manufacturing productivity, mainly as a result of Project Fuel efforts.
R&D expense in the quarter was $52 million, up 3% over the first quarter of 2009. As a percentage of net sales, R&D was 5.1% versus 5.8% in the first quarter of 2009. This was less than we anticipated, but it's primarily related to the timing of project spending, which will occur later in the year.
SG&A expense for the first quarter was $179 million, up 23% from $146 million from the same period last year. The increase reflects temporary spending associated with Project Fuel optimization initiatives, as well as additional expenses related to the Precedex sales force expansion, intellectual property, legal expenses, partially offset by Project Fuel cost reduction efforts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 17.7% compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of 2009.
Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $240 million versus $150 million in the first quarter last year. Operating margin adjusted at 23.8% improved by almost 640 basis points versus 17.4% in last year's first quarter. Interest expense decreased 13% to $23 million in the first quarter, down from $27 million last year. This is primarily reflecting the 2009 pay down of debt related to the Mayne acquisition.
Now our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 27%, up from our first quarter 2009 rate of 21.5%. While the increase reflects a slight shift in the mix of earnings versus the first quarter of 2009 somewhat due to oxaliplatin, it's more due to the impact of the failure by our federal government to renew several tax extender bills that we expected to be enacted in the first quarter of 2010. This was contrary to what we had expected. But we do believe that the extenders will be renewed in the second quarter of 2010. Therefore, we're still comfortable with our original guidance for an adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23%.
Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.94 compared to $0.60 last year, an increase of 57%. Turning briefly to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was actually an outflow of $6 million versus an inflow of $89 million last year. This is primarily due to the expected payout of chargebacks during the quarter, as the sales of oxaliplatin moved from wholesaler to end user.
Our cash balance at March 31 was $646 million compared to $946 million at the end of last year and $529 million at March 31 in 2009. As expected, the decline was primarily related to the acquisition of Orchid Pharmaceuticals' Injectable business.
Capital spending in the quarter was $41 million compared to $34 million in the same period last year, as a result of Project Fuel-related spending.
Finally, moving to guidance. Moving to our full year projections, on our fourth quarter 2009 and year-end earnings call in February, we projected 2010 global net sales to be relatively flat on a constant-currency basis or flat to slightly up on a reported basis. We also projected EPS in a range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share. Since the time of the call, several variables have surfaced that could positively or negatively impact guidance. I'm going to walk you through each of these variables, which ultimately will result in an increase in both sales and adjusted EPS guidance relative to our prior guidance.
Starting with the positive variables. First, the Orchid acquisition. When we provided full year guidance on our fourth quarter call, we indicated that our sales guidance did not include sales associated with the as yet not closed acquisition of Orchid's Generic Injectable Pharmaceutical business. Now having completed the acquisition last month, we're updating 2010 guidance. Net sales of Orchid for the nine months of 2010 since the close date will add about $55 million to our sales, distributed fairly evenly between the remaining three quarters.
In addition to Orchid, the other positive factor relative to our full year guidance is oxaliplatin. There are two dynamics that we have to consider when discussing oxaliplatin, that being timing and pricing. Our initial projection for oxaliplatin in 2010 assumes continued price erosion throughout the year with sales relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter.
The terms of the recent settlement, however, call for us to stop selling oxaliplatin on June 30, 2010. So we now anticipate that the sales we have previously assumed for the second half of the year will be accelerated into the first half. And in the first quarter, we experienced very little price erosion to oxaliplatin compared to fourth quarter pricing levels. Since we had assumed greater erosion rates throughout the course of the year, the increase in volume at higher price levels in the first quarter had a significant impact for us. As a result, we're modifying our full year guidance based on these factors.
Now offsetting these positive contributors are the voluntary actions we've decided to take that may have a negative financial impact to future results. First, as Chris discussed with you earlier, our recent warning letter from the FDA and what we're doing to bring the issues identified to a positive resolution. While we're in the process of implementing corrective actions in our manufacturing propofol and Liposyn today, we will not start shipping these products until we receive the agency's concurrence with our approach to addressing this issue.
We recognize there's a market shortage of these important drugs and are hopeful that we'll be able to demonstrate resolution to FDA quickly. However, to be as transparent as possible, we've chosen to remove future sales of both propofol and Liposyn from our full year 2010 guidance. Second, the voluntary hold we placed on shipments of Symbiq to new customers. The pumps will remain on hold until we can complete our investigation and make the appropriate modifications. 
While we're working diligently on the issue, we can't predict the timing of resolution. As a result, we're removing future sales of Symbiq devices from our full year 2010 guidance. Between the addition of Orchid sales and better-than-anticipated performance of oxaliplatin in the first quarter, partially offset by certain product shipping holds, we're still increasing our guidance for global net sales to 3% to 5% on a constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange contributing a positive 1%.
As most of the impact will be to the Americas region, we're increasing net sales in the Americas to 2% to 4%. Net sales guidance for EMEA and APAC will remain at the previously-disclosed ranges of 7% to 9% for EMEA and 2% to 4% for Asia-Pacific. Margin contribution from oxaliplatin will be partially offset by the ship hold issues, as well as increased R&D spending in the back part of the year from the acquisition of Orchid and increased Project Fuel IT expenses.
Accordingly, gross margin and operating margin percent guidance will remain unchanged. I mentioned earlier in my discussion that we're maintaining our adjusted tax rate guidance of 22% to 23% for 2010. We do believe that the extender bills will be renewed in the second quarter of 2010, having a favorable impact on our second quarter tax rate, as we bring the year-to-date rate to our initial guidance.
Moving finally to EPS and then cash flow. While the Orchid transaction is immaterial to EPS in 2010, the result of strong performance with oxaliplatin, offset by the product shipping holds, still will result in an increase in full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance, now to a range of $3.35 to $3.45% per share, an 8% to 11% growth rate over the prior year.
We expect that second quarter EPS will be the softest quarter, with sequential earnings growth in the latter half of the year. We're also increasing our guidance for cash flow from operations up to $625 million to $675 million due to the strong U.S. oxaliplatin sales in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization will increase to $250 million to $260 million, also as a result of the Orchid acquisition and guidance for capital spending remains unchanged. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

We'll have to see how the second quarter plays out with respect to price erosion, and then as you know, at June 30 we're done. So hopefully, we don't have any spillover for chargeback adjustments into the third quarter. But the amount of product that's been purchased by the wholesalers, it's pretty difficult to tell exactly when it's going to run out, when the chargebacks are going to come in. But as you look at EPS, we're up a dime, and I'll just kind of take you through the major pieces. And without specifically quantifying oxali, I think those here on the call can probably piece it together. So first thing that we've, I guess, called incorrectly was our share count. And you may note in our 10-Q that we've slightly changed the language on the share buyback authorization. Our shares are up almost eight million shares from the first quarter of last year. They were at 161 million, they're now up to 169 million. So we're going to begin to evaluate whether there are some steps we can take to at least stabilize the share count. As it stands, the assumption right now is that the share count won't get any higher, and the increase obviously is related to the high level of option exercises. If the share count doesn't get any higher, that's about a negative $0.08 per share impact. It was hard to estimate the number of exercises. Collectively, the product holds and the costs that we believe are necessary to get things fixed, that's about a quarter of negative. And then between oxaliplatin and some other moving pieces in various parts of the business, primarily in the U.S. and in EMEA, that's sort of the delta that would allow us to take the guidance up about a dime. And the positive oxaliplatin is a large portion of it, but it's not the only item that's swinging in our favor."

As we said in the prepared comments, earnings in the second quarter would be the softest for the year, and that's going to be driven by lower margins. So we have to sort of wind off of oxaliplatin. There'll be much less of oxaliplatin recorded in the second quarter. And then margins will begin to rebound in the back part of the year, aided by better manufacturing performance, as well as increased savings from Project Fuel. Within the quarter, I went back yesterday and did an analysis that took the oxaliplatin, and put the chargeback adjustments into the correct quarter. And as we said today, it's about 25% to 30% of what we recorded this quarter was chargeback related. But as you recall, we sold very little product in the fourth quarter. So most of the chargeback goes back to the initial bunch of sales that we did in the third quarter of last year. So when you get the chargebacks into the right period, margins had been pretty stable. And we had taken some reserves in the third and fourth quarter last year related to some of these product actions, propofol, Liposyn and some of other things, the power cord as well. And when you clean that out, margins look fairly stable. So the 45% this quarter, if you get the chargeback out of there, it's not 45%. It's 200-some basis points less than that. So Q2 will drop down, and then we'll begin to progress back up and still be able to hit the 42% to 43% for the year."

First of all, let me give a little context to the Symbiq ship hold. First of all, in 2009, if you looked at our shipments of infusion pumps, approximately 80% of them were our Plum technology-base and about 20% for Symbiq. For the first quarter, we've seen a shift to 90% Plum, 10% Symbiq, and the primary reason for that shift is we're beginning to see the availability of capital with our customers, but the amount of capital that is available is less. So capital is beginning to free up, but they're really looking for a lower price point than where Symbiq was. And so for Q1, we ran a 90-10 split of the two different technologies all right. And on Symbiq specifically, let me give some additional color. The ship hold is a very recent occurrence, and it occurred because we were monitoring our data from our customers, okay, our complaint data, and we saw a spike in our airline [ph] complaints from certain clinical practices, and we really believe when we saw that, that we needed to take a deep breath and do a thorough investigation to make sure that we understand how perhaps clinical practices have shifted or how Symbiq might be used in the clinic versus other infusion pump technology. And so we have underway a thorough investigation to better understand this, and then we've been dialoguing with the FDA ever since we saw the spike. And then subsequently, when we put the product on hold towards the end of last week. And so we don't have an answer yet at this point in time. The other thing I will share with you though, is we do believe it is something that we can solve. We actually have a newer version of software with Symbiq, which is scheduled to go into the FDA towards the end of this quarter. And so what we're targeting is to have our investigation completed, understand, if there's any changes that need to be made or further education with the customer base. And then, if a change needs to be made, to incorporate it into that new software version that we plan on filing at the end of Q2. Then obviously, because it is a new filing, it's got to go through all the processes that a new product would, with the FDA, and we believe it was a prudent thing to do because of the nature of the event. And we did it before the FDA went public with this increased, heightened awareness around infusion pumps, okay. And so it's not a reaction to that, but obviously, I think we did the right thing in trying to make sure that we understand this and that we have the very best product out there for all different types of clinical applications."

And so what the industry is doing from a drug library standpoint is fantastic, all right, and so what we need to do is increase the adoption of that in the marketplace and perhaps, get some regulations whether it's State or Federal to drive the increased usage of drug libraries. Because what they're talking about, at least on the surface, a drug library implemented appropriately and that worked with a hospital pharmacy system and a barcode system would take care of those misadventures. And as we talked about, with our analysts, with our shareholders, our employees and quite candidly our customers, this whole issue of drug misadventure is not a new one at all, okay.

And the mild market is taken care of by things like Tylenol, Advil, et cetera. It's not a market that interests us whatsoever, but the moderate to severe is one that is right in our wheelhouse, because it's what takes place from a hospital standpoint. And from everything that we can tell on Dyloject, it does a good job of taking care of both the moderate and severe pain segments, and it doesn't have the side effects that are associated with opioid drug products, such as nausea and constipation, because this is a non-opiate pain product. And the other beauty of it is, it's not an infused product, it's a syringe push product. So the delivery of it and the convenience of it is much nicer for our customers.

Not just hospital infusion devices, but infusion devices associated with delivering insulin for people who are diabetic. And it all ties, I think perfectly to the report that was done several years ago around the level of misadventures that occur in drug delivery, and that occurs on the injectable side, but it also occurs on the oral solid side and our biggest interest is in the injectable side. And the very high level, Hospira does two things. We keep the high cost of proprietary products down with our generic portfolio, and the other thing we do is we reduce medication errors. And so that is part of what we do, it's part of the fabric of our culture. And we will do whatever it takes from a technology quality improvement standpoint to make sure that we are able to deliver the best product out there. It's interesting, we now have, I believe it's either, I think it's free now, sites up and running with auto programming, where the infusion pump is actually automatically programmed by the wireless network system in the hospital, and what the nurse does is she walks up, reads what's in the pump, confirms it and hits run.

Thank you. Let me wrap up with one last thing before we end the call, and I didn't get asked about the positives and the negatives or upsides and downsides, as it relates to guidance. But let me cover that because you may find it helpful from a guidance standpoint. 
The following are the upsides that we see potentially: any positive developments related to docetaxel and/or gemcitabine litigation in the U.S.; also an upside lesser-than-assumed price erosion for oxaliplatin; FDA approval of Zosyn, since Zosyn is not in the guidance that we just covered; the release of ship hold for propofol and/or Liposyn, since both of those products are taken out of the new guidance; better overall product mix; and faster-than-expected recovery of hospital capital spending environment in the back half of 2010, as it relates to overall Pump business. And then from a downside standpoint: any further negative developments related to the warning letters or costs associated with the warning letters; greater-than-assumed price erosion for oxaliplatin;  And ability to execute Project Fuel. So that's how we would frame the upsides and downsides to the guidance that we just covered.

We had another solid quarter, driven mainly by continued strength in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals. The majority of the positive performance came from oxaliplatin, an oncology drug used in the treatment of colon cancer, and Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent.
Net sales were $968 million this quarter, increasing 1% year-over-year or relatively flat excluding the impact of foreign currency. If we look at the results, excluding the impact of the divestitures we have made as part of Project Fuel, net sales grew 5% compared to the second quarter of 2009 on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 represented growth of 18% over the second quarter 2009 EPS of $0.73.
We had several significant achievements during the quarter and in more recent weeks. We received approval for injectable meropenem, launching the generic anti-infective at the end of the quarter. Meropenem is the first generic carbapenem drug approved in the US and the first drug to launch from our recent acquisition of the generic injectable business of Orchid Pharmaceuticals, which we now reference as Hospira India.
So far, we are the only company to have launched a generic version of the drug, which has branded sales of $200 million in US last year. We completed two transactions, which provide Hospira with a couple of new pain management products that will bolster our leadership position in acute care proprietary pharmaceuticals.
The first is a signed agreement with DURECT to develop and commercialize POSIDUR, a long-acting version of the anesthetic bupivicaine in the US and Canada. POSIDUR is designed to provide up to 72 hours of anesthetic directly at the site of a surgical wound, with the potential to reduce post-surgical pain and allow earlier patient mobility and hospital discharge.
The second was the acquisition of Javelin Pharmaceuticals, which we successfully completed in early July. As with DURECT, Javelin will allow us to capitalize on the synergies between Javelin’s main product candidate Dyloject, a post-operative pain management drug, and Precedex. Both Dyloject and POSIDUR will be marketed to anesthesiologists and sold to our Precedex sales force.
During the quarter, we were also awarded five-year contracts by Novation, the largest group purchasing organization in the US. The contracts, which take effect in October, provide us additional access to Novation’s University HealthSystem Consortium member hospitals. We are already meeting with prospective customers regarding future MMS opportunities.
On the biosimilar front, we were very pleased to receive approval from the European Commission for Nivestim, our second commercially available biogeneric. Nivestim is our brand name for generic filgrastim, a drug used to boost white blood cells. We will be leveraging the strong Retacrit sales force we’ve developed across the European region to market Nivestim as well.
Finally, we announced earlier this week the start of our US Phase I clinical trial for biosimilar erythropoietin or EPO in renal patients. The goal of the Phase I trial is to test the safety in pharmacokinetics of our biosimilar EPO compared with the reference product. Pending the successful completion of the Phase I trial, we would then launch an expanded Phase III trial in 2011.
I would like to update you at this point on the progress we have made towards resolving some of the situations we discussed with you last quarter. First, the warning letter we received from the US FDA related to inspections of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mountain, North Carolina.
We submitted our response to the FDA in May and have subsequently met with the agency to discuss our plans and objectives. We believe the FDA has accepted the remediation plan we laid out. We are now dedicated to fulfilling the planned commitments, the bulk of which we expect to complete by year-end. As part of our commitment to transparency and proactive communication, we are providing bimonthly updates to the FDA and are pleased with the progress so far.
Second, Propofol. While Propofol remains on voluntary hold here, two, we are making progress. In April, we submitted our proposed manufacturing process improvements to the agency, including the installation of a finer micron filter designed to filter out the sub-visual particulate. We have since met with the FDA, and while the agency accepted the micron filter change, they have asked us to explore additional enhancements to our manufacturing process. We are currently in the process of implementing these changes.
Third, on the device side of the business, we have spent the past couple of months identifying the root cause related to the failure of some of our Symbiq devices to alarm at the end of infusion therapy under certain conditions of use. We have been in continued communications with our customers during this time and have provided them with temporary mitigation plans. We will soon be submitting our corrective action response to the FDA.
The next step is to set the meeting to review the response, and our expectation is that the meeting should occur sometime in the third quarter. New customer pump shipments will remain on voluntary shiphold until we have approval from the FDA regarding our approach and have made the appropriate modifications to the delivery system. While we are working diligently on the issue, we can’t predict the timing of resolution. These issues have a silver lining.
We have taken our learnings from our Rocky Mount and Clayton facilities and are applying them to our manufacturing operations around the world to ensure that we meet the highest standards of quality going forward. By taking this holistic approach, we are raising our bar internally. Furthermore, we are at the forefront of implementing the FDA’s new device guidelines and we will be one of the first companies to make a submission under the new 510(k) guidelines. By doing this, we are ensuring that we meet the highest level of compliance with all of our products, and as always, putting the safety of our patients first.
Turning now to Project Fuel, we remain on track with Project Fuel and we are pleased with our progress on this organization-wide optimization program. As many of you know, Project Fuel is designed to simplify our business and drive continuous improvement and operational excellence in order to obtain top tier financial performance.
Since we announced the initiative a little over a year ago, we have eliminated approximately 48% of the total identified list numbers or SKUs, which compares to the 45% we announced in April. And we continue to make progress in streamlining our organizational structure. We have notified over 85% of the people impacted by our targeted reduction goal of 1,400 to 1,500 physicians. The 85% is close to our estimated goal for 2010. We believe most of the remaining 15% will occur in 2011.
With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?

9681063,108527251,69961,"Hospira Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone.

I’ll remind you as usual that references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table in the schedules accompanying our press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line.
Overall, global net sales were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, but as Chris referenced, they were up 5%, excluding the impact of divestitures. Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical’s strong double-digit sales growth for the quarter was offset by weakness in medication management systems.
With respect to global specialty injectables, net sales grew 16%, despite an increase in back orders, which negatively impacted performance in all regions. The increase in back orders was driven primarily by some capacity related constraints and a general slowdown of deliveries as a result of our quality enhancement initiatives.
Moving to SIP results by region, net sales in the Americas were up 22% for the second quarter and 32% year-to-date, again primarily attributable to greater than anticipated performance of both oxaliplatin and Precedex. Excluding the impact of oxaliplatin, the base business in the second quarter was flat to slightly up.
A few comments on oxaliplatin. As of June 30, which was the date we agreed to temporarily exit the generic oxaliplatin market, we had sold 100% of our negotiated settlement volume at prices that were slightly higher and more stable than we had expected. The erosion rate of the branded price remained unchanged at approximately 70% during the quarter. As a result, we benefited from sales to our wholesaler customers as well as from favorable developments to the chargeback provisions we have recorded in previous quarters.
During the quarter, approximately 70% of the oxaliplatin sales that we recorded were due to wholesaler demand, with the remaining 30% resulting from a change to our original chargeback estimates. Also contributing to the quarter’s positive SIP performance were strong demand in momentum for Precedex and the new high dosage heparin presentations we launched in the third quarter of last year. And while our newest drug meropenem didn’t launch in the US until the tail end of the quarter, we are currently the only generic on the market so far and we are pleased with our initial market share gains.
In EMEA, net sales of specialty injectables increased 4% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date, driving the quarter’s results with continued momentum in many of our recently launched molecules and the introduction of docetaxel in five smaller countries. We continue to roll out this major oncology drug, launching in our sixth country, Spain, at the beginning of July. Retacrit, our first biosimilar, had another solid quarter and has now captured more than 55% of the total short acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe.
Net sales of specialty injectables in Asia-Pacific decreased 8% from the prior year second quarter, primarily as a result of wholesaler buying patterns in the first half of the year. On a year-to-date basis, SIP sales in Asia-Pacific were up close to 4%. We continue to progress with the expansion of our portfolio in the region, receiving approval to launch Precedex in Korea, and more recently, we were granted approval to launch our first oncology generic products, irinotecan and gemcitabine in Japan.
Moving now to devices, net sales of global Medication Management Systems were down 19% versus the second quarter of 2009. It’s primarily a result of the performance in the Americas where MMS net sales declined 22% in the quarter. The quarter was characterized by an overall slowdown in pump sales activity, which we attribute to prospective customers who are waiting both Novation contract outcome as well as further details on the Baxter Colleague recall, which were announced in early July.
In addition, the voluntary hold we placed at the beginning of the quarter on shipments of Symbiq pumps to new customers resulted in negligible sales for the device in the quarter. Plum also experienced softness in the quarter. This was related to temporary supply constraints as we worked to increase capacity to meet future market demand. Despite these three factors though, cumulative signings were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2009.
Outside the Americas, MMS net sales in EMEA were up 1% and they grew 4% in Asia-Pacific. Both regions experienced continued strength with GemStar, our ambulatory device, and dedicated set sales continued to provide a favorable stream of revenue.
Finally, with respect to the Other Pharma and Other Devices product lines, sales in both of these product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter, primarily due to the divestitures of two of our contract manufacturing facilities, Salisbury, Australia and Wasserburg, Germany, and the sale of our critical care product line.
Continuing down the remainder of the income statement, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 43%, up 480 basis points compared to 38.2% in the second quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement are favorable product mix driven by oxaliplatin and Precedex, as well as cost reductions associated with Project Fuel efforts.
These factors were partially offset by charges associated with the FDA warning letter and our voluntary shipholds. In addition, we incurred a non-recurring pretax charge of $26 million during the quarter related to consulting and assessment activity, as well as customer penalties for failure to supply, all of which were associated with our quality improvement efforts.
R&D expense in the quarter was $80 million, which included a $27.5 million milestone payment to DURECT for the development and plant commercialization of POSIDUR in the United States and Canada. Excluding the milestone payment, R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.5%, consistent with the second quarter of 2009.
SG&A expense for the second quarter was $170 million, up 16% from $146 million for the same period last year, the increase however reflects expenses related to intellectual property legal expenses, a litigation settlement related charges, as well as some temporary spending associated with Project Fuel optimization initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 17.5% compared to 15.3% in the second quarter of 2009.
Adjusted operating income increased 21% to $213 million versus $177 million in the second quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin at 22% improved by 350 basis points compared to 18.5% in last year's second quarter.
Moving to Project Fuel, we made significant progress in the first half of the year and are on track to meet our estimate of $70 million to $80 million in net savings this year and $110 million to $140 million in net savings in 2011. Interest expense decreased 14% to $24 million in the second quarter, down from $28 million last year due to our continuing progress in deleveraging the company.
Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 22.8%, higher than we anticipated due to the impact of the non-renewal by the US Federal government of several tax extender bills, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 25.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.86 compared to $0.73 last year or an increase of 18%.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the six months ended June 30 was $144 million compared to $236 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily a result of the expected payout generally in the first quarter of chargebacks, as sales of oxaliplatin moved from the wholesaler to the end user as well as the increased inventory levels and income tax payments.
Our cash balance was $783 million compared to $946 million at the end of last year and $609 million at June 30 of last year, the decline since the end of last year primarily being due to the acquisition of Orchid in the first quarter of this year. Capital spending was $39 million compared to $44 million in the same period last year.
Before moving to guidance, at this point, I’ll provide a mid-year update to our drug pipeline, which we usually do this time of year. As of June 30, our small molecule pipeline totaled 41 compounds, which represents a total of 66 regional launches, including 32 in the United States. The global branded market value of the small molecule pipeline is approximately $15 million.
Of the pipeline’s compounds, currently 21 have been submitted for approval to one or more regulatory agencies. The local market value of the filed compounds is approximately $7 billion. And of that dollar value, roughly 50% relates to compounds where we are either currently challenging the patents or where there is some uncertainty associated with launch timing.
In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly half of the total pipeline compounds are related to oncology and beta-lactam anti-infective drugs. This reflects the investments we have been making and acquisitions as well to enhance our presence in these two important areas. Relative to launch timing, approximately 17 drugs are currently expected to launch in various regions over 2010 and 2011, with the split between the two years roughly equivalent.
As was the case last year, our launches in 2010 and ’11 combined larger molecules with significant potential and smaller molecules that help drive growth and scale. Our biosimilar pipeline at 11 compounds with a local branded value of $28 billion is one of the largest pipelines in the industry. It includes five incremental biosimilars from our agreement with Celltrion. And by therapeutic class, oncology represents about 70% of our biosimilars pipeline, with most of the remainder being rheumatoid arthritis.
Turning now to our full year projections, we are maintaining our full year global net sales growth guidance of 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis, with no anticipated full year impact from foreign exchange, although foreign exchange will be a headwind in the back part of this year. We are also maintaining our gross margin and operating margin guidance of 42% to 43% and 20% to 21% respectively.
Adjusted tax rate guidance remains at 22% to 23% for 2010. The projection is based on the assumption that certain US tax credits are renewed in the second half of the year, retroactive to January 1 of this year. We therefore expect that our effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarters will be lower than the first half of this year, bringing the full year rate in line with our expectations, assuming the tax credits are renewed. There is risk in this assumption, however, if the credits are not renewed.
Despite the better than expected performance this quarter, our projected earnings per share range of $3.35 to $3.45 or 8% to 11% growth rate remains unchanged. This is primarily due to increased charges associated with our quality improvement initiatives as well as the current back order situation. We also expect to see a significant increase in research and development spending in the back part of the year due to various clinical trials as well as a slightly dilutive impact from both the Javelin and DURECT acquisitions.
Now while consensus earnings per share is currently above our estimated range of $3.35 to $3.45, I want to reiterate our guidance does not include any sales in the United States for docetaxel, gemcitabine or Zosyn, nor does it assume resumption of sales of Propofol or sales of Symbiq devices to new customers in 2010.
As far as quarterly guiding, the third quarter is traditionally the softest quarter of the year, and this is proving to be the case in 2010. Year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter will be especially difficult since we launched oxaliplatin in the third quarter of last year and the various product line divestitures that we’ve completed will not fully lap themselves until early in 2011.
We believe the fourth quarter will be substantially stronger than the third quarter, with a potential $0.20 to $0.25 spread in earnings per share between the two quarters. By the fourth quarter, we expect to alleviate some of the back orders related to our non-shiphold products, which resulted from our quality enhancement initiatives. This should favorably impact fourth quarter results.
We now expect cash flow from operations to range between $525 million to $575 million, the decrease being a result of additional charges associated with the warning letter in shipholds, the milestone payment to DURECT, higher inventory levels, as well as the timing of certain oxaliplatin related chargebacks that we initially expected to be paid out in early 2011. Guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures remain unchanged at $250 million to $260 million and $195 million to $215 million respectively.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Chris.

During the quarter, we made significant progress in advancing our business, launching our first product from Hospira India, commercializing our second biosimilar product in Europe, and augmenting our leadership position in acute care proprietary pharmaceuticals through two strategic transactions.
At the same time, we remained highly focused on our quality improvement efforts, working diligently to raise the standards of quality across the company and address the concerns of the FDA. Meeting our increased commitments to quality does present some shorter-term challenges. But I am confident the efforts we are making today will benefit Hospira, our patients, our customers, and our shareholders over the longer-term.
We have reached the halfway point of the year. Despite several unanticipated challenges, we remain on track to achieve our sales and earnings projections for 2010. I attribute much of this to Project Fuel, which is not only driving improved operational performance, but is also transforming the way we think and act and respond to difficulties that may arise. I am very proud of our employees at Hospira and commend their effort to advance the company. I look forward to briefing you on our progress on next quarter’s call.
With that, we are now ready to take questions. Operator?

In this case, we are fairly confident that it makes sense to go with the biosimilar route, which is what we’re proceeding down that pathway.

And docetaxel and gemcitabine specifically, that could occur towards the end of the fourth quarter.
But to put it into our guidance, we went through that with Zosyn where it was in our guidance, I believe, for two-plus years and we kept - haven't talked to the Street and not only disappointed our shareholders, but disappointed ourselves that it wasn’t approved. So at this point in time, we think it’s prudent not to. And as far as the legal front on gemcitabine and what may be going on from a competitive standpoint, we’re going to continue down in our path and we’re not privileged to all of the different conversations that may be taking place from a legal standpoint with our competitors on gemcitabine.

We still believe it is a good opportunity for Hospira and for our shareholders. All right? We don’t believe it’s going to be a usually material impact in 2010. All right? I think what we all need to keep in mind is the customer base just recently got clarity on the Baxter recall situation from a reimbursement standpoint. And so now they need to go through their traditional process of assessing what they are going to do, whether they are going to stick with their current supplier with a different pump. And if you’re going to do that, then you have to assess and go. Okay?
If I’m to switch pumps, does it make sense to evaluate the other pumps out there in the marketplace and then go through that evaluation process, which is not a short-term process and it does take some time? And then there is a whole question around. Do I go wireless? Do I go MedNet drug library? Or do I do a basic pump that the hospital has to make a decision on? And keep in mind, they are balancing of that with - all right, I’ve got this stimulus package from the government as it relates to meaningful use and hitting certain criteria there. And is it more important to make a major capital investment from an infrastructure standpoint and get that piece done first and then come back and implement the pumps later?
And so, having said all that, we just don’t see it as a significant impact to 2010 guidance. All right? That doesn’t mean that we’re not out there talking to customers, engaged with customers, but we don’t see it as a significant impact to 2010. And we see it going through and being more of a positive impact as we look at 2011 and perhaps even beyond that. Hopefully I answered your question there.

But two, it also plays - we've often talked about how sticky this business is from a market share standpoint. And so going through a pump conversion and talking about pump conversion, not necessarily a supplier conversion, but a pump conversion, is a whole lot of work for a hospital. Pumps are used on every floor in the hospital. They are touched by all the different nurses. And so when you begin to embark on that initiative, it is a major undertaking. And I would assume - okay, not being involved with the conversions with the FDA, but that was part of the logic of having a two-year timeframe was that they realize it takes some time and commitment on the customer standpoint to make this type of conversion.
So I’d say this is really a combination of both. And the other piece, David, as I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of different decisions for a hospital to make today. This is no longer just a commodity product that is tied to IDs. As I mentioned earlier, you have the wireless decision to make, you have the drug library decision to make. And if you go with the drug library, then you have to set the drug library up ahead of time. And then if you are going to go with some type of drug library, what do you have as it relates to rest of your HIT system or you better off making that decision at the same time or prior.

Overall, our enthusiasm isn’t dampened whatsoever on this situation. I think when all the dust settles, we continue - we have not made any changes to our plans to ramp up production. We indicated about a month ago that we were going to produce 80,000 pumps this year. We are on track to do that. We’re very focused on that. We’ve basically reopened the second factory in the quarter. I think if there has been any change, first of all, the guidelines were late in coming. And second, the timeframe was a bit longer than we had anticipated.
And I’d add to that that in the end, this is really all about getting the sets. And we intend to do that, but we think this is going to be more of a 2011 event than it will be a 2010 event. With respect to R&D, overall, the guidance that we gave, I don’t think we were specific on R&D guidance as a line item, but we won’t spend in total what we anticipated to spend for the full year. But there should be a sequential increase of around $20 million in both quarters for R&D, and we really hope that these numbers to make sure that we are confident that the spending will take place. We had hoped that some of the spending would get underway in the second quarter. The uptick is primarily related to two things. One, the beginning of clinical for various products, EPO, which we mentioned, as well as just an increase in the overall base spending rate as we bring on Javelin, DURECT, and the heavier spending with Orchid.
So the favorability in the second quarter and frankly the first quarter, we haven’t canceled any programs. We are not trying to save R&D to offset other shortfalls. It’s simply an issue of timing. And frankly, when we entered the year, we probably had two aggressive of a ramp. In fact, the initial internal numbers we were working with had a fairly flat spend quarter-to-quarter. And in hindsight, we should have chosen to not believe that and put some type of a ramp in. But we are pretty confident for a variety of reasons that the spend will tick up. We look at internal spend and external spend in R&D. And we’ve got a very close handle on the internal spend where most of the increases coming from is external spend related to clinical and then these additional businesses that we now own factoring their way into the base.

And the good news here is when you strip all that out, margin continues to progress certainly aided by Project Fuel, but it’s a nice 40, 50, 60 basis point sequential improvement in gross margin. And then your conclusion on what we need to run to in the back part of the year is fair.

And let me address it from a geographic standpoint. I say from a US standpoint, as it relates our efforts in acute care, with the two recent transactions we did, we’ve got a very nice portfolio that goes with our Precedex product line. In the US though, we certainly would like to in-license a proprietary oncology product that we could start building a sales organization around in the US for the future launch of biosimilars in the oncology space. All right? We have not been able to find anything at this point in time that we believe makes sense from a size standpoint for Hospira and that has the appropriate financial returns.
And so that would be one of the pieces missing from a US proprietary standpoint. As we go around the globe, we would love to continue to in-license some small oncology products for Europe. We’ve been successful in doing that and leveraging the sales organization that we have selling our biosimilar EPO and now our biosimilar filgrastim. We would like to continue that strategy in Asia-Pacific, as we begin to launch biosimilars in that part of the world as well. I don’t see it necessarily increasing beyond those two therapeutic categories of acute care, which pain management clearly falls into, and then the smaller oncology proprietary area to go with our biosimilars. Does that help?

First of all, I think we all need to keep in mind that Propofol is on the drug shortage list. And as a result of that, we are working very closely with the FDA as it relates to Propofol, but also our Clayton facility, which manufactures Propofol. And if you think about Propofol, what we really have is a two-step plan that’s in place. Step one includes the installation of this finer micron filter designed to filter up sub-visual particulate that I mentioned in my opening comments.
And in April, we submitted that manufacturing change through a CBE-30 to the agency. And then step two involved some additional process enhancements, including improved filtration of the actual starting materials instead of just the finished product. If you look at where we are, we are just looking at manufacturing product in the step two and then getting test results on the particulate level from this step two manufactured product. And once we have that information and we believe it’s appropriate to restart Clayton, we will end up having a dialog with the FDA to update them on our status and to get their concurrence on our approach. And so we’ve made some tremendous progress. We’re getting closer, but we are not there yet.

We’re viewing the progress on the plan not only for Clayton and Rocky Mount, but the status of our initiatives across all of our manufacturing plants. In addition to that, I have a larger monthly meeting. And so the ball is in our court clearly now to execute that plan. We will be giving every other month an update to the FDA on the status of that.

But as near as we can tell, we’ve got everything cut off and we’ve made our best estimate. So I wouldn’t expect that anything would dribble out into 2011. Where it may have been confusing is that on a cash flow standpoint, we had anticipated that the chargebacks for these last series of sales would extend into 2011. And the assumption we have right now is that the chargebacks will make their way through and we will have to pay the wholesalers and distributors back before the end of this year. So that’s the only 2010 to 2011 issue that we talked about.

I had the board and myself Europe going through our operations, and I can tell you I think that the flu season has already begun. So I apologize for any raspiness in my voice. The third quarter is a good quarter for Hospira despite facing difficult year-over-year comparison due to our very successful launch of oxaliplatin in the third quarter last year. As you recall, third quarter 2009 represented the largest sales quarter of the major generic oncology drugs on market. Since June 30, 2010, we temporarily exited the market due to a litigation settlement and plan to reenter in the third quarter of 2012. Despite extremely tough comparison in third quarter of 2009, our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals or SIP business declined only 3%. The impact of not selling oxaliplatin was tempered primarily by strength in Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin. Total net sales were $949 million this quarter, decreasing 6% year-over-year with relatively no impact from foreign currency. Excluding the year-over-year decline related to oxaliplatin and divestitures, net sales increased 9% versus the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 represented a decline of 18% over the third quarter 2009 EPS of $0.90 but better than our expectation for the quarter. The quarter saw several key Hospira achievements. I would like to highlight. We received approval for the long-term use of Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent in Japan. This approval makes Precedex available to a greater number of patients providing a new competitive option for patients who are critically ill and require sedation for greater than 24 hours for long-term use approval -- launch of Precedex earlier in the year in Canada and South Korea and is one more milestone to expanding the molecules global presence. On the Biosimilars front, we were very pleased to receive approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA for Nivestim, our second commercially available Biosimilar. This was the first approval of Biosimilar filgrastim in Australia, an important step in building our global Biosimilars portfolio. Nivestim is our brand name for our Biosimilar filgrastim which is a drug used to boost white blood cells. We launched this drug earlier in the year in Europe and we'll be leveraging the specialized hematology, Oncology salesforce we've developed across the Australian region to market Nivestim. We completed the commercial collaboration and codevelopment agreement with Smiths Medical for infusion pumps systems in the U.S. and Canada. This collaboration allows us to broaden our portfolio offering and extend our reach. It also enables the development of interoperable solutions for our respective customers which means that Hospira devices and Smiths' syringe pumps will be able to use one standard solution to view and report infusion data for Hospira's MedNet technology. As part of TheraDoc clinical surveillance platform, we introduced our new anticoagulation assist knowledge module. The module helps streamline caregiver communication, improve clinical workflow and enhance patient safety, also helping hospitals comply with one of the 2010 joint commission national patient safety goals, to reduce the risks of adverse events associated with anticoagulant therapy. And finally, more recently, we were pleased to announce last week the launch of Pibrosalim and Pabaken in the U.S. This drug, a generic version of Zosyn, is a broad spectrum antibiotics that had U.S. sales of $855 million in 2009. We are launching in a phased approach of vials in our proprietary advantage system, which we believe will be well received. We already offered the drug in Europe and plan to launch it in our Asia Pacific region beginning late this year and into early 2011. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to update you on our quality improvement initiatives as well as the search for my successor as CEO. Regarding the warning letter we received from the U.S. FDA related the inspections of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton, Rocky Mountain North Carolina, we continue to make good progress during the quarter. We are on track to fulfill our plant commitments, most of which we expect to complete by year-end. We also recently resumed delivery of propofol under a new manufacturing process. On the device side of business, we have completed replacement of the bulk of the sets related to the air line issue with our Symbiq general infusion device and are hoping to complete the recall by the end of the year. However, to ensure we are providing our customers with the highest-quality devices available in the market, we have decided implement certain software enhancements related to this and previously announced issues. We expect these enhancements will be filed with the broader software upgrade package early in the first quarter of 2011. Thus, at this time, approval timing remains uncertain. New pump placements will remain on voluntary hold until our corrective activities are completed. An to update you on the search for my successor as CEO, we commenced the search for a new CEO in August using Eganvendor, [ph] a global leader in executive search. Since that time, Eganvendor has received interest from several dozen candidates and narrowed that list to short list. They are currently in the process of screening and interviewing the shortlist candidates. The board has been pleased with the interest and qualification of the candidates and looks forward to conduct the interviews over the next couple of months. As I mentioned at the onset of my CEO retirement announcement, I will remain in place as CEO as long as it takes to find my replacement and then transition to the new role of Executive Chairman. Those of you who know me realize how important this is to me. I wanted to make sure that we not only get the right person for the job at Hospira but also that the transition goes smoothly for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"

I remind everyone that references to net sales results will be in a constant-currency basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and schedules accompanying the press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. 
Global net sales declined 6% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. But as Chris mentioned, excluding the impact of oxaliplatin and divestitures, global net sales actually increased 9%. Global Specialty Injectables net sales declined 3% given an extremely tough year-over-year comparison due to oxaliplatin. By segment, net specialty injectable sales in America were down 4% for the third quarter while strong sales of oxaliplatin carried through the first half of the year reflected in 18% year-to-date year-over-year performance. Several of our other SIP drugs Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin performed very well in the third quarter. Drilling down into the growth drivers for the quarter, we saw another quarter of strong demand for Precedex. It's been a very solid growth year for the drug. First, Precedex has gained an extremely strong reputation as a sedation agent addressing unmet clinical needs among anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. And second, our specialized sales force has been highly effective in communicating the differentiating attributes of the drug to new prescribers and thereby improving market penetration. We mentioned in our call last quarter that we launched the NI infected drug meropenem in the U.S. at the tail end of the second quarter. The third quarter was the first full quarter where we saw a substantial positive impact. Being the only generic on the market so far, we've quickly gained market share and currently hold approximately 30% of the total U.S. market. Moving to Vancomycin, we made good progress during the quarter in reducing our back orders and maintaining our #1 share position. We are currently meeting market demand and are building inventory levels back up our targeted levels. We also saw continued momentum for our new presentations of high-dose heparin. While additional competition has entered the market, pricing has remained relatively stable and we've maintained our market share of over 20%. 
Turning to EMEA. Net sales of specialty injectable to the European region increased 7% in the quarter, driving the quarter's results is its continued momentum in many of our recently launched molecules and the introduction of docetaxel in countries throughout Europe this year. Retacrit, our first Biosimilar, had another solid quarter and continues to hold its leading position in the total short-acting biogeneric [ph] market in Europe. Net sales of specialty injectables to Asia-Pacific decreased 7% over the prior-year third quarter due primarily to aggressive pricing in both Oncology and the anti-infectives. Response to Precedex in Japan has continued to be positive bolstered by the recent approval of the long-term indication. 
Turning now to Devices. Net sales of global Medication Management Systems were down 6% versus the third quarter of 2009, primarily a result of performance in the Americas where MMS net sales declined 8%. First, Symbiq remains on ship-hold and as a result, we did not recognize any new customer pump related sales for this infusion device in the third quarter. Second, we characterized the quarter by a general slowdown in pump sales activity as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We anticipate a soft market through the remainder of the year with increased activity in 2011 and 2012 as Baxter Colleague customers begin executing their decisions. Outside the Americas, MMS net sales increased 7% year-over-year in EMEA and 13% in Asia-Pacific. Both regions experienced continued momentum with dedicated set sales for our Plum general infusion device and our GemStar ambulatory device. Sales in both our Other Pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter primarily due to the divestitures we've completed over the past 18 months. Other Pharma also experienced a particularly soft quarter as the backorder issues discussed on the second quarter call impacted our ability to supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. Moving down the rest of the income statement, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 42.8%, up 130 basis points compared to 41.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement was favorable product mix driven by Precedex as well as cost reductions associated with Project Fuel efforts. These factors were partially offset by charges associated with the FDA warning letter and our voluntary ship-hold's. In addition, we incurred pretax one-time charges of $15 million during the quarter related to quality consulting and assessment activity, idle facility cost, all associated with our quality improvement efforts. R&D expense increased 13% in the quarter to $65 million primarily a result of the timing of spending related to clinical trials. RDS as a percentage of net sales was 6.9%, up from 5.7% in last year's third quarter. SG&A expense for the third quarter was $159 million, down 2% from $162 million for the same period last year. Driving the improved SG&A performance were cost reductions associated with Project Fuel initiatives as well as the timing of certain spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 16.7% compared to 16.1% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $189 million versus $207 million in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin at 19.9% decreased by 70 basis points versus 20.6% in last year's third quarter. We continue to make significant progress year-to-date on Project Fuel and are on track to meet our estimate of $70 million to $80 million in cumulative savings this year and $110 million to $140 million in cumulative savings in 2011. Interest expense increased 6% to $27 million in the third quarter from $25 million last year due to a partial quarter of additional but temporary interest associated with our new $500 million of 30-year debt. Earlier this month, that's October, the proceeds in cash on hand were used to pay down our $500 million, five-year debt that was originally due in 2012, thereby eliminating future incremental interest expense. Related to the early debt repayment was a one-time charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $36.8 million in the third quarter that, as I mentioned, was paid in October. The charges included in other expense net of income statement. Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 23.8% bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 25.0%. This continues to be higher than we had anticipated due to the fact that Congress has not yet approved anticipated extensions of tax provisions that expired at the beginning of this year. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.74 compared to $0.90 last year. Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010 was $235 million compared to $541 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the result of the expected 2010 payout of chargebacks and rebates as 2009 sales of oxaliplatin moved from the wholesaler to the end-user as well as increased inventories to improve our service levels and increased income tax and quality initiative related payments. At September 30, our cash balance was $1.1 billion compared to $946 million at December 31, 2009, and $921 million at September 30, 30, 2009. The increase since the end of last year was primarily related to the timing of the new issuance of the $500 million in 30-year notes, partially offset by the acquisition of or Orchid and Javelin and another investing related M&A activities. Capital spending in the quarter was $62 million compared to $41 million in the same period last year. The increase primarily reflects investments we're making with respect to manufacturing improvement initiatives and IT infrastructure enhancements. As we have discussed in previous calls, at the end of the second quarter, we had a remaining share buyback authorization of approximately $100 million out of the original $400 million authorization that was approved in 2006 by our board of directors. During this quarter, the third quarter, to address the share count creep associated with stock options we entered into an accelerated share repurchase or ASR contract to repurchase $50 million of our common stock. Under the ASR, we received approximately 725,000 shares with a remaining shares to be delivered over 3 months subject to adjustments based on the average stock price during the period. The ASR is expected to be completed no later than November 23 of this year. Since 2006, as of the end of the third quarter this year, we've cumulatively repurchased 8.3 million shares or $350 million in aggregate purchases under the board authorization. At the end of the third quarter, our outstanding diluted share count was at approximately 170 million shares. Turning now to full-year guidance. During our second quarter earnings call in July, we projected 2010 global net sales growth of 3% to 5% and earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. Since then, several items have surfaced that could have an impact on guidance. Starting with sales, there are 2 primary factors that could affect guidance. First, as we discussed earlier, in our MMS business, this quarter was characterized by a general slowdown in pump sales activity. We believe the market is somewhat frozen as prospective customers were for the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We don't expect it is a change in activity until sometime in 2011 when we believe Baxter Colleague customers will start to execute on the device decisions. As a result, we reduced our MMS sales expectations for the remainder of the year. The second item relates to the increased and our orders which we discussed in the second quarter call. The backorder increase was driven primarily by delays in deliveries as a result of our quality enhancement initiatives and on certain drugs, capacity related constraints. Our Contract Manufacturing business, which is reflected in the other pharma product line, utilizes some of of the same capacity our manufacturing facilities and the build up in that orders and accompanying delays in delivery have impact of certain contract manufacturing customers. While we're making progress on reducing these back orders, our inability to adequately supply product will result in lower than anticipated performance in the other pharma product line for this year. So primarily as a result of these 2 items, we reducing our full-year global net sales growth by 1%. We therefore expect net sales to range between 2% and 3% on a constant-currency basis with foreign exchange contributing a 1% benefit. We're maintaining our gross margin range of 42% to 43% of our operating margin range of 20% to 21%. Our adjusted tax rate guidance remains at 22% to 23% for 2010. This projection is based on the assumption that certain U.S. tax provisions will still be renewed before year end, retroactive to January 1 of this year. We therefore expect that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the first 9 months of the year bringing the full-year rate in line with our original expectations. Now, obviously, there's risks in these assumption if these provisions are not renewed by Congress. Moving to earnings per share, we feel confident we can meet the favorable and of many these projected ranges. As a result, we're narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of our previous guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to range between $3.40 and $3.45 per share, representing growth of 9% to 11% over 2009. While consensus EPS is currently above our estimated range of $3.40 to $3.45, I want to reiterate that our 2010 guidance, this point, does not include any U.S. sales of docetaxel or gems that gemcitabine. It also does not include or assume resumption of sales of Symbiq devices to new customers in 2010. However, the guidance does include the expected impact of our launch last week of generic Zosyn. Based on many of the analysts' notes published last week, I'd like to clarify a few issues regarding generic Zocyn in. First, today we are focused on the single-dose vial and frozen premixed markets. Second, the impact in 2010 will be limited as the product is being rolled out on a gradual basis with single-dose vials already o in market and advantage starting to shift for the beginning of next year. Third, product sales will steadily ramp-up over time as capacity ramps up. And forth, as we've mentioned in prior calls, the product is a partner product with shared margins. We continue to exclude docetaxel and gemcitabine from our full-year guidance because they are litigated drugs which still carry a degree of launch of certainty. However, we are providing an update this morning on both drugs as well as some color on how to think about the potential opportunity this year. Start with docetaxel, last month the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided that the originators patents asserted against us are invalid ruling strongly in our favor. The originator has appealed this decision. We have tentative approval on our single file product, and we'll be ready to launch in mid-November, assuming we received final FDA approval. We are assuming the 2 other generic competitors will be on market day 1 including an authorized generic and that the originator will stay in the market with a discounted price. We also believe the originator will convert the market for a single vial solution product and that we will be the only generic competitor with this offering. Moving to gemcitabine. In August, the Federal Circuit court affirmed the District Court's decision of invalidity in the Sun versus Lilly case. This ruling paved the way for us to launch our 2-gram powder presentation as an exclusive offering for a 180 day period. In late September, we filed regulatory judgment action against Lilly. The action relates to a process patent we have litigated in other jurisdictions. We took this action preemptively in the U.S. to help secure a clear launch. We have tentative approval for our 2-gram [ph] powder format and with docetaxel, we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. We are assuming, on gemcitabine that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day 1, including unauthorized generic and that the originator will maintain branded pricing levels. You may also recall that we filed a 505B2 more for a differentiated solution gemcitabine product which is pending FDA approval. Now, it if docetaxel and gemcitabine to launch before year end, the sales and EPS impact could vary significantly based on the number of launch dates of competitors, the legal position of pricing dynamics. We estimate that a fourth quarter launch of both docetaxel and 2-gram gemcitabine FreezeRight product in the U.S. could add an incremental $0.10 to $0.50 our EPS guidance. The majority of this total estimated increase is related to the potential docetaxel launch pro- you would launch all of our presentations of the drug versus gemcitabine where we would only be launching our 2-gram product. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

First, the whole quality situation, the slow down that we've put in place on release. Within increased cycle times we're getting new procedures in place. Second, we did have some localized focus capacity issues that were not truly attributed to the quality situation but just as we've grown this business from a 13% share in the available market to almost 19% in 6 years, and as we shut some factories down and so on, we ran into some capacity issues on Vanco and a few other products. Third, while we're in the backorder situation for some of our own internal reasons, there have been various competitors, I won't name them, but are off market and have exited certain products. And customers are coming to us, customers that might not previously have purchased from us. So it's been difficult to sort of weed through the backorders and figure out what's the backorder and what's not because in some of these situations, they're well documented chronicled on the FDA site. People will order quite a bit more than they really need in the hopes that they'll get what they really consume. So those are sort of the 3 or 4 factors that come into play. And on gemcitabine and docetaxel, the facilities that those products are coming out of are not directly impacted by the quality situation, nor they directly impacted by other capacity issues.

In terms of the cost mix, just to explain a little bit about our geography and where we make product, and I would really point to probably 3 geographies and just give you some relative comments. In Australia, proportionately we make a lot more than we sell because the facility which is the primary Aquila drug facility for us ships all over the world, yet the in-country sales in Australia are proportionately less. So you have a bit of a cost heavy revenue, like situation in Australia. If you go to Canada, we don't manufacture anything in Canada. So we have some exposure there and that we're sort of revenue heavy and other cost from Canada is either coming out of the U.S., a little bit out of Europe and some out of Australia. In Europe, proportionately we sell a lot more than we make. We do have one factory, 2 factories in Europe: One in Croatia and one in Italy. Actually, where Chris were at the previous week. But relative to the income statement in Europe, we are selling a lot more product there than we are locally sourcing.

Yet, in early 2009, you can see across all industry sectors the damage that was done to share prices to companies that had higher than average debt levels. So today, that is very attractive. One of the reasons that we decided to do the refi is just how attractive and hope the markets are, our maturity, our average maturity right now is about 13 years, which puts us sort of an upper quartile of our peers. As you look to next year and the cash accumulating, we really need to get through our 2011 planning process. We need to then present our longer-range plan to the board in February. And I think, at that point, we'll be a little lot clearer on what uses and priority of cash will be. In terms of taking on additional debt, it's just too early to call that right now despite how attractive things are because we're kind of between this position of what's an acceptable level. And if you go back 2 or 3 years, we thought we were in flying buying shape and then frankly, the stock and others got hammered because it was above average.

But Precedex will continue to grow much faster than the business, the total business because we're launching Precedex around the world. We've introduced in Brazil. We have a salesforce in place. We said the additional indication in Japan. It's growing extremely well here in the U.S. Vancomycin's coming back.

However, our numbers says it's going to tick up from Q3 levels.

But Greg, it can be really lumpy depending on what type of clinical studies are going on. So it's just -- I mean the number doesn't move from $60 million to $30 million, but to sort of say that $70 million would be a new benchmark, it's going to bounce around plus or minus off of that, depending on the clinical activity. But both in SG&A, as we mentioned in our opening comments, there was some favorable timing of spending, promotional expenses and some other things in marketing that we saw in the third quarter which could spill over into the fourth quarter and the forecast I have which show R&D going up in the fourth quarter. But as you know historically, we've had trouble spending the money as fast as we initially think we can."

The third quarter was a good quarter for Hospira despite facing difficult year-over-year comparison due to our very successful launch of oxaliplatin in the third quarter last year. As you recall, third quarter 2009 represented the largest sales quarter for the major generic oncology drug while it was on market. Since June 30, 2010, we temporarily exited the market due to a litigation settlement and plan to reenter in the third quarter of 2012. Despite the extremely tough comparison to the third quarter of 2009, our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals or SIP business declined only 3%. The impact of not selling oxaliplatin was tempered primarily by strength in Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin. 
Total net sales were $949 million this quarter, decreasing 6% year-over-year with relatively no impact from foreign currency. Excluding the year-over-year decline related to oxaliplatin and divestitures, net sales increased 9% versus the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 represented a decline of 18% over the third quarter 2009 EPS of $0.90 but better than our expectation for the quarter. 
The quarter saw several key Hospira achievements. I would like to highlight. We received approval for the long-term use of Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent in Japan. This approval makes Precedex available to a greater number of patients, providing a new sedative option for patients who are critically ill and require sedation for greater than 24 hours. The long-term use approval follows our launch of Precedex earlier in the year in Canada and South Korea. It is one more milestone to expanding the molecule's global presence. 
On the Biosimilars front, we were very pleased to receive approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, for Nivestim, our second commercially available Biosimilar. This was the first approval of Biosimilar filgrastim in Australia, an important step in building our global Biosimilars portfolio. Nivestim is our brand name for our Biosimilar filgrastim, which is a drug used to boost white blood cells. We launched this drug earlier in the year in Europe, and we'll be leveraging the specialized hematology, Oncology sales force we've developed across the Australian region to market Nivestim. 
We completed a commercial collaboration and co-development agreement with Smiths Medical for infusion pumps systems in the U.S. and Canada. This collaboration allows us to broaden our portfolio offering and extend our reach. It also enables the development of interoperable solutions for our respective customers which means that Hospira devices and Smiths' syringe pumps will be able to use one standard solution to view and report infusion data through Hospira's MedNet technology. 
As part of the TheraDoc clinical surveillance platform, we introduced our new anticoagulation assist knowledge module. The module helps streamline caregiver communication, improve clinical workflow and enhance patient safety, ultimately helping hospitals comply with one of the 2010 joint commission national patient safety goals, to reduce the risks of adverse events associated with anticoagulant therapy. 
And finally, more recently, we were pleased to announce last week the launch of piperacillin and tazobactam in the U.S. This drug, a generic version of Zosyn, is a broad spectrum antibiotic that had U.S. sales of $855 million in 2009. We are launching in a phased approach, both vials and our proprietary advantage system, which we believe will be well received. We already offered the drug in Europe and plan to launch it in our Asia Pacific region beginning late this year and into early 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to update you on our quality improvement initiatives, as well as the search for my successor as CEO. Regarding the warning letter we received from the U.S. FDA related the inspections of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, we continue to make good progress during the quarter. We are on track to fulfill our plant commitments, most of which we expect to complete by year end. We also recently resumed delivery of propofol under the new manufacturing process. 
On the device side of business, we have completed replacement of the bulk of the sets related to the air in line issue with our Symbiq general infusion device and are hoping to complete the recall by the end of the year. However, to ensure we are providing our customers with the highest-quality devices available in the market, we have decided implement certain software enhancements related to this and previously announced issues. We expect these enhancements will be filed with the broader software upgrade package early in the first quarter of 2011. Thus, at this time, approval timing remains uncertain. New pump placements will remain on voluntary hold until our corrective activities are completed. 
And to update you on the search for my successor as CEO, we commenced the search for a new CEO in August using Egon Zehnder, a global leader in executive search. Since that time, Egon Zehnder has received interest from several dozen candidates and narrowed that list to a short list. They are currently in the process of screening and interviewing the shortlist candidates. The board has been pleased with the interest and qualifications of the candidates and looks forward to conducting interviews over the next couple of months. 
As I mentioned at the onset of my CEO retirement announcement, I will remain in place as CEO as long as it takes to find my replacement and then transition to the new role of Executive Chairman. Those of you who know me realize how important this is to me. I wanted to make sure that we not only get the right person for the job at Hospira but also that the transition goes smoothly for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,113828427,163041,"Hospira Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying the press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. 
Global net sales declined 6% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. But as Chris mentioned, excluding the impact of oxaliplatin and the divestitures, global net sales actually increased 9%. Global Specialty Injectables net sales declined 3% given an extremely tough year-over-year comparison due to oxaliplatin. By segment, net specialty injectable sales in the Americas were down 4% for the third quarter, while strong sales of oxaliplatin carried us through the first half of the year reflected in 18% year-to-date year-over-year performance. Several of our other SIP drugs Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin performed very well in the third quarter. 
Drilling down into the growth drivers for the quarter, we saw another quarter of strong demand for Precedex. It's been a very solid growth year for the drug. First, Precedex has gained an extremely strong reputation as a sedation agent addressing unmet clinical needs among anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. And second, our specialized sales force has been highly effective in communicating the differentiating attributes of the drug to new prescribers and thereby improving market penetration. 
We mentioned on our call last quarter that we launched the anti-infective drug, meropenem, in the U.S. at the tail end of the second quarter. The third quarter was the first full quarter where we saw a substantial positive impact. Being the only generic on the market so far, we've quickly gained market share and currently hold approximately 30% of the total U.S. market. 
Moving to Vancomycin, we made good progress during the quarter in reducing our back orders and maintaining our #1 share position. We're currently meeting market demand and are building inventory levels back up our targeted levels. We also saw a continued momentum for our new presentations of high-dose heparin. While additional competition has entered the market, pricing has remained relatively stable, and we've maintained our market share of over 20%. 
Turning to EMEA. Net sales of specialty injectable in the European region increased 7% in the quarter, driving the quarter's results was continued momentum in many of our recently launched molecules and the introduction of docetaxel in countries throughout Europe this year. Retacrit, our first Biosimilar, had another solid quarter and continues to hold its leading position in the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe. Net sales of specialty injectables in Asia-Pacific decreased 7% over the prior-year third quarter due primarily to aggressive pricing in both oncology and anti-infectives. Response to Precedex in Japan has continued to be positive, bolstered by the recent approval of the long-term indication. 
Turning now to devices, net sales of global Medication Management Systems were down 6% versus the third quarter of 2009, primarily a result of performance in the Americas where MMS net sales declined 8%. First, Symbiq remains on ship-hold and as a result, we did not recognize any new customer pump-related sales for this infusion device in the third quarter. Second, we characterized the quarter by a general slowdown in pump sales activity as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We anticipate a soft market through the remainder of the year with increased activity in 2011 and 2012 as Baxter Colleague customers begin executing on their decisions. 
Outside the Americas, MMS net sales increased 7% year-over-year in EMEA and 13% in Asia-Pacific. Both regions experienced continued momentum with dedicated set sales for our Plum general infusion device and our GemStar ambulatory device. Sales in both our Other Pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter primarily due to the divestitures we've completed over the past 18 months. Other Pharma also experienced a particularly soft quarter as the backorder issues discussed on the second quarter call impacted our ability to supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. 
Moving down the rest of the income statement, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 42.8%, up 130 basis points compared to 41.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement was favorable product mix driven by Precedex, as well as cost reductions associated with Project Fuel efforts. These factors were partially offset by charges associated with the FDA warning letter and our voluntary ship holds. In addition, we incurred pretax onetime charges of $15 million during the quarter related to quality consulting and assessment activity, idle facility costs, all associated with our quality improvement efforts. 
R&D expense increased 13% in the quarter to $65 million, primarily a result of the timing of spending related to clinical trials. R&D, as a percentage of net sales, was 6.9% up from 5.7% in last year's third quarter. SG&A expense for the third quarter was $159 million down 2% from $162 million for the same period last year. Driving the improved SG&A performance were cost reductions associated with Project Fuel initiatives as well as the timing of certain spending. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 16.7% compared to 16.1% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $189 million versus $207 million in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin at 19.9% decreased by 70 basis points versus 20.6% in last year's third quarter. We continue to make significant progress year-to-date on Project Fuel and are on track to meet our estimate of $70 million to $80 million in cumulative savings this year and $110 million to $140 million in cumulative savings in 2011. 
Interest expense increased 6% to $27 million in the third quarter from $25 million last year due to a partial quarter of additional but temporary interest associated with our new $500 million of 30-year debt. Earlier this month, that's October, the proceeds in cash on hand were used to pay down our $500 million, 5-year debt that was originally due in 2012, thereby eliminating future incremental interest expense. 
Related to the early debt repayment was a onetime charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $36.8 million in the third quarter that, as I mentioned, was paid in October. The charge is included in other expense nets on the income statement. Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 23.8% bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 25.0%. This continues to be higher than we had anticipated due to the fact that Congress has not yet approved anticipated extensions of tax provisions that expired at the beginning of this year. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.74 compared to $0.90 last year. 
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010 was $235 million compared to $541 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily a result of the expected 2010 payout of chargebacks and rebates as 2009 sales of oxaliplatin moved from the wholesaler to the end-user, as well as increased inventories to improve our service levels and increased income tax and quality initiative-related payments. 
At September 30, our cash balance was $1.1 billion compared to $946 million at December 31, 2009 and $921 million at September 30, 2009. The increase since the end of last year was primarily related to the timing of the new issuance of the $500 million in 30-year notes, partially offset by the acquisition of Orchid and Javelin and another investing related M&A activities. 
Capital spending in the quarter was $62 million compared to $41 million in the same period last year. The increase primarily reflects investments we're making with respect to manufacturing improvement initiatives and IT infrastructure enhancements. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, at the end of the second quarter, we had a remaining share buyback authorization of approximately $100 million out of the original $400 million authorization that was approved in 2006 by our Board of Directors. During this quarter, the third quarter, to address the share count creep associated with stock options, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase or ASR contract to repurchase $50 million of our common stock. Under the ASR, we received approximately 725,000 shares with the remaining shares to be delivered over 3 months subject to adjustments based on the average stock price during the period. The ASR is expected to be completed no later than November 23 of this year. 
Since 2006, as of the end of the third quarter this year, we cumulatively repurchased 8.3 million shares or $350 million in aggregate purchases under the board authorization. At the end of the third quarter, our outstanding diluted share count was at approximately 170 million shares. 
Turning now to full year guidance, during our second quarter earnings call in July, we projected 2010 global net sales growth of 3% to 5% and earnings per share in the range -- adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. Since then, several items have surfaced that could have an impact on guidance. Starting with sales, there are 2 primary factors that could affect guidance. First, as we discussed earlier, in our MMS business, this quarter was characterized by a general slowdown in pump sales activity. We believe the market is somewhat frozen as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We don't expect to see a change in activity until some time in 2011 when we believe Baxter Colleague customers will start to execute on their device decisions. As a result, we've reduced our MMS sales expectations for the remainder of the year. 
The second item relates to the increase in backorders which we discussed on the second quarter call. The backorder increase was driven primarily by delays in deliveries as a result of our quality enhancement initiatives and on certain drugs, capacity related constraints. Our contract manufacturing business, which is reflected in the Other Pharma product line, utilizes some of the same capacity in our manufacturing facilities and the build up in backorders and accompanying delays in delivery have impacted certain contract manufacturing customers. 
While we're making progress on reducing these back orders, our inability to adequately supply product will result in lower-than-anticipated performance in the Other Pharma product line for this year. So primarily as a result of these 2 items, we're reducing our full year global net sales growth by 1%. We therefore expect net sales to range between -- net sales growth to range between 2% and 3% on a constant-currency basis with foreign exchange contributing a 1% benefit. 
We're maintaining our gross margin range of 42% to 43% and our operating margin range of 20% to 21%. Our adjusted tax rate guidance remains at 22% to 23% for 2010. This projection is based on the assumption that certain U.S. tax provisions will still be renewed before year end, retroactive to January 1 of this year. We therefore expect that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the first 9 months of the year, bringing the full year rate in line with our original expectation. Now, obviously, there is risks in this assumption if these provisions are not renewed by Congress. 
Moving to earnings per share, we feel confident we can meet the favorable end of many of these projected ranges. As a result, we're narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of our previous guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to range between $3.40 and $3.45 per share, representing growth of 9% to 11% over 2009. While consensus EPS is currently above our estimated range of $3.40 to $3.45, I want to reiterate that our 2010 guidance at this point does not include any U.S. sales of docetaxel or gemcitabine. It also does not include or assume resumption of sales of Symbiq devices to new customers in 2010. However, the guidance does include the expected impact of our launch last week of generic Zosyn. 
Based on many of the analysts' notes published last week, I'd like to clarify a few issues regarding generic Zocyn. First, today, we are focused on the single-dose vial and frozen pre-mixed markets. Second, the impact in 2010 will be limited as the product is being rolled out on a gradual basis with single-dose vials already on market, an advantage starting to shift for the beginning of next year. Third, product sales will steadily ramp up over time as capacity ramps up. And fourth, as we've mentioned in prior calls, the product is a partner product with shared margins. 
We continue to exclude docetaxel and gemcitabine from our full year guidance because they are litigated drugs which still carry a degree of launch uncertainty. However, we are providing an update this morning on both drugs as well as some color on how to think about the potential opportunity this year. 
Starting with docetaxel, last month, the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided that the originator's patents asserted against us are invalid, ruling strongly in our favor. The originator has appealed this decision. We have tentative approval on our single vial product, and we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. We are assuming that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day one including an authorized generic and that the originator will stay in the market with a discounted price. We also believe the originator will convert the market to a single vial solution product and that we will be the only generic competitor with this offering. 
Moving to gemcitabine. In August, the Federal Circuit court affirmed the District Court's decision of invalidity of the -- in the Sun versus Lilly case. This ruling paved the way for us to launch our 2-gram powder presentation as an exclusive offering for a 180 day period. In late September, we filed a declaratory judgment action against Lilly. The action relates to a process patent we have litigated in other jurisdictions. We took this action preemptively in the U.S. to help secure a clear launch. We have tentative approval for our 2-gram lyophilized powder format and as with docetaxel, we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. 
We are assuming on gemcitabine that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day one including unauthorized generic, and that the originator will maintain branded pricing levels. You may also recall that we filed a 505 b2 more recently for a differentiated solution gemcitabine product which is pending FDA approval. Now if docetaxel and gemcitabine do launch before year end, the sales and EPS impact could vary significantly based on the number and launch dates of competitors, the legal position and pricing dynamics. 
We estimate that a fourth quarter launch of both docetaxel and 2-gram gemcitabine freeze dried product in the U.S. could add an incremental $0.10 to $0.15 to our EPS guidance. The majority of this total estimated increase is related to the potential docetaxel launch where we would launch all of our presentations of the drug versus gemcitabine where we'd only be launching our 2-gram product. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

And as we shut some factories down and so on, we ran into some capacity issues on Vanco and a few other products. Third, we -- while we are in a back order situation for some of our own internal reasons, there have been various competitors, I won't name them, that are off market and had exited certain products. And customers are now coming to us, customers that might not previously have purchased from us. So it's been difficult to sort of weed through their backorders and figure out what's a back order and what's not because in some of these situations, they're well documented, chronicled on the FDA site. People will order quite a bit more than they really need in the hopes that they'll get what they really consume. So those are sort of the 3 or 4 factors that have come into play. And on gemcitabine and docetaxel, the facilities that those products are coming out of are not directly impacted by the quality situation nor are they directly impacted by other capacity issues.

And although you didn't ask it, we are somewhat capacity limited on piptaz right now and you have to factor that into the sales impact this year as well as next year. The API there, and Chris elaborate on this, it's just a very difficult API to manufacture, and it's traditionally been in somewhat shorter supply. And I think as you've seen the initial generic gains, they've been not as substantial as you might have expected. So that is one where we will be capacity constrained for the mid-term, but we'll begin ramping up and then shipping advantage towards the beginning of the year. Chris, is there anything you'd add on that at all or?"

In terms of the cost mix, just to explain a little bit about our geography and where we make product, and I would really point to probably 3 geographies and just give you some relative comments. In Australia, proportionately, we make a lot more than we sell because the Mulgrave facility, which is the primary oncolytic drug facility for us ships all over the world, yet the in-country sales in Australia are proportionately, substantially less. So you've got a bit of a cost heavy revenue-light situation in Australia. If you go to Canada, we don't manufacture anything in Canada, so we have some exposure there and that we're sort of revenue heavy and all of the cost from Canada is either coming out of the U.S., a little bit out of Europe and some out of Australia. In Europe, proportionately, we sell a lot more than we make. We do have one factory -- 2 factories in Europe, one in Croatia and one in Italy, actually, where Chris was at the previous week. But relative to the income statement in Europe, we're selling a lot more product there than we are locally sourcing.

Yet, in early 2009, you could see across all industry sectors the damage that was done to share prices to companies that had higher-than-average debt levels. So today, that is very attractive. One of the reasons that we decided to do the refi at the time we did is just how attractive and open the markets are. Our maturity, average maturity length right now is about 13 years, which puts us sort of at -- in the upper quartile of our peers. As you look to next year and the cash accumulating, it's -- we really need to get through our 2011 planning process. We need to then present our longer-range plan to the board in February. And I think, at that point, we'll be a little -- we'll be a lot clearer on what uses and priority of cash will be. In terms of taking on additional debt, it's just too early to call that right now despite how attractive things are because we're kind of between this position of what's an acceptable level. And if you go back 2 or 3 years, we thought we were in fine shape and then, frankly, the stock and others got hammered because it was above average. So we've just got to kind of let this play out.

But there will be some increased costs of production and hopefully, other programs that we have in place can go to offsetting that. With respect to mix drivers, you're correct on Symbiq, and we'll have to see how the '11 guidance plays out. But Precedex will continue to grow much faster than the business, the total business because we're launching Precedex around the world. We've introduced it in Brazil. We've have a sales force in place. We saw the additional indication in Japan. It's growing extremely well here in the U.S. Vancomycin is coming back. We're not backed to our historical market share levels, but we've rebounded, and pricing has been fairly stable, down a little bit, but nothing to worry about. Project Fuel, you mentioned. And then the wide range of outcomes, assuming that one or both of these drugs is able to launch would help. Frankly, piptaz will be a drag on margins, at least, on gross margins as they're below company average because of the profit split with Sandoz. However, on a bottom line, they'll help with the operating margin because there really is no incremental SG&A expense when we add that into the sales kit.

The third quarter was a good quarter for Hospira despite facing difficult year-over-year comparison due to our very successful launch of oxaliplatin in the third quarter last year. As you recall, third quarter 2009 represented the largest sales quarter for the major generic oncology drug while it was on market. Since June 30, 2010, we temporarily exited the market due to a litigation settlement and plan to reenter in the third quarter of 2012. Despite the extremely tough comparison to the third quarter of 2009, our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals or SIP business declined only 3%. The impact of not selling oxaliplatin was tempered primarily by strength in Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin. 
Total net sales were $949 million this quarter, decreasing 6% year-over-year with relatively no impact from foreign currency. Excluding the year-over-year decline related to oxaliplatin and divestitures, net sales increased 9% versus the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 represented a decline of 18% over the third quarter 2009 EPS of $0.90 but better than our expectation for the quarter. 
The quarter saw several key Hospira achievements. I would like to highlight. We received approval for the long-term use of Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent in Japan. This approval makes Precedex available to a greater number of patients, providing a new sedative option for patients who are critically ill and require sedation for greater than 24 hours. The long-term use approval follows our launch of Precedex earlier in the year in Canada and South Korea. It is one more milestone to expanding the molecule's global presence. 
On the Biosimilars front, we were very pleased to receive approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, for Nivestim, our second commercially available Biosimilar. This was the first approval of Biosimilar filgrastim in Australia, an important step in building our global Biosimilars portfolio. Nivestim is our brand name for our Biosimilar filgrastim, which is a drug used to boost white blood cells. We launched this drug earlier in the year in Europe, and we'll be leveraging the specialized hematology, Oncology sales force we've developed across the Australian region to market Nivestim. 
We completed a commercial collaboration and co-development agreement with Smiths Medical for infusion pumps systems in the U.S. and Canada. This collaboration allows us to broaden our portfolio offering and extend our reach. It also enables the development of interoperable solutions for our respective customers which means that Hospira devices and Smiths' syringe pumps will be able to use one standard solution to view and report infusion data through Hospira's MedNet technology. 
As part of the TheraDoc clinical surveillance platform, we introduced our new anticoagulation assist knowledge module. The module helps streamline caregiver communication, improve clinical workflow and enhance patient safety, ultimately helping hospitals comply with one of the 2010 joint commission national patient safety goals, to reduce the risks of adverse events associated with anticoagulation therapy. 
And finally, more recently, we were pleased to announce last week the launch of piperacillin and tazobactam in the U.S. This drug, a generic version of Zosyn, is a broad spectrum antibiotic that had U.S. sales of $855 million in 2009. We are launching in a phased approach, both vials and our proprietary advantage system, which we believe will be well received. We already offered the drug in Europe and plan to launch it in our Asia Pacific region beginning late this year and into early 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to update you on our quality improvement initiatives, as well as the search for my successor as CEO. Regarding the warning letter we received from the U.S. FDA related to the inspections of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, we continued to make good progress during the quarter. We are on track to fulfill our planned commitments, most of which we expect to complete by year end. We also recently resumed delivery of propofol under the new manufacturing process. 
On the device side of business, we have completed replacement of the bulk of the sets related to the air in line issue with our Symbiq general infusion device and are hoping to complete the recall by the end of the year. However, to ensure we are providing our customers with the highest-quality devices available in the market, we have decided to implement certain software enhancements related to this and previously announced issues. We expect these enhancements will be filed with the broader software upgrade package early in the first quarter of 2011. Thus, at this time, approval timing remains uncertain. New pump placements will remain on voluntary hold until our corrective activities are completed. 
And to update you on the search for my successor as CEO, we commenced the search for a new CEO in August using Egon Zehnder, a global leader in executive search. Since that time, Egon Zehnder has received interest from several dozen candidates and narrowed that list to a short list. They are currently in the process of screening and interviewing the shortlist candidates. The board has been pleased with the interest and qualifications of the candidates and looks forward to conducting interviews over the next couple of months. 
As I mentioned at the onset of my CEO retirement announcement, I will remain in place as CEO as long as it takes to find my replacement and then transition to the new role of Executive Chairman. Those of you who know me realize how important this is to me. I want to make sure that we not only get the right person for the job at Hospira but also that the transition goes smoothly for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,113828427,163126,"Hospira Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying the",2554,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying the press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. 
Global net sales declined 6% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. But as Chris mentioned, excluding the impact of oxaliplatin and the divestitures, global net sales actually increased 9%. Global Specialty Injectables net sales declined 3% given an extremely tough year-over-year comparison due to oxaliplatin. By segment, net specialty injectable sales in the Americas were down 4% for the third quarter, while strong sales of oxaliplatin carried us through the first half of the year reflected in the 18% year-to-date year-over-year performance. Several of our other SIP drugs Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin performed very well in the third quarter. 
Drilling down into the growth drivers for the quarter, we saw another quarter of strong demand for Precedex. It's been a very solid growth year for the drug. First, Precedex has gained an extremely strong reputation as a sedation agent addressing unmet clinical needs among anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. Second, our specialized sales force has been highly effective in communicating the differentiating attributes of the drug to new prescribers and thereby improving market penetration. 
We mentioned on our call last quarter that we launched the anti-infective drug, meropenem, in the U.S. at the tail end of the second quarter. The third quarter was the first full quarter where we saw a substantial positive impact. Being the only generic on the market so far, we've quickly gained market share and currently hold approximately 30% of the total U.S. market. 
Moving to Vancomycin, we made good progress during the quarter in reducing our back orders and maintaining our #1 share position. We're currently meeting market demand and are building inventory levels back up to our targeted levels. We also saw a continued momentum for our new presentations of high-dose heparin. While additional competition has entered the market, pricing has remained relatively stable, and we've maintained our market share of over 20%. 
Turning to EMEA. Net sales of specialty injectables in the European region increased 7% in the quarter, driving the quarter's results was continued momentum in many of our recently launched molecules and the introduction of docetaxel in countries throughout Europe this year. Retacrit, our first Biosimilar, had another solid quarter and continues to hold its leading position in the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe. Net sales of specialty injectables in Asia-Pacific decreased 7% over the prior-year third quarter due primarily to aggressive pricing in both oncology and anti-infectives. Response to Precedex in Japan has continued to be positive, bolstered by the recent approval of the long-term indication. 
Turning now to devices, net sales of global Medication Management Systems were down 6% versus the third quarter of 2009, primarily a result of performance in the Americas where MMS net sales declined 8%. First, Symbiq remains on ship-hold and as a result, we did not recognize any new customer pump-related sales for this infusion device in the third quarter. Second, we characterized the quarter by a general slowdown in pump sales activity as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We anticipate a soft market through the remainder of the year with increased activity in 2011 and 2012 as Baxter Colleague customers begin executing on their decisions. 
Outside the Americas, MMS net sales increased 7% year-over-year in EMEA and 13% in Asia-Pacific. Both regions experienced continued momentum with dedicated set sales for our Plum general infusion device and our GemStar ambulatory device. Sales in both our Other Pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter primarily due to the divestitures we've completed over the past 18 months. Other Pharma also experienced a particularly soft quarter as the backorder issues discussed on the second quarter call impacted our ability to supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. 
Moving down the rest of the income statement, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 42.8%, up 130 basis points compared to 41.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement was favorable product mix driven by Precedex, as well as cost reductions associated with Project Fuel efforts. These factors were partially offset by charges associated with the FDA warning letter and our voluntary ship holds. In addition, we incurred pretax onetime charges of $15 million during the quarter related to quality consulting and assessment activity, idle facility costs, all associated with our quality improvement efforts. 
R&D expense increased 13% in the quarter to $65 million, primarily a result of the timing of spending related to clinical trials. R&D, as a percentage of net sales, was 6.9% up from 5.7% in last year's third quarter. SG&A expense for the third quarter was $159 million down 2% from $162 million for the same period last year. Driving the improved SG&A performance were cost reductions associated with Project Fuel initiatives as well as the timing of certain spending. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 16.7% compared to 16.1% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $189 million versus $207 million in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin at 19.9% decreased by 70 basis points versus 20.6% in last year's third quarter. We continue to make significant progress year-to-date on Project Fuel and are on track to meet our estimate of $70 million to $80 million in cumulative savings this year and $110 million to $140 million in cumulative savings in 2011. 
Interest expense increased 6% to $27 million in the third quarter from $25 million last year due to a partial quarter of additional but temporary interest associated with our new $500 million of 30-year debt. Earlier this month, that's October, the proceeds in cash on hand were used to pay down our $500 million, 5-year debt that was originally due in 2012, thereby eliminating future incremental interest expense. 
Related to the early debt repayment was a onetime charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $36.8 million in the third quarter that, as I mentioned, was paid in October. The charge is included in other expense nets on the income statement. Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 23.8% bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 25.0%. This continues to be higher than we had anticipated due to the fact that Congress has not yet approved anticipated extensions of tax provisions that expired at the beginning of this year. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.74 compared to $0.90 last year. 
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010 was $235 million compared to $541 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily a result of the expected 2010 payout of chargebacks and rebates as 2009 sales of oxaliplatin moved from the wholesaler to the end-user, as well as increased inventories to improve our service levels and increased income tax and quality initiative-related payments. 
At September 30, our cash balance was $1.1 billion compared to $946 million at December 31, 2009 and $921 million at September 30, 2009. The increase since the end of last year was primarily related to the timing of the new issuance of the $500 million in 30-year notes, partially offset by the acquisition of Orchid and Javelin and other investing related M&A activities. 
Capital spending in the quarter was $62 million compared to $41 million in the same period last year. The increase primarily reflects investments we're making with respect to manufacturing improvement initiatives and IT infrastructure enhancements. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, at the end of the second quarter, we had a remaining share buyback authorization of approximately $100 million out of the original $400 million authorization that was approved in 2006 by our Board of Directors. During this quarter, the third quarter, to address the share count creep associated with stock options, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase or ASR contract to repurchase $50 million of our common stock. Under the ASR, we received approximately 725,000 shares with the remaining shares to be delivered over 3 months subject to adjustments based on the average stock price during the period. The ASR is expected to be completed no later than November 23 of this year. 
Since 2006, as of the end of the third quarter this year, we cumulatively repurchased 8.3 million shares or $350 million in aggregate purchases under the board authorization. At the end of the third quarter, our outstanding diluted share count was at approximately 170 million shares. 
Turning now to full year guidance, during our second quarter earnings call in July, we projected 2010 global net sales growth of 3% to 5% and earnings per share in the range -- adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. Since then, several items have surfaced that could have an impact on guidance. Starting with sales, there are 2 primary factors that could affect guidance. First, as we discussed earlier, in our MMS business, this quarter was characterized by a general slowdown in pump sales activity. We believe the market is somewhat frozen as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We don't expect to see a change in activity until sometime in 2011 when we believe Baxter Colleague customers will start to execute on their device decisions. As a result, we've reduced our MMS sales expectations for the remainder of the year. 
The second item relates to the increase in backorders which we discussed on the second quarter call. The backorder increase was driven primarily by delays in deliveries as a result of our quality enhancement initiatives and on certain drugs, capacity related constraints. Our contract manufacturing business, which is reflected in the Other Pharma product line, utilizes some of the same capacity in our manufacturing facilities and the buildup in backorders and accompanying delays in delivery have impacted certain contract manufacturing customers. 
While we're making progress on reducing these back orders, our inability to adequately supply product will result in lower-than-anticipated performance in the Other Pharma product line for this year. So primarily as a result of these 2 items, we're reducing our full year global net sales growth by 1%. We therefore expect net sales to range between -- net sales growth to range between 2% and 3% on a constant-currency basis with foreign exchange contributing a 1% benefit. 
We're maintaining our gross margin range of 42% to 43% and our operating margin range of 20% to 21%. Our adjusted tax rate guidance remains at 22% to 23% for 2010. This projection is based on the assumption that certain U.S. tax provisions will still be renewed before year end, retroactive to January 1 of this year. We therefore expect that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the first 9 months of the year, bringing the full year rate in line with our original expectation. Now, obviously, there’s risk in this assumption if these provisions are not renewed by Congress. 
Moving to earnings per share, we feel confident we can meet the favorable end of many of these projected ranges. And as a result, we're narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of our previous guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to range between $3.40 and $3.45 per share, representing growth of 9% to 11% over 2009. While consensus EPS is currently above our estimated range of $3.40 to $3.45, I want to reiterate that our 2010 guidance at this point does not include any U.S. sales of docetaxel or gemcitabine. It also does not include or assume resumption of sales of Symbiq devices to new customers in 2010. However, the guidance does include the expected impact of our launch last week of generic Zosyn. 
Based on many of the analysts' notes published last week, I'd like to clarify a few issues regarding generic Zocyn. First, today, we are focused on the single-dose vial and frozen pre-mixed markets. Second, the impact in 2010 will be limited as the product is being rolled out on a gradual basis with single-dose vials already on market, an advantage starting to shift for the beginning of next year. Third, product sales will steadily ramp up over time as capacity ramps up. And fourth, as we've mentioned in prior calls, the product is a partnered product with shared margins. 
We continue to exclude docetaxel and gemcitabine from our full year guidance because they are litigated drugs which still carry a degree of launch uncertainty. However, we are providing an update this morning on both drugs as well as some color on how to think about the potential opportunity this year. 
Starting with docetaxel, last month, the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided that the originator's patents asserted against us are invalid, ruling strongly in our favor. The originator has appealed this decision. We have tentative approval on our single vial product, and we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. We are assuming that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day one including an authorized generic and that the originator will stay in the market with a discounted price. We also believe the originator will convert the market to a single vial solution product and that we will be the only generic competitor with this offering. 
Moving to gemcitabine. In August, the Federal Circuit court affirmed the District Court's decision of invalidity of the -- in the Sun versus Lilly case. This ruling paved the way for us to launch our 2-gram powder presentation as an exclusive offering for a 180 day period. In late September, we filed a declaratory judgment action against Lilly. The action relates to a process patent we have litigated in other jurisdictions. We took this action preemptively in the U.S. to help secure a clear launch. We have tentative approval for our 2-gram lyophilized powder format and as with docetaxel, we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. 
We are assuming on gemcitabine that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day one including an authorized generic, and that the originator will maintain branded pricing levels. You may also recall that we filed a 505 b2 more recently for a differentiated solution gemcitabine product which is pending FDA approval. Now if docetaxel and gemcitabine do launch before year end, the sales and EPS impact could vary significantly based on the number and launch dates of competitors, the legal position and pricing dynamics. 
We estimate that a fourth quarter launch of both docetaxel and 2-gram gemcitabine freeze dried product in the U.S. could add an incremental $0.10 to $0.15 to our EPS guidance. The majority of this total estimated increase is related to the potential docetaxel launch where we would launch all of our presentations of the drug versus gemcitabine where we'd only be launching our 2-gram product. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

And as we shut some factories down and so on, we ran into some capacity issues on Vanco and a few other products. Third, we -- while we are in a back order situation for some of our own internal reasons, there have been various competitors, I won't name them, that are off market and have exited certain products. And customers are now coming to us, customers that might not previously have purchased from us. So it's been difficult to sort of weed through their backorders and figure out what's a back order and what's not because in some of these situations, they're well documented, chronicled on the FDA site. People will order quite a bit more than they really need in the hopes that they'll get what they really consume. So those are sort of the 3 or 4 factors that have come into play. And on gemcitabine and docetaxel, the facilities that those products are coming out of are not directly impacted by the quality situation nor are they directly impacted by other capacity issues.

On propofol, we've got to ramp back up to get to where we were and then see how things go. And although you didn't ask it, we are somewhat capacity limited on piptaz right now and you have to factor that into the sales impact this year as well as next year. The API there, and Chris can elaborate on this, it's just a very difficult API to manufacture, and it's traditionally been in somewhat short supply. And I think as you've seen the initial generic gains, they've been not as substantial as you might have expected. So that is one where we will be capacity constrained for the mid-term, but we'll begin ramping up and then shipping advantage towards the beginning of the year. Chris, anything you'd add on that at all or?"

In terms of the cost mix, just to explain a little bit about our geography and where we make product, and I would really point to probably 3 geographies and just give you some relative comments. In Australia, proportionately, we make a lot more than we sell because the Mulgrave facility, which is the primary oncolytic drug facility for us ships all over the world, yet the in-country sales in Australia are proportionately, substantially less. So you've got a bit of a cost heavy revenue-light situation in Australia. If you go to Canada, we don't manufacture anything in Canada, so we have some exposure there in that we're sort of revenue heavy and all of the cost from Canada is either coming out of the U.S., a little bit out of Europe and some out of Australia. In Europe, proportionately, we sell a lot more than we make. We do have one factory -- 2 factories in Europe, one in Croatia and one in Italy, actually, where Chris was at the previous week. But relative to the income statement in Europe, we're selling a lot more product there than we are locally sourcing.

Yet, in early 2009, you could see across all industry sectors the damage that was done to share prices to companies that had higher-than-average debt levels. So today, debt is very attractive. One of the reasons that we decided to do the refi at the time we did is just how attractive and open the markets are. Our maturity, average maturity length right now is about 13 years, which puts us sort of at -- in the upper quartile of our peers. As you look to next year and the cash accumulating, it's -- we really need to get through our 2011 planning process. We need to then present our longer-range plan to the board in February. And I think, at that point, we'll be a little -- we'll be a lot clearer on what uses and priority of cash will be. In terms of taking on additional debt, it's just too early to call that right now despite how attractive things are because we're kind of between this position of what's an acceptable level. And if you go back 2 or 3 years, we thought we were in fine shape and then, frankly, the stock and others got hammered because it was above average. So we've just got to kind of let this play out. The tax law is changing with respect to dividends. We've got a lot of moving pieces. So sorry, I can't be a little more clearer at this point, but we will be in the coming months."

But there will be some increased costs of production and hopefully, other programs that we have in place can go to offsetting that. With respect to mix drivers, you're correct on Symbiq, and we'll have to see how the '11 guidance plays out. But Precedex will continue to grow much faster than the business, the total business because we're launching Precedex around the world. We've introduced it in Brazil. We've have a sales force in place. We saw the additional indication in Japan. It's growing extremely well here in the U.S. Vancomycin is coming back. We're not backed to our historical market share levels, but we've rebounded, and pricing has been fairly stable, down a little bit, but nothing to worry about. Project Fuel, you mentioned. And then the wide range of outcomes, assuming that one or both of these drugs is able to launch would help. Frankly, piptaz will be a drag on margins, at least, on gross margins as they're below company average because of the profit split with Sandoz. However, on a bottom line, they'll help with the operating margin because there really is no incremental SG&A expense when we add that into the sales kit.

But as you know, historically, we've had trouble spending the money as fast as we initially think we can."

The third quarter was a good quarter for Hospira despite facing difficult year-over-year comparison due to our very successful launch of oxaliplatin in the third quarter last year. As you recall, third quarter 2009 represented the largest sales quarter for the major generic oncology drug while it was on market. Since June 30, 2010, we temporarily exited the market due to a litigation settlement and plan to reenter in the third quarter of 2012. Despite the extremely tough comparison to the third quarter of 2009, our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals or SIP business declined only 3%. The impact of not selling oxaliplatin was tempered primarily by strength in Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin. 
Total net sales were $949 million this quarter, decreasing 6% year-over-year with relatively no impact from foreign currency. Excluding the year-over-year decline related to oxaliplatin and divestitures, net sales increased 9% versus the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 represented a decline of 18% over the third quarter 2009 EPS of $0.90 but better than our expectation for the quarter. 
The quarter saw several key Hospira achievements. I would like to highlight. We received approval for the long-term use of Precedex, our proprietary sedation agent in Japan. This approval makes Precedex available to a greater number of patients, providing a new sedative option for patients who are critically ill and require sedation for greater than 24 hours. The long-term use approval follows our launch of Precedex earlier in the year in Canada and South Korea. It is one more milestone to expanding the molecule's global presence. 
On the Biosimilars front, we were very pleased to receive approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, for Nivestim, our second commercially available Biosimilar. This was the first approval of Biosimilar filgrastim in Australia, an important step in building our global Biosimilars portfolio. Nivestim is our brand name for our Biosimilar filgrastim, which is a drug used to boost white blood cells. We launched this drug earlier in the year in Europe, and we'll be leveraging the specialized hematology, Oncology sales force we've developed across the Australian region to market Nivestim. 
We completed a commercial collaboration and co-development agreement with Smiths Medical for infusion pumps systems in the U.S. and Canada. This collaboration allows us to broaden our portfolio offering and extend our reach. It also enables the development of interoperable solutions for our respective customers which means that Hospira devices and Smiths' syringe pumps will be able to use one standard solution to view and report infusion data through Hospira's MedNet technology. 
As part of the TheraDoc clinical surveillance platform, we introduced our new anticoagulation assist knowledge module. The module helps streamline caregiver communication, improve clinical workflow and enhance patient safety, ultimately helping hospitals comply with one of the 2010 joint commission national patient safety goals, to reduce the risks of adverse events associated with anticoagulation therapy. 
And finally, more recently, we were pleased to announce last week the launch of piperacillin and tazobactam in the U.S. This drug, a generic version of Zosyn, is a broad spectrum antibiotic that had U.S. sales of $855 million in 2009. We are launching in a phased approach, both vials and our proprietary advantage system, which we believe will be well received. We already offered the drug in Europe and plan to launch it in our Asia Pacific region beginning late this year and into early 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to update you on our quality improvement initiatives, as well as the search for my successor as CEO. Regarding the warning letter we received from the U.S. FDA related to the inspections of our manufacturing facilities in Clayton and Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, we continued to make good progress during the quarter. We are on track to fulfill our planned commitments, most of which we expect to complete by year end. We also recently resumed delivery of propofol under the new manufacturing process. 
On the device side of business, we have completed replacement of the bulk of the sets related to the air in line issue with our Symbiq general infusion device and are hoping to complete the recall by the end of the year. However, to ensure we are providing our customers with the highest-quality devices available in the market, we have decided to implement certain software enhancements related to this and previously announced issues. We expect these enhancements will be filed with the broader software upgrade package early in the first quarter of 2011. Thus, at this time, approval timing remains uncertain. New pump placements will remain on voluntary hold until our corrective activities are completed. 
And to update you on the search for my successor as CEO, we commenced the search for a new CEO in August using Egon Zehnder, a global leader in executive search. Since that time, Egon Zehnder has received interest from several dozen candidates and narrowed that list to a short list. They are currently in the process of screening and interviewing the shortlist candidates. The board has been pleased with the interest and qualifications of the candidates and looks forward to conducting interviews over the next couple of months. 
As I mentioned at the onset of my CEO retirement announcement, I will remain in place as CEO as long as it takes to find my replacement and then transition to the new role of Executive Chairman. Those of you who know me realize how important this is to me. I want to make sure that we not only get the right person for the job at Hospira but also that the transition goes smoothly for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,113828427,164967,"Hospira Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

I'll remind everyone that references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Please refer to the table and the schedules accompanying the press release for the impact of foreign currency by segment and product line. 
Global net sales declined 6% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. But as Chris mentioned, excluding the impact of oxaliplatin and the divestitures, global net sales actually increased 9%. Global Specialty Injectables net sales declined 3% given an extremely tough year-over-year comparison due to oxaliplatin. By segment, net specialty injectable sales in the Americas were down 4% for the third quarter, while strong sales of oxaliplatin carried us through the first half of the year reflected in the 18% year-to-date year-over-year performance. Several of our other SIP drugs Precedex, meropenem, Vancomycin and heparin performed very well in the third quarter. 
Drilling down into the growth drivers for the quarter, we saw another quarter of strong demand for Precedex. It's been a very solid growth year for the drug. First, Precedex has gained an extremely strong reputation as a sedation agent addressing unmet clinical needs among anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. Second, our specialized sales force has been highly effective in communicating the differentiating attributes of the drug to new prescribers and thereby improving market penetration. 
We mentioned on our call last quarter that we launched the anti-infective drug, meropenem, in the U.S. at the tail end of the second quarter. The third quarter was the first full quarter where we saw a substantial positive impact. Being the only generic on the market so far, we've quickly gained market share and currently hold approximately 30% of the total U.S. market. 
Moving to Vancomycin, we made good progress during the quarter in reducing our back orders and maintaining our #1 share position. We're currently meeting market demand and are building inventory levels back up to our targeted levels. We also saw a continued momentum for our new presentations of high-dose heparin. While additional competition has entered the market, pricing has remained relatively stable, and we've maintained our market share of over 20%. 
Turning to EMEA. Net sales of specialty injectables in the European region increased 7% in the quarter, driving the quarter's results was continued momentum in many of our recently launched molecules and the introduction of docetaxel in countries throughout Europe this year. Retacrit, our first Biosimilar, had another solid quarter and continues to hold its leading position in the total short-acting biogeneric EPO market in Europe. Net sales of specialty injectables in Asia-Pacific decreased 7% over the prior-year third quarter due primarily to aggressive pricing in both oncology and anti-infectives. Response to Precedex in Japan has continued to be positive, bolstered by the recent approval of the long-term indication. 
Turning now to devices, net sales of global Medication Management Systems were down 6% versus the third quarter of 2009, primarily a result of performance in the Americas where MMS net sales declined 8%. First, Symbiq remains on ship-hold and as a result, we did not recognize any new customer pump-related sales for this infusion device in the third quarter. Second, we characterized the quarter by a general slowdown in pump sales activity as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We anticipate a soft market through the remainder of the year with increased activity in 2011 and 2012 as Baxter Colleague customers begin executing on their decisions. 
Outside the Americas, MMS net sales increased 7% year-over-year in EMEA and 13% in Asia-Pacific. Both regions experienced continued momentum with dedicated set sales for our Plum general infusion device and our GemStar ambulatory device. Sales in both our Other Pharma and other device product lines decreased across all regions in the quarter primarily due to the divestitures we've completed over the past 18 months. Other Pharma also experienced a particularly soft quarter as the backorder issues discussed on the second quarter call impacted our ability to supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. 
Moving down the rest of the income statement, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 42.8%, up 130 basis points compared to 41.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Contributing to the improvement was favorable product mix driven by Precedex, as well as cost reductions associated with Project Fuel efforts. These factors were partially offset by charges associated with the FDA warning letter and our voluntary ship holds. In addition, we incurred pretax onetime charges of $15 million during the quarter related to quality consulting and assessment activity, idle facility costs, all associated with our quality improvement efforts. 
R&D expense increased 13% in the quarter to $65 million, primarily a result of the timing of spending related to clinical trials. R&D, as a percentage of net sales, was 6.9% up from 5.7% in last year's third quarter. SG&A expense for the third quarter was $159 million down 2% from $162 million for the same period last year. Driving the improved SG&A performance were cost reductions associated with Project Fuel initiatives as well as the timing of certain spending. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 16.7% compared to 16.1% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $189 million versus $207 million in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin at 19.9% decreased by 70 basis points versus 20.6% in last year's third quarter. We continue to make significant progress year-to-date on Project Fuel and are on track to meet our estimate of $70 million to $80 million in cumulative savings this year and $110 million to $140 million in cumulative savings in 2011. 
Interest expense increased 6% to $27 million in the third quarter from $25 million last year due to a partial quarter of additional but temporary interest associated with our new $500 million of 30-year debt. Earlier this month, that's October, the proceeds in cash on hand were used to pay down our $500 million, 5-year debt that was originally due in 2012, thereby eliminating future incremental interest expense. 
Related to the early debt repayment was a onetime charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $36.8 million in the third quarter that, as I mentioned, was paid in October. The charge is included in other expense nets on the income statement. Our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 23.8% bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 25.0%. This continues to be higher than we had anticipated due to the fact that Congress has not yet approved anticipated extensions of tax provisions that expired at the beginning of this year. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.74 compared to $0.90 last year. 
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010 was $235 million compared to $541 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily a result of the expected 2010 payout of chargebacks and rebates as 2009 sales of oxaliplatin moved from the wholesaler to the end-user, as well as increased inventories to improve our service levels and increased income tax and quality initiative-related payments. 
At September 30, our cash balance was $1.1 billion compared to $946 million at December 31, 2009 and $921 million at September 30, 2009. The increase since the end of last year was primarily related to the timing of the new issuance of the $500 million in 30-year notes, partially offset by the acquisition of Orchid and Javelin and other investing related M&A activities. 
Capital spending in the quarter was $62 million compared to $41 million in the same period last year. The increase primarily reflects investments we're making with respect to manufacturing improvement initiatives and IT infrastructure enhancements. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, at the end of the second quarter, we had a remaining share buyback authorization of approximately $100 million out of the original $400 million authorization that was approved in 2006 by our Board of Directors. During this quarter, the third quarter, to address the share count creep associated with stock options, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase or ASR contract to repurchase $50 million of our common stock. Under the ASR, we received approximately 725,000 shares with the remaining shares to be delivered over 3 months subject to adjustments based on the average stock price during the period. The ASR is expected to be completed no later than November 23 of this year. 
Since 2006, as of the end of the third quarter this year, we cumulatively repurchased 8.3 million shares or $350 million in aggregate purchases under the board authorization. At the end of the third quarter, our outstanding diluted share count was at approximately 170 million shares. 
Turning now to full year guidance, during our second quarter earnings call in July, we projected 2010 global net sales growth of 3% to 5% and earnings per share in the range -- adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. Since then, several items have surfaced that could have an impact on guidance. Starting with sales, there are 2 primary factors that could affect guidance. First, as we discussed earlier, in our MMS business, this quarter was characterized by a general slowdown in pump sales activity. We believe the market is somewhat frozen as prospective customers worked through the evaluation and decision-making process related to choosing their next pump platform. We don't expect to see a change in activity until sometime in 2011 when we believe Baxter Colleague customers will start to execute on their device decisions. As a result, we've reduced our MMS sales expectations for the remainder of the year. 
The second item relates to the increase in backorders which we discussed on the second quarter call. The backorder increase was driven primarily by delays in deliveries as a result of our quality enhancement initiatives and on certain drugs, capacity related constraints. Our contract manufacturing business, which is reflected in the Other Pharma product line, utilizes some of the same capacity in our manufacturing facilities and the buildup in backorders and accompanying delays in delivery have impacted certain contract manufacturing customers. 
While we're making progress on reducing these back orders, our inability to adequately supply product will result in lower-than-anticipated performance in the Other Pharma product line for this year. So primarily as a result of these 2 items, we're reducing our full year global net sales growth by 1%. We therefore expect net sales to range between -- net sales growth to range between 2% and 3% on a constant-currency basis with foreign exchange contributing a 1% benefit. 
We're maintaining our gross margin range of 42% to 43% and our operating margin range of 20% to 21%. Our adjusted tax rate guidance remains at 22% to 23% for 2010. This projection is based on the assumption that certain U.S. tax provisions will still be renewed before year end, retroactive to January 1 of this year. We therefore expect that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the first 9 months of the year, bringing the full year rate in line with our original expectation. Now, obviously, there’s risk in this assumption if these provisions are not renewed by Congress. 
Moving to earnings per share, we feel confident we can meet the favorable end of many of these projected ranges. And as a result, we're narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance to the upper end of our previous guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to range between $3.40 and $3.45 per share, representing growth of 9% to 11% over 2009. While consensus EPS is currently above our estimated range of $3.40 to $3.45, I want to reiterate that our 2010 guidance at this point does not include any U.S. sales of docetaxel or gemcitabine. It also does not include or assume resumption of sales of Symbiq devices to new customers in 2010. However, the guidance does include the expected impact of our launch last week of generic Zosyn. 
Based on many of the analysts' notes published last week, I'd like to clarify a few issues regarding generic Zocyn. First, today, we are focused on the single-dose vial and frozen pre-mixed markets. Second, the impact in 2010 will be limited as the product is being rolled out on a gradual basis with single-dose vials already on market, an advantage starting to shift for the beginning of next year. Third, product sales will steadily ramp up over time as capacity ramps up. And fourth, as we've mentioned in prior calls, the product is a partnered product with shared margins. 
We continue to exclude docetaxel and gemcitabine from our full year guidance because they are litigated drugs which still carry a degree of launch uncertainty. However, we are providing an update this morning on both drugs as well as some color on how to think about the potential opportunity this year. 
Starting with docetaxel, last month, the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided that the originator's patents asserted against us are invalid, ruling strongly in our favor. The originator has appealed this decision. We have tentative approval on our single vial product, and we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. We are assuming that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day one including an authorized generic and that the originator will stay in the market with a discounted price. We also believe the originator will convert the market to a single vial solution product and that we will be the only generic competitor with this offering. 
Moving to gemcitabine. In August, the Federal Circuit court affirmed the District Court's decision of invalidity of the -- in the Sun versus Lilly case. This ruling paved the way for us to launch our 2-gram powder presentation as an exclusive offering for a 180 day period. In late September, we filed a declaratory judgment action against Lilly. The action relates to a process patent we have litigated in other jurisdictions. We took this action preemptively in the U.S. to help secure a clear launch. We have tentative approval for our 2-gram lyophilized powder format and as with docetaxel, we'll be ready to launch in mid-November assuming we receive final FDA approval. 
We are assuming on gemcitabine that 2 other generic competitors will be on market day one including an authorized generic, and that the originator will maintain branded pricing levels. You may also recall that we filed a 505 b2 more recently for a differentiated solution gemcitabine product which is pending FDA approval. Now if docetaxel and gemcitabine do launch before year end, the sales and EPS impact could vary significantly based on the number and launch dates of competitors, the legal position and pricing dynamics. 
We estimate that a fourth quarter launch of both docetaxel and 2-gram gemcitabine freeze dried product in the U.S. could add an incremental $0.10 to $0.15 to our EPS guidance. The majority of this total estimated increase is related to the potential docetaxel launch where we would launch all of our presentations of the drug versus gemcitabine where we'd only be launching our 2-gram product. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

And as we shut some factories down and so on, we ran into some capacity issues on Vanco and a few other products. Third, we -- while we are in a back order situation for some of our own internal reasons, there have been various competitors, I won't name them, that are off market and have exited certain products. And customers are now coming to us, customers that might not previously have purchased from us. So it's been difficult to sort of weed through their backorders and figure out what's a back order and what's not because in some of these situations, they're well documented, chronicled on the FDA site. People will order quite a bit more than they really need in the hopes that they'll get what they really consume. So those are sort of the 3 or 4 factors that have come into play. And on gemcitabine and docetaxel, the facilities that those products are coming out of are not directly impacted by the quality situation nor are they directly impacted by other capacity issues.

The API there, and Chris can elaborate on this, it's just a very difficult API to manufacture, and it's traditionally been in somewhat short supply. And I think as you've seen the initial generic gains, they've been not as substantial as you might have expected. So that is one where we will be capacity constrained for the mid-term, but we'll begin ramping up and then shipping advantage towards the beginning of the year.

In terms of the cost mix, just to explain a little bit about our geography and where we make product, and I would really point to probably 3 geographies and just give you some relative comments. In Australia, proportionately, we make a lot more than we sell because the Mulgrave facility, which is the primary oncolytic drug facility for us ships all over the world, yet the in-country sales in Australia are proportionately, substantially less. So you've got a bit of a cost heavy revenue-light situation in Australia. If you go to Canada, we don't manufacture anything in Canada, so we have some exposure there in that we're sort of revenue heavy and all of the cost from Canada is either coming out of the U.S., a little bit out of Europe and some out of Australia. In Europe, proportionately, we sell a lot more than we make. We do have one factory -- 2 factories in Europe, one in Croatia and one in Italy, actually, where Chris was at the previous week. But relative to the income statement in Europe, we're selling a lot more product there than we are locally sourcing.

Yet, in early 2009, you could see across all industry sectors the damage that was done to share prices to companies that had higher-than-average debt levels. So today, debt is very attractive. One of the reasons that we decided to do the refi at the time we did is just how attractive and open the markets are. Our maturity, average maturity length right now is about 13 years, which puts us sort of at -- in the upper quartile of our peers. As you look to next year and the cash accumulating, it's -- we really need to get through our 2011 planning process. We need to then present our longer-range plan to the board in February. And I think, at that point, we'll be a little -- we'll be a lot clearer on what uses and priority of cash will be. In terms of taking on additional debt, it's just too early to call that right now despite how attractive things are because we're kind of between this position of what's an acceptable level. And if you go back 2 or 3 years, we thought we were in fine shape and then, frankly, the stock and others got hammered because it was above average. So we've just got to kind of let this play out.

But there will be some increased costs of production and hopefully, other programs that we have in place can go to offsetting that. With respect to mix drivers, you're correct on Symbiq, and we'll have to see how the '11 guidance plays out. But Precedex will continue to grow much faster than the business, the total business because we're launching Precedex around the world. We've introduced it in Brazil. We've have a sales force in place. We saw the additional indication in Japan. It's growing extremely well here in the U.S. Vancomycin is coming back. We're not backed to our historical market share levels, but we've rebounded, and pricing has been fairly stable, down a little bit, but nothing to worry about. Project Fuel, you mentioned. And then the wide range of outcomes, assuming that one or both of these drugs is able to launch would help. Frankly, piptaz will be a drag on margins, at least, on gross margins as they're below company average because of the profit split with Sandoz.

But to say that, that's a new level, we had initially guided to about 6.7% of sales this year, which I think worked out to somewhere around $260 million. So that's what, about $65 million a quarter. But Greg, it's -- it can be really lumpy depending on what type of clinical studies are going on. So it's just -- I mean, the number doesn't move from $60 million to $30 million. But to sort of say that $70 million would be a new benchmark, it's going to bounce around, plus or minus, off of that depending on the clinical activity. But both in SG&A, as we mentioned in our opening comments, there was some favorable timing of spending, promotional expenses and some other things in marketing that we saw in the third quarter, which could spill over into the fourth quarter and the forecast I have which show R&D going up in the fourth quarter. But as you know, historically, we've had trouble spending the money as fast as we initially think we can."

So we're going to continue to rebound in Vancomycin and expect a strong fourth quarter. With respect -- the other product I was going to cite was propofol. That's probably not back to normal levels until probably the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter next year. But the market's going to be very different. It doesn't look like that there's going to be as many competitors in that product as there were prior. So assuming all goes well with ramping production back up, we'll look at our capacity situation and share gain in pricing as well."

And at this point, to say there is a Project Fuel the second, a little preliminary on that topic. But there's good momentum here and people have learned quite a bit as we've look at our cost structure and looked at opportunities to simplify the business. So what we've learned is that in this business, particularly the generic pharma side, is you can't standstill, and you need to continue to stay out in front of the cost curve. And whether it's Project Fuel or other initiatives, we intend to do that. So were not going to sort of rest on our laurels and watch things pass us by.
