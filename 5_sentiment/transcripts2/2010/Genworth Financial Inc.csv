Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with the solid improvement in both sales and earnings results we reported this quarter, and we will remain very focused on continued execution of our strategies to keep building on this progress. More specifically, the actions we took in 2009 to manage risk and put cash back to work coupled with improved economic and housing market conditions in most markets and our targeted growth strategies are clearly paying off.Importantly, the fourth quarter trends are a good indicator for improved earnings power and results in 2010 and beyond. Today, I'll focus on a few key highlights in each of our business segments and in the investment portfolio, then Pat and Kevin will provide more detail on market trends and performance in our business segments. Before getting into these areas, I would note that we continue to see improving markets overall but economic recovery in general will be gradual in most markets and consumers remain stressed. So I would characterize our view as optimistic, tempered by the realism of a choppy recovery and appropriate caution regarding markets that are still trying to find their footing for the possibility of unforeseen events.Starting with Retirement and Protection, our refined specialist strategies centered around Main Street life insurance, long-term care insurance and independent advisor wealth management offerings with a more targeted focus on the annuity front is proceeding well. Basically, we see all consumers and in particular, Main Street consumers, reassessing how they build their personal safety net, what advisers what want to work with going forward, what approaches make the most sense when it comes to investing and how to do all this in a balanced way, with less reliance on self insuring through the equity in their home or gains that they may have in a stock portfolio. At the same time, distributors, producers and advisers are looking for companies who can be their growth partners.These dynamics intersect well with our enhanced focus and capabilities within the Retirement and Protection areas. For example, the launch of our new life insurance product suite has been quite successful, with strong initial trends in overall submitted policies. As a reminder, we introduced our new colony term UL product, which is basically a term life value proposition sold on a Universal Life chassis. Here, we've optimized the pricing and reserve patterns with the UL structure to allow us to be much more capital efficient.On the Universal Life side, we've optimized our pricing to match it with a reasonable actuarial definition of lifetime to deliver a capital-efficient product with a strong value proposition and competitive rate for Main Street consumers. In addition, long-term care sales also showed sequential growth and we see a gradual improvement in that market. Finally, we are pleased with the momentum building in our wealth management business as evidenced by positive net flows and gains in market position versus competitors.Turning to international, I am encouraged on two fronts. First, housing market and economic conditions in Canada and Australia have continued to improve with stabilizing or improving trends across home prices, unemployment and GDP. And in Lifestyle Protection, the swift action we took to reprice business and restructure distribution agreements is showing strong early results. Our repricing efforts are on track with most large contracts completed at year end. And you can see the associated lift as part of our earnings this quarter. In 2010, we are targeting incremental earnings lift of approximately $30 million from these efforts gathering into earnings throughout the year.In Europe, we remain cautious about the recessionary conditions that have persisted in many countries, resulting in higher unemployment and lower levels of consumer lending, and we do not expect quick economic recoveries. So we anticipate continued pressures from some claims durations extending, and lower levels of new business, which would negatively impact revenue in Europe. Now on this last point, we're not standing still and are diligently pursuing the growth strategies outlined at our December Investor Day to generate additional new business at appropriate returns.Finally, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, I would highlight three areas where results in the quarter showed sound progress. First, there are good indications that USMI earnings troughed in 2009 and that we are on a gradual upward trajectory, though we might expect some choppiness quarter to quarter. Extensive loss-mitigation efforts are helping lead this transition along with loss results, which are showing signs of improvement. Importantly, in the bulk business, we entered into an agreement that will significantly reduce both risk in force and associated risk of losses going forward.Second, U.S. Mortgage Insurance took a solid step forward with new business results. The prudent changes we made to guidelines and geographies where home prices and economic conditions have improved resulted in a nice uptick in market share, which we estimate increased from 9% in the third quarter to 14% at year end. The business we are writing reflects a lower risk profile, with much higher returns, driven by product, pricing and underwriting changes. In addition, we expect more business to shift back to private mortgage insurers from the FHA over time.And third, U.S. Mortgage Insurance ended the year with a risk-to-capital ratio estimated at 14.6:1, a very good position to support growth while maintaining a sound buffer against unforeseen events. This reflects both our differentiated performance and a benefit from changes to federal tax law that expanded the use of tax losses.Finally, turning to the investment portfolio, I'd highlight two areas. First, we made nice progress reinvesting excess cash balances. As of the end of the third quarter, our target was to reinvest $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion by mid 2010 and we reinvested $1.5 billion of that in the fourth quarter and remain on track to complete our reinvestment program by midyear. Next, the actions taken to diversify and reduce risk in the investment portfolio are showing results with both impairments and unrealized losses continuing to trend down. In closing, as we look to 2010, we see a clear path forward, with some pluses and minuses in the environment. In particular, solid new business growth, stronger investment income, continued though staged improvement in global economies and housing markets and the benefits from loss mitigation efforts are all good leading indicators for improved earnings and returns. We remain diligent on a capital and risk management front and continue to benefit from our streamlined organization structure.With the win more at our back from a market perspective, we will keep investing strategically in product, distribution, service and technology areas to drive smart growth and ROE improvement. With that, let me turn it over to Pat. Pat?"

Results in the quarter marked clear progress in executing the plans we shared with you at our December Investor Day and position us well for 2010. Overall, key financial trends and developments have improved and include strengthened economic and housing market conditions in Canada and Australia, good results from loss-mitigation repricing and new product introductions and higher net investment income. Let me start with Retirement and Protection.Here, we are seeing growth in several key areas, investment income and sales growth in life insurance, long-term care and wealth management. On a sequential basis, we had good investment income growth from two areas. First, cash reinvestment, which lifted total earnings by about $11 million after tax, with the majority or about $9 million in the R&B segment. Second, from limited partnership investment income. In Retirement and Protection, this grew earnings by $15 million, with a $2 million gain in the quarter compared with a $13 million loss in the third quarter. Although we are aware of the potential for additional limited partnership investment losses in the first quarter, when year end financial information becomes available, overall, we expect improving cash reinvestment and positive limited partnership investment income results to continue into 2010.In Life Insurance, sales increased 10% sequentially. As Mike indicated, early trends in our submitted volume are encouraging for our new product suite. Individual long-term care sales improved 7% sequentially. We are seeing potential for a rebound in the long-term care market following declines in industry sales earlier in the year. We are particularly encouraged by the positive trend in our independent distribution sales channel. In wealth management, we saw the third straight quarter of positive net flows and a 50% increase in sales year-over-year. Here, we are investing in new capabilities to penetrate new markets and we expect to see earnings growth in 2010 as AUM increases. Adding results up from a statutory perspective, the consolidated risk-based capital ratio decreased moderately from 370% to an estimated 365% during the quarter. Key drivers here were our expected operating results, funding new business growth and a modest level of impairments.Given the growing sales momentum in life and long-term care insurance, we contributed $200 million of capital from the holding company in January, which will further strengthen the life insurance company's statutory capital base as of year-end 2009, increasing the risk based capital ratio to approximately 390%. While our capital plan now provides for a more robust new business growth, we continue to make prudent allowances for potential investment impairments and credit migration and with that in mind, our target for year-end 2010 risk-based capital is to remain at or above 350%.Turning to the international businesses. The Canadian economy and housing markets overall continue to improve with some regional variations. Unemployment declined modestly, from a peak of 8.7% in August, to 8.5% in December. Housing affordability remains solid, with mortgage interest rates ending the year at approximately 4%, down from around 5% at the end of 2008. And home prices in our target markets continue to gradually increase from comparatively low levels a year ago. Most regions have now recouped the declines experienced during the recent downturn. As a result, low delinquency rate in Canada has been stable for the past two quarters at about 34 basis points, down from 36 in the second quarter, reflecting improved economic trends. The loss ratio decreased by two points, marking the second consecutive quarter of improvement. Accordingly, total earnings in Canada remain sound and consistent with third quarter levels.Turning to Australia. You have a similar story to Canada, with the economic and housing markets continuing to recover, again with some regional variation. The economy is generating GDP growth, with nearly 2% growth forecast for the fourth quarter. Unemployment rates declined modestly from the peak earlier this year of 5.8% to 5.5% at year end. Housing affordability deteriorated moderately, reflecting a reduction in the benefits provided under the government first-time home buyer programs, as well as an uptick in mortgage interest rates to approximately 6.3%. I should note that mortgage interest rates remain well below the high of 9.4% experienced in mid-2008. Home prices continue to increase from relatively low levels in fourth quarter 2008 and most areas have recouped the home price declines experienced during the recent downturn.In 2010, we will monitor how these recent favorable trends develop in both Canada and Australia. Given these trends, we are optimistic that earnings in these markets will remain at or above current levels, with some normal quarterly fluctuations. From a sales perspective, low mortgage insurance in Canada has now increased for three sequential quarters reflecting improving economic and housing market conditions. While in Australia, the strong sales we've seen throughout 2009 slowed modestly in the fourth quarter as borrowing rates increased and as government stimulus programs were trimmed as we expected given the economic recovery.Turning to Europe, we saw a second sequential quarter of improvement in Lifestyle Protection earnings, which were hurt by rapidly rising unemployment in the first half of 2009. Two factors have contributed to this improvement trend. First, new claim registrations have slowed in the last six months and have now stabilized, reflecting a decline in the pace of unemployment growth. And second, we recompleted the majority of a planned product repricing and distribution contract restructuring during the quarter. These impacts have outpaced loss pressure from increases in claims durations as the absolute level of unemployment remains high. Our repricing initiatives will continue to benefit earnings in 2010 and if high unemployment persists as expected, will offset further increases in claims duration.Finally, from a capital plan perspective, Canada, Australia and Lifestyle Protection all ended the quarter with sound capital ratios in excess of targeted levels. In Australia, we expanded external reinsurance relationships as part of our capital strategy to continue to provide for growth, additional risk dispersion and capital flexibility. This quarter, we received insurance commitments of 250 million Australian dollars, which really highlights the strength of our Australian business. This coverage was effective on January 1, 2010, and will incrementally pressure premium growth. In sum, our international businesses are well-positioned to support operating and parent holding company capital plans going forward.Briefly turning to the investment portfolio, here we've seen good progress on our cash reinvestment plans, favorable earnings trends and limited partnership investment, declines in net realized losses and we've been able to take advantage of favorable market conditions to derisk the overall portfolio while diversifying credit risk exposure. Looking more closely at realized losses by asset class, about three quarters or 57 million of fourth quarter impairments were in residential mortgage-backed securities and remain concentrated in subprime and Alt-A. Recent trends in these impairments are at a much lower level than earlier in 2009 and are emerging in a more predictable manner. We've seen a significant decrease in impairments for corporate bonds and hybrid securities, which totaled just $10 million in the quarter. Here, we have diversified our holdings, reduced our relative weighting in financials and benefited from market improvement.Our high-quality commercial mortgage loan and commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolios continued to perform very well, with only $7 million of impairments in the quarter. Finally, unrealized losses were $1.4 billion and are down substantially from $4 billion a year ago. The unrealized losses have been drifting down modestly through most of the quarter but increased a bit in December, ending the year at about the same level we had in the third quarter. In January, we've seen unrealized losses trend back down about $200 million in total. Before leaving investments, I'll review the impact of changes in regulatory capital requirements on the commercial mortgage loan and structured asset classes that were adopted at year end.Starting with our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, we were subject to changes in the mortgage experience adjustment factor or MEAF. As Genworth loan portfolio has consistently experienced very low levels of losses relative to industry experience, our risk-based capital requirement is determined by the MEAF minimum. As of year-end 2009, this minimum level was increased. At our target 350% RBC level, this increase required approximately $90 million of funding. We also had the introduction of two new rating firms for structured securities, PIMCO for RMBS and Realpoint for CMBS. Together, incorporating the ratings from these two firms benefited capital by about $85 million at our target 350% RBC level. So collectively, these three regulatory change had almost no impact on required funding at our target 350% RBC level.As we reflect on Genworth's progress over the last few quarters, we are encouraged by the trends we see across our businesses. And as we move through 2010, we will build on this foundation and focus on profitable new business growth. Much of the groundwork for this growth is now in place, with recent product introductions, improved service capabilities and an intense focus on expanding key distribution relationships. Adding it all up, we finished 2009 with two sequential quarters of earnings improvements and we are positioned for growth and ROE improvement going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

I want to share a few perspectives on U.S. Mortgage Insurance business, particularly in the context of our financial results this quarter, which show improvements as we end a challenging 2009. As a reminder, we have been executing and remain focused on a five-point strategy, actually managing through a challenging housing market, continuing our loss-mitigation focus, managing capital on a self-contained basis, growing highly profitable new business while at the same time, participating in the regulatory reform debate that will play out over the next two years.This morning, I'll cover three areas. First, the improving dynamics that we see developing in our books of business. Second, the continued market headwinds that remain a challenge. And finally, how these combined factors influence our focus in 2010. So let's begin where we see improving trends, many of which have been developing for several quarters. I'll group them into five areas, delinquency count, average reserve per delinquency, loss mitigation, risk to capital and new business growth.First, flow  delinquency inventories are increasing at a slower rate, up 7% from Q3 to Q4 versus 14% from Q2 to Q3. This is encouraging as we would've expected a further increase in the rate of growth in delinquency counts from traditional seasonality. Second, a decline in average flow reserve per delinquency, which has trended down for the past three quarters, from a high of $23,100 in the first quarter to $18,900 at year end. This decrease is being driven by two influences. First, a shift in the mix of delinquencies from high loan balance geographies and alternative products to traditional loan product delinquencies with a more national distribution driven by unemployment. This shift drove about half of the decline in average reserve per delinquency this quarter. The other half is from our continuing loss mitigation efforts, which are impacting delinquencies with higher average balances. Third, loss mitigation has a direct benefit, which continues to increase. This quarter, we were encouraged by the number of modifications coming out of the HAMP program, which increased from essentially zero last quarter to $35 million or about 2,000 modified loans for this quarter. In addition, the number of Genworth delinquent loans in the HAMP trial period nearly doubled to 22,200 based on the data from servicers and the GSEs. In our view, this is a good directional indicator of future modification potential and benefits.Fourth, we have experienced improvement in risk-to-capital ratios as a result of specific strategies and other market factors. The ratio was down to 14.6 to 1 in the fourth quarter, down sequentially from 15.1 to 1 and well below the 25 to 1 traditional regulatory limit. This quarter, we benefited specifically from a change in the federal tax law that extended the look-back period for net operating losses. This increased statutory capital by about $108 million. Importantly, we are pleased with the execution of our capital plan in a very challenging 2009. We have successfully delivered on the self-contained plans we have previously communicated and maintained good growth capacity.And finally, we saw growth in new business and increased market share. In the third quarter, we expanded our underwriting guidelines to reflect improved conditions in many markets, which prudently increased our addressable market. As a result, we estimate that our share increased from 9% to approximately 14%. This resulted in a sequential improvement in flow new insurance written of 20%. And we expect market share improvement to continue in 2010 and drive growth in NIW.With that said, the MI industry is not out of the woods. The industry faces several challenges including increases in unemployment and the potential for additional home price declines, particularly as the so-called shadow inventory makes its way through the foreclosure process and adds to the existing supply of available housing inventory. Let's discuss how Genworth is positioned to face these market headwinds, starting with unemployment. Most experts still predict unemployment to peak in early 2010, averaging about 10.2% for the full year. We're planning the recovery of jobs to be gradual, with unemployment in the low 10% range for the rest of 2010 and remaining elevated in 2011 in the 9.5% to 10% range, with some improvement in 2012. We did see rising unemployment pressure delinquencies in the fourth quarter and would expect that to continue in the coming year.During the home crisis, while housing inventory has shown improving trends over the last several months, the current strains on the system are increasing the length of a loss cycle. As a result, there is growing inventory of 90-day plus delinquent in foreclosure and real estate-owned properties. It is widely accepted that some portion of this shadow inventory will ultimately work its way through foreclosure and increase existing housing supply. Industry sources estimate that this inventory maybe as much as 4 million homes, and could pressure home prices depending on the level and timing of when the supply hits the market. Given the potential pressure on housing that this dynamic could cause, Genworth is taking a prudent view of home prices. In our assumptions, we're planning for an additional 5 to 10 points of price decline. Our home price recovery expectations, once prices bottom, are again gradual and conservative in the 2011 and 2012 timeframes. With that as context, I want to share some thoughts on the key metrics we're watching as we position this business for a return to profitability.First, we'll continue to monitor delinquencies. Particularly, the rate of growth, the cure rate and the average reserve per delinquency. Taking into account normal seasonality, which we do expect to see in 2010, which typically drives lower delinquencies in the first half of the year and an uptick in the third and fourth quarters, we would expect delinquency growth to slow and eventually decline as new delinquencies decrease and the cure rate the increases. The cure rate is an important component of delinquency development and to date, has been pressured given the housing market. As an offset to this pressure, we still feel that the recent challenging books of business from 2006 through the first half of 2008 should experience their peak delinquency levels during 2010, allowing a return to more traditional delinquency development patterns.We also expect the declining trend in average reserve per delinquency to continue on a gradual basis, as we have seen encouraging trends in the mix of delinquency growth. Second, we remain focused on loss mitigation. We expect total loss mitigation savings in 2010 to be at or above the level we saw in 2009, with an increasing proportion coming from HAMP and other modification programs. Third, we will continue to have risk to capital levels well within the regulatory requirement, which will support our final objective, to prudently increase new insurance written and market share. In closing, we have taken decisive actions that position Genworth to aggressively manage through a challenging environment. Our approach to loss mitigation will drive additional benefits. We continue to execute a self-contained capital plan and we are growing profitable new books with better price and less volatility. And with that, we'll open it up to your questions."

First two dimensions, and Kevin you can fill in some other perspective. Going back to your general question, I would suggest you think of a pair of bookends when you look at the portfolio in aggregate. As Kevin said, if you look at '04 and prior, you'll feel good about that. You have a lot of embedded appreciation in it, the performance you can see. '05, a little bit of a mixed story, pretty clear negative story we've laid out when you think of the '06, '07 and the first half of '08. Then, you've got the second half of '08, '09  and all the subsequent, and that's a positive bookend that you're adding to that. Because now you have all of the full benefits of the pricing increases, the tighter underwriting, it's all -- the clean nature of traditional business. With that in mind, then you look at that middle, and you're applying the loss mitigation to the very tough vintages. So those will not be as bad as one might have thought once you got in and understood the aspects of non-compliance, in some cases fraud. And of course, we dealt with that quite directly. So that's how you can think of the model and the dynamics going on. But getting back to -- you asked sort of a crossover point, and you need to think about crossover points on two fronts. One is what's going on in sort of a quarterly run rate basis. And as we talked about in Investor Day, we saw sort of a mid-11 crossover point when you're thinking of the quarterly run rate. And then depending on the mix of that, you'll see whether there's a look like in a total-year basis for that business to transition and go positive. And we have not given guidance on that, but you can see the dynamics, I think, quite clearly in this quarter and from Kevin's commentary. And certainly, the dynamics continue the theme that we laid out at Investor Day."

You're going to ultimately pay over time. But as they come down, and as the loss levels come down, it really depends on what the persistency of that book is at that point in time. If your persistency sticks long enough and you can bring in enough to additional earn premium associated with that book, sure there's a potential ultimately for it to be profitable in a given year. But my expectation right now was with the negative cumulative losses associated with those tough books so far is that we should not have high expectations of being profitable.

To your point, it's the size of the overall MI market that's ultimately going to drive where we end up from an NIW standpoint. You have to put those two things together. I would expect as the FHA continues to tighten up and we move through the year, that should expand the size of the private mortgage insurance market.

This is a -- nobody is happy with the level of rescissions in the marketplace today. But Genworth acts in accordance with our rights and obligations under the policy. We pay all legitimate claims. We're not required to pay claims associated with fraud, misrep and non-compliance with our policy. So as I commented by saying, number one, in this industry, the private mortgage insurance industry isn't around to ensure operating risk. We ensure credit risk. And so that's a lot of what we're seeing right now. Things got a little sloppy through this cycle. As it relates to going forward and our opportunity to pick up increased share, this is going to be a flexible year. It's going to be fluid. As this plays out across the industry, there's only so many players. There's a limited number of mortgage insurers available in the space. And so when somebody loses allocation in one place, they're going to pick up some of it at other place. And I think some of that might be reflective in, in some of the progression we saw in that quarter."

So when I think about our overall workout and cure rate or cure progression, we did see some nice trends in the quarter. I think it's just getting started and ramped up. The other thing you'll see is that Treasury is continuing to evolve that program, and they're continuing to work on some of the documentation challenges that we've all read about associated with getting out and improve out the back end of that program. And I think that will ultimately help things going forward. The real issue here is it's too early to call what the cure rates are going to be coming out of this. But what I'm encouraged by is on the loans that we've seen so far that have been modified and come out of them, we've seen an average reduction in payment of 29% on the Genworth loans that have been modified through the program. That's a big number. 25% improvement in your monthly payment is something that gives people the ability, as I've mentioned before, to cash flow and be successful ultimately in staying in their home.

There's some recent reporting out from the OTS and OCC that's talking about modification data today, and they're basically saying that when you have no payment change in the redefault rate or in the modification, it's generally performing at about a 66% redefault rate.

They're trying to focus on bringing in the documentation challenges, as you said, which have been challenging on the backside of the program, give the documentation out. They're trying to bring that to the front of the program. With that successful, when you bring that in, more that come into the program up front will come on at the back end of the program and ultimately cure, which I think will be a big piece. Secondly, I think the FHA's going to participate more aggressively in these programs, and they have before. Whether that has no impact really on Genworth's direct results but ultimately provides broader support to the overall industry in terms of the amount of cures there. I think the interesting thing is whether there's still be a possibility going forward for some additional principle on write-down expansions to HAMP or to all these programs. And I think that's really probably the next shoe to fall in this overall piece. And that doesn't impact us. That could only help us in our current view of it, which is if somebody gets their principal written down, we stay on the coverage. It doesn't cost us for that process to happen. The borrower gets put into a better position, ultimately has more likelihood in staying in our homes. I think those things could all be positive."

And working with the GSEs, we were able to come to a commercial settlement on them that allowed us basically to take down our risk in force associated with those loans and our exposure going forward. So if you think about it, the total RRIF we had associated with those loans was probably about $237 million in that range, and the settlement of $182 million puts that behind us, significantly reduces our GSE Alt-A RRIF. We had very little bit more monkey with candidly. And going forward, that's another thing that's going to benefit, I think, our overall delinquencies in the future because that was $50 million between those two numbers of potential future losses that could have played through into the business. So number one, that's the issue. Secondly, I think it's a validation of our overall rescission practice and approach. Because it was the hard work we have done to look at those loans and look at them early the way we do in our delinquency process, to allow us to properly document and to make sure we're very thorough in our assessment of whether there are opportunities there.

Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with the solid improvement in both sales and earnings results we reported this quarter, and we will remain very focused on continued execution of our strateg",1114,"Thanks, Alicia, and thanks, everyone for your time today. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with the solid improvement in both sales and earnings results we reported this quarter, and we will remain very focused on continued execution of our strategies to keep building on this progress. More specifically, the actions we took in 2009 to manage risk and put cash back to work coupled with improved economic and housing market conditions in most markets and our targeted growth strategies are clearly paying off.Importantly, the fourth quarter trends are a good indicator for improved earnings power and results in 2010 and beyond. Today, I'll focus on a few key highlights in each of our business segments and in the investment portfolio, then Pat and Kevin will provide more detail on market trends and performance in our business segments. Before getting into these areas, I would note that we continue to see improving markets overall, but economic recovery in general will be gradual in most markets and consumers remain stressed. So I would characterize our view as optimistic, tempered by the realism of a choppy recovery and appropriate caution regarding markets that are still trying to find their footing for the possibility of unforeseen events.Starting with Retirement and Protection, our refined specialist strategies centered around Main Street life insurance, long-term care insurance and independent advisor wealth management offerings with a more targeted focus on the annuity front is proceeding well. Basically, we see all consumers and in particular, Main Street consumers, reassessing how they build their personal safety net, what advisers they want to work with going forward, what approaches make the most sense when it comes to investing and how to do all this in a balanced way, with less reliance on self insuring through the equity in their home or gains that they may have in a stock portfolio. At the same time, distributors, producers and advisers are looking for companies who can be their growth partners.These dynamics intersect well with our enhanced focus and capabilities within the Retirement and Protection areas. For example, the launch of our new life insurance product suite has been quite successful, with strong initial trends in overall submitted policies. As a reminder, we introduced our new colony term UL product, which is basically a term life value proposition sold on a Universal Life chassis. Here, we've optimized the pricing and reserve patterns with the UL structure to allow us to be much more capital efficient.On the Universal Life side, we've optimized our pricing to match it with a reasonable actuarial definition of lifetime to deliver a capital-efficient product with a strong value proposition and competitive rate for Main Street consumers. In addition, long-term care sales also showed sequential growth and we see a gradual improvement in that market. Finally, we are pleased with the momentum building in our wealth management business as evidenced by positive net flows and gains in market position versus competitors.Turning to international, I am encouraged on two fronts. First, housing market and economic conditions in Canada and Australia have continued to improve with stabilizing or improving trends across home prices, unemployment and GDP. And in Lifestyle Protection, the swift action we took to reprice business and restructure distribution agreements is showing strong early results. Our repricing efforts are on track with most large contracts completed at year end. And you can see the associated lift as part of our earnings this quarter. In 2010, we are targeting incremental earnings lift of approximately $30 million from these efforts gathering into earnings throughout the year.In Europe, we remain cautious about the recessionary conditions that have persisted in many countries, resulting in higher unemployment and lower levels of consumer lending, and we do not expect quick economic recoveries. So we anticipate continued pressures from some claims durations extending, and lower levels of new business, which would negatively impact revenue in Europe. Now on this last point, we're not standing still and are diligently pursuing the growth strategies outlined at our December Investor Day to generate additional new business at appropriate returns.Finally, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, I would highlight three areas where results in the quarter showed sound progress. First, there are good indications that USMI earnings troughed in 2009 and that we are on a gradual upward trajectory, though we might expect some choppiness quarter to quarter. Extensive loss-mitigation efforts are helping lead this transition along with loss results, which are showing signs of improvement. Importantly, in the bulk business, we entered into an agreement that will significantly reduce both risk in force and associated risk of losses going forward.Second, U.S. Mortgage Insurance took a solid step forward with new business results. The prudent changes we made to guidelines in geographies where home prices and economic conditions have improved resulted in a nice uptick in market share, which we estimate increased from 9% in the third quarter to 14% at year end. The business we are writing reflects a lower risk profile, with much higher returns, driven by product, pricing and underwriting changes. In addition, we expect more business to shift back to private mortgage insurers from the FHA over time.And third, U.S. Mortgage Insurance ended the year with a risk-to-capital ratio estimated at 14.6:1, a very good position to support growth while maintaining a sound buffer against unforeseen events. This reflects both our differentiated performance and a benefit from changes to federal tax law that expanded the use of tax losses.Finally, turning to the investment portfolio, I'd highlight two areas. First, we made nice progress reinvesting excess cash balances. As of the end of the third quarter, our target was to reinvest $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion by mid 2010 and we reinvested $1.5 billion of that in the fourth quarter and remain on track to complete our reinvestment program by midyear. Next, the actions taken to diversify and reduce risk in the investment portfolio are showing results with both impairments and unrealized losses continuing to trend down. In closing, as we look to 2010, we see a clear path forward, with some pluses and minuses in the environment. In particular, solid new business growth, stronger investment income, continued though staged improvement in global economies and housing markets and the benefits from loss mitigation efforts are all good leading indicators for improved earnings and returns. We remain diligent on a capital and risk management front and continue to benefit from our streamlined organization structure.With the wind more at our back from a market perspective, we will keep investing strategically in product, distribution, service and technology areas to drive smart growth and ROE improvement. With that, let me turn it over to Pat. Pat?"

Results in the quarter marked clear progress in executing the plans we shared with you at our December Investor Day and position us well for 2010. Overall, key financial trends and developments have improved and include strengthened economic and housing market conditions in Canada and Australia, good results from loss-mitigation repricing and new product introductions and higher net investment income. Let me start with Retirement and Protection.  Here, we are seeing growth in several key areas; investment income and sales growth in life insurance, long-term care and wealth management. On a sequential basis, we had good investment income growth from two areas. First, cash reinvestment, which lifted total earnings by about $11 million after tax, with the majority or about $9 million in the RMB [residential mortgage-backed] segment. Second, in limited partnership investment income. In Retirement and Protection, this grew earnings by $15 million, with a $2 million gain in the quarter compared with a $13 million loss in the third quarter. Although we are aware of the potential for additional limited partnership investment losses in the first quarter when year end financial information becomes available, overall, we expect improving cash reinvestment and positive limited partnership investment income results to continue into 2010.In Life Insurance, sales increased 10% sequentially. As Mike indicated, early trends in our submitted volume are encouraging for our new product suite. Individual long-term care sales improved 7% sequentially. We are seeing potential for a rebound in the long-term care market following declines in industry sales earlier in the year. We are particularly encouraged by the positive trend in our independent distribution sales channel. In Wealth Management, we saw the third straight quarter of positive net flows and a 50% increase in sales year-over-year. Here, we are investing in new capabilities to penetrate new markets and we expect to see earnings growth in 2010 as AUM increases. Adding results up from a statutory perspective, the consolidated risk-based capital ratio decreased moderately from 370% to an estimated 365% during the quarter. Key drivers here were our expected operating results, funding new business growth and a modest level of impairments.Given the growing sales momentum in life and long-term care insurance, we contributed $200 million of capital from the holding company in January, which will further strengthen the life insurance company's statutory capital base as of year-end 2009, increasing the risk based capital ratio to approximately 390%. While our capital plan now provides for a more robust new business growth, we continue to make prudent allowances for potential investment impairments and credit migration and with that in mind, our target for year-end 2010 risk-based capital is to remain at or above 350%.Turning to the international businesses. The Canadian economy and housing markets overall continue to improve with some regional variations. Unemployment declined modestly, from a peak of 8.7% in August, to 8.5% in December. Housing affordability remains solid, with mortgage interest rates ending the year at approximately 4%, down from around 5% at the end of 2008. And home prices in our target markets continue to gradually increase from comparatively low levels a year ago. Most regions have now recouped the declines experienced during the recent downturn. As a result, low delinquency rate in Canada has been stable for the past two quarters at about 34 basis points, down from 36 in the second quarter, reflecting improved economic trends. The loss ratio decreased by two points, marking the second consecutive quarter of improvement. Accordingly, total earnings in Canada remain sound and consistent with third quarter levels.Turning to Australia. You have a similar story to Canada, with the economic and housing markets continuing to recover, again with some regional variation. The economy is generating GDP growth, with nearly 2% growth forecast for the fourth quarter. Unemployment rates declined modestly from the peak earlier this year of 5.8% to 5.5% at year end. Housing affordability deteriorated moderately, reflecting a reduction in the benefits provided under the government first-time home buyer programs, as well as an uptick in mortgage interest rates to approximately 6.3%. I should note that mortgage interest rates remain well below the high of 9.4% experienced in mid-2008. Home prices continue to increase from relatively low levels in fourth quarter 2008 and most areas have recouped the home price declines experienced during the recent downturn.In 2010, we will monitor how these recent favorable trends develop in both Canada and Australia. Given these trends, we are optimistic that earnings in these markets will remain at or above current levels, with some normal quarterly fluctuations. From a sales perspective, low mortgage insurance in Canada has now increased for three sequential quarters reflecting improving economic and housing market conditions. While in Australia, the strong sales we've seen throughout 2009 slowed modestly in the fourth quarter as borrowing rates increased and as government stimulus programs were trimmed as we expected given the economic recovery.Turning to Europe, we saw a second sequential quarter of improvement in Lifestyle Protection earnings, which were hurt by rapidly rising unemployment in the first half of 2009. Two factors have contributed to this improvement trend. First, new claim registrations have slowed in the last six months and have now stabilized, reflecting a decline in the pace of unemployment growth. And second, we recompleted the majority of a planned product repricing and distribution contract restructuring during the quarter. These impacts have outpaced loss pressure from increases in claims durations as the absolute level of unemployment remains high. Our repricing initiatives will continue to benefit earnings in 2010 and if high unemployment persists as expected, will offset further increases in claims duration.Finally, from a capital plan perspective, Canada, Australia and Lifestyle Protection all ended the quarter with sound capital ratios in excess of targeted levels. In Australia, we expanded external reinsurance relationships as part of our capital strategy to continue to provide for growth, additional risk dispersion and capital flexibility. This quarter, we received insurance commitments of 250 million Australian dollars, which really highlights the strength of our Australian business. This coverage was effective on January 1, 2010, and will incrementally pressure premium growth. In sum, our international businesses are well-positioned to support operating and parent holding company capital plans going forward.Briefly turning to the investment portfolio, here we've seen good progress on our cash reinvestment plans, favorable earnings trends and limited partnership investment, declines in net realized losses and we've been able to take advantage of favorable market conditions to derisk the overall portfolio while diversifying credit risk exposure. Looking more closely at realized losses by asset class, about three quarters or 57 million of fourth quarter impairments were in residential mortgage-backed securities and remain concentrated in subprime and Alt-A. Recent trends in these impairments are at a much lower level than earlier in 2009 and are emerging in a more predictable manner. We've seen a significant decrease in impairments for corporate bonds and hybrid securities, which totaled just $10 million in the quarter. Here, we have diversified our holdings, reduced our relative weighting in financials and benefited from market improvement.Our high-quality commercial mortgage loan and commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolios continued to perform very well, with only $7 million of impairments in the quarter. Finally, unrealized losses were $1.4 billion and are down substantially from $4 billion a year ago. The unrealized losses have been drifting down modestly through most of the quarter but increased a bit in December, ending the year at about the same level we had in the third quarter. In January, we've seen unrealized losses trend back down about $200 million in total. Before leaving investments, I'll review the impact of changes in regulatory capital requirements on the commercial mortgage loan and structured asset classes that were adopted at year end.Starting with our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, we were subject to changes in the mortgage experience adjustment factor or MEAF. As Genworth loan portfolio has consistently experienced very low levels of losses relative to industry experience, our risk-based capital requirement is determined by the MEAF minimum. As of year-end 2009, this minimum level was increased. At our target 350% RBC level, this increase required approximately $90 million of funding. We also had the introduction of two new rating firms for structured securities, PIMCO for RMBS and Realpoint for CMBS. Together, incorporating the ratings from these two firms benefited capital by about $85 million at our target 350% RBC level. So collectively, these three regulatory change had almost no impact on required funding at our target 350% RBC level.As we reflect on Genworth's progress over the last few quarters, we are encouraged by the trends we see across our businesses. And as we move through 2010, we will build on this foundation and focus on profitable new business growth. Much of the groundwork for this growth is now in place, with recent product introductions, improved service capabilities and an intense focus on expanding key distribution relationships. Adding it all up, we finished 2009 with two sequential quarters of earnings improvements and we are positioned for growth and ROE improvement going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

I want to share a few perspectives on U.S. Mortgage Insurance business, particularly in the context of our financial results this quarter, which show improvements as we end a challenging 2009. As a reminder, we have been executing and remain focused on a five-point strategy, actually managing through a challenging housing market, continuing our loss-mitigation focus, managing capital on a self-contained basis, growing highly profitable new business while at the same time, participating in the regulatory reform debate that will play out over the next two years.This morning, I'll cover three areas. First, the improving dynamics that we see developing in our books of business. Second, the continued market headwinds that remain a challenge. And finally, how these combined factors influence our focus in 2010. So let's begin where we see improving trends, many of which have been developing for several quarters. I'll group them into five areas, delinquency count, average reserve per delinquency, loss mitigation, risk to capital and new business growth.First, flow  delinquency inventories are increasing at a slower rate, up 7% from Q3 to Q4 versus 14% from Q2 to Q3. This is encouraging as we would've expected a further increase in the rate of growth in delinquency counts from traditional seasonality. Second, a decline in average flow reserve per delinquency, which has trended down for the past three quarters, from a high of $23,100 in the first quarter to $18,900 at year end. This decrease is being driven by two influences. First, a shift in the mix of delinquencies from high loan balance geographies and alternative products to traditional loan product delinquencies with a more national distribution driven by unemployment. This shift drove about half of the decline in average reserve per delinquency this quarter. The other half is from our continuing loss mitigation efforts, which are impacting delinquencies with higher average balances. Third, loss mitigation has a direct benefit, which continues to increase. This quarter, we were encouraged by the number of modifications coming out of the HAMP program, which increased from essentially zero last quarter to $35 million or about 2,000 modified loans for this quarter. In addition, the number of Genworth delinquent loans in the HAMP trial period nearly doubled to 22,200 based on the data from servicers and the GSEs. In our view, this is a good directional indicator of future modification potential and benefits.Fourth, we have experienced improvement in risk-to-capital ratios as a result of specific strategies and other market factors. The ratio was down to 14.6 to 1 in the fourth quarter, down sequentially from 15.1 to 1 and well below the 25 to 1 traditional regulatory limit. This quarter, we benefited specifically from a change in the federal tax law that extended the look-back period for net operating losses. This increased statutory capital by about $108 million. Importantly, we are pleased with the execution of our capital plan in a very challenging 2009. We have successfully delivered on the self-contained plans we have previously communicated and maintained good growth capacity.And finally, we saw growth in new business and increased market share. In the third quarter, we expanded our underwriting guidelines to reflect improved conditions in many markets, which prudently increased our addressable market. As a result, we estimate that our share increased from 9% to approximately 14%. This resulted in a sequential improvement in flow new insurance written of 20%. And we expect market share improvement to continue in 2010 and drive growth in NIW.With that said, the MI industry is not out of the woods. The industry faces several challenges including increases in unemployment and the potential for additional home price declines, particularly as the so-called shadow inventory makes its way through the foreclosure process and adds to the existing supply of available housing inventory. Let's discuss how Genworth is positioned to face these market headwinds, starting with unemployment. Most experts still predict unemployment to peak in early 2010, averaging about 10.2% for the full year. We're planning the recovery of jobs to be gradual, with unemployment in the low 10% range for the rest of 2010 and remaining elevated in 2011 in the 9.5% to 10% range, with some improvement in 2012. We did see rising unemployment pressure delinquencies in the fourth quarter and would expect that to continue in the coming year.During the home crisis, while housing inventory has shown improving trends over the last several months, the current strains on the system are increasing the length of a loss cycle. As a result, there is growing inventory of 90-day plus delinquent in foreclosure and real estate-owned properties. It is widely accepted that some portion of this shadow inventory will ultimately work its way through foreclosure and increase existing housing supply. Industry sources estimate that this inventory maybe as much as 4 million homes, and could pressure home prices depending on the level and timing of when the supply hits the market. Given the potential pressure on housing that this dynamic could cause, Genworth is taking a prudent view of home prices. In our assumptions, we're planning for an additional 5 to 10 points of price decline. Our home price recovery expectations, once prices bottom, are again gradual and conservative in the 2011 and 2012 timeframes. With that as context, I want to share some thoughts on the key metrics we're watching as we position this business for a return to profitability.First, we'll continue to monitor delinquencies. Particularly, the rate of growth, the cure rate and the average reserve per delinquency. Taking into account normal seasonality, which we do expect to see in 2010, which typically drives lower delinquencies in the first half of the year and an uptick in the third and fourth quarters, we would expect delinquency growth to slow and eventually decline as new delinquencies decrease and the cure rate the increases. The cure rate is an important component of delinquency development and to date, has been pressured given the housing market. As an offset to this pressure, we still feel that the recent challenging books of business from 2006 through the first half of 2008 should experience their peak delinquency levels during 2010, allowing a return to more traditional delinquency development patterns.We also expect the declining trend in average reserve per delinquency to continue on a gradual basis, as we have seen encouraging trends in the mix of delinquency growth. Second, we remain focused on loss mitigation. We expect total loss mitigation savings in 2010 to be at or above the level we saw in 2009, with an increasing proportion coming from HAMP and other modification programs. Third, we will continue to have risk to capital levels well within the regulatory requirement, which will support our final objective, to prudently increase new insurance written and market share. In closing, we have taken decisive actions that position Genworth to aggressively manage through a challenging environment. Our approach to loss mitigation will drive additional benefits. We continue to execute a self-contained capital plan and we are growing profitable new books with better price and less volatility. And with that, we'll open it up to your questions."

Going back to your general question, I would suggest you think of a pair of bookends when you look at the portfolio in aggregate. As Kevin said, if you look at '04 and prior, you'll feel good about that. You have a lot of embedded appreciation in it, the performance you can see. '05, a little bit of a mixed story, pretty clear negative story we've laid out when you think of the '06, '07 and the first half of '08. Then, you've got the second half of '08, '09  and all the subsequent, and that's a positive bookend that you're adding to that. Because now you have all of the full benefits of the pricing increases, the tighter underwriting, it's all -- the clean nature of traditional business. With that in mind, then you look at that middle, and you're applying the loss mitigation to the very tough vintages. So those will not be as bad as one might have thought once you got in and understood the aspects of non-compliance, in some cases fraud. And of course, we dealt with that quite directly. So that's how you can think of the model and the dynamics going on. But getting back to -- you asked sort of a crossover point, and you need to think about crossover points on two fronts. One is what's going on in sort of a quarterly run rate basis. And as we talked about in Investor Day, we saw sort of a mid-11 crossover point when you're thinking of the quarterly run rate. And then depending on the mix of that, you'll see whether there's a look like in a total-year basis for that business to transition and go positive. And we have not given guidance on that, but you can see the dynamics, I think, quite clearly in this quarter and from Kevin's commentary. And certainly, the dynamics continue the theme that we laid out at Investor Day."

If your persistency sticks long enough and you can bring in enough to additional earn premium associated with that book, sure there's a potential ultimately for it to be profitable in a given year. But my expectation right now with the negative cumulative losses associated with those tough books so far, is that we should not have high expectations of being profitable. And again, to Mike's point, as we said at Investor Day, we see that crossover point for us in terms of overall profitability on a quarterly basis, about mid-2011."

So with six players, we see ourselves, we came out of the fourth quarter with an average, we think, of about 14%. I think we got some more upward runway associated with that, as it relates. Market share to me, though, is not really the biggest thing we're going to be looking at right now. To your point, it's the size of the overall MI market that's ultimately going to drive where we end up from an NIW standpoint. You have to put those two things together. I would expect as the FHA continues to tighten up and we move through the year, that should expand the size of the private mortgage insurance market. And I think given our capital position and the way manage it so that we can take advantage of this on the upside of this recovery, we're really well positioned to see some additional market share associated with that."

And that's going to go away and there's a lawsuit.

Secondly, our ongoing disputes, or ongoing disagreements over the approach the entire industry is taking as it relates to the industry's contractual rights and obligations, sure there is. This is a -- nobody is happy with the level of rescissions in the marketplace today. But Genworth acts in accordance with our rights and obligations under the policy. We pay all legitimate claims. We're not required to pay claims associated with fraud, misrep and non-compliance with our policy. So as I come at it by saying, number one, in this industry, the private mortgage insurance industry isn't around to ensure operating risk. We ensure credit risk. And so that's a lot of what we're seeing right now. Things got a little sloppy through this cycle. As it relates to going forward and our opportunity to pick up increased share, this is going to be a flexible year. It's going to be fluid. As this plays out across the industry, there's only so many players. There's a limited number of mortgage insurers available in the space. And so when somebody loses allocation in one place, they're going to pick up some of it at other place. And I think some of that might be reflective in some of the progression we saw in that quarter."

So when I think about our overall workout and cure rate or cure progression, we did see some nice trends in the quarter. I think it's just getting started and ramped up. The other thing you'll see is that Treasury is continuing to evolve that program, and they're continuing to work on some of the documentation challenges that we've all read about associated with getting out and improve out the back end of that program. And I think that will ultimately help things going forward. The real issue here is it's too early to call what the cure rates are going to be coming out of this. But what I'm encouraged by is on the loans that we've seen so far that have been modified and come out of them, we've seen an average reduction in payment of 29% on the Genworth loans that have been modified through the program. That's a big number. 25% improvement in your monthly payment is something that gives people the ability, as I've mentioned before, to cash flow and be successful ultimately in staying in their home.

But to further dive down into what I was just sharing with Andrew, if you look back to 2008 and the modifications we did in 2008, those modifications had a redefault rate of about 55%. We'll start that with a baseline understanding. Those were largely not modifications that lowered the borrower's monthly payment. There's some recent reporting out from the OTS and OCC that's talking about modification data today, and they're basically saying that when you have no payment change in the redefault rate or in the modification, it's generally performing at about a 66% redefault rate. So our numbers were still better than that on '08. With the 10%-20% payment reduction, the redefault rate goes down to 48%. And then what I was just talking about it, with a 20-plus percent payment redefault rate, their data says that, that can go down as low as 39%.

They're trying to focus on bringing in the documentation challenges, as you said, which have been challenging on the backside of the program, give the documentation out. They're trying to bring that to the front of the program. With that successful, when you bring that in, more that come into the program up front will come on at the back end of the program and ultimately cure, which I think will be a big piece. Secondly, I think the FHA's going to participate more aggressively in these programs, and they have before. Whether that has no impact really on Genworth's direct results but ultimately provides broader support to the overall industry in terms of the amount of cures there. I think the interesting thing is whether there's still be a possibility going forward for some additional principle on write-down expansions to HAMP or to all these programs. And I think that's really probably the next shoe to fall in this overall piece. And that doesn't impact us. That could only help us in our current view of it, which is if somebody gets their principal written down, we stay on the coverage. It doesn't cost us for that process to happen. The borrower gets put into a better position, ultimately has more likelihood in staying in our homes. I think those things could all be positive."

And working with the GSEs, we were able to come to a commercial settlement on them that allowed us basically to take down our risk in force associated with those loans and our exposure going forward. So if you think about it, the total RRIF we had associated with those loans was probably about $237 million in that range, and the settlement of $182 million puts that behind us, significantly reduces our GSE Alt-A RRIF. We had very little bit more monkey with candidly. And going forward, that's another thing that's going to benefit, I think, our overall delinquencies in the future because that was $50 million between those two numbers of potential future losses that could have played through into the business. So number one, that's the issue. Secondly, I think it's a validation of our overall rescission practice and approach. Because it was the hard work we have done to look at those loans and look at them early the way we do in our delinquency process, to allow us to properly document and to make sure we're very thorough in our assessment of whether there are opportunities there. That allowed us to get to a good decision with the group."

We took another important step forward in the first quarter, executing our strategy and delivering improved financial results. I was especially pleased with the progress we made across five areas: First, building new business growth momentum in several lines and launching additional new products; second, improving investment results, which included substantial cash reinvestment and ongoing risk reduction and diversification; third, transitioning U.S. mortgage insurance towards profitability, with substantial progress in the quarter supported by broad-based market efforts regarding loan modifications, plus other loss mitigation efforts. Specifically, I'm encouraged about the prospects for U.S. Mortgage Insurance where we are seeing continued favorable trends in new delinquencies, cure rates and our new business share position Fourth, optimizing Genworth's capital structure. We made good progress in the quarter with optimization strategies continuing as we move through the remainder of 2010 and the next two years; and fifth, delivering solid performances across our Australian and Canadian Mortgage Insurance platforms, where overall market conditions continue to improve nicely.
Stepping back, I've said to many of you that we are coming out of this economic downturn more focused than ever, with stronger business models. Indeed, we are. And you saw that in a number of areas in the quarter. But we still have some work to do, and I would highlight three areas where we remain actively focused. 
First, European markets remain in various stages of recovery. And some parts, like the Nordic region, are now experiencing the impact from unemployment that was seen earlier in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe. This continues to pressure our Lifestyle Protection business on two fronts, claim durations and new business levels, the latter, because of reduced levels of consumer borrowing.
I spent some time in Europe during the first quarter, and was very pleased with the benefits we are seeing from actively repricing products and restructuring distribution relationships to enhance profitability across areas like profit and loss sharing as well as commissions.
We are also focused on selling our Lifestyle Protection products in new ways. For example, rather than primarily selling Lifestyle Protection at the time of a new lending transaction, we are broadening programs with our distributors to market Lifestyle Protection to their clients with various types of outstanding financial obligations using appropriate coverage types. In addition, we are broadening distribution channels to support Lifestyle Protection sales with a larger dedicated team to do so."

In some, Lifestyle Protection's recovery is coming along, but their profile will remain choppy as we move toward a stronger recovery in Europe.
Second, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, I am very pleased with the trends and losses, loan modification and gains in market share. However, 
We would like to write more new business in aggregate. We have strong capacity for additional growth because of our risk profile and disciplined capital planning. But we have encountered a much smaller market than anticipated, with the large role currently being played by the FHA. So we are taking steps to increase sound new business. During the quarter, for example, you saw us add markets where we will cover up to 95% LTV business for high FICO borrowers for loans to come to us through retail channels, which have strong underwriting. We do feel the market is slowly starting to shift back towards private mortgage insurers and will continue to do so, as the FHA reassess its standards and reprices for risk management purposes.
In addition, there was a clear opportunity for GSEs to review loan level pricing that has steered new business to the FHA. Both these opportunities are accelerated by the fact that the industry, using various strategies, has improved its capital strength and capacity. This helps policymakers feel confident about private mortgage insurers taking on an expanded role in the housing finance system.
Finally, we will continue to focus on improving profitability and further accelerating sales growth in the life and long-term care lines. Along these lines, we were very pleased with the market acceptance of our new term-life value proposition product called Colony Term UL and the new UL offering. Both of which incorporate more capital-efficient designs.
Also long-term care sales have rebounded nicely in our independent channels. We did see some underwriting and other fluctuations in the quarter that should naturally balance out, and Pat will touch upon these.
As we look ahead, I view our performance and strategic transitions as being right on track. We are intensely focused on executing the transitions in our business segment and enterprise-level returns on equity that we laid out at our December Investor Day, along with continued improvements in earnings  and new business sales.
We also remain very engaged on the public policy and regulatory fronts in the U.S. and around the world, given the dynamic environment where multiple aspects surrounding financial services are being assessed and debated. With that, let me turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at the quarter. Pat?"

We made good progress in the first quarter executing our plans to grow earnings and enhance returns. We remain focused on efficiently managing capital and demonstrated that in several key areas this quarter. 
This morning, I'll focus on three areas. First, business and earnings growth; second, investment results and finally, our capital management activity.
Let me start with Retirement and Protection. Here, we are seeing sales growth in several key areas, setting the stage for future revenue and earnings expansion. In life insurance, our new and more capital-efficient products continue to gain traction. The combined term and Colony Term UL production premiums of $24 million for the current quarter is up over 25% from prior year, and is also up 9% from fourth quarter of 2009. This is well above our expectations. 
We're also pleased with the initial acceptance of our new GenGuard UL product, where sales nearly doubled sequentially and were almost 90% of submitted UL policies in the first quarter. Overall, Universal Life sales are down, primarily reflecting lower excess deposits in the current interest rate environment. In addition, we have intensified our focus on increasing average base amount per policy, targeting policies in the $500,000 to $1 million range. Overall, we are encouraged by first quarter life insurance sales results. 
Long-term care sales improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We are seeing improvement in long-term care sales following declines in industry sales in early 2009. First quarter individual LTC sales were $31 million, up almost 30% from prior year. Group and linked benefit sales, combined, are at an all-time high of $19 million for the quarter. 
We are pleased with the group sales momentum, including the recent addition of employees from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Given the nature of group enrollment, we'd expect quarterly sales levels to be a bit uneven. 
Over in wealth management, we saw a fourth straight quarter of positive net flows and an 85% increase in sales year-over-year. Assets under management are just shy of pre-global financial crisis levels. Here, we are investing in capabilities to penetrate new markets and are seeing the earnings growth we would expect as our assets under management increase.  We're pleased with the progress adding new advisers, due in part to the differentiated service we provide to them. 
From an earnings perspective, first quarter Retirement and Protection results improved significantly year-over-year. Wealth management and retirement income earnings benefited from a combination of improving market and cash reinvestment, while life insurance and long-term care were relatively flat year-over-year.
Looking at results sequentially, earnings growth was muted by a few factors. While we saw expected levels of earnings accretion from cash reinvestment, this was offset by expected real estate limited partnership losses. We also had some pressure from less favorable life mortality and lower persistency as certain term policies reached the end of their level term periods.
In long-term care, all blocked claims increased and we saw the usual seasonal increases in Medicare supplement claims. However, across Retirement and Protection, mortality, morbidity and persistency experience were all within a normal range of statistical variation. 
Looking at the International businesses. The Canadian economy and housing markets, overall, continued to improve. Unemployment declined modestly from 8.4% in December to 8.2% in March. Housing affordability remains solid, with mortgage interest rates ending the quarter at approximately 4.4%, up about 50 basis points from year end.
Home prices in our target markets remain stable, up 3% from year end. Most regions have now recouped the declines experienced during the recent downturn. 
Flow sales in Canada were up more than 40% versus the prior year, primarily from growth in the mortgage origination market. On a sequential-quarter basis, flows sales were down a bit, reflecting normal weather-related seasonality in home buying. Flow delinquency rate in Canada has remained stable now for the past three quarters at about 34 basis points, down from 36% in the second quarter and reflecting improved economic trends. The loss ratio decreased by one point to 38%, marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement.
As we look at loss performance across book years in Canada, our 2006 book has passed its peak delinquency period, while the 2007 book is showing signs of peaking. The delinquency rate for the large 2007 book has been in a relatively narrow range for the last three quarters, which leads us to conclude that it may have peaked and should decline in the second half of 2010.
Turning to Australia. We have a similar story to Canada with economy and home prices continuing to recover. Unemployment rates declined modestly from 5.5% at year end to 5.3% at quarter end. National home prices have stabilized following an increase of approximately 5% on average in 2009, with most areas having recouped the home price declines experienced during the recent downturn.
Following strong sales in 2009 that were driven by the combination of lower mortgage interest rates and government stimulus programs, we saw a decline in flow new insurance written, as we expected, as the government stimulus was reduced in late 2009 and as interest rates increased. We are pleased that the total delinquency rates improved and loss ratios have continued to improve. 
We had expected some modest uptick in the loss ratio as we move through the year, primarily for two reasons. First, we added AUD $250 million of external reinsurance coverage as part of our capital plan, which reduced premiums by $6 million. Second, while the national unemployment rates has improved, we are still seeing underemployment, as well as pockets of high unemployment in certain regions of Australia. This can lead to variation in quarterly loss performance.
In sum, we view performance in Canada and Australia as solid, and would expect earnings to trend gradually up from current levels. 
Now turning to Europe, we had a choppy quarter in our Lifestyle Protection business, following strong 
Results in the fourth quarter that had some additional lift from tax and loss mitigation benefits. Three factors contributed to the choppiness.
First, loss performance in Southern and Western Europe has improved, as new claim registrations slowed in the last nine months reflecting a decline in the pace of unemployment growth. In addition, repricing and restructuring distribution relationships completed to date in these areas contributed to the improved performance.
Second in the Nordic region, losses increased generally reflecting unemployment pressure, which have been running below levels seen in the rest of Europe. And as we look more closely at losses in the quarter, we've identified a concentrated source of these additional losses, and we are currently taking steps to address the situation much as we did in Western and Southern Europe during the past year. 
Third, we're seeing the impact of lower consumer lending and Lifestyle Protection sales across Europe, and this is pressuring revenue growth. As outlined earlier, we are taking steps to improve sales as the new initiatives take hold. 
In sum, we continue to take decisive actions to improve earnings in Lifestyle Protection, addressing the economic challenges in Europe. As we execute our plans and as of these European economies recover, you should expect overall earnings improvement with some choppiness reflecting this transition.
Now looking at U.S. Mortgage Insurance business. 
Here, we are seeing clear earnings improvement, primarily from lower losses and continued loss mitigation benefits. In the Flow business, we saw improved loss trends from normal seasonal declines in new delinquencies and from increases in cures from the various modification programs and continued loss mitigation benefits.
In addition, I am pleased to report that delinquencies from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books and early 2010. Flow delinquencies decreased to about 102,000 from about 107,000. We saw the return of normal seasonal patterns with the sequential delinquency decline of 5%, slightly ahead of the 4% we've seen historically in the first quarter. This was the result of a decline in new delinquencies as well as higher cures. 
Modification programs such as HAMP have been effective, particularly at curing earlier stage delinquent loans. Flow average reserve per delinquency increased a bit this quarter, given higher-than-expected loan modification activity on the early stage delinquencies.
While we continue to see a shift to a more national distribution of delinquencies across traditional loan product and this shift in continues to put downward pressure on the reserves, in this quarter, that impact was more than offset by the mix of delinquent loans being more weighted to late-stage delinquencies since the modifications are curing more of the early-stage delinquent loans.
I should note that although we saw significant loss mitigation benefits during the quarter, rescission activity was in line with our expectations, and we did not make further adjustments this quarter to our reserve factors for cures due to rescission activity. In addition, we have not yet factored in the potential impact of increases in modifications including HAMP.
In the Bulk business, losses declined to $4 million, down from $36 million in the fourth quarter. This decline was expected due to the January settlement previously announced, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 10,000 delinquent loans and reduced total bulk RIF to $523 million in the first quarter.
Finally, I would also note that we still have a shadow inventory to work through in the marketplace, which will dampen home price recoveries. In addition, as we think about the remainder of 2010, we expect normal loss trend seasonality to continue.
I'm briefly turning to the investment portfolio. The actions we have taken to reinvest cash and derisk the portfolio are having the desired impact on investment income, as well as on impairment. We will continue these actions and further diversify the portfolio. We will broaden our exposure to corporate bond sectors like utilities and industrials and in private placements, taking advantage of areas where credit spreads remain attractive.
Cash reinvestment strategies since the third quarter of 2009 contributed $18 million to investment income in the quarter. We reinvested $1.1 billion of excess cash and are marketing good progress toward our goal of deploying $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of excess cash by midyear. Most of this impacted the Retirement and Protection segment. I should also note that since these funds were deployed throughout the quarter, we do expect some incremental lift to investment income into the second quarter.
However, first quarter reported real estate limited partnership performance was weak, which was expected, and offset the quarterly impact of cash reinvestment. Total LTE losses were $22 million after-tax, $8 million in the Retirement and Protection segment and $14 million in Corporate and Other.
      
As we have seen in the past, limited partnership investment losses experienced a catch up in the first quarter, when the 2009 year-end financial information became available. Now looking ahead, we would expect the run rate on after-tax investment income to be about $24 million higher than first quarter levels, both from the cumulative benefit of cash reinvested to date and from stabilized limited partnership valuations.
The final point that I would make regarding the investment portfolio is that we have limited exposure to European sovereign credit. For example, we hold just $3 million of sovereign debt in Greece and another $2 million in Portugal.
Before closing, I'd like to comment briefly on capital. The Retirement and Protection segment capital is right on its plan, and consolidated risk-based capital for the U.S. life insurance companies ended the quarter at approximately 385%.
Regulatory capital ratios in Canada, Australia and Lifestyle Protection increased sequentially and remains in excess of targeted levels. 
In Canada, our majority-owned subsidiary announced a new plan to optimize its capital structure with two components: First, adding debt to the capital structure as current market conditions are favorable with an initial debt-to-capital target in the 10% range. Second, subsequent to the debt deal, returning up to CAD $350 million to its shareholders in the current year. As a majority shareholder, Genworth will receive a significant portion of those proceeds. 
In Australia, we increased our external reinsurance program by AUD $250 million in the quarter, which provides additional capital flexibility and diversification of exposures to high-quality reinsurance counterparties. 
In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, consolidated risk-to-capital ratio remains strong at 14.9:1, as losses moderated reflecting improved market conditions and loss mitigation benefit. 
In sum, our operating businesses are well-positioned to support operating and parent-holding capital plans going forward.
To wrap, this quarter marks solid progress executing plans for growth in earnings and in setting the stage for ongoing improvement in return on equity. We remain focused on four levers to reach these targets: profitable new business growth, optimizing investment performance, ongoing risk management, including loss mitigation and finally, effective capital management.
All in, first quarter results marked progress towards the 2012 return on equity targets announced in December. With that, I'll open it up to your questions."

First of all, going a little deeper on what are the trends we've seen. You saw things like the factors from unemployment pressure sort of move from west the east, and then from east to north. So you've seen some staging of that overall. Specifically, maybe one way to help you think about this is sort of what's the run rate of the business and you had a strong fourth quarter there, as far as improvement, direction, as you pointed out that way. There were some one timers in there that were about, aggregated about $7 million, including some tax favorability. So then you'd say, well, help me get from sort of where we are about a $12 million to a run rate and you'd have sort of one positive influence and you had two negatives and the negatives will see some shifts in and the positive has been repricing. We've done extensive repricing for risk purposes and as I mentioned, that's moved through most of our major relationships and that will remain a positive. On the negative side, volume has been slow because consumer lending has been slow and as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, that's something that we're working on very actively on multiple fronts. And then we did have one block of business where by the nature of the design, we saw some adverse selection. And one thing that, as we drilled into that, identified that certainly used various levers including certainly a price change lever to deal with that, which will improve that performance as that's monthly premium product and you can reprice that immediately and get a lift. So you put all of those sort of the positive and the negative factors together, and that gives you about a $3 million to $4 million benefit on your run rate there off of the $12 million you saw on the first quarter, and that's the way to think about the recovery profile of the business as you look at 2010. Now as we move into 2011, we expect further improvement because you're seeing hitting that peak of claims. That impact specifically on employment, product, and to a lesser extent, the accident and sickness product. Any of the benefit or all of the price increases and we expect a number of our growth initiatives will more fully kick in as that unfolds through the rest of 2010, and you have more of a full year 2011 impact. So I would expect that improvement to continue as we move on into 2011."

And some of those reinsurance contracts are sufficiently risk remote that they are accounted for on a deposit-accounting basis. So when interest expense rises, it also means you're seeing increases in investment income as the margins come through as the difference between the two. So if you see interest expense rise in that business that's generally a good sign, we're seeing more profitability or more business coming through on the contracts that do not qualify for risk transfer. From a loss perspective, I'll go back to last year and look at the situation that we had in Ireland and Spain and the repricing that we did starting in the second quarter. From my perspective, I'm very pleased with the results and in fact, by the first quarter, as opposed to repricing and given the situation in Ireland would return to underwriting margins to positive for Ireland. So the approach that we're taking is certainly producing good results, and I believe it will also produce good results, similar results in the Nordics. When you look at the loss ratios by themselves, it's hard to just look at that and draw a conclusion because the different contracts that we have had different degrees of profit sharing. So we generally look at it in terms of how well we're doing from an underwriting perspective, which will include the cost of profit sharing. And when that's factored in, even though the losses appear stable, they were higher in some areas and lower in other areas and when you factor in the cost of profit sharing what flowed through was the claims in the Nordic that Mike describe.

One is, it does contribute to optimizing your capital structure. We think there's a lot of growth, attractive growth still to go, though the market will slow this year, given the pullback of stimulus and the rise of rates. But there are still good growth opportunity in the market as there's a lot of housing demand. And in fact, some of the construction is trying to catch up to the demand. 
And frankly, it's just a discipline from a risk standpoint having a diversified reinsurance base and remember reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a global basis is relatively new. So when you think longer term, it's attractive to develop a whole set of reinsurers, introduce them to a market in various layers and forms. So that as you look out over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, you have much more of a reinsurance participation in managing both risk and capital for our various platforms. So this is just the first one that I think people can quite clearly get their arms around, but I'd expect that to broaden out in other platforms over time.

So why are you so confident that this is not the cycle that sort of changes historical patterns that we've observed and I'll have a separate question."

I mean, first of all, the observations that we've shared are not theoretical in nature. We spend an awful lot of time on the ground in Washington at a very granular level, so we're not just dreamy in perspectives up. These are reflecting a mosaic of discussions, so that will be observation number one. Observation number two is when something works, you usually try to do more of it and Private Mortgage Insurance industry worked. I mean, if you look at the reserving methodology, you look at the claims paying ability, it is first dollar loss coverage, it did exactly what it was suppose to absorb an enormous amount of losses and that perspective is not loss on policymakers. So more of the dialogue is shifting to capacity is we want you back in, we don't want to take all of this risk, demonstrate the capacity and because that's a timing consideration of adding private and public capacity to the housing financial system, so it doesn't constrain the capital that needs to come and support a housing, continued stabilization and recovery. So as I noted and Kevin noted, it's been quite positive to see all of the strategies that have been pursued in the industry to bring that capacity. But there is an education step to remind all of the policymaker of how much that capacity adds up to, and therefore, if the government program step back, that indeed, you're coming into that and that's a very active education process. Finally, going back to your specific point, I do think that we'd learn things through cycles, both companies as well as folks on the governmental side learned things. And there can be some neat opportunities to look at of hybrids, of having the private industry upfront and having the government more in a public-private partnership, providing additional reinsurance capacity in the back. It's a little different then, but has some very clear analogies to Canada, but it doesn't replace a private industry. It lets it do what it does best. Beyond the frontlines, do the second underwrite, support mortgage lending to make sure that there's enough capacity through up and down cycles and that's the way you need to think about it."

We took another important step forward in the first quarter, executing our strategy and delivering improved financial results. I was especially pleased with the progress we made across five areas: First, building new business growth momentum in several lines and launching additional new products; second, improving investment results, which included substantial cash reinvestment and ongoing risk reduction and diversification; third, transitioning U.S. mortgage insurance towards profitability, with substantial progress in the quarter supported by broad-based market efforts regarding loan modifications, plus other loss mitigation efforts. Specifically, I'm encouraged about the prospects for U.S. Mortgage Insurance where we are seeing continued favorable trends in new delinquencies, cure rates and our new business share position Fourth, optimizing Genworth's capital structure. We made good progress in the quarter with optimization strategies continuing as we move through the remainder of 2010 and the next two years; and fifth, delivering solid performances across our Australian and Canadian Mortgage Insurance platforms, where overall market conditions continue to improve nicely.
Stepping back, I've said to many of you that we are coming out of this economic downturn more focused than ever, with stronger business models. Indeed, we are. And you saw that in a number of areas in the quarter. But we still have some work to do, and I would highlight three areas where we remain actively focused. 
First, European markets remain in various stages of recovery. And some parts, like the Nordic region, are now experiencing the impact from unemployment that was seen earlier in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe. This continues to pressure our Lifestyle Protection business on two fronts, claim durations and new business levels, the latter, because of reduced levels of consumer borrowing.
I spent some time in Europe during the first quarter, and was very pleased with the benefits we are seeing from actively repricing products and restructuring distribution relationships to enhance profitability across areas like profit and loss sharing as well as commissions.
We are also focused on selling our Lifestyle Protection products in new ways. For example, rather than primarily selling Lifestyle Protection at the time of a new lending transaction, we are broadening programs with our distributors to market Lifestyle Protection to their clients with various types of outstanding financial obligations using appropriate coverage types. In addition, we are broadening distribution channels to support Lifestyle Protection sales with a larger dedicated team to do so.

In some, Lifestyle Protection's recovery is coming along, but their profile will remain choppy as we move toward a stronger recovery in Europe.
Second, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, I am very pleased with the trends and losses, loan modification and gains in market share. However, 
We would like to write more new business in aggregate. We have strong capacity for additional growth because of our risk profile and disciplined capital planning. But we have encountered a much smaller market than anticipated, with the large role currently being played by the FHA. So we are taking steps to increase sound new business. During the quarter, for example, you saw us add markets where we will cover up to 95% LTV business for high FICO borrowers for loans to come to us through retail channels, which have strong underwriting. We do feel the market is slowly starting to shift back towards private mortgage insurers and will continue to do so, as the FHA reassess its standards and reprices for risk management purposes.
In addition, there was a clear opportunity for GSEs to review loan level pricing that has steered new business to the FHA. Both these opportunities are accelerated by the fact that the industry, using various strategies, has improved its capital strength and capacity. This helps policymakers feel confident about private mortgage insurers taking on an expanded role in the housing finance system.
Finally, we will continue to focus on improving profitability and further accelerating sales growth in the life and long-term care lines. Along these lines, we were very pleased with the market acceptance of our new term-life value proposition product called Colony Term UL and the new UL offering. Both of which incorporate more capital-efficient designs.
Also long-term care sales have rebounded nicely in our independent channels. We did see some underwriting and other fluctuations in the quarter that should naturally balance out, and Pat will touch upon these.
As we look ahead, I view our performance and strategic transitions as being right on track. We are intensely focused on executing the transitions in our business segment and enterprise-level returns on equity that we laid out at our December Investor Day, along with continued improvements in earnings  and new business sales.
We also remain very engaged on the public policy and regulatory fronts in the U.S. and around the world, given the dynamic environment where multiple aspects surrounding financial services are being assessed and debated. With that, let me turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at the quarter. Pat?

We made good progress in the first quarter executing our plans to grow earnings and enhance returns. We remain focused on efficiently managing capital and demonstrated that in several key areas this quarter. 
This morning, I'll focus on three areas. First, business and earnings growth; second, investment results and finally, our capital management activity.
Let me start with Retirement and Protection. Here, we are seeing sales growth in several key areas, setting the stage for future revenue and earnings expansion. In life insurance, our new and more capital-efficient products continue to gain traction. The combined term and Colony Term UL production premiums of $24 million for the current quarter is up over 25% from prior year, and is also up 9% from fourth quarter of 2009. This is well above our expectations. 
We're also pleased with the initial acceptance of our new GenGuard UL product, where sales nearly doubled sequentially and were almost 90% of submitted UL policies in the first quarter. Overall, Universal Life sales are down, primarily reflecting lower excess deposits in the current interest rate environment. In addition, we have intensified our focus on increasing average base amount per policy, targeting policies in the $500,000 to $1 million range. Overall, we are encouraged by first quarter life insurance sales results. 
Long-term care sales improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We are seeing improvement in long-term care sales following declines in industry sales in early 2009. First quarter individual LTC sales were $31 million, up almost 30% from prior year. Group and linked benefit sales, combined, are at an all-time high of $19 million for the quarter. 
We are pleased with the group sales momentum, including the recent addition of employees from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Given the nature of group enrollment, we'd expect quarterly sales levels to be a bit uneven. 
Over in wealth management, we saw a fourth straight quarter of positive net flows and an 85% increase in sales year-over-year. Assets under management are just shy of pre-global financial crisis levels. Here, we are investing in capabilities to penetrate new markets and are seeing the earnings growth we would expect as our assets under management increase.  We're pleased with the progress adding new advisers, due in part to the differentiated service we provide to them. 
From an earnings perspective, first quarter Retirement and Protection results improved significantly year-over-year. Wealth management and retirement income earnings benefited from a combination of improving market and cash reinvestment, while life insurance and long-term care were relatively flat year-over-year.
Looking at results sequentially, earnings growth was muted by a few factors. While we saw expected levels of earnings accretion from cash reinvestment, this was offset by expected real estate limited partnership losses. We also had some pressure from less favorable life mortality and lower persistency as certain term policies reached the end of their level term periods.
In long-term care, all blocked claims increased and we saw the usual seasonal increases in Medicare supplement claims. However, across Retirement and Protection, mortality, morbidity and persistency experience were all within a normal range of statistical variation. 
Looking at the International businesses. The Canadian economy and housing markets, overall, continued to improve. Unemployment declined modestly from 8.4% in December to 8.2% in March. Housing affordability remains solid, with mortgage interest rates ending the quarter at approximately 4.4%, up about 50 basis points from year end.
Home prices in our target markets remain stable, up 3% from year end. Most regions have now recouped the declines experienced during the recent downturn. 
Flow sales in Canada were up more than 40% versus the prior year, primarily from growth in the mortgage origination market. On a sequential-quarter basis, flows sales were down a bit, reflecting normal weather-related seasonality in home buying. Flow delinquency rate in Canada has remained stable now for the past three quarters at about 34 basis points, down from 36% in the second quarter and reflecting improved economic trends. The loss ratio decreased by one point to 38%, marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement.
As we look at loss performance across book years in Canada, our 2006 book has passed its peak delinquency period, while the 2007 book is showing signs of peaking. The delinquency rate for the large 2007 book has been in a relatively narrow range for the last three quarters, which leads us to conclude that it may have peaked and should decline in the second half of 2010.
Turning to Australia. We have a similar story to Canada with economy and home prices continuing to recover. Unemployment rates declined modestly from 5.5% at year end to 5.3% at quarter end. National home prices have stabilized following an increase of approximately 5% on average in 2009, with most areas having recouped the home price declines experienced during the recent downturn.
Following strong sales in 2009 that were driven by the combination of lower mortgage interest rates and government stimulus programs, we saw a decline in flow new insurance written, as we expected, as the government stimulus was reduced in late 2009 and as interest rates increased. We are pleased that the total delinquency rates improved and loss ratios have continued to improve. 
We had expected some modest uptick in the loss ratio as we move through the year, primarily for two reasons. First, we added AUD $250 million of external reinsurance coverage as part of our capital plan, which reduced premiums by $6 million. Second, while the national unemployment rates has improved, we are still seeing underemployment, as well as pockets of high unemployment in certain regions of Australia. This can lead to variation in quarterly loss performance.
In sum, we view performance in Canada and Australia as solid, and would expect earnings to trend gradually up from current levels. 
Now turning to Europe, we had a choppy quarter in our Lifestyle Protection business, following strong 
Results in the fourth quarter that had some additional lift from tax and loss mitigation benefits. Three factors contributed to the choppiness.
First, loss performance in Southern and Western Europe has improved, as new claim registrations slowed in the last nine months reflecting a decline in the pace of unemployment growth. In addition, repricing and restructuring distribution relationships completed to date in these areas contributed to the improved performance.
Second in the Nordic region, losses increased generally reflecting unemployment pressure, which have been running below levels seen in the rest of Europe. And as we look more closely at losses in the quarter, we've identified a concentrated source of these additional losses, and we are currently taking steps to address the situation much as we did in Western and Southern Europe during the past year. 
Third, we're seeing the impact of lower consumer lending and Lifestyle Protection sales across Europe, and this is pressuring revenue growth. As outlined earlier, we are taking steps to improve sales as the new initiatives take hold. 
In sum, we continue to take decisive actions to improve earnings in Lifestyle Protection, addressing the economic challenges in Europe. As we execute our plans and as of these European economies recover, you should expect overall earnings improvement with some choppiness reflecting this transition.
Now looking at U.S. Mortgage Insurance business. 
Here, we are seeing clear earnings improvement, primarily from lower losses and continued loss mitigation benefits. In the Flow business, we saw improved loss trends from normal seasonal declines in new delinquencies and from increases in cures from the various modification programs and continued loss mitigation benefits.
In addition, I am pleased to report that delinquencies from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books and early 2010. Flow delinquencies decreased to about 102,000 from about 107,000. We saw the return of normal seasonal patterns with the sequential delinquency decline of 5%, slightly ahead of the 4% we've seen historically in the first quarter. This was the result of a decline in new delinquencies as well as higher cures. 
Modification programs such as HAMP have been effective, particularly at curing earlier stage delinquent loans. Flow average reserve per delinquency increased a bit this quarter, given higher-than-expected loan modification activity on the early stage delinquencies.
While we continue to see a shift to a more national distribution of delinquencies across traditional loan product and this shift in continues to put downward pressure on the reserves, in this quarter, that impact was more than offset by the mix of delinquent loans being more weighted to late-stage delinquencies since the modifications are curing more of the early-stage delinquent loans.
I should note that although we saw significant loss mitigation benefits during the quarter, rescission activity was in line with our expectations, and we did not make further adjustments this quarter to our reserve factors for cures due to rescission activity. In addition, we have not yet factored in the potential impact of increases in modifications including HAMP.
In the Bulk business, losses declined to $4 million, down from $36 million in the fourth quarter. This decline was expected due to the January settlement previously announced, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 10,000 delinquent loans and reduced total bulk RIF to $523 million in the first quarter.
Finally, I would also note that we still have a shadow inventory to work through in the marketplace, which will dampen home price recoveries. In addition, as we think about the remainder of 2010, we expect normal loss trend seasonality to continue.
I'm briefly turning to the investment portfolio. The actions we have taken to reinvest cash and derisk the portfolio are having the desired impact on investment income, as well as on impairment. We will continue these actions and further diversify the portfolio. We will broaden our exposure to corporate bond sectors like utilities and industrials and in private placements, taking advantage of areas where credit spreads remain attractive.
Cash reinvestment strategies since the third quarter of 2009 contributed $18 million to investment income in the quarter. We reinvested $1.1 billion of excess cash and are marketing good progress toward our goal of deploying $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of excess cash by midyear. Most of this impacted the Retirement and Protection segment. I should also note that since these funds were deployed throughout the quarter, we do expect some incremental lift to investment income into the second quarter.
However, first quarter reported real estate limited partnership performance was weak, which was expected, and offset the quarterly impact of cash reinvestment. Total LTE losses were $22 million after-tax, $8 million in the Retirement and Protection segment and $14 million in Corporate and Other.
      
As we have seen in the past, limited partnership investment losses experienced a catch up in the first quarter, when the 2009 year-end financial information became available. Now looking ahead, we would expect the run rate on after-tax investment income to be about $24 million higher than first quarter levels, both from the cumulative benefit of cash reinvested to date and from stabilized limited partnership valuations.
The final point that I would make regarding the investment portfolio is that we have limited exposure to European sovereign credit. For example, we hold just $3 million of sovereign debt in Greece and another $2 million in Portugal.
Before closing, I'd like to comment briefly on capital. The Retirement and Protection segment capital is right on its plan, and consolidated risk-based capital for the U.S. life insurance companies ended the quarter at approximately 385%.
Regulatory capital ratios in Canada, Australia and Lifestyle Protection increased sequentially and remains in excess of targeted levels. 
In Canada, our majority-owned subsidiary announced a new plan to optimize its capital structure with two components: First, adding debt to the capital structure as current market conditions are favorable with an initial debt-to-capital target in the 10% range. Second, subsequent to the debt deal, returning up to CAD $350 million to its shareholders in the current year. As a majority shareholder, Genworth will receive a significant portion of those proceeds. 
In Australia, we increased our external reinsurance program by AUD $250 million in the quarter, which provides additional capital flexibility and diversification of exposures to high-quality reinsurance counterparties. 
In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, consolidated risk-to-capital ratio remains strong at 14.9:1, as losses moderated reflecting improved market conditions and loss mitigation benefit. 
In sum, our operating businesses are well-positioned to support operating and parent-holding capital plans going forward.
To wrap, this quarter marks solid progress executing plans for growth in earnings and in setting the stage for ongoing improvement in return on equity. We remain focused on four levers to reach these targets: profitable new business growth, optimizing investment performance, ongoing risk management, including loss mitigation and finally, effective capital management.
All in, first quarter results marked progress towards the 2012 return on equity targets announced in December. With that, I'll open it up to your questions.

So when y",649,"I think the way we need to start thinking about this is what's going on with the overall insured market. When I say the insured market, we should think about it in terms of the private mortgage insurance market plus the government or FHA market. So when you think about the market drivers that have impacted that market -- first of all, let's start at the top level. The originations have been down a little bit, so our overall business levels at the pricing that we talked about so many times and higher returns have been affected by the smaller originations market. As we come through this cycle and the economy further strengthens, I would expect that to further recover. So that's the top line level of the market change. Then you think about what's happened with between the FHA and the private mortgage insurance sector. And it's really been something that's been part of this normal cycle. When we go through a cycle like this, the FHA steps in, as private capital has to be husband more to take care of the losses that we see in the marketplace. So what we've seen is the FHA has had more expansive the guidelines. The government raised their loan limits back in late 2007, I believe. The GSEs increased their pricing, which has driven more business away from the conventional market towards the FHA. The GSEs have had expensive repurchase activity with their lenders. I think that has further driven lenders to choose an FHA execution. And frankly, we adjusted our guidelines as an industry. And in particular, some of the -- from a declining market standpoint where we saw serious price declines back to the early stages of the cycle. Now to your point, transitioning and going forward, the private mortgage insurance industry has significant more capacity. On the last week or so has reinforced that further with some of the capital raises across the sector. Our industry has begun to expand guidelines and do market expansions. We did do that at Genworth. As you reported back in the fall, we had two moves back in the fall. We also announced at the end of March, an additional move that was referenced in some of the preliminary comments. That will bring business back to us -- the FHA is very focused right now on increasing their pricing to manage their risk exposure, as well as some of their own capital challenges. The first round of that has already been implemented in early April where they increased their upfront pricing. The second level of that is going through Congress right now and requires statutory approval, where their plan right now and their design is to increase their annual rate. When those two things happen, as an industry, just FHA to Private Mortgage Insurance will be very competitive with FHA. I would then ultimately expect, as the government begins to transition to an exit strategy away from being the only liquidity in this sector, that you will see gradual returns to the previous loan limit, possibly for the FHA, again driving more business back into the conventional market. And then lastly, the GSEs I believe have been a big influence on what -- as I mentioned earlier in terms of the business going to the FHA, also as mentioned earlier on in our call, the capital improvement in the industry really sets up on opportunity for them to reassess their pricing so they can participate in some of this improved credit quality business available. So I think those are the big pivot points that we're going to see as we go forward. And this is exactly what happens in this industry when you go through this cycle. You can look back on it historically, and that's what we've seen in the past.  It's operating the way it is currently constructed.

First of all, going a little deeper on what are the trends we've seen. You saw things like the factors from unemployment pressure sort of move from west the east, and then from east to north. So you've seen some staging of that overall. Specifically, maybe one way to help you think about this is sort of what's the run rate of the business and you had a strong fourth quarter there, as far as improvement, direction, as you pointed out that way. There were some one timers in there that were about, aggregated about $7 million, including some tax favorability. So then you'd say, well, help me get from sort of where we are about a $12 million to a run rate and you'd have sort of one positive influence and you had two negatives and the negatives will see some shifts in and the positive has been repricing. We've done extensive repricing for risk purposes and as I mentioned, that's moved through most of our major relationships and that will remain a positive. On the negative side, volume has been slow because consumer lending has been slow and as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, that's something that we're working on very actively on multiple fronts. And then we did have one block of business where by the nature of the design, we saw some adverse selection. And one thing that, as we drilled into that, identified that certainly used various levers including certainly a price change lever to deal with that, which will improve that performance as that's monthly premium product and you can reprice that immediately and get a lift. So you put all of those sort of the positive and the negative factors together, and that gives you about a $3 million to $4 million benefit on your run rate there off of the $12 million you saw on the first quarter, and that's the way to think about the recovery profile of the business as you look at 2010. Now as we move into 2011, we expect further improvement because you're seeing hitting that peak of claims. That impact specifically on employment, product, and to a lesser extent, the accident and sickness product. Any of the benefit or all of the price increases and we expect a number of our growth initiatives will more fully kick in as that unfolds through the rest of 2010, and you have more of a full year 2011 impact. So I would expect that improvement to continue as we move on into 2011.

And some of those reinsurance contracts are sufficiently risk remote that they are accounted for on a deposit-accounting basis. So when interest expense rises, it also means you're seeing increases in investment income as the margins come through as the difference between the two. So if you see interest expense rise in that business that's generally a good sign, we're seeing more profitability or more business coming through on the contracts that do not qualify for risk transfer. From a loss perspective, I'll go back to last year and look at the situation that we had in Ireland and Spain and the repricing that we did starting in the second quarter. From my perspective, I'm very pleased with the results and in fact, by the first quarter, as opposed to repricing and given the situation in Ireland would return to underwriting margins to positive for Ireland. So the approach that we're taking is certainly producing good results, and I believe it will also produce good results, similar results in the Nordics. When you look at the loss ratios by themselves, it's hard to just look at that and draw a conclusion because the different contracts that we have had different degrees of profit sharing. So we generally look at it in terms of how well we're doing from an underwriting perspective, which will include the cost of profit sharing. And when that's factored in, even though the losses appear stable, they were higher in some areas and lower in other areas and when you factor in the cost of profit sharing what flowed through was the claims in the Nordic that Mike describe. Is that some [ph] of your question?

One is, it does contribute to optimizing your capital structure. We think there's a lot of growth, attractive growth still to go, though the market will slow this year, given the pullback of stimulus and the rise of rates. But there are still good growth opportunity in the market as there's a lot of housing demand. And in fact, some of the construction is trying to catch up to the demand. 
And frankly, it's just a discipline from a risk standpoint having a diversified reinsurance base and remember reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a global basis is relatively new. So when you think longer term, it's attractive to develop a whole set of reinsurers, introduce them to a market in various layers and forms. So that as you look out over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, you have much more of a reinsurance participation in managing both risk and capital for our various platforms. So this is just the first one that I think people can quite clearly get their arms around, but I'd expect that to broaden out in other platforms over time. And I think we'll be a leader in helping that happen given our global experience.

Basically, what's happening is, this is what I alluded to a bit earlier, they've had the ability to raise there upfront pricing, which they've done. They need statutory approval to raise their annual fee, which is what this bill is designed to accomplish, so that they can both adequately price for the risk and support their own challenged capital levels right now. So the way I see this is this will make us very competitive with the FHA. One sees -- if this gets passed and ultimately implemented, it's still going to go through and get Senate support. So we're going to get Senate support, but I think what it really does is it reinforces the price point that we're at in the marketplace today. The FHA is acknowledging essentially that they're underpriced for the risk and once they drive and get this annual fee introduced, again, we'll be largely competitive. The biggest driver between the business though, continues -- the additional driver of why they've gotten more business continues to be the GSEs' pricing. And again, as alluded to earlier, now that capital is more visible and there's capacity in this industry beyond our own to support these writings, we think there's opportunities for both of these to really move in the right direction. The GSE backed down a little bit. The FHA, as you described heading up and will get back to a more sufficient market size to take advantage of the share levels and the relationships that we have today.

Based on -- when you think about traditional modifications, and traditional modifications did not lower borrowers' payments, traditional modification, and in fact, sometimes they increase their payments because they took arrearages and threw into the size of the mortgage and then maybe extended the amortization. So traditional modifications based on our experience have redefaulted at a rate of 55% to 60%. What we're seeing now is these HAMP modifications, and importantly, we haven't really talked about it, but importantly, growth of some additional alternative modification programs, new programs that basically are operating very much like HAMP, also driving the same type of borrower, average monthly payment reductions and really designed to get the borrower to be able to cash flow the loans. We're seeing those have a lower redefault experience, and I know it's really early right now. But I would say, that a borrower really reads right now in the 20% to 25% range at longer-term expectations are, that could trend up to 30% to 40% type range. But at this point in time, we just need to see the experience. Once we see it, once we observe it, will drive to that point.

There very engaged and focused on the additional price increases that they need to get to, and I just think at the end of the day, there is a need to have private capital in the system. And the only capital in the system -- from a taxpayers perspective, have it be public capital is not a good outcome for the country. Our model, in fact, has worked through this cycle. It's worked exactly as it was designed to work, and I think ultimately, policymakers are beginning to understand that. So that's the nature of the confidence there. I do think longer term, one of the other things that this cycle may provide for us is an opportunity to think about a longer public-private type of solution to the mortgage insurance in this industry, and we've begun to have some of those discussions in Washington as well.

I mean, first of all, the observations that we've shared are not theoretical in nature. We spend an awful lot of time on the ground in Washington at a very granular level, so we're not just dreamy in perspectives up. These are reflecting a mosaic of discussions, so that will be observation number one. Observation number two is when something works, you usually try to do more of it and Private Mortgage Insurance industry worked. I mean, if you look at the reserving methodology, you look at the claims paying ability, it is first dollar loss coverage, it did exactly what it was suppose to absorb an enormous amount of losses and that perspective is not loss on policymakers. So more of the dialogue is shifting to capacity is we want you back in, we don't want to take all of this risk, demonstrate the capacity and because that's a timing consideration of adding private and public capacity to the housing financial system, so it doesn't constrain the capital that needs to come and support a housing, continued stabilization and recovery. So as I noted and Kevin noted, it's been quite positive to see all of the strategies that have been pursued in the industry to bring that capacity. But there is an education step to remind all of the policymaker of how much that capacity adds up to, and therefore, if the government program step back, that indeed, you're coming into that and that's a very active education process. Finally, going back to your specific point, I do think that we'd learn things through cycles, both companies as well as folks on the governmental side learned things. And there can be some neat opportunities to look at of hybrids, of having the private industry upfront and having the government more in a public-private partnership, providing additional reinsurance capacity in the back. It's a little different then, but has some very clear analogies to Canada, but it doesn't replace a private industry. It lets it do what it does best. Beyond the frontlines, do the second underwrite, support mortgage lending to make sure that there's enough capacity through up and down cycles and that's the way you need to think about it.

I think when you start heading too far beyond that, you're doing things -- it drives you to bad practices. So I think that's directionally where you should expect this. And just to recall, that low point last year was in part a conscious decision while we manage through the execution of our capital plans, as well as to gain better transparency into really what was the stability of the housing market. So once we got more comfortable with that, as the capital plan is in place behind us with all the markets being approved that has allowed us to expand up to the levels we've seen today. Secondly, as it relates to HAMP, and as I mentioned earlier, other modification programs, they're emerging. Again, I can't give you a good handle on the number. I'll tell you, as we said back in December at our Investor Day, ultimately this year, we expect our overall loss mitigation benefits to be sort of consistent with the range we had last year. Increasingly, we're seeing more and more of that come from loan modifications, as we get more of the investigation and rescission activity behind us.  So I continue to be cautiously optimistic about the opportunities for modifications going forward. And, the government continues to lean in and provide new and changes to the type of modification programs that are available, that are really designed to get at people that the initial HAMP programs didn't touch.

We took another important step forward in the first quarter, executing our strategy and delivering improved financial results. I was especially pleased with the progress we made across five areas:",845,"Thanks, Alicia, and thanks, everyone, for your time today. We took another important step forward in the first quarter, executing our strategy and delivering improved financial results. I was especially pleased with the progress we made across five areas: First, building new business growth momentum in several lines and launching additional new products; second, improving investment results, which included substantial cash reinvestment and ongoing risk reduction and diversification; third, transitioning U.S. mortgage insurance towards profitability, with substantial progress in the quarter supported by broad-based market efforts regarding loan modifications, plus other loss mitigation efforts. Specifically, I'm encouraged about the prospects for U.S. Mortgage Insurance where we are seeing continued favorable trends in new delinquencies, cure rates and our new business share position; fourth, optimizing Genworth's capital structure, we made good progress in the quarter with optimization strategies continuing as we move through the remainder of 2010 and the next two years; and fifth, delivering solid performances across our Australian and Canadian Mortgage Insurance platforms, where overall market conditions continue to improve nicely.
Stepping back, I've said to many of you that we are coming out of this economic downturn more focused than ever, with stronger business models. Indeed, we are. And you saw that in a number of areas in the quarter. But we still have some work to do, and I would highlight three areas where we remain actively focused. 
First, European markets remain in various stages of recovery. And some parts, like the Nordic region, are now experiencing the impact from unemployment that was seen earlier in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe. This continues to pressure our Lifestyle Protection business on two fronts, claim durations and new business levels, the latter, because of reduced levels of consumer borrowing.
I spent some time in Europe during the first quarter, and was very pleased with the benefits we are seeing from actively repricing products and restructuring distribution relationships to enhance profitability across areas like profit and loss sharing as well as commissions.
We are also focused on selling our Lifestyle Protection products in new ways. For example, rather than primarily selling Lifestyle Protection at the time of a new lending transaction, we are broadening programs with our distributors to market Lifestyle Protection to their clients with various types of outstanding financial obligations using appropriate coverage types. In addition, we are broadening distribution channels to support Lifestyle Protection sales with a larger dedicated team to do so.
Importantly, distressed economic environment reinforces our value proposition and provides new opportunities to grow the business. In some, Lifestyle Protection's recovery is coming along, but their profile will remain choppy as we move toward a stronger recovery in Europe.
Second, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, I am very pleased with the trends and losses, loan modification and gains in market share. However, 
We would like to write more new business in aggregate. We have strong capacity for additional growth because of our risk profile and disciplined capital planning. But we have encountered a much smaller market than anticipated, with the large role currently being played by the FHA. So we are taking steps to increase sound new business. During the quarter, for example, you saw us add markets where we will cover up to 95% LTV business for high-FICO borrowers, where loans to come to us through retail channels, which have strong underwriting. We do feel the market is slowly starting to shift back towards private mortgage insurers and will continue to do so, as the FHA reassesses its standards and reprices for risk management purposes.
In addition, there was a clear opportunity for GSEs to review loan level pricing that has steered new business to the FHA. Both these opportunities are accelerated by the fact that the industry, using various strategies, has improved its capital strength and capacity. This helps policymakers feel confident about private mortgage insurers taking on an expanded role in the housing finance system.
Finally, we will continue to focus on improving profitability and further accelerating sales growth in the life and long-term care lines. Along these lines, we were very pleased with the market acceptance of our new term life value proposition product called Colony Term UL and the new UL offering. Both of which incorporate more capital-efficient designs.
Also, long-term care sales have rebounded nicely in our independent channels. We did see some underwriting and other fluctuations in the quarter that should naturally balance out, and Pat will touch upon these.
As we look ahead, I view our performance and strategic transitions as being right on track. We are intensely focused on executing the transitions in our business segment and enterprise-level returns on equity that we laid out at our December Investor Day, along with continued improvements in earnings  and new business sales.
We also remain very engaged on the public policy and regulatory fronts in the U.S. and around the world, given the dynamic environment where multiple aspects surrounding financial services are being assessed and debated. With that, let me turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at the quarter. Pat?"

We made good progress in the first quarter executing our plans to grow earnings and enhance returns. We remain focused on efficiently managing capital and demonstrated that in several key areas this quarter. 
This morning, I'll focus on three areas: First, business and earnings growth; second, investment results; and finally, our capital management activity.
Let me start with Retirement and Protection. Here, we are seeing sales growth in several key areas, setting the stage for future revenue and earnings expansion. In life insurance, our new and more capital-efficient products continue to gain traction. The combined term and Colony Term UL production premiums of $24 million for the current quarter is up over 25% from prior year, and is also up 9% from fourth quarter of 2009. This is well above our expectations. 
We are also pleased with the initial acceptance of our new GenGuard UL product, where sales nearly doubled sequentially and were almost 90% of submitted UL policies in the first quarter. Overall, Universal Life sales are down, primarily reflecting lower excess deposits in the current interest rate environment. In addition, we have intensified our focus on increasing average base amount per policy, targeting policies in the $500,000 to $1 million range. Overall, we are encouraged by first quarter life insurance sales results. 
Long-term care sales improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We are seeing improvement in long-term care sales following declines in industry sales in early 2009. First quarter individual LTC sales were $31 million, up almost 30% from prior year. Group and linked benefit sales, combined, are at an all-time high of $19 million for the quarter. 
We are pleased with the group sales momentum, including the recent addition of employees from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Given the nature of group enrollment, we'd expect quarterly sales levels to be a bit uneven. 
Over in wealth management, we saw our fourth straight quarter of positive net flows and an 85% increase in sales year-over-year. Assets under management are just shy of pre-global financial crisis levels. Here, we are investing in capabilities to penetrate new markets and are seeing the earnings growth we would expect as our assets under management increase.  We're pleased with the progress adding new advisers, due in part to the differentiated service we provide to them. 
From an earnings perspective, first quarter Retirement and Protection results improved significantly year-over-year. Wealth management and retirement income earnings benefited from a combination of improving market and cash reinvestment, while life insurance and long-term care were relatively flat year-over-year.
Looking at results sequentially, earnings growth was muted by a few factors. While we saw expected levels of earnings accretion from cash reinvestment, this was offset by expected real estate limited partnership losses. We also had some pressure from less favorable life mortality and lower persistency as certain term policies reached the end of their level term periods.
In long-term care, all blocked claims increased and we saw the usual seasonal increases in Medicare supplement claims. However, across Retirement and Protection, mortality, morbidity and persistency experience were all within a normal range of statistical variation. 
Looking at the International businesses. The Canadian economy and housing markets, overall, continued to improve. Unemployment declined modestly from 8.4% in December to 8.2% in March. Housing affordability remains solid, with mortgage interest rates ending the quarter at approximately 4.4%, up about 50 basis points from year end.
Home prices in our target markets remain stable, up 3% from year end. Most regions have now recouped the declines experienced during the recent downturn. 
Flow sales in Canada were up more than 40% versus the prior year, primarily from growth in the mortgage origination market. On a sequential-quarter basis, flows sales were down a bit, reflecting normal weather-related seasonality in home buying. Flow delinquency rate in Canada has remained stable now for the past three quarters at about 34 basis points, down from 36% in the second quarter and reflecting improved economic trends. The loss ratio decreased by one point to 38%, marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement.
As we look at loss performance across book years in Canada, our 2006 book has passed its peak delinquency period, while the 2007 book is showing signs of peaking. The delinquency rate for the large 2007 book has been in a relatively narrow range for the last three quarters, which leads us to conclude that it may have peaked and should decline in the second half of 2010.
Turning to Australia. We have a similar story to Canada with economy and home prices continuing to recover. Unemployment rates declined modestly from 5.5% at year end to 5.3% at quarter end. National home prices have stabilized following an increase of approximately 5% on average in 2009, with most areas having recouped the home price declines experienced during the recent downturn.
Following strong sales in 2009 that were driven by the combination of lower mortgage interest rates and government stimulus programs, we saw a decline in flow new insurance written, as we expected, as the government stimulus was reduced in late 2009 and as interest rates increased. We are pleased that the total delinquency rates improved and loss ratios have continued to improve. 
We had expected some modest uptick in the loss ratio as we move through the year, primarily for two reasons. First, we added AUD $250 million of external reinsurance coverage as part of our capital plan, which reduced premiums by $6 million. Second, while the national unemployment rates has improved, we are still seeing underemployment, as well as pockets of high unemployment in certain regions of Australia. This can lead to variation in quarterly loss performance.
In sum, we view performance in Canada and Australia as solid, and would expect earnings to trend gradually up from current levels. 
Now turning to Europe, we had a choppy quarter in our Lifestyle Protection business, following strong 
Results in the fourth quarter that had some additional lift from tax and loss mitigation benefits. Three factors contributed to the choppiness.
First, loss performance in Southern and Western Europe has improved, as new claim registrations slowed in the last nine months reflecting a decline in the pace of unemployment growth. In addition, repricing and restructuring distribution relationships completed to date in these areas contributed to the improved performance.
Second in the Nordic region, losses increased generally reflecting unemployment pressure, which have been running below levels seen in the rest of Europe. And as we look more closely at losses in the quarter, we've identified a concentrated source of these additional losses, and we are currently taking steps to address the situation much as we did in Western and Southern Europe during the past year. 
Third, we're seeing the impact of lower consumer lending and Lifestyle Protection sales across Europe, and this is pressuring revenue growth. As outlined earlier, we are taking steps to improve sales as the new initiatives take hold. 
In sum, we continue to take decisive actions to improve earnings in Lifestyle Protection, addressing the economic challenges in Europe. As we execute our plans and as of these European economies recover, you should expect overall earnings improvement with some choppiness reflecting this transition.
Now looking at U.S. Mortgage Insurance business. 
Here, we are seeing clear earnings improvement, primarily from lower losses and continued loss mitigation benefits. In the Flow business, we saw improved loss trends from normal seasonal declines in new delinquencies and from increases in cures from the various modification programs and continued loss mitigation benefits.
In addition, I am pleased to report that delinquencies from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books and early 2010. Flow delinquencies decreased to about 102,000 from about 107,000. We saw the return of normal seasonal patterns with the sequential delinquency decline of 5%, slightly ahead of the 4% we've seen historically in the first quarter. This was the result of a decline in new delinquencies as well as higher cures. 
Modification programs such as HAMP have been effective, particularly at curing earlier stage delinquent loans. Flow average reserve per delinquency increased a bit this quarter, given higher-than-expected loan modification activity on the early stage delinquencies.
While we continue to see a shift to a more national distribution of delinquencies across traditional loan product and this shift in continues to put downward pressure on the reserves, in this quarter, that impact was more than offset by the mix of delinquent loans being more weighted to late-stage delinquencies since the modifications are curing more of the early-stage delinquent loans.
I should note that although we saw significant loss mitigation benefits during the quarter, rescission activity was in line with our expectations, and we did not make further adjustments this quarter to our reserve factors for cures due to rescission activity. In addition, we have not yet factored in the potential impact of increases in modifications including HAMP.
In the Bulk business, losses declined to $4 million, down from $36 million in the fourth quarter. This decline was expected due to the January settlement previously announced, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 10,000 delinquent loans and reduced total bulk RIF to $523 million in the first quarter.
Finally, I would also note that we still have a shadow inventory to work through in the marketplace, which will dampen home price recoveries. In addition, as we think about the remainder of 2010, we expect normal loss trend seasonality to continue.
I'm briefly turning to the investment portfolio. The actions we have taken to reinvest cash and derisk the portfolio are having the desired impact on investment income, as well as on impairment. We will continue these actions and further diversify the portfolio. We will broaden our exposure to corporate bond sectors like utilities and industrials and in private placements, taking advantage of areas where credit spreads remain attractive.
Cash reinvestment strategies since the third quarter of 2009 contributed $18 million to investment income in the quarter. We reinvested $1.1 billion of excess cash and are marketing good progress toward our goal of deploying $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of excess cash by midyear. Most of this impacted the Retirement and Protection segment. I should also note that since these funds were deployed throughout the quarter, we do expect some incremental lift to investment income into the second quarter.
However, first quarter reported real estate limited partnership performance was weak, which was expected, and offset the quarterly impact of cash reinvestment. Total LTE losses were $22 million after-tax, $8 million in the Retirement and Protection segment and $14 million in Corporate and Other.
      
As we have seen in the past, limited partnership investment losses experienced a catch up in the first quarter, when the 2009 year-end financial information became available. Now looking ahead, we would expect the run rate on after-tax investment income to be about $24 million higher than first quarter levels, both from the cumulative benefit of cash reinvested to date and from stabilized limited partnership valuations.
The final point that I would make regarding the investment portfolio is that we have limited exposure to European sovereign credit. For example, we hold just $3 million of sovereign debt in Greece and another $2 million in Portugal.
Before closing, I'd like to comment briefly on capital. The Retirement and Protection segment capital is right on its plan, and consolidated risk-based capital for the U.S. life insurance companies ended the quarter at approximately 385%.
Regulatory capital ratios in Canada, Australia and Lifestyle Protection increased sequentially and remains in excess of targeted levels. 
In Canada, our majority-owned subsidiary announced a new plan to optimize its capital structure with two components: First, adding debt to the capital structure as current market conditions are favorable with an initial debt-to-capital target in the 10% range. Second, subsequent to the debt deal, returning up to CAD $350 million to its shareholders in the current year. As a majority shareholder, Genworth will receive a significant portion of those proceeds. 
In Australia, we increased our external reinsurance program by AUD $250 million in the quarter, which provides additional capital flexibility and diversification of exposures to high-quality reinsurance counterparties. 
In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, consolidated risk-to-capital ratio remains strong at 14.9:1, as losses moderated reflecting improved market conditions and loss mitigation benefit. 
In sum, our operating businesses are well-positioned to support operating and parent-holding capital plans going forward.
To wrap, this quarter marks solid progress executing plans for growth in earnings and in setting the stage for ongoing improvement in return on equity. We remain focused on four levers to reach these targets: profitable new business growth, optimizing investment performance, ongoing risk management, including loss mitigation and finally, effective capital management.
All in, first quarter results marked progress towards the 2012 return on equity targets announced in December. With that, I'll open it up to your questions."

First of all, going a little deeper on what are the trends we've seen. You saw things like the factors from unemployment pressure sort of move from west the east, and then from east to north. So you've seen some staging of that overall. Specifically, maybe one way to help you think about this is sort of what's the run rate of the business and you had a strong fourth quarter there, as far as improvement, direction, as you pointed out that way. There were some one timers in there that were about, aggregated about $7 million, including some tax favorability. So then you'd say, well, help me get from sort of where we are about a $12 million to a run rate and you'd have sort of one positive influence and you had two negatives and the negatives will see some shifts in and the positive has been repricing. We've done extensive repricing for risk purposes and as I mentioned, that's moved through most of our major relationships and that will remain a positive. On the negative side, volume has been slow because consumer lending has been slow and as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, that's something that we're working on very actively on multiple fronts. And then we did have one block of business where by the nature of the design, we saw some adverse selection. And one thing that, as we drilled into that, identified that certainly used various levers including certainly a price change lever to deal with that, which will improve that performance as that's monthly premium product and you can reprice that immediately and get a lift. So you put all of those sort of the positive and the negative factors together, and that gives you about a $3 million to $4 million benefit on your run rate there off of the $12 million you saw on the first quarter, and that's the way to think about the recovery profile of the business as you look at 2010. Now as we move into 2011, we expect further improvement because you're seeing hitting that peak of claims. That impact specifically on employment, product, and to a lesser extent, the accident and sickness product. Any of the benefit or all of the price increases and we expect a number of our growth initiatives will more fully kick in as that unfolds through the rest of 2010, and you have more of a full year 2011 impact. So I would expect that improvement to continue as we move on into 2011."

And some of those reinsurance contracts are sufficiently risk remote that they are accounted for on a deposit-accounting basis. So when interest expense rises, it also means you're seeing increases in investment income as the margins come through as the difference between the two. So if you see interest expense rise in that business that's generally a good sign, we're seeing more profitability or more business coming through on the contracts that do not qualify for risk transfer. From a loss perspective, I'll go back to last year and look at the situation that we had in Ireland and Spain and the repricing that we did starting in the second quarter. From my perspective, I'm very pleased with the results and in fact, by the first quarter, as opposed to repricing and given the situation in Ireland would return to underwriting margins to positive for Ireland. So the approach that we're taking is certainly producing good results, and I believe it will also produce good results, similar results in the Nordics. When you look at the loss ratios by themselves, it's hard to just look at that and draw a conclusion because the different contracts that we have had different degrees of profit sharing. So we generally look at it in terms of how well we're doing from an underwriting perspective, which will include the cost of profit sharing. And when that's factored in, even though the losses appear stable, they were higher in some areas and lower in other areas and when you factor in the cost of profit sharing what flowed through was the claims in the Nordic that Mike describe.

One is, it does contribute to optimizing your capital structure. We think there's a lot of growth, attractive growth still to go, though the market will slow this year, given the pullback of stimulus and the rise of rates. But there are still good growth opportunity in the market as there's a lot of housing demand. And in fact, some of the construction is trying to catch up to the demand. 
And frankly, it's just a discipline from a risk standpoint having a diversified reinsurance base and remember reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a global basis is relatively new. So when you think longer term, it's attractive to develop a whole set of reinsurers, introduce them to a market in various layers and forms. So that as you look out over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, you have much more of a reinsurance participation in managing both risk and capital for our various platforms. So this is just the first one that I think people can quite clearly get their arms around, but I'd expect that to broaden out in other platforms over time.

I mean, first of all, the observations that we've shared are not theoretical in nature. We spend an awful lot of time on the ground in Washington at a very granular level, so we're not just dreamy in perspectives up. These are reflecting a mosaic of discussions, so that will be observation number one. Observation number two is when something works, you usually try to do more of it and Private Mortgage Insurance industry worked. I mean, if you look at the reserving methodology, you look at the claims paying ability, it is first dollar loss coverage, it did exactly what it was suppose to absorb an enormous amount of losses and that perspective is not loss on policymakers. So more of the dialogue is shifting to capacity is we want you back in, we don't want to take all of this risk, demonstrate the capacity and because that's a timing consideration of adding private and public capacity to the housing financial system, so it doesn't constrain the capital that needs to come and support a housing, continued stabilization and recovery. So as I noted and Kevin noted, it's been quite positive to see all of the strategies that have been pursued in the industry to bring that capacity. But there is an education step to remind all of the policymaker of how much that capacity adds up to, and therefore, if the government program step back, that indeed, you're coming into that and that's a very active education process. Finally, going back to your specific point, I do think that we'd learn things through cycles, both companies as well as folks on the governmental side learned things. And there can be some neat opportunities to look at of hybrids, of having the private industry upfront and having the government more in a public-private partnership, providing additional reinsurance capacity in the back. It's a little different then, but has some very clear analogies to Canada, but it doesn't replace a private industry. It lets it do what it does best. Beyond the frontlines, do the second underwrite, support mortgage lending to make sure that there's enough capacity through up and down cycles and that's the way you need to think about it."

We made important progress in the second quarter executing our strategy and delivering improved financial results. International earnings had nice growth supported by improving economic conditions",1159,"Thanks, Alicia, and thanks, everyone, for your time today. We made important progress in the second quarter executing our strategy and delivering improved financial results. International earnings had nice growth supported by improving economic conditions in Canada and Australia and the success of our ongoing loss mitigation efforts. U.S. Mortgage Insurance made good strides towards profitability, supported by loan modification and other loss mitigation efforts. Specifically, I'm encouraged about the continued favorable trends in new delinquencies that we are seeing fueled by both seasonal patterns, as well as the burn-through of exposures associated with the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books.
The size of the private mortgage insurance market and dynamics versus the FHA [Federal Housing Administration] remains a challenge, which I will touch upon later. We had mixed performance in Retirement and Protection. Sales were strong, particularly in Life and Long Term Care Insurance along with positive net flows in Wealth Management. Earnings took a nice step forward in Long Term Care Insurance and spread-based annuities but fell in Life Insurance and Fee Based Annuities impacted by relative mortality performance, higher lapses on certain term policies and weak equity markets.
I am pleased to announce that we completed our excess cash redeployment plans, putting some $3.5 billion back to work, hitting the high end of our targeted range. In my mind, second quarter represented an inflection point for the investment portfolio, where we clearly moved from playing defense to playing offense. Impairments were relatively low and are expected to remain low, and we moved early to get cash to work using a variety of strategies to manage investments in the low interest rate environment. 
We also look closely at where it may be prudent to adjust product pricing in the event of a prolonged low interest rate environment. This morning, I want to focus on three areas: First, how we are investing for growth in targeted areas; second, developments on the regulatory front around the globe; and finally, on the size of the market for U.S. Mortgage Insurance and what needs to change for future premium growth.
Let's turn to where we're investing in key growth areas that support earnings and return expansion. We see organic growth as our biggest opportunity, with targeted complementary acquisition opportunities and selective entry into new markets. We focused on three fundamental agendas to grow organically, introducing refreshed or innovative products, driving distribution penetration and expansion and improving value-added support services and capabilities.
On the product front, we continue to drive adoption of new products to support growth in Life Insurance. The more capital efficient product suite introduced in the fourth quarter of 2009 has been one of our most successful new product launches, and we will further refine our offerings. Distribution feedback has been very positive, given the attractive price points and flexibility the new products offer, and this is apparent in our sales trends. Importantly, we see additional opportunities with new products in Long Term Care, Wealth Management and Lifestyle Protection.
Turning to distribution. A good example of our expansion drive is in Lifestyle Protection, where we are focused on selling products in new ways. Rather than slowly selling products at or near the time of a new lending transaction, we are broadening programs with our distributors to market protection to their clients with various types of outstanding financial obligations using appropriate coverage types. In addition, we are broadening distribution channels to support sales with a larger dedicated team in place to do so.
Finally, a good example of where we're adding services and capabilities is in Wealth Management. Here, a key competitive advantage lies in service and technology differentiation. As a result, we are investing in sales coverage, technology and new products to position the business for additional growth longer term. In the near term, this was somewhat new to earnings growth but should provide a good payback.
In sum, we are pursuing strong organic growth that supports our earnings and return targets. In addition, we will look at modestly-sized acquisitions with a focus on wealth management and accretive life blocks, along with select opportunities to enter new markets on the international front that complement our existing business.
Turning to the regulatory environment, we saw a great deal of activity this quarter as regulators around the globe actively engage in financial reform discussions. In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Bill has targeted impacts on insurers that I would characterize as a net positive for our business. Importantly, it enables stronger discipline in mortgage origination practices that are a significant first step to overall housing reform, especially by granting statutory recognition to the importance of underwriting standards that are based on a borrower's ability to repay. 
We're also encouraged that the law recognizes the important role of mortgage insurance by including MI [mortgage insurer] as one of the features of a qualified residential mortgage. As you may know, qualified residential mortgages will be exempt from the new risk retention requirements that will be imposed on mortgage-backed securitizations, thereby encouraging prudent mortgage origination practices.
This is an important step for the industry and we'll carefully track how it evolves over the next several months, as regulatory agencies implement the legislation. In addition, there are many regulations and interpretations of the overall legislation to come, so we will remain appropriately engaged on these fronts.
Internationally, we are actively evaluating or engaging in dialogue around potential regulatory changes, which could aid the mortgage insurance demand or expand opportunities for Lifestyle Protection, including ongoing Basel III discussions. 
Finally, let's turn to the size of the U.S. mortgage insurance market. We do feel the market is slowly starting to shift back towards private mortgage insurers and will continue to do so, as the FHA reassesses its standards and reprices for appropriate risk management. We saw some progress in this respect with the FHA raising the upfront premium and requesting statutory authority to raise their annual premium. In addition, there is a clear opportunity for GSEs to review adverse market fees and loan level pricing that has steered new business to the FHA. These fees add to the cost of conventional loans that carry private mortgage insurance and this price difference influences originators and homebuyers when choosing a government-supported FHA loan or one from a private mortgage insurer.
Together, the combination of increased FHA pricing and potential changes in GSE market fees and loan level pricing should help shift demand back to the conventional purchase market, which is supported by private capital for mortgage insurers and Genworth is well positioned to play its part in filling that role.
To wrap, I'm pleased with our progress on several fronts, including new business trends, investment portfolio progress and improved fundamentals and housing markets in the U.S., Canada and Australia. And we will only intensify our execution focus in the second half of the year. 
With that, let met turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at the quarter. Pat?"

This morning, I'll focus on four areas: First, sales and earnings growth; second, risk management and loss mitigation actions; third, our capital management progress; and finally, how we think about earnings trends in the second half of the",2026,"Thanks, Mike. This morning, I'll focus on four areas: First, sales and earnings growth; second, risk management and loss mitigation actions; third, our capital management progress; and finally, how we think about earnings trends in the second half of the year based on experience to date. Let me start with sales growth. 
We're seeing sales growth in several key areas particularly in our leadership lines in Retirement and Protection and in mortgage insurance in Canada. This sets the stage for future revenue expansion. In Life Insurance, sales of our new more capital efficient Colony Term UL and GenGuard UL products had strong sequential increases since their launch in late 2009. We remain number one in total life policies sold through the BGA channel and continued to make good progress expanding sales of larger face amount policy. 
Turning to Long Term Care. Individual Long Term Care sales increased 36% versus the prior year. Here, we are seeing a rebound following declines in industry sales in early 2009. We had good growth across sales channels led by the independent channel. 
Wealth Management had its fifth straight quarter of positive net flows. Net flows were $436 million, up considerably compared to a year ago and down slightly on a sequential basis. We view this as a very good result in the context of current investment market conditions.
We saw mixed sales growth in the International segment related to differences in market conditions in Canada, Australia and Europe. In Canada, flow new insurance written increased 61% year-over-year as overall mortgage market growth was robust. The market view is that originations have been loaded somewhat towards the first half of the year in anticipation of a rate increase and a sales tax increase, both of which occurred in July. In addition, we saw the seasonal growth we expect on a sequential basis going from winter to spring. Accordingly, we would expect sales to slow moderately in the second half of the year.
In Australia, new flow insurance written declined 41% year-over-year, driven by increasing mortgage rates and the reduction of government stimulus programs that fueled a strong origination market in 2009. In Lifestyle Protection, the impact of lower consumer lending continues to pressure sales across Europe. Although consumer lending has stabilized at lower levels, many lenders remain capital constrained and therefore, are cautious in their lending activities. So we do not see conditions improving this year. At the same time, we are taking steps to improve sales as Mike outlined.
Finally, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we had incremental sequential growth in new insurance written. There are signs that business is gradually coming back to the private mortgage insurance market from the FHA but at a slower rate than we would like to see.
Turning to earnings growth. A highlight in the quarter was growth in investment income in Retirement and Protection. We completed our planned cash redeployment that began in the fourth quarter of 2009 at the high end of the targeted range or $3.5 billion. We reinvested the majority of funds in the fourth and first quarters ahead of declines in rates and yields. Cash reinvestment added about $4 million after-tax sequentially to R&P earnings. In addition, limited partnership investments generated $6 million of earnings after tax, compared with an $8 million after-tax loss in the first quarter. However, lower earnings in our fee-based Retirement Income and Life Insurance businesses more than offset these improved investment results. In Fee Retirement income, recent equity market declines resulted in valuation changes that reduced Fee Retirement Income earnings for the quarter. In total, higher DAC [deferred acquisition cost] amortization reduced earnings by $11 million.
In our Life Insurance business, we experienced higher mortality and lapse-related cost than we have historically. The term insurance mortality ratio was 96% of original pricing levels compared to an average of 92% over the last eight quarters. This is normal statistical variation and reduced earnings by approximately $10 million compared to the prior year and $2 million compared with first quarter. Term lapse related cost increased $11 million compared with prior year and $4 million compared to the first quarter. This is primarily related to more lapses at the end of the level premium period on 10-year term insurance policies sold in 1999 and 2000. 
International earnings growth was strong, aided by improved market conditions in Canada and Australia plus tax legislation change in Australia that we had anticipated. The tax law change had a cumulative impact of $16 million, $6 million of this is attributable to second quarter 2010 and $10 million is attributable to prior quarters. Going forward, the tax change will continue to provide benefits to earnings in Australia.
In Lifestyle Protection, earnings were flat on a sequential basis. Underwriting results did improve marginally, reflecting lower new claim registrations and pricing and product changes. However, this was muted by some foreign exchange fluctuations. The U.S. Mortgage Insurance loss increased moderately with favorable delinquency trends moderating slightly relative to the first quarter results.
Looking next at risk management and loss mitigation, we continue to take a proactive approach to managing our risks with the market conditions both that we currently see and what we might expect to see in the future. There are four examples I'll touch on today. 
First, in our housing-related businesses, we use loss mitigation to keep borrowers in their homes and ensure that we are paying only legitimate claims. In the U.S., this resulted in $217 million of savings in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $450 million. Looking at the full year, we expect to approach the 2009 level. Savings could fluctuate depending on new delinquency trends, the success of modification programs and the impact of rescission experience as we work through the declining inventory of investigation. Given our experience over the past two quarters, we expect the benefits from rescissions to trail down and we expect the benefits from modifications to remain at or above what we saw this quarter, driven by both HAMP [Home Affordable Modification Program] and non-HAMP modifications.
Second, we are selectively reducing risk where appropriate by reaching contract settlements targeted for certain servicers, lenders or GSEs. This involves agreeing on terms that remove risk from our portfolios and achieve derisking targets. We've done this effectively over the past two years in Mortgage Insurance, primarily in Spain, Australia and in the U.S. 
As an example, in the second quarter, we reached a settlement with a U.S. servicer relating to rescissions for a portion of our flow mortgage insurance portfolio. This is a mutually beneficial outcome. Settlement activity remains an additional tool for managing risk and positioning for stronger and more predictable earnings emergence going forward. I should note that this quarter, settlement activity in our Global Mortgage Insurance businesses reduced operating earnings by approximately $18 million after tax.
Third, we completed pricing and product changes on new and in force business in Lifestyle Protection to improve earnings and decrease volatility. We've taken action in Western Europe and more recently in the Nordic region. In the second quarter, we achieved underwriting profits in nearly all of our European markets, although profitability remains below target levels due to lower lending and high unemployment throughout Europe. 
We are encouraged by the effectiveness of our repricing mechanisms and the strength of our distribution relationships as we pursue suitable loss mitigation actions. We continue to evaluate performance, and we'll take incremental pricing or product actions as appropriate. 
And finally, we have also taken additional steps in the investment portfolio. While the low interest-rate environment is a challenge, our longer duration liabilities allowed us to invest in the seven to 15-year part of the curve, where we can take advantage of the higher yield. In addition, we invested in select asset classes whose spreads widened during the quarter, which helped to offset the lower interest rates.
Turning now to capital management. We are pleased with the sound capital ratios at our operating companies. We are successfully executing our plans to meet and provide for obligations at the holding company. We currently have in excess of $1.1 billion of holding company cash and short-term securities. We issued $400 million of debt during the quarter and used $200 million of the proceeds to repay a portion of our credit facility. 
In Canada, our majority-owned subsidiary issued CAD $275 million of senior debt during the quarter, and subsequently announced plans to repurchase common shares and return up to CAD $325 million to shareholders. We expect net proceeds of approximately USD $175 million to be received by the holding company in the second half of 2010. In total, we expect $350 million to $400 million in operating company dividends and return of capital in the second half of 2010, primarily from our international companies. 
As we look to 2011, we expect the international companies, as well as the U.S. life companies to pay dividends to the holding company. So in sum, our operating businesses remain well positioned to support operating and parent holding company capital plans going forward.
Before closing, I'd like to comment on earnings trends. In Retirement and Protection, we expect that revenue growth associated with the continuation of recent sales trends in our leadership line will provide meaningful earnings growth over time, and we expect mortality and morbidity levels to remain within normal ranges. We do expect some level of continued volatility in equity markets, and we'd expect life insurance persistency to remain a manageable headwind.
In International, earnings trends have been favorable and stable in Canada and Australia with some choppiness in Lifestyle Protection and European Mortgage Insurance, reflecting conditions in Europe. In Canada and Australia, economic growth has been relatively strong, unemployment is declining, housing prices have rebounded strongly from the downturn and are now stabilizing and governments have been withdrawing stimulus, while central banks increased interest rates to control inflation. While these conditions persist, we can reasonably expect that loss ratio should remain in the current range with normal quarterly fluctuations.
The decisive actions taken to improve earnings in Lifestyle Protection should result in overall earnings improvement if current market conditions persist with some choppiness in quarterly results. Given this action, when market starts to recover and consumer lending returns in Europe, our Lifestyle Protection business will be well positioned for further earnings improvement. 
The Europe Mortgage Insurance business remains small and well contained. It's worth noting that at the end of the second quarter, total risk in force in Spain has been reduced significantly to approximately $125 million as a result of the loss mitigation activities I described earlier. Given today's pricing and tight underwriting, combined with anticipated influences from the current regulatory environment, we do see targeted growth opportunities for this business in the years ahead.
Turning to U.S. Mortgage Insurance, while current trends are favorable, we remain cautious in our outlook for the second half of 2010. Flow delinquencies decreased by 4% from first quarter to second, better than the 1% decline we have seen historically in the second quarter. We attribute the differential to the combination of burn-through of the 2005, '06 and '07 books and the favorable delinquency development in the 2009 and '10 books. Seasonal delinquency patterns are expected to continue in the second half of the year. Based on our average historical experience, delinquencies generally trend up about 8% in both of the third and fourth quarters.
However, the decreasing impact of poor performing books and favorable delinquency development relating to recent books will also influence second half experience. Balancing these trends, we believe it is prudent to take a more conservative view of our U.S. MI performance for the next two quarters, and have a more favorable view as we look towards 2011.
To wrap, Genworth delivered good results this quarter, setting the stage for growth in sales and earnings. And while we faced some headwinds, we are encouraged by our progress. We remain focused on four levers to reach our return on equity targets: Profitable new business growth, optimizing investment performance, ongoing risk management including loss mitigation and finally, effective capital management.
With that, I'll open it up to your questions."

Accounting rules require amortization in proportion to premium",321,"First, we'll talk about the 10-year term lapses generally and why they do not amortized fully over to level period. And I'll do this from an accounting and an industry experience perspective. Accounting rules require amortization in proportion to premium revenue over the life of the policy. 10-year level term product with premiums that grade up on an ART basis following the level period will typically show some persistency beyond the period and continue to generate premium revenue. So it is normal in the industry that some portion of deferred acquisition cost remains to be amortized after the level-term period. Now ordinarily, you'd expect that to be relatively minor fluctuations, and to understand what's happened versus prior year, we have to go back and start with our experience in the second quarter of last year and bring that forward to our experience in this quarter. Back in the second quarter of 2009, amortization costs were really relatively low for the term insurance portfolio at around 5% of premiums, and that was due to unusually favorable lapse experience compared to what is more typical. And more typical run rate for amortization of acquisition cost on a portfolio like this, I would say, is in the range of 10% to 15% of premium. Current year amortization costs are actually more in line with this more typical run rate. So the favorability we saw last year, we're not seeing this year. So what's important is why? And as we look at the emerging experience, we saw that most of the increase is attributable to an increase in amortization of acquisition costs, as policies on the post-level period increase. We have the large books of 10-year term business sold in 1999 and 2000. We are seeing an increased rate of lapse because those are flowing into the level-term period, and we've seen the increase in amortization year-over-year that I described. Does that address your point?"

I'll have to give you at a bit of background because you are right. A lot of the work that we've done over the last several quarters is going to impact that. I'll start with our International and our Mortgage Insurance businesse",570,"This is Pat. I'll do that. I'll have to give you at a bit of background because you are right. A lot of the work that we've done over the last several quarters is going to impact that. I'll start with our International and our Mortgage Insurance businesses. There are, generally, short-duration products in those businesses, so they don't have the interest rate risk or earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate movements that are U.S. Life Insurance or a Long Term Care business might. So what I do to respond would be, I'll step back and talk a little bit about the potential impacts of interest rates across our domestic Life Insurance business, where we are relatively more interest-sensitive than in international. And what we've been doing to mitigate these impacts, as well as what they would be. And I would say in general, low interest rates and movements in interest rates impact returns on our annuities, long term care and in our  universal life insurance. In annuity blocks over the past three to four quarters, as we've been actively putting cash back to work, we've been lengthening an asset duration and matching asset and liability durations to lock in spread. Actually, we went a little bit long on the SPDA portfolio, anticipating that with the low-interest rate environment, you might see better persistency and that was prior to the unlocking that we did in the current quarter. I'd say, currently, we have a tight matching of asset and liability durations for our Fixed Annuity business, which does help to minimize interest rate risks. So we might see some residual leakage associated non-parallel shifts of the interest rate curve as it flattens. But generally speaking, the spread should maintain at the current levels going forward or within about 10 basis points or so of current levels. In the longer-duration liability products like long term care, we've similarly put back cash to work and we've lengthened asset durations. But we also employ hedging strategies that lock in yields for clash flows yet to be received. In general, I would say we've got interest rate protection for about 70% of the expected cash flows over the next 10 years. And to give you an idea of the scope of those strategies and programs, these strategies provide downside interest rate protection, and effectively, they're currently worth about $1.8 billion and they reside in the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income after adjustments for tax. In the current quarter, due to declines in interest rates, these hedges increased in value by approximately $575 million. So again in long term care, over the next several years, we would have about 30% of our cash flows exposed to reductions in rates. But because of the impact of these rather significant hedging strategies, we feel like the earnings volatility associated was at least a decline in interest rates over a few years would be limited. And then finally, in universal life, that's currently a small piece of our end force, and our secondary account balance -- guarantee account balances only make up about 30% to 35% of the total UL block. And here, we're employing the duration-matching strategies similar to those described for the annuity block. And I'd say you'd have similar types of leakage from the spreads on the account values. And the difference between earned in credit and interest rates. That address your question?"

And then last year, I'm wondering if, in the future, we should anticipate kind of similar issues as kind of the 15- and 20-year level term policies written from that year kind of bubble up?"

The way that I would look at it is I would look at the life insurance amortization and in comparison to -- that's in the supplement -- in comparison to the revenue stream associated with the business because if you break it down into a lot of detail, you'll see a fair amount of fluctuation between cohorts and it's quite difficult to observe trends. So I would suggest that use the information in the supplement, take a look at the way the amortization is changing as the revenue trends and that should give you a pretty good picture. And where things happen from quarter-to-quarter, which are out of line with the usual quarterly trends, you can count on the fact that we'll provide additional clarity on that. On to your second point, the interplay of  mortality and persistency, logically, you're right. But we do also price the product recognizing that interplay. And in particular, as I look at the mortality that is emerging quarter-over-quarter, we haven't seen that anti-selection. In fact, I describe the mortality as being within the normal range but high. To give you a little bit more color on what actually happened, our number of claims in the current quarter actually declined from first quarter, but it just so happen that the severity increased because the people who happen to die this quarter owned larger policies. So it really is fluctuating randomly within a range, and we haven't seen anything associated with the interplay that should describe, although that certainly exist. And then..."

First is, we took all of the actions that we thought we're appropriate to deal with the in force that we've had. As far as half of the book was monthly premium, so it was subject to price change. So we moved on that, as you know, and really put all of those price moves in place. But we remain actively monitoring those areas per performance to see if there's any additional pricing actions required. I'll remind you that as part of -- when I use the term pricing actions, it's not just premium. You may change how you handle a profit and loss share with a distributor. You may change a commission structure. It also helps you get back some margin along with that. The second thing we did though is looked at our experience and incorporated that back into product design as we go forward. In other words, did you have to adjust the nature of any liabilities or therefore coverages so that it could handle a more strained period that like we just have gone through. So that has been built into the new products that we're selling now. Finally, surrounding both of those whether it's old or new, we do have active loss mitigation efforts, in other words, following up on claims, making sure we're paying valid claims. But let's say you have an accident and sickness claim, someone should get better and like for example go back to work and you have to have active follow-up on those. So I think we've designed the business model to handle a more stressed environment going forward. And we've used the same types of a back-testing disciplines that we did in the U.S. Mortgage Insurance business in Europe to make sure that that's a data-driven and analytic exercise, not a theoretical one. So we're quite comfortable with that model going forward."

We made important progress in a number of key areas in the third quarter while navigating a tough U.S. mortgage insurance environment. International earnings showed strong growth, with improvement across our Canadian, Australian and European mortgage insurance platforms, supported by better economic conditions in Canada and Australia. 
We also saw a turn in Lifestyle Protection earnings, reflecting lower losses and improved pricing. U.S. Mortgage Insurance had a disappointing quarter from the standpoint of the move we made to strengthen forwarded reserves. At the same time, we continue to experience favorable trends across other areas lead by delinquencies and loan modifications. Specifically, we saw improving trends in delinquencies, which outperformed expectations of a seasonal increase, demonstrating additional burn-through of exposures associated with the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books.
Turning to loss mitigation activities, the bulk of benefits now come from loan modifications as expected, with clearly improved rates of redefault. Looking ahead, we believe servicer-based loan modification programs should continue to ramp up, as only a few servicers are hitting full-stride here. And we will work intently to support these. And we're also seeing gradual improvement in the size of the private mortgage insurance market and competitiveness versus the FHA. 
However, the dynamic of late-stage delinquencies being tougher to cure with more going to foreclosure is real. So we have to keep working to deal with it and work to offset it. 
Pat will provide more color across these areas in his remarks.
Turning to Retirement and Protection, we had mixed performance. Sales were strong, particularly in life and long term care insurance, along with positive net flows in wealth management. Earnings were solid in long term care insurance but remained lower in life insurance, impacted by the higher lapses we've been seeing on certain term policies, higher life reserve funding costs and some mortality performance, but at levels not as strong as experienced in the prior periods.
This morning, I want to focus on four topics: first, highlight two examples of how we are driving growth and investing in targeted areas; second, update you on actions we continue to take to improve in force performance, most recently focused on our old block of long term care insurance; third, provide an update on the housing regulatory front; and finally, provide perspectives on our medium-term return on equity targets.
Let's begin with where we are investing in key growth areas that support earnings and return expansion. As a reminder, we see organic growth from our existing business platforms as our biggest opportunity, complemented by two additional strategies: targeted, small bolt-on acquisition opportunities that fit with existing platforms, and in particular, at wealth management; and elective entry into new international markets, which we think have strong future growth and profit potential where we bring established capabilities. 
To drive organic growth, we focus on three fundamental agendas: introducing refreshed or innovative products, driving distribution penetration and expansion and improving value-added support services. Our new life insurance line that is more capital-efficient has reflected all aspects of this organic growth agenda. And it shows in the sales numbers. The product line has been totally redesigned with a few more additions to come, producer penetration is up, and we have supported this with improved application processing and underwriting approaches. 
We also saw an example of how we're using targeted, small acquisitions to accelerate growth in our Wealth Management business. Here we announced plans to acquire Altegris, a specialist in alternative investments, which will broaden our offerings to financial advisors. This is a great opportunity to enhance our competitiveness with advisors and their high net worth clients.
Turning to actions we take to improve in force performance. You saw the benefits come through more clearly this quarter of our repricing and contract restructuring actions in Lifestyle Protection. In addition, last week we announced plans to increase rates on two of our older blocks of long term care insurance policies, which would improve the overall earnings profile on that line. 
This is our second price increase on these blocks of business. Similar to the actions we took in 2007, we plan to increase price responsibly, in this case by 18%, and are taking this action based on the lower termination experience we have seen in these older policies. 
The price increase will affect about 25% of the premium base, which will tether into earnings starting in 2011, with the full impact seen in 2012. Going forward, Genworth will continue to look for opportunities to improve the performance profile of our older books of business.
Turning to regulatory developments. The dialogue around housing policy reform in the United States picked up steam in the quarter and included what role should exist for the GSCs and whether there are better designs for such entities, the importance of conservative mortgage underwriting, the role of first-time homeownership, the importance of securitization to the housing market and implementation of the qualified residential mortgage provision of the Dodd-Frank bill. 
The Treasury Department, regulatory bodies including HUD [Housing and Urban Development] and FHFA, and the legislators are central to this debate, the outcome of which remains open but will determine the path forward for housing finance. The mortgage insurance industry and Genworth are participating actively in Washington, providing important data and perspectives in this dialogue, as well as working to shape the policies that will be implemented in coming years. Throughout these discussions, the value of private mortgage insurance and the role of mortgage insurers were highlighted and clearly reinforced, which should be a positive for the industry. 
Finally, turning to ROE target. We assess the progress we are making towards our medium-term operating return on equity targets on an ongoing basis and in view of the current environment. In that context, we are taking a more cautious view towards the timing of reaching our interim total business operating ROE goal of 10% initially targeted for 2012. 
We will provide a more detailed view into our earnings drivers and return targets at our December Investor Day. At this point, we expect that achieving the overall 10% ROE level will take longer than previously estimated, given the dynamics and trends to date in the U.S. platforms, with business segment-level ROEs showing different ranges of performance. 
We have seen good earnings momentum and growth in returns in the International segment supported by recovery or stabilization in these markets. International has certainly tracked our expectations. 
Retirement and Protection earnings have stabilized but have not yet transitioned to the growth rate we want to see. The overall dynamics in U.S. Mortgage Insurance remain reasonably within expectations, but there are several market dynamics outside our control that impact market recovery timing, including recent foreclosure trends, activity around foreclosure suspensions, softness in home prices and a sizable inventory overhang. We still view 2011 as a transitional year from an earnings perspective in U.S. Mortgage Insurance. However, this specific timing of a return to sustained quarterly profits is less clear, given these market dynamics, so we must see how these play out. 
In sum, we look forward to giving you a more detailed update in December. Now before I turn it over to Pat, I wanted to comment on some management shifts we communicated during the quarter. As you know, Pam Schutz had announced her retirement earlier this year, effective February 2011. So we were pleased to announce that Pat Kelleher will be transitioning to lead the Retirement and Protection segment. Pat has been instrumental as Genworth navigated the financial crisis, and will bring his strong finance, product management and actuarial background to the segment at an important time. We are in the midst of an external search for a new Chief Financial Officer, and in the interim, Pat will remain in his current position and work with Pam on the Retirement and Protection leadership transition. We were also pleased to announce that Kevin Walker will join us as CFO of Retirement and Protection, replacing Kelly Groh who will be leading our investment portfolio management as part of Ron Joelson's investment team. With that, let me turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at the quarter. Pat?"
8598029,113894684,83416,"Genworth Financial Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Genworth Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

This morning I'll focus on four areas: first, sales and earnings growth in several businesses; second, loss trends in U.S. mortgage insurance; third, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on earnings; and finally, our capital management progress. 
Let me start with sales growth. We're seeing good sales growth trends in several key areas, particularly in our leadership lines in Retirement and Protection and in mortgage insurance in Canada. In life insurance, sales of our new, more capital-efficient Colony Term UL and GenGuard UL products had strong sequential increases since the launch in late 2009. We remain number one in total life policies sold through the BGA channel and continued to make good progress expanding sales of larger face amount policies.
Turning to long term care. Individual long term care sales increased 36% versus the prior year. In the year we are seeing a rebound, following declines in industry sales in early 2009. Growth has been driven by independent channels. And wealth management had its sixth straight quarter of positive net flows which, combined with favorable market returns in the most recent quarter, brought assets under management to over $21 billion. 
We saw a mix sales growth in the International segment related to differences in market conditions in Canada, Australia and Europe. In Canada, flow new insurance written increased 45% year-over-year as overall mortgage market growth was robust. The market view is that originations have been loaded somewhat toward the first part of the year in anticipation of a rate increase and a sales tax increase, both of which occurred in July. Although sales continued at a stronger pace than we expected in the current quarter, they declined each month, and we expect sales to continue to slow in the fourth quarter as normal seasonal patterns slow origination. In Australia, flow new insurance written declined 36% year-over-year, driven by lower levels of government support to first-time homebuyers, a decline in the high loan to value mortgage originations and increased interest rates beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
In Lifestyle Protection, we've seen the impact of lower consumer lending and have seen sales stabilize over the past three quarters. We do not see conditions improving this year, and we are continuing execution of previously announced strategies to increase sales by broadening our distribution focus and more effectively mining in force books of business. Finally, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we have sequential growth in new insurance written. Here we are seeing clear indications that business has been gradually coming back to the private mortgage insurance market from the FHA, but at a slower rate than we would like to see.
Now turning to earnings growth. Long term care earnings were up 13% from a year ago. New business growth and improved investment income more than offset higher claims in the old block. As Mike mentioned, we are implementing an in force rate increase on a portion of the old block which should improve future earnings. 
Given the long term care market environment and recent competitor actions, we've been getting more questions in the areas of interest rate exposure, new business, underwriting risk and reserving practices. And given this, I thought it might be useful to address these points. First, regarding the interest rate exposure, we actively hedged forward cash flow reinvestment risks and about 70% of future cash flows on the in force business over the next 10 years will receive yield enhancements from these programs if interest rates remain at low levels. 
With respect to new business, we are planning to reduce interest rate yield assumptions in our next generation of products, continuing a trend that started several years ago. We believe our pricing and hedging strategies are appropriate for managing interest rate risk associated with our long term care business. 
Second, regarding new business. Despite near-term market disruptions, we believe the overwhelming consumer need and our approach to providing a robust portfolio of product solutions and broad distribution access will enable us to continue to grow sales. 
And third, regarding underwriting. We have good practices in place which, based on our deep experience, we evaluate and improve on a continuous basis. We demonstrated stable trends in the interest-adjusted loss ratio, and the loss ratio on the new block has been consistently favorable relative to pricing. In fact, we gave up sales to competitors to stick with our focus on preferred risks such as healthy couples. 
And fourth, we actively review emerging loss ratios and trends as part of our reserving process and supplement this with independent third-party reviews. As a result, we reflect emerging trends as they are identified. Our reserving process provides for appropriate adjustments and refinements on a timely basis. The point is this is not something we only do every few years.
Now let's turn to retirement income, including fee and spread annuities, where earnings also improved, reflecting the benefits of improving markets and better asset liability matching. I should note that in this quarter, the earnings were reduced by $6 million due to evaluation refinement impacting DAC [deferred acquisition cost] amortization and death benefit costs. 
And in our life insurance business, we've seen lower year-over-year earnings for the past few quarters. Here, three factors are influencing results. First, mortality, while below pricing, is above the very favorable levels we saw in 2009 and specifically, the term insurance mortality ratio was 94% of original pricing levels in the current quarter, compared to 85% in the third quarter of last year. This reduced quarterly earnings by approximately $14 million compared to the prior year. 
And second, we faced continued pressure from higher funding costs, for the XXX securitizations. Now while this did not materially impact the year-over-year comparison that's funding cost increase back in 2008, it has muted overall earnings levels. We will look opportunistically to improve the funding cost of these programs over the longer term. 
And finally, consistent with the second quarter, term lapse-related costs were up compared with prior year. This is primarily related to the higher lapses at the end of the level premium period on 10-year term insurance. So as we look ahead, we would expect the near-term run rate for quarterly earnings to remain in the low- to mid-$30 million range subject to normal quarterly fluctuations, with the new business gradually lifting the earnings profile. 
International earnings growth was strong, aided by improved market conditions in Canada and Australia and an improved earnings profile in Europe. Sequentially, market conditions in Canada and Australia were stable. As we look ahead, we are mindful of the earnings patterns associated with the single premium financial model. Specifically, that premium recognition parallels the timing of loss emergence with most premiums recognized in years two through five. In Canada, we will see the premium recognition on the large 2007 book decline in 2011, which will pressure next year's revenues. This will rebound over time as larger books of business are underwritten. 
In contrast, we anticipate moderate premium growth in Australia during 2011, which is aided by a larger 2009 book. 
In Lifestyle Protection, earnings improved nicely for three reasons: first, loss experience has improved, with the loss ratio declining to 17% in the quarter compared to 27% a year ago; second, the in force pricing and distribution contract changes we made in 2009 and earlier this year are providing the lift we expected; and finally, Lifestyle Protection earnings benefited from about $7 million of lower taxes in the quarter. Looking ahead, and excluding the favorable tax item, we would expect earnings improvement overall, with some quarterly choppiness.
Turning to U.S. Mortgage Insurance. As we expected and discussed last quarter, earnings were below the levels we saw in the first half of the year, and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Let's take a closer look at third quarter loss developments, starting with the biggest driver, $85 million pretax of reserve strengthening of delinquent loans in Florida. A few dynamics contributed to this result: Aging and delinquencies; lower loss mitigation savings from lower loan modifications versus the rest of the country; and higher foreclosure starts and paid claims during the quarter. 
As Alicia mentioned, we posted some supplementary materials on our website that walk through these dynamics in more detail. I'll offer two observations relating to these developments. First, Florida has a relatively high percentage of investor-owned properties, 15% versus 6% in our overall portfolio in the U.S. As a result, these loans can be more difficult to modify. 
Second, there are two servicers in Florida where we saw a more dramatic increase in foreclosure starts during the quarter. These servicers in general are having relatively low success rates in completing modification, and therefore more of these loans have proceeded to foreclosure. We are actively working with the servicers to improve modification results. 
Looking past the Florida reserve strengthening, we saw results that were overall consistent with expected trends, particularly given the seasonal developments that we anticipated. Total flow delinquencies decreased 3%, primarily from growth in paid claims and lower new delinquencies. Modifications increased, and this was offset by earlier-than-expected declines in rescission activity. And as a result of these dynamics was an overall shift in the delinquency inventory, from early-stage delinquencies to later stage. 
We added a schedule to the financial supplement this quarter which illustrates this trend. We now expect the delinquency aging to gradually increase the average reserve for delinquency as the late-stage delinquencies move through the claims process over the next several quarters. And we expect paid claims to trend up as they did this quarter. In total, loss mitigation savings declined to $158 million in the quarter bringing the year-to-date amount to $608 million. Looking at the full year, and considering the lower level of new delinquencies, we now expect to be at approximately $750 million below the $847 million in 2009. 
We continue to expect savings to be more heavily weighted to loan modifications from recisions, and we are seeing encouraging trends in redefault rates on modified loans, with current redefault experience of around 30% compared with much higher historic redefault-s on modifications. To wrap on U.S. Mortgage Insurance, while we are encouraged by trends in new delinquency development and early signs of improved new business, some clear headwinds remain. Our self-contained capital plans remains within expectations. The risk to capital level is right in line with our capital planning assumptions as these plans were based on a relatively conservative outlook. We will continue to manage prudently through a challenging mortgage market.
Next I wanted to review the potential impact to Genworth of a prolonged period of low interest rates. For context, our mix of housing and Protection and Retirement business positions us well to manage a period of low interest rates on a relative basis. Within our Protection and Retirement businesses, our product mix has relatively small exposures to interest-sensitive deposit-type liabilities. The largest exposure to deposit-type liabilities is our single premium deferred annuity portfolio, with approximately $11 billion of account values. 
Here, our assets are matched with our liabilities from a duration perspective with less than one quarter mismatch. This means that we're well-positioned to preserve spreads and protect against the impacts of lower lapses in a low interest rate environment. That said, all longer duration insurance products have exposure to changes in interest rates over time. Our biggest such exposure is in our long term care insurance products, which I touched on earlier, where the duration of the liabilities is around 25 years, making it impractical to match closely with appropriate assets. Here, we've enhanced our asset liability matching strategies using derivatives to lock in future reinvestment rates that are consistent with our pricing requirements. 
In total, these positions are worth approximately $2.1 billion as of September 30. They reside in the balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive income. Given this, it is clear that a portion of future cash flows in long term care are unhedged and a prolonged low interest rate environment would impact GAAP earnings. If rates and credit spreads were to remain at current levels, I would not expect a material impact on long term care earnings this year or next. The impact would build over three years to about $20 million to $30 million after tax impact to GAAP earnings in year three.
Turning now to capital management. We are pleased with the sound capital ratios at our operating companies. We are successfully executing our plans to meet and provide for obligations at the holding company. We currently have $1.3 billion of holding company cash and short-term securities. We received $182 million in dividends from our operating companies during the quarter. In total, we expect about $350 million in operating company dividends during 2010. 
As we look to 2011, we see multiple sources and good flexibility for holding company dividends from our operating companies. In sum, our operating businesses remain well-positioned to support operating and parent holding company capital plans going forward. Looking ahead, we remain focused on four levers to drive improvements in our returns: profitable new business growth; optimizing investment performance; ongoing risk management, including loss mitigation; and finally, effective capital management. We look forward to providing you with a more detailed update on our business and financial targets at our December Investor Day. With that, I'll open it up to your questions."

But there are larger issues here that I think you need to address. Frankly, the only accomplishment that this management team can truly point to is the survival of this company, which I don't mean to minimize, but otherwise, this management team has overseen a massive destruction of shareholder value. In fact, at the current price-to-book, Genworth is selling at a steep discount at both MGIC and PMI to pure-play MIs, and this is probably because this company does not meet its cost of capital in any of its businesses. In other words, the market currently is ascribing negative value to your non-MI businesses. It's a pretty astonishing statement, and I don't get any sense of urgency from this management team as to how this is all going to be addressed. To keep going down the current road seems to me a complete waste of time. Clearly, the best use of capital for this company is to buyback stock when it is at a discount, at less than 40% of book value. The ROE on that activity is multiples higher than any new business you can write. So it seems to me we can go down a couple of roads. Number one, you could shut down businesses and use resulting excess capital to buyback stock, or you can give us a roadmap and a time schedule which we're going to hold you to as to when each of your businesses will achieve at least its cost of capital. I want you to understand that my patience, or the patience of your shareholders, is not infinite, and my patience is just about done. And I'd like a response to my comments. And one other thing, at the beginning of this conference call, Mr. Fraser said that they might do bolt-on acquisitions. Do not do that. Your stock's at the selling, it's less than 40% of book value. You do a bolt-on acquisition, and I will wage a proxy battle immediately to throw you out here. Now, I would like a response."

Clearly, we are in a transition, with different other business segments at different stages of that transition. As we look at the International segment, a much clearer path, a much clearer performance trend. You can also see the path to not only earning your cost of capital in International but in fact, exceeding the head cost of capital. And we'll reinforce that as we lay out both where we are and where we're going in that as we walk through the Investor Day. But I think you can see that in the numbers. And I will make sure we give you -- if you look at International and where we have targeted in that segment, 15% ROE by 2012, we're tracking right to that. So we'll try to make sure that in that form, we can show all the details and leverage that you and other investors can see behind that one. Number two, if you get to the mortgage insurance business, clearly the transition we're going through is a frustrating one. And I share your frustration on that, but I think we're doing all of the right things to bring that business back. Now I can't explain for you the difference in valuation if I look at that on a segment versus some other public comparables. And I'm happy to have that deeper discussion on the reasons for that, your perspectives on that separately. But there's a business where we did move early, and others followed to deal with loss mitigation activities, to reprice business for the risk. So that as you put on new business, you can turn that business and we've currently seen a very choppy, to say the least, third quarter set of data come in, as Kevin outlined. That, as I said, that is a business we will again see transition back, turning more than a cost of capital. I think they have a timing issue there, given some of the factors I highlighted specifically in the market. Thirdly, then you come back to Retirement and Protection, and we have put a number of the lines, such as our institutional area, into runoff to basically harvest capital from them. And what we do, as you look at capital there, is maintain capital to support the ratings and a sound level of growth, not too much, not too little, maintain appropriate risk by percent, and now I'm jumping to a bit of an enterprise comment, optimize the capital structure as we look through the maturities we have in 2011 and 2012. And then it comes -- so let me just finish then on the life business. We have to continue to, at the line level taking the actions we are, we'll show you the progress in long term care, and you've seen us move with pricing actions there, and the dynamics of the old book versus the new book. The old book is about 35% of the book, the new book's now at 65% in the path of those dynamics. The life area, because of the two factors that the path has touched upon, has certainly been below our performance expectations, but that's also why we totally changed the nature of the product, to not make it capital-consumptive as the old, and to have very different margins. Now let's get to your point on the use of any excess capital, and what's the appropriate use of that. First, if I looked at the map, for example, and use of $100 million to repurchase shares, you would get about a five basis point lift on today's ROE, and I look at that quite carefully. I would agree with you that, first of all, acquisitions should not be a major priority, or any subsequent priority for the company beyond what it's executing with organic growth and optimizing our capital structure and maintaining appropriate risk offers. The one you did see this quarter was a small tuck-in one. There's not a pipeline of those per se, but in the wealth management business, that's the one area I pointed towards, along with where we've selectively put less than $25 million of capital, looking at a few new markets in international mortgage insurance that we think can be the next Canada and Australia. But it has to be very modest because after that, I would agree, as I look at any excess redeployable capital, the math is compelling on a share repurchase when you look at the book valuation. So right now, if you step away and looked at our -- and you look at our capital versus rating agency requirements or regulatory requirements, you'd see about $1.2 billion level over those hurdles. We would hold -- basically, if you look at U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we'd hold the portion associated with that to navigate this period as a risk buffer. We would hold what we have in the life businesses, similarly for both risk offers and just to operate the business appropriately at a single A rating, and the rest of that capital sits in International. And as Pat has noted, there will be dividends that come in from International through the holding company, but some of those dividends will be used to address the 2011 and 2012 maturities. And you'll see our debt to capital structure, come from sort of the mid- 20% range right down to the 20% to 21% range, which is in line with targeted coverage ratios, and where we need to be. So if there's capital that we generate beyond that as we go-forward, your point's due, noted and accepted that if you have that excess capital, buying shares is a compelling way to deploy that capital and you should run the other businesses for recovery. So as we get to the December Investor Day, we will certainly endeavor to walk you through with good visibility, not only each of those segments but also the holding company, walk you through the levers and continue to take your views as well as other investor views, and execute."

I think that's certainly something that we're concerned about at the industry. As you watch some of the original carriers and some of their pricing actions, that a couple of perspectives just on -- as we adjust premiums on this in force blocks, certainly worth taking an approach to take a responsible increase. The increase in that we announced back in 2007 was a range of 8% to 12%, what we saw on that was a shock lapse of less than 1%. We would expect, again, this increase is the second round on two of the four older blocks that we addressed in 2007. The amount again that we announced is 18% that we'll be requesting with the Departments of Insurance. We would not expect that shock lapse to be, again, much more than 1% or so. The discussions with the customer, when you're looking at a comparable set of benefits of the price of the product that they're buying today, even with that 8% to 12% we announced back in 2007, the additional 18%, that same package of benefits that is purchased on the market today is roughly 20%. What they're paying on the older blocks would be roughly 20% cheaper than the new-priced products. So as we think about the in force rate increases, we are looking at this in a responsible way. We think that the seniors that purchase the products historically are still getting great value in that product. And the products that we're selling in the market today -- again, as we look at our assumptions, we believe our prize for relative stability. One thing I would point out, that in 2001, 2002, the NAIC model regulations required a level of rate stabilization. So all carriers that are filing products today are approaching their pricing with, I think, a more conservative stance. So we're seeing that the in force rate increases announced are being accepted by the consumers. They're paying the higher premium and still have good value."

Lets just walk through. If you look at the life and long term care area, as we declare, though we have leadership in both -- in the middle or mainstream market in life insurance. And if you look at the bulk of our policies, they are under a $1 million phase size. And the fact that the vast majority of under $500,000, and we're penetrating in both segments. So we've made a very clear call there, and we've made it a very clear call in making sure that we leveraged our long, long term care experience. They have appropriate and profitable business there. The wealth management businesses has actually grown nicely. I understand, we kind of have different views. But that is a third area that we concentrated on because of the shift to advisers, and we've seen a lot of adviser dynamics moving to independent platforms that we serve. We have taken a much narrower stance and continued to evaluate the optimum participation in the annuity area, recognizing that some of our distribution values is selling more than one product. And that is a dialogue with distribution, and we're able to leverage our distribution expense and spread it, because of those multiple products, as opposed to if you were a mono-line in that area. But there will be the appropriate capital development given to the leadership areas, and that capital is being taken away from the other areas as we work through that U.S. life strategy which is playing out, but for the drag and the older blocks that Pat talked about, and lapsing off and dynamics around that. Internationally, in mortgage insurance, I'm upset when you look at Canada and Australia and the way those platforms not only perform but move through. And we pulled back from a number of the markets we were starting to explore to concentrate on those leadership areas while selectively planting some seeds. I guess we probably have a different view on the lifestyle protection business because of how we see the market. And it sounds like we should make sure that we do a good job of laying that out. I view that over time as more of a compliment to a protection value proposition when you look at the nature of the risks, the underwriting, the actuarial support that we leverage, and I like the diversification it gives you in the protection area versus the U.S. market. So I think it's more than just being classified as a credit insurance business. But we will, as we move through executing our strategy, of course look at our portfolio and make sure that our portfolio mix evolves, so that not only are we trying to rebuild value, but we optimize it over time. So we'll try to bring internally, I'll say a diligent screen to where we put capital and to where we don't as we move ahead."

I don't see why you need to offer variable annuity to complement that. And even in long term care, that's a sector where most are affected, pretty much all of the majors have pulled out. And if we look at the in force block, it's clearly not earning target profitability since the day you brought Genworth public. Every analyst meeting, you talked about getting it repriced, right? We're still here with having to put rate hikes up.

Because it looks like you actually made pretty solid progress in a number of your other businesses, whether they be MI related or retirement protection.

We made important progress in a number of key areas in the third quarter while navigating a tough U.S mortgage insurance environment.
International earnings showed strong growth with improvement across our Canadian, Australian and European mortgage insurance platform supported by better economic conditions in Canada and Australia. We also saw a turn in Lifestyle Protection earnings reflecting lower losses and improved pricing.
U.S Mortgage Insurance had a disappointing quarter from the standpoint of the move we made to strengthen Florida reserves. At the same time we continue to experience favorable trends across other areas led by delinquencies and loan modifications.
Specifically, we saw improving trends in delinquencies which outperformed expectations of a seasonal increase demonstrating additional burn through of exposures associated with the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books.
Turning to loss mitigation activities, the bulk of benefits now come from loan modifications as expected with clearly improved rates of redefault. Looking ahead, we believe servicer based loan modification programs should continue to ramp up as only a few servicers are hitting full stride here and we will work intently to support these.
We’re also seeing gradual improvement in the size of the private mortgage insurance market and competitiveness versus the FHA. However, the dynamic of late-stage delinquencies being tougher to cure with more going to foreclosure is real. So we have to keep working to deal with it and work to offset it.
Pat will provide more color across these areas in his remarks.
Turning to retirement and protection we had mixed performance. Sales were strong particularly in life and long-term care insurance along with positive net flows in wealth management. Earnings were solid in Long Term Care Insurance but remained lower in Life Insurance impacted by the higher lapses we’ve been seeing on certain term policies, higher life reserved funding cost and sound mortality performance but at levels not as strong as experienced in the prior periods.
This morning I want to focus on four topics, first highlight two examples of how we are driving growth and investing in targeted areas, second update you on actions we continue to take to improve in-force performance, most recently focused on our old black of Long Term Care Insurance, third provide an update on the housing regulatory front and finally provide perspectives on our medium term return on equity targets.
Let’s begin with where we are investing in key growth areas that support earnings and return expansion. As a reminder we see organic growth from our existing business platforms as our biggest opportunity complemented by two additional strategies, targeted, small, bolt-on acquisition opportunities that fit with existing platforms and in particular at Wealth Management and elective entry in the new international markets which we think have strong future growth and profit potential where we bring established capabilities.
To drive organic growth we focus on three fundamental agendas introducing refreshed or innovative products, driving distribution, penetration and expansion and improving value-added support services.
Our new life insurance line that is more capital efficient has reflected all aspects of this organic growth agenda and it shows in the sales numbers. The product line has been totally redesigned with a few more additions to come, producer penetration is up and we have supported this with improved application processing and underwriting approaches.
We also saw an example of how we’re using targeted small acquisitions to accelerate growth in our Wealth Management business. Here we announced plans to acquire Altegris, a specialist in alternative investments, which will broaden our offerings to financial advisors, this is a great opportunity to enhance our competitiveness with advisors and their high net-worth clients.
Turning to actions we take to improve the in-force performance, you saw the benefits come through more clearly this quarter of our re-pricing and contract restructuring actions in Lifestyle protection.
In addition, last week we announced plans to increase rates on two of our older blocks of long-term care insurance policies, which would improve the overall earnings profile in that line. This is our second price increase on these blocks of business. Similar to the actions we took in 2007, we plan to increase price responsibly, in this case by 18% and are taking this action based on the lower termination experience we have seen in these older policies.
The price increase will affect about 25% of the premium base which will feather in the earnings starting in 2011 with the full impact seen in 2012. Going forward Genworth will continue to look for opportunities to improve the performance profile of our older books of business.
Turning to regulatory developments, a dialog around housing policy reform in the United States picked up steam in the quarter and included, a role should exists for the GSEs and whether they are better designs for such entities, the importance of conservative mortgage underwriting, the role of first time homeownership, the importance of securitization to the housing market and implementation of the qualified residential mortgage provision of the Dodd-Frank bill.
The Treasury Department, regulatory bodies including HUD and FHFA and legislators are central to this debate. The outcome of which remains open, HUD will determine the path forward for housing finance.
The mortgage insurance industry and Genworth are participating actively in Washington providing important data and perspectives in this dialog as well as working to shape the policies that will be implemented in coming years.
Throughout these discussions, the value of private mortgage insurance and the role of mortgage insurers were highlighted and clearly reinforced, which should be a positive for the industry.
Finally, turning to ROE targets, we assess the progress we are making towards our medium term operating return on equity targets on an ongoing basis and in view of the current environment.
In that context, we are taking a more cautious view towards the timing of reaching our interim total business operating ROE goal of 10% initially targeted for 2012. We will provide a more detailed view into our earnings drivers and return targets at our December Investor Day.
At this point, we expect at achieving the overall 10% ROE level will take longer than previously estimated given the dynamics and trends to-date in the U.S. platforms with business segment level ROE showing different ranges of performance.
We have seen good earnings momentum in growth and returns in the international segment supported by recovery or stabilization in these markets. International has certainly tracked our expectations. Retirement and Protection earnings have stabilized, but have not yet transitioned to the growth rate we want to see.
The overall dynamics in U.S. Mortgage Insurance remain reasonably within expectations, but there are several market dynamics outside our control that impact market recovery timing, including recent foreclosure trends, activity around foreclosure suspensions, softness in home prices and the sizeable inventory overhang.
We still view 2011 as a transitional year from an earnings perspective in U.S Mortgage Insurance. However, this specific timing of our return to sustained quarterly profit is less clear given these market dynamics, so we must see how these play off. In sum, we look forward to giving you a more detailed update in December.
Now before I turn it over to Pat, I wanted to comment on some management shifts we communicated during the quarter. As you know Pam Schutz had announced retirement earlier this year effective February 2011, so we were pleased to announce the Pat Kelleher will be transitioning to lead the Retirement and Protection segment. Pat has been instrumental at Genworth, navigated the financial crisis and will bring his strong finance, product management and actuarial background to the segment at an important time.
We are in the midst of an external search for a new Chief Financial Officer and in the interim, Pat will remain in his current position and work with Pam on the Retirement and Protection leadership transition. We were also pleased to announce that Kevin Walker will join us as CFO of Retirement and Protection replacing Kelly Groh, who will be leading our investment portfolio management as part of Ron Joelson’s investment team.
With that let me turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at quarter. Pat?

This morning I’ll focus on four areas. First, sales and earnings growth in several businesses; second, loss trends in U.S Mortgage Insurance; third, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on earnings; and finally, our capital management progress.
Let me start with sales growth. We’re seeing good sales growth in several key areas, particularly in our leadership lines in Retirement and Protection and in Mortgage Insurance in Canada.
In Life Insurance, sales of our new, more capital-efficient Colony Term UL and GenGuard UL products had strong sequential increases since the launch in late 2009. We remain number one in total life policies sold through the BGA channel and continued to make good progress expanding sales of larger face amount policies.
Turning to Long Term Care, individual long-term care sales increased 36% versus the prior year and here we are seeing a rebound following declines in industry sales in early 2009. Growth has been driven by independent channel, and wealth management had a sixth straight quarter of positive net flows which combined with favorable market returns in the most recent quarter brought assets under management to over $21 billion.
We saw a mixed sales growth in the International segment related to differences in market conditions in Canada, Australia and Europe. In Canada, flow new insurance written increased 45% year-over-year as overall mortgage market growth was robust. The market view is that originations have been loaded somewhat towards the first part of the year in anticipation of a rate increase and a sales tax increase both of which occurred in July.
Although sales continued at a stronger pace than we expected in the current quarter they declined each month and we expect sales to continue to flow in the fourth quarter as normal seasonal pattern flow origination.
In Australia, flow new insurance written declined 36% year-over-year driven by lower levels of government support to first time homebuyers; a decline in the high loan to value mortgage originations, and increased interest rates beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009.
In Lifestyle Protection, we’ve seen the impact of lower consumer lending and have seen sales stabilize over the past three quarters. We do not see conditions improving this year and we’re continuing execution of previously announced strategies to increase sales by broadening our distribution focus and more effectively mining in force books of business.
Finally in U.S. mortgage insurance, we had sequential growth in new insurance written. Here, we are seeing clear indications that business has been gradually coming back to the private mortgage insurance market from the FHA, but at a slower rate than we’d like to see.
Now turning to earnings growth, Long Term Care earnings were up 13% from a year ago. New business growth and improved investment income more than offset higher claims in the old block.
As Mike mentioned, we are implementing an in force rate increase on a portion of the old block which should improve future earnings. And given the Long Term Care market environment and recent competitor actions, we’ve been getting more questions in the areas of interest rate exposure, new business, underwriting risk and reserving practices and given this I thought it might be useful to address these points.
First, regarding the interest rate exposure, we actively hedge forward cash flow reinvestment risks and about 70% of our future cash flows on in force business over the next 10 years will receive yield enhancements from these programs if interest rates remain at low level.
With respect to new business, we are planning to reduce interest rate yield assumptions in our next-generation of products, continuing a trend that started several years ago. We believe our pricing and hedging strategies are appropriate for managing interest rate risk associated with our Long Term Care business.
Second, regarding new business; despite near-term market disruptions, we believe, the overwhelming consumer need and our approach to providing a robust portfolio of product solutions and broad distribution access will enable us to continue to grow sales.
Third, regarding underwriting, we have good practices in place which based on our deep experience we evaluate and improve on a continuous basis. We’ve demonstrated stable trends in the interest adjusted loss ratio and the loss ratio on the new block has been consistently favorable relative to pricing. In fact, we gave up sales to competitors to stick with our focus on preferred risks such as healthy couple.
Fourth, we actively review emerging loss ratios and trends as part of our reserving process and supplement this with independent third party reviews. As a result, we reflect emerging trends as they are identified. Our reserving process provides for appropriate adjustments and refinements on a timely basis. The point is, this is not something we only do every few years.
Now, let’s turn to retirement income, including fee and spread annuities where earnings also improved reflecting the benefits of improving markets and better asset liability matching. I should note that in this quarter the earnings were reduced by $6 million due to a valuation refinement impacting DAC amortization and death benefit cost.
In our Life Insurance business we’ve seen lower year-over-year earnings for the past few quarters. Here three factors are influencing results. First, mortality, while below pricing is above the very favorable levels we saw in 2009 and specifically the term insurance mortality ratio was 94% of original pricing levels in the current quarter compared to 85% in the third quarter of last year. This reduced quarterly earnings by approximately $14 million compared to the prior year.
Second, we faced continued pressure from higher funding cost for the XXX securitizations. Now, while this did not materially impact the year-over-year comparison as funding cost increased back in 2008, it has muted overall earnings levels. We will look opportunistically to improve the funding cost of these programs over the longer term.
Finally, consistent with the second quarter, term loss related costs were up compared with prior year. This is primarily related to the higher lapses at the end of the level premium period on 10-year term insurance.
So, as we look ahead, we would expect the near-term run rate for quarterly earnings to remain in the low-to-mid $30 million range, subject to normal quarterly fluctuations with the new business gradually lifting the earnings profile.
International earnings growth was strong, aided by improved market conditions in Canada and Australia and an improved earnings profile in Europe. Sequentially, market conditions in Canada and Australia were stable.
As we look ahead, we are mindful of the earnings patterns associated with the single premium financial model. Specifically, that premium recognition parallel for the timing of loss emergence with most premiums recognized in year’s two through five.
In Canada, we will see the premium recognition on the large 2007 book decline in 2011 which will pressure next year’s revenues. This will rebound over time as lager books of business are underwritten. In contrast, we anticipate moderate premium growth in Australia during 2011 which is aided by our larger 2009 book.
In Lifestyle Protection, earnings improved nicely for three reasons, first loss experience has improved with the loss ratio declining to 17% in the quarter compared to 27% a year ago. Second, the in force pricing and distribution contract changes we made in 2009 and earlier this year are providing the lift we expected. Finally, Lifestyle Protection earnings benefited from about $7 million of lower taxes in the quarter.
Looking ahead and excluding the favorable tax item, we would expect earnings improvement overall with some quarterly choppiness.
Turning to U.S. Mortgage Insurance, as we expected and discussed last quarter, earnings were below the levels we saw in the first half of the year and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter.
Let’s take a closer look at third quarter loss development starting with the biggest driver. $85 million pre-tax of reserving strengthening on delinquent loans in Florida. A few dynamics contributed to this result. Aging and delinquencies, lower loss mitigation savings from lower loan modification versus the rest of the country and higher foreclosure starts and paid claims during the quarter.
As Alicia mentioned, we posted some supplementary materials on our Web site that walk through these dynamics in more details. I’ll offer two observations relating to these development. First, Florida has relatively high percentage of investor-owned properties, 16% versus 6% in our overall portfolio in the U.S. As a result, these loans can be more difficult to modify.
Second, there are two services in Florida, where we saw a more dramatic increase in foreclosure starts during the quarter. These services, in general, are having relatively low success rates in completing modification and therefore, more of these loans have proceeded to foreclosure. We are actively working with the servicers to improve modification results.
Looking past the Florida reserve strengthening, we saw results that were overall consistent with expected trends, particularly given the seasonal developments that we anticipated. Total flow delinquencies decreased 3%, primarily from growth in paid claims and lower new delinquencies.
Modifications increased and this was offset by earlier than expected declines in rescission activity. As a result of these dynamics, we’re seeing an overall shift in the delinquency inventory from early stage delinquencies to later stage.
We added a schedule to the financial supplement this quarter, which illustrates this trend. We now expect the delinquency aging to gradually increase the average reserve per delinquency as the late-stage delinquencies move through the claims process over the next several quarters, and we expect paid claims to trend up as they did this quarter.
In total, loss mitigation savings declines to $158 million in the quarter bringing the year-to-date amount to $608 million. Looking at the full year and considering the lower level of new delinquencies, we now expect to be at approximately $750 million below the $847 million in 2009.
We continue to expect savings to be more heavily weighted to loan modifications from rescissions, and we are seeing encouraging trends and re-default rates on modified loans with current re-default experience of around 30% compared with much higher historic re-defaults on modifications.
To wrap on U.S. Mortgage Insurance, while we are encouraged by trends and new delinquency development and early signs of improved new business, unclear headwinds remain. Our self-contained capital plans remains within expectations. The risk to capital level is right in line with our capital planning assumptions as these plans were based on a relatively conservative outlook. We will continue to manage prudently through our challenging mortgage market.
Next I wanted to review the potential impact to Genworth of a prolonged period of low interest rates. For context, our mix of Housing and Protection and Retirement business positions us well to manage a period of low interest rate on a relative basis.
Within our Protection and Retirement businesses, our product mix has relatively small exposures to interest-sensitive deposit type liabilities. Our largest exposure to deposit type liabilities is our single premium deferred annuity portfolio with approximately $11 billion of account values.
Here our assets are matched with our liabilities from a duration perspective with less than one quarter mismatch. This means that we’re well positioned to preserve spreads and protect against the impacts of lower lapses in our low interest rate environment.
That said, our longer duration insurance product have exposure to changes in interest rates over time. Our biggest such exposure is in our Long Term Care insurance products, which I touched on earlier, where the duration of the liabilities is around 25 years making it impractical to match closely with appropriate assets. Here we’ve enhanced our asset liability matching strategies using derivative to loss and future reinvestment rates that are consistent with our pricing requirements.
In total, these positions are worth approximately $2.1 billion as of September 30. They reside in the balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive income.
Given this, it is clear that a portion of future cash flows in long term care are unhedged and a prolonged low interest rate environment would impact GAAP earnings, if rates and credit spreads were to remain at current levels, I would not expect the material impact on Long Term Care earnings this year or next. The impact would build over three years to about $20 to $30 million after-tax impact to GAAP earnings in year three.
Turning now to capital management, we are pleased with the sound capital ratios at our operating companies. We are successfully executing our plans to meet and provide for obligations at the holding company. We currently have $1.3 billion of holding company cash and short term securities; we received $182 million in dividends from our operating companies during the quarter.
In total, we expect about $350 million in operating company dividends during 2010. As we look to 2011, we see multiple sources and good flexibility for holding company dividends from our operating companies.
In sum, our operating businesses remain well positioned to support operating and parent holding company capital plans going forward.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on four levers to drive improvements in our returns; profitable new business growth; optimizing investment performance; ongoing risk management, including loss mitigation and finally, effective capital management. We look forward to providing you with a more detailed update on our business and financial targets at our December Investor Day.
With that, I’ll open it up to your questions.

What we really saw happening in Florida is the reserve strengthening was based on our recent observed experience that we witnessed in the quarter and basically we more heavily weighted and reflected our provisioning for that recent observed experience. Unlike the rest of the country where as modification and cure development in earlier staged delinquencies, based on our recent experience and then the aging challenge of loans throughout the rest of the country, those largely offset themselves from the rest of the country.
In the state of the Florida that was not the case. Florida had a much higher level of foreclosure development we saw in the third quarter and we saw rescission activity trailing off in Florida but its impact has been quite strong in the first two quarters of the year. Our foreclosure development in Florida in the second quarter, for example actually had declined from what it had been in the first quarter, and so we saw a reversal of that in the fourth quarter.
So I’d say what we did is we reflected the actual experience we saw. Rescissions declined more than we expected, modification across the rest of the country were generally very consistent with what our expectations were, but you didn’t get the same level of modifications in the state of Florida.
So, when I think about further pressure to your question to reserve development in Florida, again we actually strengthen our reserves to more heavily reflect that recent experience, so we think we’re adequately reserved there, but we’re going to need to watch the observed experience in the quarters ahead and see how this continues to play out. But at this point of time based on our best estimate and we think we’re right on point and we don’t really see any other states right now that have many similar characteristics.

You could see that continue to trend upward until those losses come off the back end of that inventory and you start taking down the more heavily reserve delinquent loan population.
So, I would expect to see some incremental pressure to that number over time. The modifications and the work on that is having a higher impact on loans that are in earlier stage and therefore have less reserves per delinquency up against them. So that will continue to pressure the lower delinquency levels and so on a mix basis you’re going to have some pressure to that number until we get over the HAMP on this paid claim basis.

The experience we’re seeing right now as we work into the fourth quarter in a period where normally you’d have a lot more seasonality headwind. We are seeing that it looks like that credit burnout exist there and the new delinquencies while are still up or not up, as a level we would expect them to be up.
So I think a lot of it is based on in this burnout is really going to be dependent on what happens with this foreclosure issue we’re looking into, whether that holds things up a little bit in terms of ultimately playing through and all the claims curing. I would expect that to be somewhere in early 2011, but there is a lot of uncertainty in the market right now in terms of when are all these foreclosures going to be perfected. Or are we again have to restart some of them and run through it again, but I think that’s really the level of uncertainties that we’re facing into.

I think it’s pretty clear, this was a very poor quarter, but there are larger issues here that I think you need to address. Frankly the only accomplishment that this management’s team contribute point to is the survival of this company which I don’t mean to minimize, but otherwise this management team has overseen a massive destruction of shareholder value. In fact at the current price to book Genworth is selling at a steep discount to both MGIC and PMI, the pure-play MIs. This is probably because this company does not meet its cost of capital and any of its businesses.
In other words, the market currently is describing negative value to your non-MI businesses. A pretty astonishing statement and I don’t get any sense of urgency from this management’s team as to how this is all going to be addressed. To keep going down the current road seems to me a complete waste of time. Clearly, the best use of capital for this company is to buy back stock when it is at discount, less than 40% of book value. The ROE on that activity is multiple higher than any new business you can write.
So it seems to me, we can go down a couple of roads, number one, you could shutdown businesses and use resulting excess capital to buy back stock or you can give us a roadmap and the time schedule which we’re going to hold you too as to when each of your businesses will achieve at least its cost of capital. I want you to understand that my patience, but the patience of your shareholder is not infinite and my patience is just about done.
And I would like a response to my comments and one other thing, at the beginning of this conference call Mr. Fraizer said that they might do bolt-on acquisitions; do not do that. Your stock is selling at less than 40% of book value, you do a bolt-on acquisitions and I will wage a proxy battle immediately to throw you out of here. Now, I will like some response.

So, we’ll try to make sure that in that forum, we can show all the details and leverage that you and other investors can see behind that one. Number two, if you get to the mortgage insurance business, clearly the transition we’re going through is a frustrating one and I share your frustration on that, but I think we’re doing all of the right things to bring that business back.
Now, I can’t explain for you the difference in valuation if I look at that on a segment versus some other public comparables. I’m happy to have that deeper discussion on the reasons for that. We have perspectives on that separately, but there is a business where we did move early and others followed to deal with loss mitigation activities to re-price business for the risk, so that as you put on new business you can churn that business.
We’re currently seeing a very choppy to say the least third quarter set of data come in as Kevin outlined that as I said that is a business we will again see transition back earning more than a cost of capital. I think we have a timing issue there given some of the factors I highlighted specifically in the market.
Thirdly, then you come back to Retirement and Protection and we have put a number of lines, such as our institutional area into run off to basically harvest capital from them. We do, as you look at capital there, have maintained capital to support the ratings and the sound level of growth not too much and too little, maintain appropriate risk offers and now I am jumping to a bit of an enterprise comment, optimize the capital structure as we look through the maturities we have in 2011 and 2012.
So let me just finish then on the Life business. We have to continue at the line levels taking the actions we are. We’ll show you the progress in Long Term Care and you’ve seen us move on with pricing actions there and the dynamics of the old book versus the new book. The old book is about 35% of the book. The new book is now at 65% in the path of those dynamics. The Life area, because of the two factors that the Pat has touched upon, has certainly have been below our performance expectations, but that’s also why we totally changed the nature of the product to not make it capital consumptive as the old and they have very different margins.
Now, let’s get to your point on the use of any excess capital and what’s the appropriate use of that. First, if I look at the map, for example and use $100 million to repurchase shares, you would get about 5 basis point lift on today’s ROE and I look at that quite carefully. I would agree with you that, first of all, acquisitions should not be a major priority or any subsequent priority for the company beyond what it’s executing with organic growth and optimizing our capital structure and maintaining appropriate risk buffers.
The one you did see this quarter was a small a tuck-in one, there is not a pipeline of those per se, but in the wealth management business that’s the one area I’d pointed towards along with where we’ve selectively put less than $25 million of capital looking at a few new markets in international mortgage insurance that we think can be the next Canada and Australia, but it has to be very modest, because after that, I would agree as I look at any excess re-deployable capital, the math is compelling on a share repurchase, when we look at the book valuation.
But right now if you step away and you look at our capital versus rating agency requirements or regulatory requirements, you’d see about a $1.2 billion level over those hurdles. We would hold basically if you look at U.S. Mortgage Insurance would hold the portion associated with that to navigate this period as a risk buffer. We would hold what we have in the Life business, similarly for both risk buffers and just to operate the business appropriately at a single A rating and the rest of that capital sits in the international.
As Pat as noted, there will be dividends that come in from international through the holding company, but some of those dividends will be used to address the 2011 and 2012 maturities and you’ll see our debt to capital structure come from sort of the mid 20 range, right down to the 20% to 21% range, which is in line with targeted coverage ratios and where we need to be. So, if there is capital that we generate beyond that as we go forward, your point due noted and accepted, that if you have that excess capital buying shares is a compelling way to deploy that capital and you should run your other businesses for recovery.
So, as we get to the December Investor Day we will certainly endeavor to walk you through with good visibility, not only each of those segments, but also the holding company, walk you through the levers and continue to take your views as well as other investor views and execute.

Kevin, it seems to me that the reason that we have this issue in Florida, and quite frankly across the whole country is that a development occurred that surprised you. You’ve said repeatedly, thank you for being clear on this, that rescissions came in lower than expected in Florida, indeed lower than expected across the country and it’s only because you have the offset, I suppose in the form of higher than expected modifications that you didn’t have in earnings hit elsewhere. Now, I can understand why this is going to happen, this is not a perfect science, I appreciate that, but you guys have been in this business for decades and reserves will be short, reserves will be redundant no different from a bank having shortage in redundancy of reserves, property casualty company and so forth.

We endeavored and continue to try and improve upon that and that’s one area specifically where we will continue to work as a management team at improving our visibility in demand.
Secondly, we are working very closely with those same servicers on working to improve the modification benefits and the outcome on the various workout programs that those servicers are working on. As you can imagine, like sort of across the board and across the country if you look at overall servicing performance, different servicers have different level of traction. They are getting against this overall modification effort. So we’re working very hard to target the opportunities for loss mitigation and for loan modifications, in particular, with those servicers that are a little bit below the average.
Additionally, Eric, one of the things we did here in particular is, we more heavily weighted in our provisioning the actual reserve experience that we saw in this quarter. Across the entire country you are seeing improvements in the earlier stage delinquencies. So we’re very comfortable with what we’re seeing there from a development standpoint. The new delinquencies are generally flat, trending better to experience. The cures in those earlier staged delinquencies continue to develop, both through self cures as well as modifications. We’ll continue to have ageing, as things aged through this population.
So I think one of the real challenges here is really having clear visibility as loans move from each successive stage of delinquency pattern and that’s something we’re endeavoring to try and get a better handle on with the servicers. I don’t look at this as some huge mistake on the quarter. Clearly, we’re disappointed with the results in the quarter, but when I look back at what we had been observing in Florida in the first two quarters of the year, our provisioning was consistent with what we had observed in those quarters. So, we’re trying to modify it now.
We think we’ve addressed that with what we did in the fourth quarter. If you look at the supplemental investor materials that we shared on our Web site, you can see how Florida truly does stand out as an outlier compared to the rest of the states on there. Nobody has that same unique level of circumstances that we’ve seen in Florida. Florida has got some unique characteristics it’s a big state, it’s one of the most problematic states in the entire mortgage industry. It’s got a higher investor level of content in terms of the loans and those are more challenging to modify and so as a team, we’ll look to continue to address that and incorporate that into our expectations going forward.

So here is my question, what is your sense of what this repeated multiple price increases are going to do for the demand of the product. Isn’t it possible that the senior population looking at this across the board repeated increases will say, this isn’t helping me, if I buy this product and the industry is repeatedly hitting me with price increases, I am really not taking an issue off the table here. What’s going to happen to the demand for this product and how are those conversations going at the agent’s customer level right now?

What we saw in that was a shock lapse of less than 1%, we would expect again this increase is the second round on two of the four older blocks that we addressed in 2007. The amount again, that we announced is 18% that we’ll be requesting with the Departments of Insurance. We would not expect that shock lapse to be again much more than 1% or so.
The discussions with the customer, when you are looking at a comparable set of benefits of the price of the product that they are buying today, even with that 8% to 12%, we announced back in 2007 additionally 18%, that same package of benefits that is purchased on the market today is what they’re paying on the older blocks would be roughly 20% cheaper than the new priced products.
As we think about the in-force rate increases, we are looking at this in a responsible way. We think that the seniors that purchased the products historically are still getting great value in that product and the products that we’re selling on the market today, again as we look at our assumptions, we believe our priced for relative stability.
One thing I would point out that in 2001-2002, the NAIC model regulations required a level of rate stabilization. So, all carriers that are filing products today are approaching their pricing with, I think a more conservative stance. We’re seeing that the in-force rate increases announced are being accepted by the consumers. They are paying a higher premium and still have good value.

Isn’t the real strategy here that you need to shrink this company and focus on your key lines, whatever you decide those are, rather than playing in things like Wealth Management, where Genworth is never going to be a material player or it’s never going to contribute the material amount to earnings at least over the next five years?

I’ll just walk through. If you look at the Life and Long Term Care area, as we declared that we have leadership in both in the middle or mainstream market in Life Insurance and if you look at the bulk of our policies, they are under $1 million face size. In fact, the vast majorities were under 500,000 and we’re penetrating in both segments. So we’ve made a very clear call there and we’ve made a very clear call in making sure that we leverage our long term care experience. We have appropriate and profitable business there.
The wealth management business has actually grown nicely. I understand we can have different views, but that is third area that we concentrated on because of the shift to advisors and we’ve seen a lot of advisor dynamics moving to independent platforms that we serve. We have taken a much narrower stance and continue to evaluate the optimum participation in the annuity area, recognizing that some of our distribution values selling more than one product and that is a dialog with distribution.
We’re able to leverage our distribution expense and spread it because of those multiple products as opposed to if you are a monoline in that area. But there will be the appropriate capital give to the leadership areas and that capital has been taken away from the other areas as we work through that U.S. Life strategy, which is playing out but for the drag in the older blocks that Pat talked about, lapsing off dynamics around that.
Internationally, in Mortgage Insurance, I’m upset when you look at Canada and Australia and the way those platforms not only perform but move through and we pulled back from a number of markets we were starting to explore to concentrate on those leadership areas, while selectively planting some seeds. I guess we probably have a different view on the Lifestyle Protection business because of how we see the market and it sounds like we should make sure that we do a good job of laying that out. I view that overtime as more of a complement to a protection value proposition.
When you look at the nature of the risks, the underwriting, the actuarial support that we leverage and I like the diversification it gives you in the protection area versus the U.S. market. So I think it’s more than just being classified as a credit insurance business, but we will, as we move through, are executing our strategy. Of course, look at our portfolio and make sure that our portfolio mix evolves, so that not only are we trying to rebuild value but we optimize it over time. So we hope try to bring, certainly, I’ll say a diligent screen to where we put capital and where we don’t as we move ahead.

I mean, managed money, Genworth is never going to be a player in, okay. In variable annuities, you are not and I guess it’s very difficult, I mean the market perceives you as a specialty writer if it’s in Long Term Care, perhaps Life. I don’t see why you need to offer variable annuity to complement that and even in Long Term Care, that’s a sector where most of, in fact pretty much all the majors have pulled out and if we look at the in force block, it’s clearly not earning target profitability since the day you bought Genworth public, every analyst meeting you’ve talked about getting it re-priced, right? We’re still here with having to put rate hikes up. If Long Term Care, is your core line maybe it needs a lot more attention and you need to get out of some of these other businesses, pay down the debt and strengthen this balance sheet.

That said let me just take a look at what happened in the quarter at this 263% loss ratio. If you back out of Florida, you’re still at 205 and I know seasonally you see a pick-up, but in the prior two quarters you’re at 138, 141. So, seasonality wise, at worst I would have expected maybe 150 or 160. And then you mentioned that the two servicers, they were inefficient. I would have assumed that you would have been aware of that inefficiency.
And secondly, you mentioned foreclosures came down earlier in this call in the second quarter. Maybe that was a sign that things could actually get worse not that your provisions was spot on. So, my question is, I want to have confidence in Genworth going forward. I want to make sure that you guys have the ability to get it right.

Number one our gross paid claims increased in the quarter about $133 million. The total gross change and reserves from the quarter was $51 million. Offsetting that we had some continued benefit from captives of about $12 million in the quarter and another $3 million or $4 million of some bulk losses that were totaled within our expectations. That in aggregate is what drove the overall change. When I think about a strengthening provision in Florida, while the rest of the country actually was largely performing in line with what our expectations were. Overall, cures in the third quarter were downward pressured consistent with what you think from overall seasonality.
On our last call, we said we were cautious about what was going to play out in the fourth quarter as cure rates generally are pressured during that quarter. The acceleration in foreclosures was something that these loans are going to eventually have to move through the further claims. Foreclosure accelerations were up in total about 35% across our entire book. So there were certainly issues with that. Now we have the further cloudiness over the overall foreclosure activity and that is something we’re simply trying to parse through to get our best handle on it, so that we can provide better clarity, better visibility to everybody in terms of our expectations.
But at the end of the day, we saw expectations in the quarter that were generally in line with what we would have thought. We’re seeing the benefit on the earlier claim term delinquencies, we’re seeing some ageing pressure on the older but nowhere near what we saw in the State of Florida. So we believe based up on our best estimate of where we are at right now, that we have that addressed. We do not see that we have another hot state issue like that out there based upon expectations. We’re going to certainly have to continue to work on modifications with the servicers because that’s still our key focus of our loss mitigation effort.
And then the last point I just want to remind you of is, as we’ve declared throughout the cycle, when after our investigation and rescission process barely early on, we received the benefit of that in our previous periods. We put most of that behind us as we work through it and eventually as we expected that’s going to trail off towards the balance of this year. That came in a little faster than what was expected but we don’t have a lot of expectation for significant benefit from that going forward into 2011.
So that’s very in line with where we are right now. Florida was an unique animal and the size of the risk there, adjusted and compared to other states is higher. 65% of the loan is there and are in a later stage of delinquency versus a much lower level of about 45% or 47% in the rest of the country. We think we’ve accounted for it and we’ll continue to do our best job that continue to give you clarity and hopefully, provide more comfort to you that this won’t be a repeat performance.

We made important progress in a number of key areas in the third quarter while navigating a tough U.S. mortgage insurance environment. International earnings showed strong growth, with improvement across our Canadian, Australian and European mortgage insurance platforms, supported by better economic conditions in Canada and Australia. 
We also saw a turn in Lifestyle Protection earnings, reflecting lower losses and improved pricing. U.S. Mortgage Insurance had a disappointing quarter from the standpoint of the move we made to strengthen forwarded reserves. At the same time, we continue to experience favorable trends across other areas lead by delinquencies and loan modifications. Specifically, we saw improving trends in delinquencies, which outperformed expectations of a seasonal increase, demonstrating additional burn-through of exposures associated with the 2005, 2006 and 2007 books.
Turning to loss mitigation activities, the bulk of benefits now come from loan modifications as expected, with clearly improved rates of redefault. Looking ahead, we believe servicer-based loan modification programs should continue to ramp up, as only a few servicers are hitting full-stride here. And we will work intently to support these. And we're also seeing gradual improvement in the size of the private mortgage insurance market and competitiveness versus the FHA. 
However, the dynamic of late-stage delinquencies being tougher to cure with more going to foreclosure is real. So we have to keep working to deal with it and work to offset it. 
Pat will provide more color across these areas in his remarks.
Turning to Retirement and Protection, we had mixed performance. Sales were strong, particularly in life and long term care insurance, along with positive net flows in wealth management. Earnings were solid in long term care insurance but remained lower in life insurance, impacted by the higher lapses we've been seeing on certain term policies, higher life reserve funding costs and sound mortality performance, but at levels not as strong as experienced in the prior periods.
This morning, I want to focus on four topics: first, highlight two examples of how we are driving growth and investing in targeted areas; second, update you on actions we continue to take to improve in force performance, most recently focused on our old block of long term care insurance; third, provide an update on the housing regulatory front; and finally, provide perspectives on our medium-term return on equity targets.
Let's begin with where we are investing in key growth areas that support earnings and return expansion. As a reminder, we see organic growth from our existing business platforms as our biggest opportunity, complemented by two additional strategies: targeted, small bolt-on acquisition opportunities that fit with existing platforms, and in particular, at wealth management; and elective entry into new international markets, which we think have strong future growth and profit potential where we bring established capabilities. 
To drive organic growth, we focus on three fundamental agendas: introducing refreshed or innovative products, driving distribution penetration and expansion and improving value-added support services. Our new life insurance line that is more capital-efficient has reflected all aspects of this organic growth agenda. And it shows in the sales numbers. The product line has been totally redesigned with a few more additions to come, producer penetration is up, and we have supported this with improved application processing and underwriting approaches. 
We also saw an example of how we're using targeted, small acquisitions to accelerate growth in our Wealth Management business. Here we announced plans to acquire Altegris, a specialist in alternative investments, which will broaden our offerings to financial advisors. This is a great opportunity to enhance our competitiveness with advisors and their high net worth clients.
Turning to actions we take to improve in force performance. You saw the benefits come through more clearly this quarter of our repricing and contract restructuring actions in Lifestyle Protection. In addition, last week we announced plans to increase rates on two of our older blocks of long term care insurance policies, which would improve the overall earnings profile on that line. 
This is our second price increase on these blocks of business. Similar to the actions we took in 2007, we plan to increase price responsibly, in this case by 18%, and are taking this action based on the lower termination experience we have seen in these older policies. 
The price increase will affect about 25% of the premium base, which will tether into earnings starting in 2011, with the full impact seen in 2012. Going forward, Genworth will continue to look for opportunities to improve the performance profile of our older books of business.
Turning to regulatory developments. The dialogue around housing policy reform in the United States picked up steam in the quarter and included what role should exist for the GSEs and whether there are better designs for such entities, the importance of conservative mortgage underwriting, the role of first-time homeownership, the importance of securitization to the housing market and implementation of the qualified residential mortgage provision of the Dodd-Frank bill. 
The Treasury Department, regulatory bodies including HUD [Housing and Urban Development] and FHFA, and the legislators are central to this debate, the outcome of which remains open but will determine the path forward for housing finance. The mortgage insurance industry and Genworth are participating actively in Washington, providing important data and perspectives in this dialogue, as well as working to shape the policies that will be implemented in coming years. Throughout these discussions, the value of private mortgage insurance and the role of mortgage insurers were highlighted and clearly reinforced, which should be a positive for the industry. 
Finally, turning to ROE target. We assess the progress we are making towards our medium-term operating return on equity targets on an ongoing basis and in view of the current environment. In that context, we are taking a more cautious view towards the timing of reaching our interim total business operating ROE goal of 10% initially targeted for 2012. 
We will provide a more detailed view into our earnings drivers and return targets at our December Investor Day. At this point, we expect that achieving the overall 10% ROE level will take longer than previously estimated, given the dynamics and trends to date in the U.S. platforms, with business segment-level ROEs showing different ranges of performance. 
We have seen good earnings momentum and growth in returns in the International segment supported by recovery or stabilization in these markets. International has certainly tracked our expectations. 
Retirement and Protection earnings have stabilized but have not yet transitioned to the growth rate we want to see. The overall dynamics in U.S. Mortgage Insurance remain reasonably within expectations, but there are several market dynamics outside our control that impact market recovery timing, including recent foreclosure trends, activity around foreclosure suspensions, softness in home prices and a sizable inventory overhang. We still view 2011 as a transitional year from an earnings perspective in U.S. Mortgage Insurance. However, this specific timing of a return to sustained quarterly profits is less clear, given these market dynamics, so we must see how these play out. 
In sum, we look forward to giving you a more detailed update in December. Now before I turn it over to Pat, I wanted to comment on some management shifts we communicated during the quarter. As you know, Pam Schutz had announced her retirement earlier this year, effective February 2011. So we were pleased to announce that Pat Kelleher will be transitioning to lead the Retirement and Protection segment. Pat has been instrumental as Genworth navigated the financial crisis, and will bring his strong finance, product management and actuarial background to the segment at an important time. We are in the midst of an external search for a new Chief Financial Officer, and in the interim, Pat will remain in his current position and work with Pam on the Retirement and Protection leadership transition. We were also pleased to announce that Kevin Walker will join us as CFO of Retirement and Protection, replacing Kelly Groh who will be leading our investment portfolio management as part of Ron Joelson's investment team. With that, let me turn it over to Pat for a deeper look at the quarter. Pat?"
8598029,113894684,83662,"Genworth Financial Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Genworth Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. This morning I'll focus on four areas: first, sales and earnings growth in several businesses; second, loss trends in U.S. mortgage insurance; third, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on earnings; and finally, our capit",2229,"Thanks, Mike. This morning I'll focus on four areas: first, sales and earnings growth in several businesses; second, loss trends in U.S. mortgage insurance; third, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on earnings; and finally, our capital management progress. 
Let me start with sales growth. We're seeing good sales growth trends in several key areas, particularly in our leadership lines in Retirement and Protection and in mortgage insurance in Canada. In life insurance, sales of our new, more capital-efficient Colony Term UL and GenGuard UL products had strong sequential increases since the launch in late 2009. We remain number one in total life policies sold through the BGA channel and continued to make good progress expanding sales of larger face amount policies.
Turning to long term care. Individual long term care sales increased 36% versus the prior year. And here we are seeing a rebound, following declines in industry sales in early 2009. Growth has been driven by independent channels. And wealth management had its sixth straight quarter of positive net flows which, combined with favorable market returns in the most recent quarter, brought assets under management to over $21 billion. 
We saw a mix sales growth in the International segment related to differences in market conditions in Canada, Australia and Europe. In Canada, flow new insurance written increased 45% year-over-year as overall mortgage market growth was robust. The market view is that originations have been loaded somewhat toward the first part of the year in anticipation of a rate increase and a sales tax increase, both of which occurred in July. Although sales continued at a stronger pace than we expected in the current quarter, they declined each month, and we expect sales to continue to slow in the fourth quarter as normal seasonal patterns slow origination. In Australia, flow new insurance written declined 36% year-over-year, driven by lower levels of government support to first-time homebuyers, a decline in the high loan to value mortgage originations and increased interest rates beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
In Lifestyle Protection, we've seen the impact of lower consumer lending and have seen sales stabilize over the past three quarters. We do not see conditions improving this year, and we are continuing execution of previously announced strategies to increase sales by broadening our distribution focus and more effectively mining in force books of business. Finally, in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we have sequential growth in new insurance written. Here we are seeing clear indications that business has been gradually coming back to the private mortgage insurance market from the FHA, but at a slower rate than we would like to see.
Now turning to earnings growth. Long term care earnings were up 13% from a year ago. New business growth and improved investment income more than offset higher claims in the old block. As Mike mentioned, we are implementing an in force rate increase on a portion of the old block which should improve future earnings. 
Given the long term care market environment and recent competitor actions, we've been getting more questions in the areas of interest rate exposure, new business, underwriting risk and reserving practices. And given this, I thought it might be useful to address these points. First, regarding the interest rate exposure, we actively hedged forward cash flow reinvestment risks and about 70% of future cash flows on the in force business over the next 10 years will receive yield enhancements from these programs if interest rates remain at low levels. 
With respect to new business, we are planning to reduce interest rate yield assumptions in our next generation of products, continuing a trend that started several years ago. We believe our pricing and hedging strategies are appropriate for managing interest rate risk associated with our long term care business. 
Second, regarding new business. Despite near-term market disruptions, we believe the overwhelming consumer need and our approach to providing a robust portfolio of product solutions and broad distribution access will enable us to continue to grow sales. 
And third, regarding underwriting. We have good practices in place which, based on our deep experience, we evaluate and improve on a continuous basis. We demonstrated stable trends in the interest-adjusted loss ratio, and the loss ratio on the new block has been consistently favorable relative to pricing. In fact, we gave up sales to competitors to stick with our focus on preferred risks such as healthy couples. 
And fourth, we actively review emerging loss ratios and trends as part of our reserving process and supplement this with independent third-party reviews. As a result, we reflect emerging trends as they are identified. Our reserving process provides for appropriate adjustments and refinements on a timely basis. The point is this is not something we only do every few years.
Now let's turn to retirement income, including fee and spread annuities, where earnings also improved, reflecting the benefits of improving markets and better asset liability matching. I should note that in this quarter, the earnings were reduced by $6 million due to evaluation refinement impacting DAC [deferred acquisition cost] amortization and death benefit costs. 
And in our life insurance business, we've seen lower year-over-year earnings for the past few quarters. Here, three factors are influencing results. First, mortality, while below pricing, is above the very favorable levels we saw in 2009 and specifically, the term insurance mortality ratio was 94% of original pricing levels in the current quarter, compared to 85% in the third quarter of last year. This reduced quarterly earnings by approximately $14 million compared to the prior year. 
And second, we faced continued pressure from higher funding costs, for the XXX securitizations. Now while this did not materially impact the year-over-year comparison that's funding cost increase back in 2008, it has muted overall earnings levels. We will look opportunistically to improve the funding cost of these programs over the longer term. 
And finally, consistent with the second quarter, term lapse-related costs were up compared with prior year. This is primarily related to the higher lapses at the end of the level premium period on 10-year term insurance. So as we look ahead, we would expect the near-term run rate for quarterly earnings to remain in the low- to mid-$30 million range subject to normal quarterly fluctuations, with the new business gradually lifting the earnings profile. 
International earnings growth was strong, aided by improved market conditions in Canada and Australia and an improved earnings profile in Europe. Sequentially, market conditions in Canada and Australia were stable. As we look ahead, we are mindful of the earnings patterns associated with the single premium financial model. Specifically, that premium recognition parallels the timing of loss emergence with most premiums recognized in years two through five. In Canada, we will see the premium recognition on the large 2007 book decline in 2011, which will pressure next year's revenues. This will rebound over time as larger books of business are underwritten. 
In contrast, we anticipate moderate premium growth in Australia during 2011, which is aided by a larger 2009 book. 
In Lifestyle Protection, earnings improved nicely for three reasons: first, loss experience has improved, with the loss ratio declining to 17% in the quarter compared to 27% a year ago; second, the in force pricing and distribution contract changes we made in 2009 and earlier this year are providing the lift we expected; and finally, Lifestyle Protection earnings benefited from about $7 million of lower taxes in the quarter. Looking ahead, and excluding the favorable tax item, we would expect earnings improvement overall, with some quarterly choppiness.
Turning to U.S. Mortgage Insurance. As we expected and discussed last quarter, earnings were below the levels we saw in the first half of the year, and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Let's take a closer look at third quarter loss developments, starting with the biggest driver, $85 million pretax of reserve strengthening of delinquent loans in Florida. A few dynamics contributed to this result: Aging and delinquencies; lower loss mitigation savings from lower loan modifications versus the rest of the country; and higher foreclosure starts and paid claims during the quarter. 
As Alicia mentioned, we posted some supplementary materials on our website that walk through these dynamics in more detail. I'll offer two observations relating to these developments. First, Florida has a relatively high percentage of investor-owned properties, 15% versus 6% in our overall portfolio in the U.S. As a result, these loans can be more difficult to modify. 
Second, there are two servicers in Florida where we saw a more dramatic increase in foreclosure starts during the quarter. These servicers in general are having relatively low success rates in completing modification, and therefore more of these loans have proceeded to foreclosure. We are actively working with the servicers to improve modification results. 
Looking past the Florida reserve strengthening, we saw results that were overall consistent with expected trends, particularly given the seasonal developments that we anticipated. Total flow delinquencies decreased 3%, primarily from growth in paid claims and lower new delinquencies. Modifications increased, and this was offset by earlier-than-expected declines in rescission activity. And as a result of these dynamics we’re seeing an overall shift in the delinquency inventory, from early-stage delinquencies to later stage. 
We added a schedule to the financial supplement this quarter which illustrates this trend. We now expect the delinquency aging to gradually increase the average reserve for delinquency as the late-stage delinquencies move through the claims process over the next several quarters. And we expect paid claims to trend up as they did this quarter. In total, loss mitigation savings declined to $158 million in the quarter bringing the year-to-date amount to $608 million. Looking at the full year, and considering the lower level of new delinquencies, we now expect to be at approximately $750 million below the $847 million in 2009. 
We continue to expect savings to be more heavily weighted to loan modifications from rescissions, and we are seeing encouraging trends in redefault rates on modified loans, with current redefault experience of around 30% compared with much higher historic redefaults on modifications. To wrap on U.S. Mortgage Insurance, while we are encouraged by trends in new delinquency development and early signs of improved new business, some clear headwinds remain. Our self-contained capital plans remains within expectations. The risk to capital level is right in line with our capital planning assumptions as these plans were based on a relatively conservative outlook. We will continue to manage prudently through a challenging mortgage market.
Next I wanted to review the potential impact to Genworth of a prolonged period of low interest rates. For context, our mix of housing and Protection and Retirement business positions us well to manage a period of low interest rates on a relative basis. Within our Protection and Retirement businesses, our product mix has relatively small exposures to interest-sensitive deposit-type liabilities. The largest exposure to deposit-type liabilities is our single premium deferred annuity portfolio, with approximately $11 billion of account values. 
Here, our assets are matched with our liabilities from a duration perspective with less than one quarter mismatch. This means that we're well-positioned to preserve spreads and protect against the impacts of lower lapses in a low interest rate environment. That said, all longer duration insurance products have exposure to changes in interest rates over time. Our biggest such exposure is in our long term care insurance products, which I touched on earlier, where the duration of the liabilities is around 25 years, making it impractical to match closely with appropriate assets. Here, we've enhanced our asset liability matching strategies using derivatives to lock in future reinvestment rates that are consistent with our pricing requirements. 
In total, these positions are worth approximately $2.1 billion as of September 30. They reside in the balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive income. Given this, it is clear that a portion of future cash flows in long term care are unhedged and a prolonged low interest rate environment would impact GAAP earnings. If rates and credit spreads were to remain at current levels, I would not expect a material impact on long term care earnings this year or next. The impact would build over three years to about $20 million to $30 million after tax impact to GAAP earnings in year three.
Turning now to capital management. We are pleased with the sound capital ratios at our operating companies. We are successfully executing our plans to meet and provide for obligations at the holding company. We currently have $1.3 billion of holding company cash and short-term securities. We received $182 million in dividends from our operating companies during the quarter. In total, we expect about $350 million in operating company dividends during 2010. 
As we look to 2011, we see multiple sources and good flexibility for holding company dividends from our operating companies. In sum, our operating businesses remain well-positioned to support operating and parent holding company capital plans going forward. Looking ahead, we remain focused on four levers to drive improvements in our returns: profitable new business growth; optimizing investment performance; ongoing risk management, including loss mitigation; and finally, effective capital management. We look forward to providing you with a more detailed update on our business and financial targets at our December Investor Day. With that, I'll open it up to your questions."

But there are larger issues here that I think you need to address. Frankly, the only accomplishment that this management team can truly point to is the survival of this company, which I don't mean to minimize, but otherwise, this management team has overseen a massive destruction of shareholder value. In fact, at the current price-to-book, Genworth is selling at a steep discount at both MGIC and PMI to pure-play MIs, and this is probably because this company does not meet its cost of capital in any of its businesses. In other words, the market currently is ascribing negative value to your non-MI businesses. A pretty astonishing statement, and I don't get any sense of urgency from this management team as to how this is all going to be addressed. To keep going down the current road seems to me a complete waste of time. Clearly, the best use of capital for this company is to buyback stock when it is at a discount, at less than 40% of book value. The ROE on that activity is multiples higher than any new business you can write. So it seems to me we can go down a couple of roads. Number one, you could shut down businesses and use resulting excess capital to buyback stock, or you can give us a roadmap and a time schedule which we're going to hold you to as to when each of your businesses will achieve at least its cost of capital. I want you to understand that my patience, or the patience of your shareholders, is not infinite, and my patience is just about done. And I'd like a response to my comments. And one other thing, at the beginning of this conference call, Mr. Fraser said that they might do bolt-on acquisitions. Do not do that. Your stock's at the selling, it's less than 40% of book value. You do a bolt-on acquisition, and I will wage a proxy battle immediately to throw you out here. Now, I would like a response."

Clearly, we are in a transition, with different other business segments at different stages of that transition. As we look at the International segment, a much clearer path, a much clearer performance trend. You can also see the path to not only earning your cost of capital in International but in fact, exceeding the head cost of capital. And we'll reinforce that as we lay out both where we are and where we're going in that as we walk through the Investor Day. But I think you can see that in the numbers. And I will make sure we give you -- if you look at International and where we have targeted in that segment, 15% ROE by 2012, we're tracking right to that. So we'll try to make sure that in that form, we can show all the details and leverage that you and other investors can see behind that one. Number two, if you get to the mortgage insurance business, clearly the transition we're going through is a frustrating one. And I share your frustration on that, but I think we're doing all of the right things to bring that business back. Now I can't explain for you the difference in valuation if I look at that on a segment versus some other public comparables. And I'm happy to have that deeper discussion on the reasons for that, your perspectives on that separately. But there's a business where we did move early, and others followed to deal with loss mitigation activities, to reprice business for the risk. So that as you put on new business, you can turn that business and we've currently seen a very choppy, to say the least, third quarter set of data come in, as Kevin outlined. That, as I said, that is a business we will again see transition back, turning more than a cost of capital. I think they have a timing issue there, given some of the factors I highlighted specifically in the market. Thirdly, then you come back to Retirement and Protection, and we have put a number of the lines, such as our institutional area, into runoff to basically harvest capital from them. And what we do, as you look at capital there, is maintain capital to support the ratings and a sound level of growth, not too much, not too little, maintain appropriate risk by percent, and now I'm jumping to a bit of an enterprise comment, optimize the capital structure as we look through the maturities we have in 2011 and 2012. And then it comes -- so let me just finish then on the life business. We have to continue to, at the line level taking the actions we are, we'll show you the progress in long term care, and you've seen us move with pricing actions there, and the dynamics of the old book versus the new book. The old book is about 35% of the book, the new book's now at 65% in the path of those dynamics. The life area, because of the two factors that the path has touched upon, has certainly been below our performance expectations, but that's also why we totally changed the nature of the product, to not make it capital-consumptive as the old, and to have very different margins. Now let's get to your point on the use of any excess capital, and what's the appropriate use of that. First, if I looked at the map, for example, and use $100 million to repurchase shares, you would get about a five basis point lift on today's ROE, and I look at that quite carefully. I would agree with you that, first of all, acquisitions should not be a major priority, or any subsequent priority for the company beyond what it's executing with organic growth and optimizing our capital structure and maintaining appropriate risk offers. The one you did see this quarter was a small tuck-in one. There's not a pipeline of those per se, but in the wealth management business, that's the one area I pointed towards, along with where we've selectively put less than $25 million of capital, looking at a few new markets in international mortgage insurance that we think can be the next Canada and Australia. But it has to be very modest because after that, I would agree, as I look at any excess redeployable capital, the math is compelling on a share repurchase when you look at the book valuation. So right now, if you step away and looked at our -- and you look at our capital versus rating agency requirements or regulatory requirements, you'd see about $1.2 billion level over those hurdles. We would hold -- basically, if you look at U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we'd hold the portion associated with that to navigate this period as a risk buffer. We would hold what we have in the life businesses, similarly for both risk offers and just to operate the business appropriately at a single A rating, and the rest of that capital sits in International. And as Pat has noted, there will be dividends that come in from International through the holding company, but some of those dividends will be used to address the 2011 and 2012 maturities. And you'll see our debt to capital structure, come from sort of the mid- 20% range right down to the 20% to 21% range, which is in line with targeted coverage ratios, and where we need to be. So if there's capital that we generate beyond that as we go-forward, your point's due, noted and accepted that if you have that excess capital, buying shares is a compelling way to deploy that capital and you should run the other businesses for recovery. So as we get to the December Investor Day, we will certainly endeavor to walk you through with good visibility, not only each of those segments but also the holding company, walk you through the levers and continue to take your views as well as other investor views, and execute."

And you'd said repeatedly, thank you for being clear on this, that rescissions came in lower than expected in Florida, indeed lower than expected across the country. And it's only because you have the offset, I suppose, in the form of higher-than-expected modifications that you didn't have an earnings hit elsewhere. Now I can understand why this is going to happen. This is not a perfect science, I appreciate that. But you guys have been in this business for decades, and reserves will be short, reserves will be redundant, no different from a bank having a shortage in redundancy of reserves, property/casualty company and so forth.

I'm going to presume, I certainly haven't interviewed a significant number of older people who are buying your policies, and I know that while the age group has been coming down, it's still a policy long term care insurance that is bought by older people -- I'm going to presume that like anyone who buys insurance, these older people are buying them to be relieved of risk, to get an issue off their hands. So here's my question. What is your sense of what these repeated multiple price increases are going to do for the demand of the product? I mean, isn't it possible that the senior population looking at these across-the-board repeated increases will say, ""this isn't helping me. If I buy this product and the industry is repeatedly hitting me with price increases, I'm really not taking an issue off the table here."" What's going to happen to demand for this product, and how are those conversations going at the agent-customer level right now?"

I think that's certainly something that we're concerned about at the industry. As you watch some of the original carriers and some of their pricing actions, that a couple of perspectives just on -- as we adjust premiums on this in force blocks, certainly we’re taking an approach to take a responsible increase. The increase in that we announced back in 2007 was a range of 8% to 12%, what we saw on that was a shock lapse of less than 1%. We would expect, again, this increase is the second round on two of the four older blocks that we addressed in 2007. The amount again that we announced is 18% that we'll be requesting with the Departments of Insurance. We would not expect that shock lapse to be, again, much more than 1% or so. The discussions with the customer, when you're looking at a comparable set of benefits of the price of the product that they're buying today, even with that 8% to 12% we announced back in 2007, the additional 18%, that same package of benefits that is purchased on the market today is roughly 20%. What they're paying on the older blocks would be roughly 20% cheaper than the new-priced products. So as we think about the in force rate increases, we are looking at this in a responsible way. We think that the seniors that purchase the products historically are still getting great value in that product. And the products that we're selling in the market today -- again, as we look at our assumptions, we believe our price for relative stability. One thing I would point out, that in 2001, 2002, the NAIC model regulations required a level of rate stabilization. So all carriers that are filing products today are approaching their pricing with, I think, a more conservative stance. So we're seeing that the in force rate increases announced are being accepted by the consumers. They're paying the higher premium and still have good value."

In once sense, with respect to strategy, I'm just going to leave USMI alone. Truly, not much more I can say about it. It seems to me that you're in a lot of businesses, where Genworth is, at best, a second-tier player, if that. Whether it's variable annuities, I'm not sure why you continue to do it. I'm not sure what the incremental benefit, long-term, is going to be if the credit insurance business where the earnings are at a third of where they were two years ago. Isn't the real strategy here that you need to shrink this company and focus on your key lines, whatever you decide those are, rather than playing in things like wealth management where Genworth is never going to be a material player, or it's never going to contribute a material amount to earnings, at least over the next five years?"

Lets just walk through. If you look at the life and long term care area, as we declare, though we have leadership in both -- in the middle or mainstream market in life insurance. And if you look at the bulk of our policies, they are under a $1 million phase size. And the fact that the vast majority of under $500,000, and we're penetrating in both segments. So we've made a very clear call there, and we've made a very clear call in making sure that we leveraged our long, long term care experience. They have appropriate and profitable business there. The wealth management business has actually grown nicely. I understand, we kind of have different views. But that is a third area that we concentrated on because of the shift to advisers, and we've seen a lot of adviser dynamics moving to independent platforms that we serve. We have taken a much narrower stance and continued to evaluate the optimum participation in the annuity area, recognizing that some of our distribution values is selling more than one product. And that is a dialogue with distribution, and we're able to leverage our distribution expense and spread it, because of those multiple products, as opposed to if you were a mono-line in that area. But there will be the appropriate capital development given to the leadership areas, and that capital is being taken away from the other areas as we work through that U.S. life strategy which is playing out, but for the drag in the older blocks that Pat talked about, and lapsing off and dynamics around that. Internationally, in mortgage insurance, I'm upset when you look at Canada and Australia and the way those platforms not only perform but move through. And we pulled back from a number of the markets we were starting to explore to concentrate on those leadership areas while selectively planting some seeds. I guess we probably have a different view on the lifestyle protection business because of how we see the market. And it sounds like we should make sure that we do a good job of laying that out. I view that over time as more of a compliment to a protection value proposition when you look at the nature of the risks, the underwriting, the actuarial support that we leverage, and I like the diversification it gives you in the protection area versus the U.S. market. So I think it's more than just being classified as a credit insurance business. But we will, as we move through executing our strategy, of course look at our portfolio and make sure that our portfolio mix evolves, so that not only are we trying to rebuild value, but we optimize it over time. So we'll try to bring internally, I'll say a diligent screen to where we put capital and to where we don't as we move ahead."

As you've got a lot of capital tied up in, frankly what I would refer to as many hobby businesses, that just result in a complete lack of focus. I mean, managed money, Genworth is never going to be a player in. In variable annuities, you're not. And I guess it's very difficult -- I mean, the market perceives you as a specialty writer if it's in long term care, perhaps life. I don't see why you need to offer variable annuity to complement that. And even in long term care, that's a sector where most are affected, pretty much all of the majors have pulled out. And if we look at the in force block, it's clearly not earning target profitability since the day you brought Genworth public. Every analyst meeting, you talked about getting it repriced, right? We're still here with having to put rate hikes up. And if long term care is your core line, maybe it needs a lot more attention, and you need to get out of some of these other businesses, pay down the debt and strengthen this balance sheet."

Because it looks like you actually made pretty solid progress in a number of your other businesses, whether they be MI related or retirement protection. That said, let me just kind of take a look at what happened in the quarter at this 263% loss ratio. If you back out of Florida, you're still at 205%. And I know seasonally you see a pick up, but in the prior two quarters, you were at 138%, 141%, so seasonality-wise, at worse, I would have expected maybe 150% or 160%. And then you mentioned that the two servicers, they were inefficient. I would have assumed that you would've been aware of that inefficiency.
