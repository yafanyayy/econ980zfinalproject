We saw many encouraging signs in the fourth quarter, including improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a notable increase in the net interest margin. These positive development could lead us to believe our core fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010. We are pleased to see broad-based improvement in credit quality. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $14 million in the fourth quarter, non-performing assets decreased $13 million and the provision for loan losses decreased $54 million. Non-accrual loans were charged down to 44% as of December 31, versus 41% at September 30.Our watch list loans were down $520 million. We believe these improved credit metrics are the result of our diligent management of credit throughout this economic cycle. With unemployment at 10%, business owners and managers, as well as consumers, remain cautious. This is reflected in the subdued loan demand and in our core deposits, which increased $935 million from the third quarter. However, our customers are conveying a more confident tone, and we are seeing more loans in the pipeline. New and renewed loan commitments totaled $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with our strong capital levels and dedicated colleagues, we believe we are ideally positioned to develop new relationships and expand existing ones as the economy continues its recovery.Our net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.94% in the fourth quarter. Excluding excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, the net interest margin would have been 3.07%. We continue to focus on expense controls. Our workforce has been reduced by 8% from 2008, even as we added 10 new banking centers in 2009. Our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 Capital ratio is estimated to be 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital remained solid as evidenced by a tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%.With regard to the $2.25 billion in preferred stock, we still plan to redeem it at such time as feasible with careful consideration given to the economic environment. It remains a top-corporate priority. In summary, we believe the future is brighter and that current opportunities are ahead of us because of the many positive signs we have seen in the fourth quarter. These positive signs are reflected in the breadth of improvement we have seen in credit quality, as well as in our strong deposit growth, the less subdued loan demand and in our increasing net interest margin. Our customers are expressing more optimism, and we share that optimism with them as the economy continues its recovery. And now, I'll turn the call over to Beth and Dale who will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."
318670,83354738,46407,"Comerica Incorporated, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2010",2010-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph. As I review our fourth quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.

As I review our fourth quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our fourth quarter and full year results compared to prior periods. Today, we report our fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $29 million. After preferred dividends of $33 million, the net loss applicable to common stock was $62 million or $0.41 per diluted share.Slide 4 provides an overview of the financial results for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Credit quality metrics improved consistent with our outlook. Non-performing assets declined $13 million, and the inflow to non-accruals slowed by $95 million to $266 million. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased to $225 million, and the provision declined to $257 million compared to $311 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter increased 26 basis points to 2.94%. Produced deposit rates, maturing of higher cost-time deposits and improved loan spreads, all contributed to the increase. The lower turn on excess liquidity had a 13 basis-point impact, which I'll describe in more detail in a minute.We had very strong deposit generation again, in the fourth quarter with core deposits increasing $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average earning assets decreased $3.6 billion, including a $2 billion decline in loan outstandings. Our customers continue to be cautious in the current economic environment. Average other earning assets, primarily Federal Reserve Bank deposits and investment securities declined $1.6 billion as average excess liquidity was reduced.Non-interest income decreased due to a $97 million decline in securities' gains consistent with our outlook. We continue to carefully control expenses. The fourth quarter results reflected a decrease in regular salaries and incentives, which were more than offset by an increase in severance expense, relating to a planned reduction of 300 full-time equivalent positions. Our workforce has been reduced by about 850 positions or 8% since December 2008. Full year 2009 non-interest expenses decreased 6% from 2008. Our capital position is strong and was further enhanced in the fourth quarter. But Tier 1 Capital ratio increased to an estimated 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital is solid as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%. Turning to Slide 5, average loan outstandings declined at a slower pace in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Consistent with post-recessionary environments, we had low loan demand in all of our geographic markets, as customers continue to deleverage as they cautiously manage their businesses. Decreased average outstandings in the fourth quarter were noted in virtually every area with the largest declines in Middle-Market, Global Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate. Line utilization was 46.8% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter.As shown on Slide 6, we had very strong core deposit growth again in the fourth quarter. We had  growth in Texas, Western and Florida markets and all commercial lines of business. Average core deposits increased $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. While deposit rates are significantly lower today, I'm pleased to say that today, we've retained the vast majority of the balances of maturing customer CDs, many of which were put on in late 2008 at rates over 3%. Deposit pricing conditions remained competitive in the fourth quarter, and we believe we have hit rate floors on a number of our products. However, we were able to selectively decrease rates and [indiscernible] deposit categories.As outlined on Slide 7, the net interest margin increased 26 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.94%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.07% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 23 basis points from the third quarter. The increase was primarily a result of lower core deposit rates, maturing higher cost customer CDs and other time deposits and a decrease in excess liquidity. In the fourth quarter, excess liquidity had an approximately 13 basis point negative effect on the margin compared to the 16 basis point impact in the third quarter.Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $2.5 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter, down from an average $3.5 billion in the third quarter. With the maturities of wholesale funding and expected loan growth, we expect excess liquidity will dissipate in the first half of the year. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.Turning to Slide 8, we focused on expense management on a daily basis. Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years, even while we were opening new banking centers. In 2009, in response to the recession and as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage technology and maximize productivity to support growth, full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 850 employees or 8%. In 2010, we expect to achieve a further reduction of about 300 positions or about 3% of the total workforce, which will largely be completed by mid-year. These positions are across all lines of business and geographies. In conjunction with this action, we incurred a severance charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized salary savings of about $16 million related to this action are expected going forward. Now Dale Greene, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss credit qualities, starting on Slide 9."

We saw broad-based improvement in our credit metrics in the fourth quarter. As expected, fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs and the provision for credit losses improved from third quarter levels. Economic conditions continue to be challenging, but we are seeing more encouraging signs that things are improving. Net credit-related charge-offs were $225 million in the fourth quarter, a $14 million reduction from the third quarter. Net charge-offs included $62 million in the Commercial Real Estate line of business, primarily related to residential real-estate development, down from $91 million in the third quarter. The decline in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs reflects the wind down of the California local residential real estate portfolio, and the fact we believe we have been taking the necessary charges to reflect declining values over the past two years.We also continue to see value stabilized in select markets. Provision for credit-related losses of $259 million was $54 million less than the third quarter. The provision exceeded net charge-offs by $34 million compared to $74 million in the third quarter, reflecting the improvement in overall credit performance. The allowance for loan losses was 2.34% of total loans, an increase of 15 basis points from the third quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 83% of non-performing loans.Turning to Slide 10, total non-performing assets declined $13 million to $1.3 billion. Importantly, the inflow on non-performing assets decreased by $95 million in the fourth quarter. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing declined $60 million to $101 million. Foreclosed property held relatively stable. Other real estate expenses in the fourth quarter increased to $22 million from $10 million in the third quarter. This reflects write-downs related to updated appraisals. The average carrying value of these properties is now well below 40% of the original contractual loan amount.Also we believe that the market is starting to stabilize. Therefore, we expect quarterly ORE [official residence expenses] expenses going forward to be less than the fourth quarter level. Our watch list loans decreased by $520 million to $7.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This reflects improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.On Slide 11, we provided information on the makeup of the non-accrual loans. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be Commercial Real Estate, which consist primarily of residential real estate development loans. Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans decreased by $47 million in the quarter. Non-accruals also decreased in Middle-Market by $17 million. Personal Banking, which falls within other business lines, saw a $25 million increase in non-accruals as the weak economy has taken a toll on some of our residential mortgage customers. Because these are primarily seasoned mortgages, the loss content remains low.During the fourth quarter 2009, $266 million of loan relationships, greater than $2 million, were transferred to non-accrual status, a reduction of $95 million from the third quarter. Of these inflows, Commercial Real Estate line of business contributed $64 million, down from $211 million in the third quarter. Middle market at $85 million, a small decrease from the third quarter. Inflows increased modestly in several lines of business, such as Small Business, Global Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Science (sic) [Sciences] from low levels.Slide 12, provides further detail on our non-accrual loans. Collateral values on non-accrual loans are reviewed every quarter as part of our credit-quality review process. We have written down non-performing loans by 44% compared to 34% a year ago. The carrying value, plus the reserve, reflected current market conditions. We had $34 million in total trouble debt restructurings or TDRs. This included $18 million in reduced rate loans, primarily residential mortgages, $5 million in other non-performing TDRs and $11 million in performing TDRs.In the fourth quarter, we sold $11 million in loans, four [ph] loans, totaling $10 million, were non-performing. The average price was close to carrying values plus reserves. We have seen a firming of prices, particularly for distressed syndicated debt. And we continue to pursue loan sales on a one-off basis.On Slide 13, we provide a breakdown of net credit-related charge-offs by office of loan origination. Net charge-offs in all four major geographic markets declined in the fourth quarter. Within the Midwest, which made up 43% of the total, Middle-Market charge-offs declined. Small Business charge-offs were relatively stable, and we saw small increases in private banking and global banking.Western market charge-offs made up 38% of total. The decrease from the third quarter was driven by a decline in residential development-related charge-offs, as well as Global Corporate Banking. Middle market posted an increase from the third quarter.Texas net charge-offs returns were at relatively low level with no particular area of concentration. As far as Florida, net charge-offs declined again in the fourth quarter, as there were no additional significant write-downs on the condo portfolio. Other markets net charge-offs increased with no particular geographic or industry focus.Slide 14, provides detail on net loan charge-offs by line of business. The Commercial Real Estate line of business charge-offs declined, while Middle-Market increased as expected. Charge-offs for Wealth and Institutional Management, Small Business and Personal Banking were relatively stable.On slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $194 million from the prior quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. At the December 31, 22% of this portfolio consisted of loans made to residential real estate developers secured by the underlying real estate. Michigan outstandings of $620 million, represented 13% of the portfolio, and were down $142 million from a year ago. Florida outstandings of $553 million represents 11% of the portfolio, and were down $160 million from a year ago.As a shown on Slide 16, as of the end of the fourth quarter, we reduced residential real estate development exposure by $1.2 billion or 54% since June of 2008. Total Single Family construction outstandings were down $785 million or 59% from June 2008. Turning to Slide 17, we displayed project type and geographic breakdown of net charge-offs for the Commercial Real Estate line of business. Consistent with the decline in total Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans and decline in inflows to non-accrual loans, we had a $29 million or 33% decrease in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter for a total of $62 million. Residential real estate development loan charge-offs decreased by over 50% in the fourth quarter. We have seen prices for Single Family home stabilized and even increase in select markets. However, land prices remain soft and in some locations, continue to decline.Charge-offs in non-Residential Real Estate Construction segment increased in the fourth quarter. The majority can be attributed to a single transaction secured by entitled land in California. While we continue to see softness, we believe that non-residential real estate will see far fewer defaults and much lower loss contest than the Residential Construction segment. In fact, we had only one non-residential Commercial Real Estate loan, over $2 million, transferred to non-accrual in the fourth quarter.Total Commercial Real Estate related charge-offs decreased in Western, Texas and other markets. Midwest was stable. As far as Florida, charge-offs have trended downward for the last two quarters. We have limited land exposure in Florida, and Single Family exposure has been managed down for some time. The issues in Florida are primarily related to condo exposure, which totaled about $100 million at December 31, down from about $125 million at the end of September. Condo closings are occurring, but at a very modest level.Slide 18, provides an overview of our consumer loan portfolio. This portfolio is relatively small, representing less than 10% of our total loans. These loans are self-originated and are part of a full-service relationship. The residential mortgages we hold on our balance sheet are primarily associated with our Private Banking customers. Net charge-offs for residential mortgages decreased again in the fourth quarter. The home equity loan portfolio has held up relatively well with a slight increase in charge-offs in the fourth quarter, and 30- and 90-day delinquency rates improved.Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplies portfolio can be found in the appendix. Both portfolios continue to perform well. As far as the auto supplier portfolio, we continue to reduce our loan outstandings, and it now represents only 2% of our total loans. Non-accrual loans and net charge-offs declined significantly in the fourth quarter. The auto dealer average outstandings have declined $1.4 billion or 32% over the past year, in line with falling sales volumes of new cars. And we continue to have excellent credit quality in this portfolio.To conclude on credit, we conduct in-depth reviews of all of our watch list credits, at least quarterly, to ensure that we have an appropriate workout strategy, as well as reserves and carrying values that reflect our collateral assessments. This proactive action has resulted in a current carrying value of non-performing loans of 56%. We are pleased with the improvement in credit metrics in the fourth quarter. These results, as well as an improving macroeconomic statistics, support our outlook for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million for 2010. We expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net charge-offs for the year. And now, I'll turn the call back to Beth"

Turning to Slide 19, our Tier 1 Capital ratio is well in excess of the well-capitalized thresholds, as defined by the regulators and this has increased in each of the past five quarters.Turning to Slide 20, in the intangible common equity ratio. We had maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years. Our tangible common equity ratio, which was 7.99% at the end of the fourth quarter increased from the third quarter. And historically, has been well above the average ratio of our peer group.Slide 21, provides our expectations for 2010, which is based on a modestly improving economic environment. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer, as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We believe we will achieve single-digit period-end-to-period-end loan growth. We expect the securities' portfolio will remain at the current level.Based on the assumption that there will not be an increase in the Fed funds rates in 2010, we expect that net interest margin will increase to 3.15% to 3.25% as a result of maturities of higher cost CDs and wholesale funding, and a reduction in excess liquidity. In addition, we expect the margin will continue to benefit from the improved loan pricing.  Our outlook is for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million. Provision is expected to be slightly in excess of net charge-offs. Non-interest income, excluding 2009 securities gains, is expected to be flat as increases in core fee income are offset by 2009 non-recurring item, such as gains on the repurchase of debt.The expected reduction of pension, FDIC and ORE expense, as well as the continued careful control of discretionary cost is expected to result in low single-digit decrease in expenses. Overall, the many positive signs we saw in the fourth quarter, such as improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a significant increase in the net interest margin lead us to believe that we will continue to see improvement in our core operating fundamentals in 2010. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

We saw many encouraging signs in the fourth quarter, including improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a notable increase in the net interest margin. These positive development could lead us to believe our core fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010. We are pleased to see broad-based improvement in credit quality. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $14 million in the fourth quarter, non-performing assets decreased $13 million and the provision for loan losses decreased $54 million. Non-accrual loans were charged down to 44% as of December 31, versus 41% at September 30.Our watch list loans were down $520 million. We believe these improved credit metrics are the result of our diligent management of credit throughout this economic cycle. With unemployment at 10%, business owners and managers, as well as consumers, remain cautious. This is reflected in the subdued loan demand and in our core deposits, which increased $935 million from the third quarter. However, our customers are conveying a more confident tone, and we are seeing more loans in the pipeline. New and renewed loan commitments totaled $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with our strong capital levels and dedicated colleagues, we believe we are ideally positioned to develop new relationships and expand existing ones as the economy continues its recovery.Our net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.94% in the fourth quarter. Excluding excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, the net interest margin would have been 3.07%. We continue to focus on expense controls. Our workforce has been reduced by 8% from 2008, even as we added 10 new banking centers in 2009. Our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 Capital ratio is estimated to be 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital remained solid as evidenced by a tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%.With regard to the $2.25 billion in preferred stock, we still plan to redeem it at such time as feasible with careful consideration given to the economic environment. It remains a top-corporate priority. In summary, we believe the future is brighter and that current opportunities are ahead of us because of the many positive signs we have seen in the fourth quarter. These positive signs are reflected in the breadth of improvement we have seen in credit quality, as well as in our strong deposit growth, the less subdued loan demand and in our increasing net interest margin. Our customers are expressing more optimism, and we share that optimism with them as the economy continues its recovery. And now, I'll turn the call over to Beth and Dale who will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."

As I review our fourth quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our fourth quarter and full year results compared to prior periods. Today, we report our fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $29 million. After preferred dividends of $33 million, the net loss applicable to common stock was $62 million or $0.41 per diluted share.Slide 4 provides an overview of the financial results for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Credit quality metrics improved consistent with our outlook. Non-performing assets declined $13 million, and the inflow to non-accruals slowed by $95 million to $266 million. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased to $225 million, and the provision declined to $257 million compared to $311 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter increased 26 basis points to 2.94%. Produced deposit rates, maturing of higher cost-time deposits and improved loan spreads, all contributed to the increase. The lower turn on excess liquidity had a 13 basis-point impact, which I'll describe in more detail in a minute.We had very strong deposit generation again, in the fourth quarter with core deposits increasing $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average earning assets decreased $3.6 billion, including a $2 billion decline in loan outstandings. Our customers continue to be cautious in the current economic environment. Average other earning assets, primarily Federal Reserve Bank deposits and investment securities declined $1.6 billion as average excess liquidity was reduced.Non-interest income decreased due to a $97 million decline in securities' gains consistent with our outlook. We continue to carefully control expenses. The fourth quarter results reflected a decrease in regular salaries and incentives, which were more than offset by an increase in severance expense, relating to a planned reduction of 300 full-time equivalent positions. Our workforce has been reduced by about 850 positions or 8% since December 2008. Full year 2009 non-interest expenses decreased 6% from 2008. Our capital position is strong and was further enhanced in the fourth quarter. But Tier 1 Capital ratio increased to an estimated 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital is solid as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%. Turning to Slide 5, average loan outstandings declined at a slower pace in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Consistent with post-recessionary environments, we had low loan demand in all of our geographic markets, as customers continue to deleverage as they cautiously manage their businesses. Decreased average outstandings in the fourth quarter were noted in virtually every area with the largest declines in Middle Market, Global Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate. Line utilization was 46.8% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter.As shown on Slide 6, we had very strong core deposit growth again in the fourth quarter. We had  growth in Texas, Western and Florida markets and all commercial lines of business. Average core deposits increased $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. While deposit rates are significantly lower today, I'm pleased to say that today, we've retained the vast majority of the balances of maturing customer CDs, many of which were put on in late 2008 at rates over 3%. Deposit pricing conditions remained competitive in the fourth quarter, and we believe we have hit rate floors on a number of our products. However, we were able to selectively decrease rates and [indiscernible] deposit categories.As outlined on Slide 7, the net interest margin increased 26 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.94%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.07% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 23 basis points from the third quarter. The increase was primarily a result of lower core deposit rates, maturing higher cost customer CDs and other time deposits and a decrease in excess liquidity. In the fourth quarter, excess liquidity had an approximately 13 basis point negative effect on the margin compared to the 16 basis point impact in the third quarter.Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $2.5 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter, down from an average $3.5 billion in the third quarter. With the maturities of wholesale funding and expected loan growth, we expect excess liquidity will dissipate in the first half of the year. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.Turning to Slide 8, we focused on expense management on a daily basis. Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years, even while we were opening new banking centers. In 2009, in response to the recession and as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage technology and maximize productivity to support growth, full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 850 employees or 8%. In 2010, we expect to achieve a further reduction of about 300 positions or about 3% of the total workforce, which will largely be completed by mid-year. These positions are across all lines of business and geographies. In conjunction with this action, we incurred a severance charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized salary savings of about $16 million related to this action are expected going forward. Now Dale Greene, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss credit qualities, starting on Slide 9."

We saw a broad-based improvement in our credit metrics in the fourth quarter. As expected, fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs and the provision for credit losses improved from third quarter levels. Economic conditions continue to be challenging, but we are seeing more encouraging signs that things are improving. Net credit-related charge-offs were $225 million in the fourth quarter, a $14 million reduction from the third quarter. Net charge-offs included $62 million in the Commercial Real Estate line of business, primarily related to residential real-estate development, down from $91 million in the third quarter. The decline in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs reflects the wind down of the California local residential real estate portfolio, and the fact we believe we have been taking the necessary charges to reflect declining values over the past two years.We also continue to see value stabilized in select markets. Provision for credit-related losses of $259 million was $54 million less than the third quarter. The provision exceeded net charge-offs by $34 million compared to $74 million in the third quarter, reflecting the improvement in overall credit performance. The allowance for loan losses was 2.34% of total loans, an increase of 15 basis points from the third quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 83% of non-performing loans.Turning to Slide 10, total non-performing assets declined $13 million to $1.3 billion. Importantly, the inflow to non-performing assets decreased by $95 million in the fourth quarter. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing declined $60 million to $101 million. Foreclosed property held relatively stable. Other real estate expenses in the fourth quarter increased to $22 million from $10 million in the third quarter. This reflects write-downs related to updated appraisals. The average carrying value of these properties is now well below 40% of the original contractual loan amount.Also we believe that the market is starting to stabilize. Therefore, we expect quarterly ORE [official residence expenses] expenses going forward to be less than the fourth quarter level. Our watch list loans decreased by $520 million to $7.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This reflects an improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.On Slide 11, we provided information on the makeup of the non-accrual loans. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be Commercial Real Estate, which consist primarily of residential real estate development loans. Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans decreased by $47 million in the quarter. Non-accruals also decreased in Middle Market by $17 million. Personal Banking, which falls within other business lines, saw a $25 million increase in non-accruals as the weak economy has taken a toll on some of our residential mortgage customers. Because these are primarily seasoned mortgages, the loss content remains low.During the fourth quarter 2009, $266 million of loan relationships, greater than $2 million, were transferred to non-accrual status, a reduction of $95 million from the third quarter. Of these inflows, Commercial Real Estate line of business contributed $64 million, down from $211 million in the third quarter. Middle Market at $85 million, a small decrease from the third quarter. Inflows increased modestly in several lines of business, such as Small Business, Global Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Science (sic) [Sciences] from low levels.Slide 12, provides further detail on our non-accrual loans. Collateral values on non-accrual loans are reviewed every quarter as part of our credit-quality review process. We have written down non-performing loans by 44% compared to 34% a year ago. The carrying value, plus the reserve, reflected current market conditions. We had $34 million in total trouble debt restructurings or TDRs. This included $18 million in reduced rate loans, primarily residential mortgages, $5 million in other non-performing TDRs and $11 million in performing TDRs.In the fourth quarter, we sold $11 million in loans, four loans, totaling $10 million, were non-performing. The average price was close to carrying values plus reserves. We have seen a firming of prices, particularly for distressed syndicated debt. And we continue to pursue loan sales on a one-off basis.On Slide 13, we provide a breakdown of net credit-related charge-offs by office of loan origination. Net charge-offs in all four major geographic markets declined in the fourth quarter. Within the Midwest, which made up 43% of the total, Middle Market charge-offs declined. Small Business charge-offs were relatively stable, and we saw a small increases in Private Banking and Global Banking.Western market charge-offs made up 38% of the total. The decrease from the third quarter was driven by a decline in residential development-related charge-offs, as well as Global Corporate Banking. Middle Market posted an increase from the third quarter.Texas net charge-offs return to a relatively low level with no particular area of concentration. As far as Florida, net charge-offs declined again in the fourth quarter, as there were no additional significant write-downs on the condo portfolio. Other markets net charge-offs increased with no particular geographic or industry focus.Slide 14, provides detail on net loan charge-offs by line of business. The Commercial Real Estate line of business charge-offs declined, while Middle Market increased as expected. Charge-offs for Wealth and Institutional Management, Small Business and Personal Banking were relatively stable.On slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $194 million from the prior quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. At the December 31, 22% of this portfolio consisted of loans made to residential real estate developers secured by the underlying real estate. Michigan outstandings of $620 million, represented 13% of the portfolio, and were down $142 million from a year ago. Florida outstandings of $553 million represents 11% of the portfolio, and were down $160 million from a year ago.As a shown on Slide 16, as of the end of the fourth quarter, we reduced residential real estate development exposure by $1.2 billion or 54% since June of 2008. Total Single Family construction outstandings were down $785 million or 59% from June 2008. Turning to Slide 17, we displayed project type and geographic breakdown of net charge-offs for the Commercial Real Estate line of business. Consistent with the decline in total Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans and decline in inflows to non-accrual loans, we had a $29 million or 33% decrease in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter for a total of $62 million. Residential real estate development loan charge-offs decreased by over 50% in the fourth quarter. We have seen prices for Single Family home stabilized and even increase in select markets. However, land prices remain soft and in some locations, continue to decline.Charge-offs in non-Residential Real Estate Construction segment increased in the fourth quarter. The majority can be attributed to a single transaction secured by entitled land in California. While we continue to see softness, we believe that non-residential real estate will see far fewer defaults and much lower loss contest than the Residential Construction segment. In fact, we had only one non-residential Commercial Real Estate loan, over $2 million, transferred to non-accrual in the fourth quarter.Total Commercial Real Estate related charge-offs decreased in Western, Texas and other markets. Midwest was stable. As far as Florida, charge-offs have trended downward for the last two quarters. We have limited land exposure in Florida, and Single Family exposure has been managed down for some time. The issues in Florida are primarily related to condo exposure, which totaled about $100 million at December 31, down from about $125 million at the end of September. Condo closings are occurring, but at a very modest level.Slide 18, provides an overview of our consumer loan portfolio. This portfolio is relatively small, representing less than 10% of our total loans. These loans are self-originated and are part of a full-service relationship. The residential mortgages we hold on our balance sheet are primarily associated with our Private Banking customers. Net charge-offs for residential mortgages decreased again in the fourth quarter. The home equity loan portfolio has held up relatively well with a slight increase in charge-offs in the fourth quarter, and 30- and 90-day delinquency rates improved.Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplies portfolio can be found in the appendix. Both portfolios continue to perform well. As far as the auto supplier portfolio, we continue to reduce our loan outstandings, and it now represents only 2% of our total loans. Non-accrual loans and net charge-offs declined significantly in the fourth quarter. The auto dealer average outstandings have declined $1.4 billion or 32% over the past year, in line with falling sales volumes of new cars. And we continue to have excellent credit quality in this portfolio.To conclude on credit, we conduct in-depth reviews of all of our watch list credits, at least quarterly, to ensure that we have an appropriate workout strategy, as well as reserves and carrying values that reflect our collateral assessments. This proactive action has resulted in a current carrying value of non-performing loans of 56%. We are pleased with the improvement in credit metrics in the fourth quarter. These results, as well as an improving macroeconomic statistics, support our outlook for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million for 2010. We expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net charge-offs for the year. And now, I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Turning to Slide 19, our Tier 1 Capital ratio is well in excess of the well-capitalized thresholds, as defined by the regulators and this has increased in each of the past five quarters.Turning to Slide 20, in the intangible common equity ratio. We had maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years. Our tangible common equity ratio, which was 7.99% at the end of the fourth quarter increased from the third quarter. And historically, has been well above the average ratio of our peer group.Slide 21, provides our expectations for 2010, which is based on a modestly improving economic environment. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer, as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We believe we will achieve single-digit period-end-to-period-end loan growth. We expect the securities' portfolio will remain at the current level.Based on the assumption that there will not be an increase in the Fed funds rates in 2010, we expect that net interest margin will increase to 3.15% to 3.25% as a result of maturities of higher cost CDs and wholesale funding, and a reduction in excess liquidity. In addition, we expect the margin will continue to benefit from the improved loan pricing.  Our outlook is for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million. Provision is expected to be slightly in excess of net charge-offs. Non-interest income, excluding 2009 securities gains, is expected to be flat as increases in core fee income are offset by 2009 non-recurring item, such as gains on the repurchase of debt.The expected reduction of pension, FDIC and ORE expense, as well as the continued careful control of discretionary cost is expected to result in low single-digit decrease in expenses. Overall, the many positive signs we saw in the fourth quarter, such as improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a significant increase in the net interest margin lead us to believe that we will continue to see improvement in our core operating fundamentals in 2010. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

I believe that given our outlook for charge-offs, and I think we have the question earlier that we should probably continue to see the first half provision continue to be in excess of charge-offs but at the declining rate. And I believe that we are very likely to see provision in the second half of the year to be below charge-offs simply because I think we will continue to see improving credit metrics. I believe the broad-based improvement we saw in the fourth quarter will largely continue throughout all of this year. And obviously, we look at each quarter as we always do to see where we are.

We saw many encouraging signs in the fourth quarter, including improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a notable increase in the net interest margin. These positive development could lead us to believe our core fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010. We are pleased to see broad-based improvement in credit quality. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $14 million in the fourth quarter, non-performing assets decreased $13 million and the provision for loan losses decreased $54 million. Non-accrual loans were charged down to 44% as of December 31, versus 41% at September 30.Our watch list loans were down $520 million. We believe these improved credit metrics are the result of our diligent management of credit throughout this economic cycle. With unemployment at 10%, business owners and managers, as well as consumers, remain cautious. This is reflected in the subdued loan demand and in our core deposits, which increased $935 million from the third quarter. However, our customers are conveying a more confident tone, and we are seeing more loans in the pipeline. New and renewed loan commitments totaled $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with our strong capital levels and dedicated colleagues, we believe we are ideally positioned to develop new relationships and expand existing ones as the economy continues its recovery.Our net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.94% in the fourth quarter. Excluding excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, the net interest margin would have been 3.07%. We continue to focus on expense controls. Our workforce has been reduced by 8% from 2008, even as we added 10 new banking centers in 2009. Our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 Capital ratio is estimated to be 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital remained solid as evidenced by a tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%.With regard to the $2.25 billion in preferred stock, we still plan to redeem it at such time as feasible with careful consideration given to the economic environment. It remains a top-corporate priority. In summary, we believe the future is brighter and that current opportunities are ahead of us because of the many positive signs we have seen in the fourth quarter. These positive signs are reflected in the breadth of improvement we have seen in credit quality, as well as in our strong deposit growth, the less subdued loan demand and in our increasing net interest margin. Our customers are expressing more optimism, and we share that optimism with them as the economy continues its recovery. And now, I'll turn the call over to Beth and Dale who will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."

As I review our fourth quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.

As I review our fourth quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our fourth quarter and full year results compared to prior periods. Today, we report our fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $29 million. After preferred dividends of $33 million, the net loss applicable to common stock was $62 million or $0.41 per diluted share.Slide 4 provides an overview of the financial results for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Credit quality metrics improved consistent with our outlook. Non-performing assets declined $13 million, and the inflow to non-accruals slowed by $95 million to $266 million. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased to $225 million, and the provision declined to $257 million compared to $311 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter increased 26 basis points to 2.94%. Produced deposit rates, maturing of higher cost-time deposits and improved loan spreads, all contributed to the increase. The lower turn on excess liquidity had a 13 basis-point impact, which I'll describe in more detail in a minute.We had very strong deposit generation again, in the fourth quarter with core deposits increasing $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average earning assets decreased $3.6 billion, including a $2 billion decline in loan outstandings. Our customers continue to be cautious in the current economic environment. Average other earning assets, primarily Federal Reserve Bank deposits and investment securities declined $1.6 billion as average excess liquidity was reduced.Non-interest income decreased due to a $97 million decline in securities' gains consistent with our outlook. We continue to carefully control expenses. The fourth quarter results reflected a decrease in regular salaries and incentives, which were more than offset by an increase in severance expense, relating to a planned reduction of 300 full-time equivalent positions. Our workforce has been reduced by about 850 positions or 8% since December 2008. Full year 2009 non-interest expenses decreased 6% from 2008. Our capital position is strong and was further enhanced in the fourth quarter. But Tier 1 Capital ratio increased to an estimated 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital is solid as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%. Turning to Slide 5, average loan outstandings declined at a slower pace in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Consistent with post-recessionary environments, we had low loan demand in all of our geographic markets, as customers continue to deleverage as they cautiously manage their businesses. Decreased average outstandings in the fourth quarter were noted in virtually every area with the largest declines in Middle Market, Global Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate. Line utilization was 46.8% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter.As shown on Slide 6, we had very strong core deposit growth again in the fourth quarter. We had  growth in Texas, Western and Florida markets and all commercial lines of business. Average core deposits increased $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. While deposit rates are significantly lower today, I'm pleased to say that today, we've retained the vast majority of the balances of maturing customer CDs, many of which were put on in late 2008 at rates over 3%. Deposit pricing conditions remained competitive in the fourth quarter, and we believe we have hit rate floors on a number of our products. However, we were able to selectively decrease rates and [indiscernible] deposit categories.As outlined on Slide 7, the net interest margin increased 26 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.94%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.07% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 23 basis points from the third quarter. The increase was primarily a result of lower core deposit rates, maturing higher cost customer CDs and other time deposits and a decrease in excess liquidity. In the fourth quarter, excess liquidity had an approximately 13 basis point negative effect on the margin compared to the 16 basis point impact in the third quarter.Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $2.5 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter, down from an average $3.5 billion in the third quarter. With the maturities of wholesale funding and expected loan growth, we expect excess liquidity will dissipate in the first half of the year. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.Turning to Slide 8, we focused on expense management on a daily basis. Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years, even while we were opening new banking centers. In 2009, in response to the recession and as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage technology and maximize productivity to support growth, full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 850 employees or 8%. In 2010, we expect to achieve a further reduction of about 300 positions or about 3% of the total workforce, which will largely be completed by mid-year. These positions are across all lines of business and geographies. In conjunction with this action, we incurred a severance charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized salary savings of about $16 million related to this action are expected going forward. Now Dale Greene, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss credit qualities, starting on Slide 9."

We saw a broad-based improvement in our credit metrics in the fourth quarter. As expected, fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs and the provision for credit losses improved from third quarter levels. Economic conditions continue to be challenging, but we are seeing more encouraging signs that things are improving. Net credit-related charge-offs were $225 million in the fourth quarter, a $14 million reduction from the third quarter. Net charge-offs included $62 million in the Commercial Real Estate line of business, primarily related to residential real-estate development, down from $91 million in the third quarter. The decline in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs reflects the wind down of the California local residential real estate portfolio, and the fact we believe we have been taking the necessary charges to reflect declining values over the past two years.We also continue to see value stabilized in select markets. Provision for credit-related losses of $259 million was $54 million less than the third quarter. The provision exceeded net charge-offs by $34 million compared to $74 million in the third quarter, reflecting the improvement in overall credit performance. The allowance for loan losses was 2.34% of total loans, an increase of 15 basis points from the third quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 83% of non-performing loans.Turning to Slide 10, total non-performing assets declined $13 million to $1.3 billion. Importantly, the inflow to non-performing assets decreased by $95 million in the fourth quarter. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing declined $60 million to $101 million. Foreclosed property held relatively stable. Other real estate expenses in the fourth quarter increased to $22 million from $10 million in the third quarter. This reflects write-downs related to updated appraisals. The average carrying value of these properties is now well below 40% of the original contractual loan amount.Also we believe that the market is starting to stabilize. Therefore, we expect quarterly ORE [official residence expenses] expenses going forward to be less than the fourth quarter level. Our watch list loans decreased by $520 million to $7.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This reflects an improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.On Slide 11, we provided information on the makeup of the non-accrual loans. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be Commercial Real Estate, which consist primarily of residential real estate development loans. Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans decreased by $47 million in the quarter. Non-accruals also decreased in Middle Market by $17 million. Personal Banking, which falls within other business lines, saw a $25 million increase in non-accruals as the weak economy has taken a toll on some of our residential mortgage customers. Because these are primarily seasoned mortgages, the loss content remains low.During the fourth quarter 2009, $266 million of loan relationships, greater than $2 million, were transferred to non-accrual status, a reduction of $95 million from the third quarter. Of these inflows, Commercial Real Estate line of business contributed $64 million, down from $211 million in the third quarter. Middle Market at $85 million, a small decrease from the third quarter. Inflows increased modestly in several lines of business, such as Small Business, Global Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Science (sic) [Sciences] from low levels.Slide 12, provides further detail on our non-accrual loans. Collateral values on non-accrual loans are reviewed every quarter as part of our credit-quality review process. We have written down non-performing loans by 44% compared to 34% a year ago. The carrying value, plus the reserve, reflected current market conditions. We had $34 million in total trouble debt restructurings or TDRs. This included $18 million in reduced rate loans, primarily residential mortgages, $5 million in other non-performing TDRs and $11 million in performing TDRs.In the fourth quarter, we sold $11 million in loans, four loans, totaling $10 million, were non-performing. The average price was close to carrying values plus reserves. We have seen a firming of prices, particularly for distressed syndicated debt. And we continue to pursue loan sales on a one-off basis.On Slide 13, we provide a breakdown of net credit-related charge-offs by office of loan origination. Net charge-offs in all four major geographic markets declined in the fourth quarter. Within the Midwest, which made up 43% of the total, Middle Market charge-offs declined. Small Business charge-offs were relatively stable, and we saw a small increases in Private Banking and Global Banking.Western market charge-offs made up 38% of the total. The decrease from the third quarter was driven by a decline in residential development-related charge-offs, as well as Global Corporate Banking. Middle Market posted an increase from the third quarter.Texas net charge-offs return to a relatively low level with no particular area of concentration. As far as Florida, net charge-offs declined again in the fourth quarter, as there were no additional significant write-downs on the condo portfolio. Other markets net charge-offs increased with no particular geographic or industry focus.Slide 14, provides detail on net loan charge-offs by line of business. The Commercial Real Estate line of business charge-offs declined, while Middle Market increased as expected. Charge-offs for Wealth and Institutional Management, Small Business and Personal Banking were relatively stable.On slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $194 million from the prior quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. At the December 31, 22% of this portfolio consisted of loans made to residential real estate developers secured by the underlying real estate. Michigan outstandings of $620 million, represented 13% of the portfolio, and were down $142 million from a year ago. Florida outstandings of $553 million represents 11% of the portfolio, and were down $160 million from a year ago.As a shown on Slide 16, as of the end of the fourth quarter, we reduced residential real estate development exposure by $1.2 billion or 54% since June of 2008. Total Single Family construction outstandings were down $785 million or 59% from June 2008. Turning to Slide 17, we displayed project type and geographic breakdown of net charge-offs for the Commercial Real Estate line of business. Consistent with the decline in total Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans and decline in inflows to non-accrual loans, we had a $29 million or 33% decrease in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter for a total of $62 million. Residential real estate development loan charge-offs decreased by over 50% in the fourth quarter. We have seen prices for Single Family home stabilized and even increase in select markets. However, land prices remain soft and in some locations, continue to decline.Charge-offs in non-Residential Real Estate Construction segment increased in the fourth quarter. The majority can be attributed to a single transaction secured by entitled land in California. While we continue to see softness, we believe that non-residential real estate will see far fewer defaults and much lower loss contest than the Residential Construction segment. In fact, we had only one non-residential Commercial Real Estate loan, over $2 million, transferred to non-accrual in the fourth quarter.Total Commercial Real Estate related charge-offs decreased in Western, Texas and other markets. Midwest was stable. As far as Florida, charge-offs have trended downward for the last two quarters. We have limited land exposure in Florida, and Single Family exposure has been managed down for some time. The issues in Florida are primarily related to condo exposure, which totaled about $100 million at December 31, down from about $125 million at the end of September. Condo closings are occurring, but at a very modest level.Slide 18, provides an overview of our consumer loan portfolio. This portfolio is relatively small, representing less than 10% of our total loans. These loans are self-originated and are part of a full-service relationship. The residential mortgages we hold on our balance sheet are primarily associated with our Private Banking customers. Net charge-offs for residential mortgages decreased again in the fourth quarter. The home equity loan portfolio has held up relatively well with a slight increase in charge-offs in the fourth quarter, and 30- and 90-day delinquency rates improved.Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplies portfolio can be found in the appendix. Both portfolios continue to perform well. As far as the auto supplier portfolio, we continue to reduce our loan outstandings, and it now represents only 2% of our total loans. Non-accrual loans and net charge-offs declined significantly in the fourth quarter. The auto dealer average outstandings have declined $1.4 billion or 32% over the past year, in line with falling sales volumes of new cars. And we continue to have excellent credit quality in this portfolio.To conclude on credit, we conduct in-depth reviews of all of our watch list credits, at least quarterly, to ensure that we have an appropriate workout strategy, as well as reserves and carrying values that reflect our collateral assessments. This proactive action has resulted in a current carrying value of non-performing loans of 56%. We are pleased with the improvement in credit metrics in the fourth quarter. These results, as well as an improving macroeconomic statistics, support our outlook for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million for 2010. We expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net charge-offs for the year. And now, I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Turning to Slide 19, our Tier 1 Capital ratio is well in excess of the well-capitalized thresholds, as defined by the regulators and this has increased in each of the past five quarters.Turning to Slide 20, in the intangible common equity ratio. We had maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years. Our tangible common equity ratio, which was 7.99% at the end of the fourth quarter increased from the third quarter. And historically, has been well above the average ratio of our peer group.Slide 21, provides our expectations for 2010, which is based on a modestly improving economic environment. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer, as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We believe we will achieve single-digit period-end-to-period-end loan growth. We expect the securities' portfolio will remain at the current level.Based on the assumption that there will not be an increase in the Fed funds rates in 2010, we expect that net interest margin will increase to 3.15% to 3.25% as a result of maturities of higher cost CDs and wholesale funding, and a reduction in excess liquidity. In addition, we expect the margin will continue to benefit from the improved loan pricing.  Our outlook is for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million. Provision is expected to be slightly in excess of net charge-offs. Non-interest income, excluding 2009 securities gains, is expected to be flat as increases in core fee income are offset by 2009 non-recurring item, such as gains on the repurchase of debt.The expected reduction of pension, FDIC and ORE expense, as well as the continued careful control of discretionary cost is expected to result in low single-digit decrease in expenses. Overall, the many positive signs we saw in the fourth quarter, such as improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a significant increase in the net interest margin lead us to believe that we will continue to see improvement in our core operating fundamentals in 2010.

We're seeing in many cases that the discounted cash flows are sufficient to structure deals into a mini-perm. We have numerous examples of deals that we've done that with. And not only are we able to structure into mini-perms, we're able to get, in many cases more collateral, cross-collateralized.

We saw many encouraging signs in the fourth quarter, including improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a notable increase in the net interest margin. These positive development could lead us to believe our core fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010. We are pleased to see broad-based improvement in credit quality. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $14 million in the fourth quarter, non-performing assets decreased $13 million and the provision for loan losses decreased $54 million. Non-accrual loans were charged down to 44% as of December 31, versus 41% at September 30.Our watch list loans were down $520 million.

With unemployment at 10%, business owners and managers, as well as consumers, remain cautious. This is reflected in the subdued loan demand and in our core deposits, which increased $935 million from the third quarter. However, our customers are conveying a more confident tone, and we are seeing more loans in the pipeline. New and renewed loan commitments totaled $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with our strong capital levels and dedicated colleagues, we believe we are ideally positioned to develop new relationships and expand existing ones as the economy continues its recovery. Our net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.94% in the fourth quarter. Excluding excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, the net interest margin would have been 3.07%. We continue to focus on expense controls. Our workforce has been reduced by 8% from 2008, even as we added 10 new banking centers in 2009. Our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 Capital ratio is estimated to be 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital remained solid as evidenced by a tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%.With regard to the $2.25 billion in preferred stock, we still plan to redeem it at such time as feasible with careful consideration given to the economic environment. It remains a top-corporate priority. In summary, we believe the future is brighter and that current opportunities are ahead of us because of the many positive signs we have seen in the fourth quarter. These positive signs are reflected in the breadth of improvement we have seen in credit quality, as well as in our strong deposit growth, the less subdued loan demand and in our increasing net interest margin. Our customers are expressing more optimism, and we share that optimism with them as the economy continues its recovery. And now, I'll turn the call over to Beth and Dale who will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail."

As I review our fourth quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our fourth quarter and full year results compared to prior periods. Today, we report our fourth quarter 2009 net loss of $29 million. After preferred dividends of $33 million, the net loss applicable to common stock was $62 million or $0.41 per diluted share.Slide 4 provides an overview of the financial results for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Credit quality metrics improved consistent with our outlook. Non-performing assets declined $13 million, and the inflow to non-accruals slowed by $95 million to $266 million. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased to $225 million, and the provision declined to $257 million compared to $311 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter increased 26 basis points to 2.94%. Produced deposit rates, maturing of higher cost-time deposits and improved loan spreads, all contributed to the increase. The lower turn on excess liquidity had a 13 basis-point impact, which I'll describe in more detail in a minute.We had very strong deposit generation again, in the fourth quarter with core deposits increasing $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average earning assets decreased $3.6 billion, including a $2 billion decline in loan outstandings. Our customers continue to be cautious in the current economic environment. Average other earning assets, primarily Federal Reserve Bank deposits and investment securities declined $1.6 billion as average excess liquidity was reduced.Non-interest income decreased due to a $97 million decline in securities' gains consistent with our outlook. We continue to carefully control expenses. The fourth quarter results reflected a decrease in regular salaries and incentives, which were more than offset by an increase in severance expense, relating to a planned reduction of 300 full-time equivalent positions. Our workforce has been reduced by about 850 positions or 8% since December 2008. Full year 2009 non-interest expenses decreased 6% from 2008. Our capital position is strong and was further enhanced in the fourth quarter. But Tier 1 Capital ratio increased to an estimated 12.46% at December 31. In addition, the quality of our capital is solid as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 7.99%. Turning to Slide 5, average loan outstandings declined at a slower pace in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Consistent with post-recessionary environments, we had low loan demand in all of our geographic markets, as customers continue to deleverage as they cautiously manage their businesses. Decreased average outstandings in the fourth quarter were noted in virtually every area with the largest declines in Middle Market, Global Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate. Line utilization was 46.8% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter.As shown on Slide 6, we had very strong core deposit growth again in the fourth quarter. We had  growth in Texas, Western and Florida markets and all commercial lines of business. Average core deposits increased $935 million, including a $1.2 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. While deposit rates are significantly lower today, I'm pleased to say that today, we've retained the vast majority of the balances of maturing customer CDs, many of which were put on in late 2008 at rates over 3%. Deposit pricing conditions remained competitive in the fourth quarter, and we believe we have hit rate floors on a number of our products. However, we were able to selectively decrease rates and [indiscernible] deposit categories.As outlined on Slide 7, the net interest margin increased 26 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.94%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.07% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 23 basis points from the third quarter. The increase was primarily a result of lower core deposit rates, maturing higher cost customer CDs and other time deposits and a decrease in excess liquidity. In the fourth quarter, excess liquidity had an approximately 13 basis point negative effect on the margin compared to the 16 basis point impact in the third quarter.Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $2.5 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter, down from an average $3.5 billion in the third quarter. With the maturities of wholesale funding and expected loan growth, we expect excess liquidity will dissipate in the first half of the year. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.Turning to Slide 8, we focused on expense management on a daily basis. Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years, even while we were opening new banking centers. In 2009, in response to the recession and as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage technology and maximize productivity to support growth, full-time equivalent staff decreased by approximately 850 employees or 8%. In 2010, we expect to achieve a further reduction of about 300 positions or about 3% of the total workforce, which will largely be completed by mid-year. These positions are across all lines of business and geographies. In conjunction with this action, we incurred a severance charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized salary savings of about $16 million related to this action are expected going forward. Now Dale Greene, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss credit qualities, starting on Slide 9."

We saw a broad-based improvement in our credit metrics in the fourth quarter. As expected, fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs and the provision for credit losses improved from third quarter levels. Economic conditions continue to be challenging, but we are seeing more encouraging signs that things are improving. Net credit-related charge-offs were $225 million in the fourth quarter, a $14 million reduction from the third quarter. Net charge-offs included $62 million in the Commercial Real Estate line of business, primarily related to residential real-estate development, down from $91 million in the third quarter. The decline in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs reflects the wind down of the California local residential real estate portfolio, and the fact we believe we have been taking the necessary charges to reflect declining values over the past two years.We also continue to see value stabilized in select markets. Provision for credit-related losses of $259 million was $54 million less than the third quarter. The provision exceeded net charge-offs by $34 million compared to $74 million in the third quarter, reflecting the improvement in overall credit performance. The allowance for loan losses was 2.34% of total loans, an increase of 15 basis points from the third quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 83% of non-performing loans.Turning to Slide 10, total non-performing assets declined $13 million to $1.3 billion. Importantly, the inflow to non-performing assets decreased by $95 million in the fourth quarter. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing declined $60 million to $101 million. Foreclosed property held relatively stable. Other real estate expenses in the fourth quarter increased to $22 million from $10 million in the third quarter. This reflects write-downs related to updated appraisals. The average carrying value of these properties is now well below 40% of the original contractual loan amount.Also we believe that the market is starting to stabilize. Therefore, we expect quarterly ORE [official residence expenses] expenses going forward to be less than the fourth quarter level. Our watch list loans decreased by $520 million to $7.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. This reflects an improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.On Slide 11, we provided information on the makeup of the non-accrual loans. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be Commercial Real Estate, which consist primarily of residential real estate development loans. Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans decreased by $47 million in the quarter. Non-accruals also decreased in Middle Market by $17 million. Personal Banking, which falls within other business lines, saw a $25 million increase in non-accruals as the weak economy has taken a toll on some of our residential mortgage customers. Because these are primarily seasoned mortgages, the loss content remains low.During the fourth quarter 2009, $266 million of loan relationships, greater than $2 million, were transferred to non-accrual status, a reduction of $95 million from the third quarter. Of these inflows, Commercial Real Estate line of business contributed $64 million, down from $211 million in the third quarter. Middle Market at $85 million, a small decrease from the third quarter. Inflows increased modestly in several lines of business, such as Small Business, Global Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Science (sic) [Sciences] from low levels.Slide 12, provides further detail on our non-accrual loans. Collateral values on non-accrual loans are reviewed every quarter as part of our credit-quality review process. We have written down non-performing loans by 44% compared to 34% a year ago. The carrying value, plus the reserve, reflected current market conditions. We had $34 million in total trouble debt restructurings or TDRs. This included $18 million in reduced rate loans, primarily residential mortgages, $5 million in other non-performing TDRs and $11 million in performing TDRs.In the fourth quarter, we sold $11 million in loans, four loans, totaling $10 million, were non-performing. The average price was close to carrying values plus reserves. We have seen a firming of prices, particularly for distressed syndicated debt. And we continue to pursue loan sales on a one-off basis.On Slide 13, we provide a breakdown of net credit-related charge-offs by office of loan origination. Net charge-offs in all four major geographic markets declined in the fourth quarter. Within the Midwest, which made up 43% of the total, Middle Market charge-offs declined. Small Business charge-offs were relatively stable, and we saw a small increases in Private Banking and Global Banking.Western market charge-offs made up 38% of the total. The decrease from the third quarter was driven by a decline in residential development-related charge-offs, as well as Global Corporate Banking. Middle Market posted an increase from the third quarter.Texas net charge-offs return to a relatively low level with no particular area of concentration. As far as Florida, net charge-offs declined again in the fourth quarter, as there were no additional significant write-downs on the condo portfolio. Other markets net charge-offs increased with no particular geographic or industry focus.Slide 14, provides detail on net loan charge-offs by line of business. The Commercial Real Estate line of business charge-offs declined, while Middle Market increased as expected. Charge-offs for Wealth and Institutional Management, Small Business and Personal Banking were relatively stable.On slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $194 million from the prior quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. At the December 31, 22% of this portfolio consisted of loans made to residential real estate developers secured by the underlying real estate. Michigan outstandings of $620 million, represented 13% of the portfolio, and were down $142 million from a year ago. Florida outstandings of $553 million represents 11% of the portfolio, and were down $160 million from a year ago.As a shown on Slide 16, as of the end of the fourth quarter, we reduced residential real estate development exposure by $1.2 billion or 54% since June of 2008. Total Single Family construction outstandings were down $785 million or 59% from June 2008. Turning to Slide 17, we displayed project type and geographic breakdown of net charge-offs for the Commercial Real Estate line of business. Consistent with the decline in total Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans and decline in inflows to non-accrual loans, we had a $29 million or 33% decrease in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter for a total of $62 million. Residential real estate development loan charge-offs decreased by over 50% in the fourth quarter. We have seen prices for Single Family home stabilized and even increase in select markets. However, land prices remain soft and in some locations, continue to decline.Charge-offs in non-Residential Real Estate Construction segment increased in the fourth quarter. The majority can be attributed to a single transaction secured by entitled land in California. While we continue to see softness, we believe that non-residential real estate will see far fewer defaults and much lower loss contest than the Residential Construction segment. In fact, we had only one non-residential Commercial Real Estate loan, over $2 million, transferred to non-accrual in the fourth quarter.Total Commercial Real Estate related charge-offs decreased in Western, Texas and other markets. Midwest was stable. As far as Florida, charge-offs have trended downward for the last two quarters. We have limited land exposure in Florida, and Single Family exposure has been managed down for some time. The issues in Florida are primarily related to condo exposure, which totaled about $100 million at December 31, down from about $125 million at the end of September. Condo closings are occurring, but at a very modest level.Slide 18, provides an overview of our consumer loan portfolio. This portfolio is relatively small, representing less than 10% of our total loans. These loans are self-originated and are part of a full-service relationship. The residential mortgages we hold on our balance sheet are primarily associated with our Private Banking customers. Net charge-offs for residential mortgages decreased again in the fourth quarter. The home equity loan portfolio has held up relatively well with a slight increase in charge-offs in the fourth quarter, and 30- and 90-day delinquency rates improved.Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplies portfolio can be found in the appendix. Both portfolios continue to perform well. As far as the auto supplier portfolio, we continue to reduce our loan outstandings, and it now represents only 2% of our total loans. Non-accrual loans and net charge-offs declined significantly in the fourth quarter. The auto dealer average outstandings have declined $1.4 billion or 32% over the past year, in line with falling sales volumes of new cars. And we continue to have excellent credit quality in this portfolio.To conclude on credit, we conduct in-depth reviews of all of our watch list credits, at least quarterly, to ensure that we have an appropriate workout strategy, as well as reserves and carrying values that reflect our collateral assessments. This proactive action has resulted in a current carrying value of non-performing loans of 56%. We are pleased with the improvement in credit metrics in the fourth quarter. These results, as well as an improving macroeconomic statistics, support our outlook for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million for 2010. We expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net charge-offs for the year. And now, I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Turning to Slide 19, our Tier 1 Capital ratio is well in excess of the well-capitalized thresholds, as defined by the regulators and this has increased in each of the past five quarters.Turning to Slide 20, in the intangible common equity ratio. We had maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years. Our tangible common equity ratio, which was 7.99% at the end of the fourth quarter increased from the third quarter. And historically, has been well above the average ratio of our peer group.Slide 21, provides our expectations for 2010, which is based on a modestly improving economic environment. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer, as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We believe we will achieve single-digit period-end-to-period-end loan growth. We expect the securities' portfolio will remain at the current level.Based on the assumption that there will not be an increase in the Fed funds rates in 2010, we expect that net interest margin will increase to 3.15% to 3.25% as a result of maturities of higher cost CDs and wholesale funding, and a reduction in excess liquidity. In addition, we expect the margin will continue to benefit from the improved loan pricing.  Our outlook is for net credit-related charge-offs of $775 million to $825 million. Provision is expected to be slightly in excess of net charge-offs. Non-interest income, excluding 2009 securities gains, is expected to be flat as increases in core fee income are offset by 2009 non-recurring item, such as gains on the repurchase of debt.The expected reduction of pension, FDIC and ORE expense, as well as the continued careful control of discretionary cost is expected to result in low single-digit decrease in expenses. Overall, the many positive signs we saw in the fourth quarter, such as improved credit metrics, continued strong deposit growth, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a significant increase in the net interest margin lead us to believe that we will continue to see improvement in our core operating fundamentals in 2010. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

I believe that given our outlook for charge-offs, and I think we had a question earlier, that we should probably continue to see first half provision continue to be in excess of charge-offs but at a declining rate. And I believe that we are very likely to see provision in the second half of the year be below charge-offs simply because I think we will continue to see improving credit metrics.

Our credit quality improved at a faster pace than we expected and reflecting the strong credit underwriting and processes we have in place.  Our net interest margin continued to expand.  These and other positive developments resulted in our first quarter net income of $52 million, the equivalent of $0.33 per share.  This included a $17 million after tax gain equivalent to $0.11 per share related to the cash settlement of a note receivable associated with the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary.
The negative impact to earnings of the 2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury under its capital purchase program fully redeemed in March was $123 million or $0.79 per share.  Our customers continue to convey a more positive and upbeat tone.  This is reflected in our loan pipeline which has now grown to its highest level in two years.  The small business loan pipeline in our Texas and western markets has increased by double digits in the last three months.
Now that credit is improving, our bankers can devote more time to marketing.  In Texas we are seeing more opportunities and plan to add several new middle market and small business bankers to capitalize on them.  In California, customers and prospects are seeing gradual increases in sales and are more optimistic about their businesses as backlogs are growing.  This has led to more loan proposals particularly for middle market, technology and life sciences companies.
In the western market we have 61% of our national dealer services business.  Floor plan loans are slowly picking up as expected with the increase in auto sales.  In Michigan we had more new and expanded loans approved in middle markets this March than we’ve had in any month since 2008.  As you know, middle market is one of our sweet spots.  Our relationship managers are known for their ingenuity, flexibility, responsiveness and attention to detail.  We stand out from the competition because of our experience, expertise and long standing commitments to our customers through all economic cycles including the current one.  It is not something that is replicated over night.
New and renewed loan commitments for our bank as a whole totals $6 billion in the first quarter.  We are ideally positioned to develop new relationships and expand existing ones as the economy continues its recovery.  The decline in loan outstandings we saw in the fourth quarter 2009 slowed in the first quarter 2010 and the pace of decline moderated in each successive month of the first quarter.  Average loan outstandings increased modestly in national dealer services.
Core deposit growth continued in the first quarter but at a slower pace.  In certain business lines deposits have decreased which we believe is a positive sign that customers are starting to use their cash in their businesses.  We are pleased with the continued broad based improvements in credit quality including significant declines in net charge offs and provision for loan losses.  These positive improvements are the result of our focused efforts to quickly and pro actively identify and work through problem loans.
We saw improvement in credit quality across all business lines.  Net credit related charge offs decreased $52 million in the first quarter led by a significant decline in commercial net charge offs.  The commercial real estate business line experienced an increase in net charge offs but saw declines in non-accrual and watch list loans.  Non-performing assets decreased $41 million and the provision for credit losses decreased $77 million.  
Non-accrual loans were charged down 44% as of March 31, the same as December 31, 2009.  Our watch list loans were down $228 million.  We continued to diligently manage credit throughout this economic cycle.  The net interest margin increased 24 basis points to 3.18% in the first quarter primarily from improved loan spreads, a less costly blend of core deposits and maturing higher cost wholesale funding.  Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.42%.  
We continue to focus on expense controls.  Non-interest expenses decreased $21 million from the fourth quarter.  Full-time equivalent staff decreased 481 employees or 5% from March 31, 2009.  Our capital position remains strong.  Our Tier-1 capital ratio is estimated to be 10.4% at March 31.  In addition, the quality of our capital remains solid as evidenced by a tangible common equity ratio of 9.68%.  Together with our strong liquidity, we are ideally positioned for future growth.
On March 17th we fully redeemed the 2.25 billion of preferred stock held by the US Treasury under its capital purchase program, five days after completing the public issuance of 880 million of common stock.  Our participation in the capital purchase program helped stabilize the country’s financial system at a critical point and the investment the government made in Comerica resulted in excellent returns for US tax payers. 
We elected not to repurchase the related warrant from the US Treasury as we believe it is best to retain capital for future growth.  The warrant allows the holder to purchase 11.5 million shares at an exercise price of $29.40 per share.  Given the present market price for Comerica common stock, the warrant has significant value.
In closing, we believe we are on the path to normalized earnings with great opportunities to develop new relationships and expand existing ones.  We have a consistent strategy for success that is based on relationships with a mean street banking focus.  Based on all of the positive trends we are seeing, we expect our operating fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010.  Now, I’ll turn the call over to Beth and John who will discuss our first quarter results in more detail.

Turning to Slide Three, we outline the major components of our first quarter results compared to the prior period and to the same period a year ago.  Today, we reported first quarter 2010 net income of $52 million.  This included $17 million from discontinued operations reflecting a cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of Munder, our former investment advisory subsidiary.  
After preferred dividends to the US Treasury of $123 million or $0.79 per share, the net loss attributable to common shares was $71 million or $0.46 per diluted share.  I’ll describe the preferred stock redemption further in a moment.  In the first quarter 2010, before preferred dividends continuing operations were profitable both on a pre-tax basis as well as after tax.  
Slide Four provides highlights of the financial results for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.  Credit quality metrics continue to improve.  Net credit related charge offs decreased by $52 million from the fourth quarter to $173 million.  The provision for credit losses was $182 million, $77 million less than the fourth quarter.  Non-performing assets declined $41 million and the inflow to non-accrual slowed by $21 million to $245 million.  
The net interest margin in the first quarter increased 24 basis points to 3.18%.  Maturing higher cost funding and improved loan spreads contributed to the increase.  The low return on excess liquidity had a 24 basis point negative impact which I’ll describe in more detail in a moment.  We continue to carefully control expenses.  Non-interest expenses decreased 5% and included a decrease in salaries and benefits as well as lower ORE costs.  We fully redeemed 2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury after successfully completing an 880 million common stock offering.  Our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 9.68%.  
Turning to Slide Five, I will review the details of the redemption of the 2.25 billion of preferred stock which was issued to the US Treasury under its capital purchase program.  On March 12th we completed the issuance of $880 million of common stock and net proceeds along with available cash at the holding company fully redeemed the preferred stock on March 17th.  In the first quarter in addition to the $24 million quarterly cash dividend and the $5 million non-cash accretion of the discount on the preferred stock we also incurred a onetime $94 million non-cash redemption charge reflecting the accelerated accretion of the remaining discount for a total impact of $0.79 per share.
We have elected not to repurchase the warrant that was issued in conjunction with the preferred stock in order to preserve capital in support of future growth.  On April 12th the US Treasury announced that it intends to auction the warrants of Comerica as well as other banks in the course of the next several weeks.  
The pace at which average loans declined continued to slow throughout the first quarter as slow on Slide Six.  Average loans declined $1.4 billion in the first quarter compared to the $2 billion decline in the fourth quarter.  This pattern of reduced demand is consistent with historical post recessionary environments.  Our customers are feeling more confident about the economic recovery and we are seeing our loan pipelines grow.  
We expect middle market and small businesses will start borrowing as their working capital needs increase in line with economic growth.  Regarding FAS 166 and 167, both accounting standards were adopted as of January 1st and the effect was not significant.  No additional entities were consolidated as a result of the new accounting guidance.  
Turning to Slide Seven, our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies.  National dealer services average outstandings increased modestly in the first quarter.  Decreased average outstandings in the first quarter were noted in a number of areas but the largest declines in middle market, commercial real estate and global corporate banking.  Line utilization was 45.2% in the first quarter down from 46.8% in the fourth quarter and stabilized in the last month of the quarter.
As shown on Slide Eight, core deposit growth continued in the first quarter but at a slower rate than recent quarters.  We had growth in Texas and Florida markets and most commercial lines of business.  Average core deposits increased $494 million including a $942 million increase in money market and NOW deposits and $194 million increase in non-interest bearing deposits.  This was partially offset by a $650 million decrease in higher cost customer CDs.  Modest declines were noted in small business in all of our markets as well as middle market in the Midwest and western markets.  We believe this is a positive sign that customers are starting to use their cash in their businesses.  
As outlined on Slide Nine, the net interest margin increased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 3.18%.  Without the 24 basis point negative impact from excess liquidity the net margin would have been 3.42% in the first quarter, an increase of 35 basis points from the fourth quarter.  The increase in the margin was driven primarily by continued loan spread expansion, a less costly blend of core deposits and maturities of higher cost wholesale funding.
Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $4.1 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve in the first quarter, up from an average $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter.  Maturities of wholesale funding and expected loan growth will assist in dissipating excess liquidity.  This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.  
Turning to Slide 10, non-interest expenses decreased 5% in the first quarter.  Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore management of staff levels is key.  As you can see on the Slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years even while we were opening new banking centers.  Our work force decreased by approximately 5% from year ago levels.  Salary and employee benefit expense was down 6% from the first quarter of last year.  In addition, ORE expense declined by $10 million in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and we continued to tightly control discretionary expenses.  
Now, John Killian, our chief credit officer will discuss credit qualities starting on Slide 11.

Net credit related charge offs and the provision for credit losses improved significantly from fourth quarter levels.  Net credit related charge offs were $173 million in the first quarter, $52 million reduction from the fourth quarter led by a significant decline in commercial net charge offs.
Commercial net charge offs of $42 million or 80 basis points have not been at this level since the third quarter of 2008.  Provision for credit losses of $182 million was $77 million less than the fourth quarter.  The provision exceeded net credit related charge offs by $9 million compared to $34 million in the fourth quarter reflecting the improvement in overall credit performance.  The allowance for loan losses was 2.42% of total loans, an increase of eight basis points from the fourth quarter.  The allowance for loan losses was 85% of non-performing loans.
Turning to Slide 12 total non-performing assets declined $41 million to $1.25 billion.  Importantly, the inflow to non-performing assets decreased by $21 million in the first quarter.  This marks the third consecutive quarter of decline.  Foreclosed property declined $22 million to $89 million.  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing declined $18 million to $83 million.  Our watch list loans decreased by $228 million to $7.5 billion at the end of the first quarter.  This is the second consecutive quarter of decline and reflects improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.
Slide 13 provides detail on the declining trend in net loan charge offs.  Total net loan charge offs declined $51 million to $173 million.  The decline can be attributed primarily to the middle market which declined $37 million or almost 50% from last quarter to $39 million and global corporate banking which was down $24 million to only $2 million in net charge offs in the first quarter.  Net loan charge offs in the commercial real estate business in the first quarter of 2010 increased to $86 million from $62 million in the fourth quarter 2009.  We expect that we will continue to see some variability here with an overall downward trend.
Net charge offs declined to $42 million in the Midwest market and $21 million in the western market while we saw a $12 million increase in Texas primarily as a result of charges taken on two commercial real estate projects.  On Slide 14, we provide information on the makeup of non-accrual loans.  The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the commercial real estate line of business which decreased $16 million in the quarter.  Non-accruals also decreased in global corporate banking by $30 million and middle market by $7 million.
During the first quarter $245 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status, a reduction of $21 million from the fourth quarter.  Of these inflows, commercial real estate contributed $129 million.  Global corporate banking had no inflows to non-accruals greater than $2 million compared to $42 million last quarter.  Middle market had $63 million down $21 million from the fourth quarter.  Also, in flows decreased modestly in several lines of business such as small business.
We sold $44 million of non-performing loans in the quarter as well as $12 million in performing loans and several short sales whereby we settle a note with the borrower at less than par.  In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves.  This continues to support our analysis of valuations.  
On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our commercial real estate line of business which declined $191 million from the fourth quarter.  There is further detail provided in the appendix to these Slides.  Total outstandings of $4.6 billion were down $749 million from a year ago.  This included a $472 million decrease in the western market, $190 million decrease in Florida and a $139 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge offs for our commercial real estate line of business by project type and geography.  Residential real estate development loan charge offs remained at similar levels as the fourth quarter.  We have seen prices for single family homes stabilize and even increase in select areas.  However, land prices remain soft and in some locations continue to decline.  Charge offs in the non-residential real estate construction segment increased in the first quarter.  While we continued to see softness, we believe that non-residential real estate will see far fewer defaults and much lower loss content than the residential construction segment.
While net charge offs for commercial real estate increased in the first quarter in comparison with the fourth quarter the remain well below the peak in the second quarter of last year.  In flows to non-accrual increased to $129 million compared to $64 million in the fourth quarter but well below the peak last year of $211 million in the third quarter.  Commercial real estate non-accrual and watch list loans declined in the first quarter and this along with our analysis of migration patterns for the last several quarters all supports our belief that negative migration is receding.
As shown on Slide 17, as of the end of the first quarter, we reduced residential real estate development exposure by $1.3 billion or 58% since June of 2008 to $964 million at March 31, 2010.  Total single family construction outstandings were down $844 million or 64% from June 2008.  There are additional slides in the appendix which provide further detail on certain segments.  
The consumer portfolio representing approximately 10% of our total loans continues to perform relatively well.  The Slide detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix.  Both portfolios continue to perform as expected.  As far as the auto supplier portfolio is concerned, loan outstandings now represent less than 2.5% of our total loans.  Non-accrual loans continued to decline in the first quarter.  The auto dealer average outstandings have declined $815 million or 20% over the past year in line with falling sales volumes of new cars.  We continue to have excellent credit quality in this portfolio.  
To conclude on credit, we conduct in depth reviews of all of our watch list credits at least quarterly to ensure that we have an appropriate work out strategy as well as reserves and carrying values that reflect our collateral assessment.  This proactive strategy has resulted in a current carrying value of non-performing loans of 56%.  We are pleased with the improvement in credit metrics in the first quarter.  These results, as well as the positive trends we have seen in macroeconomic statistics support our updated outlook for net credit related charge offs of $675 million to $725 million for the full year 2010 which is a $100 million decrease from our previous outlook.  We expect the provision for credit losses will be consistent with net charge offs for the year.
Now, I’ll turn the call back to Beth.

We have maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years.
Slide 19 provides and update on our outlook for 2010 which is based on a modestly improving economic environment.  We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators.  We expect that C&I borrowings will grow as working capital needs increase and will be partially offset by declining commercial real estate outstandings.  As a result, we believe we will achieve low single digit loan growth from March 31st period end to December 31st period end.  We expect the securities portfolio to remain at the current level.
Based on the assumption there will not be an increase in the Fed Funds rate in 2010 we expect a net interest margin of 325 to 335.  This is a 10 basis point increase from our prior outlook of 315 to 325.  While excess liquidity has not dissipated as quickly as we expected, loan spread expansion and the level of non-interest bearing deposits have exceeded our expectations.  
Our outlook is for net credit related charge offs of $675 to $725 million.  Provision is expected to be consistent with net charge offs.  As John mentioned there is a $100 million decline from our prior outlook as a result of the positive trends we are seeing in both the economic environment and our credit metrics.  Non-interest income excluding 2009 securities gains is expected to be flat to a low single digit decrease as we believe retail service charges on deposit accounts and market related fees such as brokerage and fiduciary will continue to be impacted by the cautious behavior of our customers.  
The expected reduction of pension, FDIC and ORE expense as well as the continued careful control of discretionary costs is expected to result in the low single digit decrease in expenses.  Overall, the many positive trends that continued in the first quarter such as improved credit metrics, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a significant increase in the net interest margin, lead us to believe we will continue to see improvement in our core operating fundamentals in 2010.
Now, we’d be happy to answer any questions that you have.

We do have $2.4 billion in debt maturities between now and the end of the year.  In addition, as we have mentioned, we do expect some modest amount of loan growth particularly summer time through the end of the year so a combination of those will certainly reduce the excess liquidity and certainly to levels below where it was last year on average.  So I think we’re comfortable that we will see a dissipation.  But, you’re right the pace of it is we’ve made an assumption that it will dissipate largely by the end of the year in our margin outlook.  As you saw, we did increase our outlook for NIM by 10 basis points really driven by very good loan spread situation and higher deposit levels than we were expecting so that is a positive thing.  
When you think about the guidance we gave you and you pick the midpoint of that guidance, for the rest of the year we’d have to average about 334 for the NIM to work out to that guidance we gave you.  So we certainly are expecting further improvements part of which is also helped by we have about $650 million of retail brokerage CDs maturing in the second quarter which have a yield over 4%.  So we’re positive about where the NIM is heading as evidenced by the improvement in the outlook we gave.

We’re pretty much past the construction risk in that portfolio because we really haven’t made very many new real estate construction loans in about three years.  When you talk about the uptick in commercial real estate charge offs and NPA inflow, I think it’s important to put it in proper context to remember our overall credit trends.  We’ve seen improvement for three quarters now in charge offs, NPA inflows and past dues and we’ve seen improvement for two quarters now in overall NPAs, provision and the watch list.  
The uptick in commercial real estate charge offs and in flows related to credits that were previously identified and were in fact on the watch list for commercial real estate, they were not a surprise.  They were just moving through the workout process and as we analyzed the data we saw that commercial real estate NPAs were still down in the first quarter.  We saw that the commercial real estate watch list was down by $100 million in the first quarter and then we analyzed the commercial real estate migration for the last several quarters and all those items supported our belief that the negative migration is receding.
That being said, there’s still a lot of work to do on commercial real estate as you can see from the absolute numbers.  While we think there may be variability as we certainly saw this quarter, and as we said in prior quarters, we think the overall trend is going in the right direction.

We’ve spent quite a bit of time up there lately kind of talking to customers, talking to our people and there’s a renewed sense of optimism certainly in the middle market and small business.  You’ve got to remember, starting from a fairly low level of not really having much optimism.  I think the autos have shown some strengthening, obvious you’re seeing that GM has repaid a substantial part of what they owe the tax payers so I think that has helped.  
Without any doubt we are seeing some good opportunities in that market.  It’s not a market that will grow in any kind of a robust fashion.  If you believe economic forecasts it probably grows at maybe 1% to 1.5% over the next year or so.  I wouldn’t suspect that we’d do much more than that if that but I think the good news is that the core customer base we’ve been through, we’ve taken whatever loans we’ve needed to take and it’s really been very strong when you consider how long that economy has been in a recession.  So I think from a credit quality perspective things are clearly improving and from a revenue growth perspective I think there are opportunities but I think it’s fairly muted.  But nonetheless we like to see the optimism.

The encouraging signs we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued into the first quarter of 2010. Our credit quality improved at a faster pace than we expected and reflecting the strong credit underwriting and processes we have in place.",959,"Good morning. The encouraging signs we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued into the first quarter of 2010. Our credit quality improved at a faster pace than we expected and reflecting the strong credit underwriting and processes we have in place. Our net interest margin continued to expand. These and other positive developments resulted in our first quarter net income of $52 million, the equivalent of $0.33 per share. This included a $17 million after-tax gain equivalent to $0.11 per share related to the cash settlement of a note receivable associated with the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. 
The negative impact to earnings of the $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program, fully redeemed in March was $123 million or $0.79 per share. Our customers continue to convey a more positive and upbeat tone. This is reflected in our loan pipeline, which has now grown to its highest level in two years. 
The small business loan pipeline in our Texas and Western markets has increased by double digits in the last three months. Now that credit is improving, our bankers can devote more time to marketing. In Texas, we are seeing more opportunities and plan to add several new middle market and small business bankers to capitalize on them. 
In California, customers and prospects are seeing gradual increases in sales and are more optimistic about their businesses as backlogs are growing. This has led to more loan proposals, particularly for middle market and technology and life sciences companies. 
In the Western market, we have 61% of our National Dealer Services business. Floor plan loans are slowly picking up as expected with the increase in auto sales. In Michigan, we had more new and expanded loans approved in middle market this March than we've had in any month since 2008. 
As you know, middle market is one of our sweet spots. Our relationship managers are known for their ingenuity, flexibility, responsiveness and attention to detail. We stand out from the competition because of our experience, expertise and long-standing commitments to our customers through all economic cycles, including the current one. It is not something that is replicated overnight. 
New and renewed loan commitments for our bank as a whole, totaled $6 billion in the first quarter. We are ideally positioned to develop new relationships and expand existing ones as the economy continues its recovery. The decline in loan outstandings we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 slowed in the first quarter of 2010, and the pace of decline moderated in each successive month of the first quarter. 
Average loan outstandings increased modestly in National Dealer Services. Core deposit growth continued in the first quarter, but at a slower pace. In certain business lines, deposits have decreased, which we believe is a positive sign that customers are starting to use their cash in their businesses. We are pleased with the continued broad-based improvements in credit quality, including significant declines in net charge-offs and provision for loan losses. These positive improvements are the result of our focused efforts to quickly and proactively identify and work through problem loans. We saw improvement in credit quality across all business lines. 
Net credit related charge-offs decreased $52 million in the first quarter, led by a significant decline in commercial net charge-offs. The Commercial Real Estate business line experienced an increase in net charge-offs, but saw declines in non-accrual and watch list loans. 
Non-performing assets decreased $41 million and the provision for credit losses decreased $77 million. Non-accrual loans were charged down 44% as of March 31, the same as December 31, 2009. Our watch list loans were down $228 million. We continued to diligently manage credit throughout this economic cycle. 
The net interest margin increased 24 basis points to 3.18% in the first quarter, primarily from improved loan spreads, a less costly blend of core deposits and maturing higher cost wholesale funding. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.42%. 
We continue to focus on expense controls. Non-interest expenses decreased $21 million from the fourth quarter. Full time equivalent staff decreased to 481 employees or 5% from March 31, 2009. Our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 capital ratio is estimated to be 10.4% at March 31. In addition, the quality of our capital remains solid, as evidenced by a tangible common equity ratio of 9.68%. Together with our strong liquidity, we are ideally positioned for future growth.
On March 17, we fully redeemed the $2.25 billion of preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program, five days after completing the public issuance of $880 million of common stock. Our participation in the Capital Purchase Program helped stabilize the country's financial system at a critical point and the investment, the government made in Comerica, resulted in excellent returns for U.S. taxpayers. 
We elected not to repurchase the related warrant from the U.S. Treasury, as we believe it is best to retain capital for future growth. The warrant allows the holder to purchase 11.5 million shares at an exercise price of $29.40 per share, given the present market price for Comerica common stock, the warrant has significant value.
In closing, we believe we are on the path to normalized earnings with great opportunities to develop new relationships and expand existing ones. We have a consistent strategy for success that is based on relationships with a main street banking focus. Based on all of the positive trends we are seeing, we expect our operating fundamentals will continue to show improvement in 2010. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our first quarter results in more detail."

As I review our first quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. 
Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our first quarter results compared to the prior period and at the same period a year ago.  Today, we reported first quarter 2010 net income of $52 million. This included $17 million from discontinued operations, reflecting the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of Munder, our former investment advisory subsidiary. 
After preferred dividends, the U.S. Treasury of $123 million or $0.79 per share, the net loss attributable to common shares was $71 million or $0.46 per diluted share. I'll describe the preferred stock redemption further in a moment. In the first quarter of 2010, before preferred dividends, continuing operations were profitable, both on a pretax basis, as well as after tax.
Slide 4 provide highlights of the financial results for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Credit quality metrics continue to improve. Net credit related charge-offs decreased by $52 million from the fourth quarter to $173 million. The provision for credit losses was $182 million, $77 million less than the fourth quarter. Non-performing assets declined $41 million and the inflow to non-accrual slowed by $21 million to $245 million. 
The net interest margin in the first quarter increased 24 basis points to 3.18%. Maturing higher cost funding and improved loan spreads contributed to the increase. The low return on excess liquidity had a 24 basis point negative impact, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. 
We continue to carefully control expenses. Non-interest expenses decreased 5% and included a decrease in salaries and benefits, as well as lower ORE costs. We fully redeemed $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, after successfully completing an $880 million common stock offering. Our capital position remains strong, as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 9.68%.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll review the details of the redemption of the $2.25 billion of preferred stock, which was issued to U.S. Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program. On March 12, we completed the issuance of $880 million of common stock and the net proceeds, along with available cash at the holding company, fully redeemed the preferred stock on March 17. 
In the first quarter, in addition to the $24 million quarterly cash dividend and the $5 million non-cash accretion of the discount on the preferred stock, we also incurred a one-time $94 million non-cash redemption charge, reflecting the accelerated accretion of the remaining discount for a total impact of $0.79 per share. We have elected not to repurchase the warrant that was issued in conjunction with the preferred stock in order to preserve capital in support of future growth. On April 12, the U.S. Treasury announced its intent to auction the warrants of Comerica, as well as other banks in the course of the next several weeks.
The pace at which average loans declined continue to slow throughout the first quarter, as shown on Slide 6. Average loans declined $1.4 billion in the first quarter compared to the $2 billion decline in the fourth quarter. This pattern of reduced demand is consistent with historical post-recessionary environments. 
Our customers are feeling more confident about the economic recovery, and we're seeing our loan pipelines grow. We expect middle market and small businesses will start borrowing as the working capital needs increase in line with economic growth. Regarding FAS 166 and 167, both accounting standards were adopted as of January 1, and the effect was not significant. No additional entities were consolidated as a result of the new accounting guidance.
Turning to Slide 7, our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. National Dealer Services average outstandings increased modestly in the first quarter. Decreased average outstandings in the first quarter were noted in a number of areas with the largest declines in middle market, Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate banking. Line utilization was 45.2% in the first quarter, down from 46.8% in the fourth quarter and stabilized in the last month of the quarter.
As shown on Slide 8, core deposit growth continued in the first quarter but at a slower rate than recent quarters. We have growth in Texas and Florida markets and most commercial lines of business. Average core deposits increased $494 million, including a $942 million increase in money market and NOW deposits, and a $194 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. This was partially offset by a $650 million decrease in higher cost customer CDs. 
Modest declines were noted in Small Business in all of our markets, as well as middle markets in the Midwest and Western markets. We believe this is a positive sign that customers are starting to use their cash in their businesses.
As outlined on Slide 9, the net interest margin increased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 3.18%. Without the 24 basis point negative impact from excess liquidity, the net margin would have been 3.42% in the first quarter, an increase of 35 basis points from the fourth quarter. The increase in the margin was driven primarily by continued loan spread expansion, a less costly blend of core deposits and maturities of higher-cost wholesale funding. 
Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $4.1 billion deposit with the Federal Reserve in the first quarter, up from an average $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Maturities of wholesale funding and expected loan growth will assist in dissipating excess liquidity. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.
Turning to Slide 10, non-interest expenses decreased 5% in the first quarter. Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years, even while we were opening new banking centers. Our workforce decreased by approximately 5% from year ago levels. 
Salary and employee benefits expense was down 6% from the first quarter of last year. In addition, ORE expense declined by $10 million in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. And we continue to tightly control discretionary expenses. 
Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss credit quality starting on Slide 11."
318670,99736672,56891,"Comerica Incorporated, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Good morning.

Net credit related charge-offs and the provision for credit losses improved si",1164,"Good morning. The broad-based improvement in our credit metrics that we saw in the fourth quarter continued in the first quarter and improved at a faster pace than we expected. Net credit related charge-offs and the provision for credit losses improved significantly from fourth quarter levels. Net credit related charge-offs were $173 million in the first quarter, a $52 million reduction from the fourth quarter led by a significant decline in commercial net charge-offs. 
Commercial net charge-offs of $42 million or 80 basis points have not been at this level since the third quarter of 2008. Provision for credit losses of $182 million was $77 million less than the fourth quarter. The provision exceeded net credit related charge-offs by $9 million compared to $34 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the improvement in overall credit performance. The allowance for loan losses was 2.42% of total loans, an increase of 8 basis points from the fourth quarter. The allowance for loan losses was 85% of non-performing loans. 
Turning to Slide 12, total non-performing assets declined $41 million to $1.25 billion. Importantly, the inflow to non-performing assets decreased by $21 million in the first quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of decline. Foreclosed property declined $22 million to $89 million. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing declined $18 million to $83 million. Our watch list loans decreased by $228 million to $7.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline and reflects improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.
Slide 13 provides the detail on the declining trend in net loan charge-offs. Total net loan charge-offs declined $51 million to $173 million. The decline can be attributed primarily to middle market, which declined $37 million or almost 50% from last quarter to $39 million and Global Corporate banking, which was down $24 million to only $2 million in net charge-offs in the first quarter. 
Net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business in the first quarter 2010 increased to $86 million from $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect that we will continue to see some variability here with an overall downward trend. 
Net charge-offs declined $42 million in the Midwest market and $21 million in the Western market, while we saw a $12 million increase in Texas, primarily as a result of charges taken on two commercial real estate projects.
On Slide 14, we provide information on the makeup of non-accrual loans. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the Commercial Real Estate line of business, which decreased $16 million in the quarter. Non-accruals also decreased in Global Corporate banking by $30 million and middle market by $7 million. 
During the first quarter, $245 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status, a reduction of $21 million from the fourth quarter. Of these inflows, Commercial Real Estate contributed $129 million, Global Corporate banking had no inflows to non-accrual greater than $2 million compared to $42 million last quarter. Middle market had $63 million, down $21 million from the fourth quarter. Also, inflows decreased modestly in several lines of business such as small business. 
We sold $44 million of non-performing loans in the quarter, as well as $12 million in performing loans and several short sales, whereby, we settle a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continues to support our analysis of valuations.
On Slide 15, we provided detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $191 million from the fourth quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. Total outstandings of $4.6 billion were down $749 million from a year ago. This included a $472 million decrease in the Western market, $190 million decrease in Florida and a $139 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial Real Estate line of business by project type and geography. Residential real estate development loan charge-offs remained at similar levels as the fourth quarter. We have seen prices for single-family homes stabilized and even increase in select areas. However, land prices remain soft and in some locations, continued to decline. 
Charge-offs in the Non-residential Real Estate Construction segment increased in the first quarter. While we continue to see softness, we believe that non-residential real estate will see far fewer defaults and much lower loss content than the Residential Construction segment. 
While net charge-offs for Commercial Real Estate increased in the first quarter in comparison with the fourth quarter, they remain well below the peak in the second quarter of last year. Inflows to non-accrual increased to $129 million compared to $64 million in the fourth quarter, but well below the peak last year of $211 million in the third quarter. Commercial Real Estate non-accrual and watch list loans declined in the first quarter. And this, along with our analysis of migration patterns for the last several quarters, all supports our belief that negative migration is receding.
As shown on Slide 17, as of the end of the first quarter, we reduced Residential Real Estate Development exposure by $1.3 billion or 58% since June of 2008 to $964 million at March 31, 2010. Total single-family construction outstandings were down $844 million or 64% from June 2008. There are additional slides in the appendix, which provide further detail on certain segments. 
The consumer portfolio representing approximately 10% of our total loans continues to perform relatively well. Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. Both portfolios continue to perform as expected. As far as the auto supplier portfolio is concerned, loan outstandings now represent less than 2.5% of our total loans. Non-accruals loans continue to decline in the first quarter. The auto dealer average outstandings have declined $815 million or 20% over the past year in line with falling sales volumes of new cars. We continued to have excellent credit quality in this portfolio.
To conclude on credit, we conduct in-depth reviews of all of our watch list credits at least quarterly to ensure that we have an appropriate workout strategy, as well as reserves and carrying values that reflect our collateral assessment. This proactive strategy has resulted in a current carrying value of non-performing loans of 56%. 
We are pleased with the improvement in credit metrics in the first quarter. These results, as well as the positive trends we have seen in macro economic statistics, support our updated outlook for net credit related charge-offs of $675 million to $725 million for the full year 2010, which is a $100 million decrease from our previous outlook. We expect the provision for credit losses will be consistent with net charge-offs for the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Our capital position is strong, and historically, we've had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. We have maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years. 
Slide 19 provides an update on our outlook for 2010, which is based on a modestly improving economic environment. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer, as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We expect that C&I borrowings will grow as working capital needs increase, and will be partially offset by declining Commercial Real Estate outstandings. As a result, we believe we will achieve low single-digit loan growth from March 31 period end to December 31 period end. We expect the securities portfolio to remain at the current level. 
Based on the assumption there will not be an increase in the Fed funds rate in 2010, we expect that net interest margin of 3.25% to 3.35%. This is a 10 basis point increase from our prior outlook of 3.15% to 3.25%. While excess liquidity has not dissipated as quickly as we expected, loan spread expansion and the level of non-interest-bearing deposits have exceeded our expectations. 
Our outlook is for net credit related charge-offs of $675 million to $725 million. Provision is expected to be consistent with net charge-offs. As John mentioned, there is $100 million decline from our prior outlook as a result of the positive trends we're seeing in both the economic environment and our credit metrics. 
Non-interest income, excluding 2009's securities gains is expected to be flat to a low single-digit decrease, as we believe retail service charges on deposit accounts and market-related fees such as brokerage and fiduciary, will continue to be impacted by the cautious behavior of our customers. The expected reduction of pension, FDIC and ORE expense, as well as the continued careful control of discretionary costs, is expected to result in a low single-digit decrease in expenses. 
Overall, the many positive trends that continued in the first quarter, such as improved credit metrics, a slower pace of decline in loan demand and a significant increase in the net interest margin, lead us to believe we will continue to see improvement in our core operating fundamentals in 2010.

In addition as we have mention, we do expect some modest amount of loan growth, particularly summertime through the end of the year.

But you're right, the pace of it is we've made an assumption that will dissipate largely through by  the end of the year in our margin outlook.

We're pretty much past the construction risk in that portfolio because we really haven't made very many new real estate construction loans in about three years. When you talk about the uptick in commercial real estate charge-offs and NPA inflow, I think it's important to put it in proper context to remember our overall credit trends. We've seen improvement for three quarters now in charge-offs NPA inflow and past dues, and we've seen improvement for two quarters now and overall NPAs provision and the watch list. The uptick in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs and inflow related to credits that were previously identified and were in fact on the watch list for Commercial Real Estate, they were not a surprise. They were just moving through the workout process. And as we analyze the data, we saw that Commercial Real Estate NPAs were still down in the first quarter. We saw that the Commercial Real Estate watch list was down by $100 million in the first quarter. And then we analyzed the commercial real estate migration for the last several quarters. And all those items supported our belief that the negative migration is receding. Now That being said, there's still a lot of work to do on Commercial Real Estate as you can see from the absolute numbers. And while we think there may be a variability as we certainly saw this quarter and as we've said in prior quarters, we think the overall trend is going in the right direction."

Without any doubt, we are seeing some good opportunities in that market. Is that a market that will grow in any kind of robust fashion? If you believe economic forecast probably grows at any 1%, 1.5% over the next few years or so. I wouldn't suspect that we do much more than that, if that.

Today we reported second quarter net income of $70 million or $0.39 per share. Second quarter total revenue increased over the first quarter and was up almost 5% compared to the second quarter last year, excluding securities gains. Our financial results will reflect the positive trends we have seen over several quarters. This includes three consecutive quarters of broad based improvement in credit quality with leading indicators of future credit quality also pointing positive. Our net interest margin continued to expand and our expenses remain well controlled.
We have strong capital and liquidity to support future growth with the flexibility to grow organically, as well as by acquisition. We continue to reach out to our customers taking their pulse on the economy, their current financial needs and future plans. As a relationship-focused ‘Main Street’ bank, this type of proactive outreach is how we differentiate ourselves. Since the onset of the economic downturn, we stepped-up our calling efforts to be sure we were ideally positioned to assist our customers in navigating the economic environment and to meet their needs as the economy improves.
While the pace of the economic recovery remains uncertain and our customer remain cautious, they are preparing for future growth. This is reflected in our loan pipeline, which is at its highest level in more than two years. Also, economic factors which support loan growth such as business, fixed investment and inventories continue to rise. We view these as encouraging and hopeful signs for the future.
The Middle Market banking teams and all of our markets report they are seeing more opportunities again due to the consistent calling efforts of our relationship managers and executive teams. The resulting new business gains include customers and prospects with an eye on acquisitions or expansions. These are full service relationships with good companies that look to us as a trusted financial advisor. We continue to see good opportunities in Texas and are adding a new small business Healthcare Profession Group to capitalize on this growing segment.
In California, our Technology and Life Sciences division has seen an increase in opportunities too, including the recent addition of more than 35 customers in the alternative energy sector. As the economy continues to improve, technology and life sciences firms are turning to Comerica because of our experience and expertise in serving this segment.
In Michigan, backlogs are continuing to grow and we are getting more interest from prospects as the economy continues to improve in that state. New and renewed loan commitments for our bank as a whole totaled $10.5 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an uptick in new commitments and the seasonality of renewals. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in the second quarter. We are pleased to see that line utilization has remained relatively stable since the middle of the first quarter.
Second quarter average core deposits increased $1.7 billion from the first quarter. The continued broad based improvement in credit quality reflects our early recognition of issues and our ability to quickly and proactively work through problem loans. Overall, charge-offs declined in the second quarter with a notable decrease in commercial real estate charge-offs. The pace of improvement in credit quality is significant and faster than we had expected. A key indicator of future credit quality is our watch list loans, which are down $851 million from the first quarter. As a result of the positive trends we have seen, we have reduced our charge-off outlook for full-year 2010.
The net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.28% in the second quarter, primarily from maturing higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. 
We continue to focus on expense controls. Noninterest expenses decreased $7 million from the first quarter. Our capital position remains strong and together with our strong liquidity we will help support our growth. As far as acquisition opportunities, we continue to look for those that would fit from a financial, geographic and cultural perspective. It is our sense that industry merger and acquisition activity will pick up much sooner than many may expect.
We are focused on opportunities in the urban markets of Texas and California, where we continue to grow organically through our banking center expansion program. With respect to financial reform, we have made a preliminary assessment of the impacts to Comerica. Ralph, go into more detail, but the bottom line is we expect to compare a quite favorably to our peers and larger banks, while it will take some time for regulators to implement any new rules both the industry and Comerica are expected to respond with new products and services to generate revenue opportunities and offset costs.
Our implementation efforts to support the Regulation E amendment continue on schedule and our banking center personnel relationship managers and customer contact staff and the tools they need to assist our customers with their participation decisions with respect to overdraft services. 
The Fed is now expecting slower economic growth, regardless of the pace of recovery we are focused on generating improving returns. We plan to do this in number of ways through targeted investments and increasing market share in our higher growth markets. 
By the proactive management of credit issues, just as we have done throughout this cycle. By maximizing relationship returns through the cross selling of products and services and by our effective management of expenses. We will continue to grow new relationships and expand existing ones with the confidence we are in the right markets with the right people and a full array of products and services to make a positive difference for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our second quarter results in more detail.

As I review our second quarter results I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.Turning to slide three, we outline the major components of our second quarter results compared t",936,"Thank you, Ralph. As I review our second quarter results I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.
Turning to slide three, we outline the major components of our second quarter results compared to the prior period and to the same period a year ago. Today we reported second quarter 2010 net income from continuing operations of $70 million, compared to $35 million for the first quarter. The diluted earnings per share was $0.39 for the second quarter.
The second quarter results reflected a lower provision for credit loss and the benefit of the full redemption of the preferred stock held by the US Treasury in the first quarter. Second quarter total revenue increased over the first quarter and was up almost 5% in comparison with second quarter last year, excluding net securities gains.
Slide four provides highlights of the financial results for the second quarter, compared to the first quarter. Credit quality metrics continue to improve, net credit related charge-offs decreased by $27 million from the first quarter to $146 million. The provision for credit losses was $126 million or $56 million less than the first quarter.
Non-performing assets declined $37 million and the inflow to nonaccrual slowed by $46 million to $199 million. The loss was declined by $851 million the net interest margin in the second quarter increased 10 basis points to 3.28% with little change from the impact of excess liquidity. The increase in the margin was primarily due to the maturities of higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. 
We continue to carefully control expenses, noninterest expenses decreased 2% primarily a result of a decrease in credit related expenses. Our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.11%. The pace at which average loans declined continued to slow as shown on slide 5.
Average loans declined $641 million in the second quarter, compared to the $1.4 billion decline in the first quarter. On a period end basis, total loans increased $62 million from March 31 to June 30 excluding commercial real estate lineup business which declined $305 million.
We expect to see commercial loan growth as working capital needs increased and this will be muted by decline in commercial real estate loan outstandings. Over half of the decline in average outstandings in the second quarter was in commercial real estate. Loan outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services, Private Banking and Technology and Life Sciences.
Decreased average outstandings in the second quarter were noted in a number of areas with the largest declines in commercial real estate, global corporate banking, energy and middle market.
Turning to slide 6, our loan portfolio was well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole has remained stable at about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. Our customers are feeling cautiously optimistic and we are seeing our loan pipelines grow, this includes commitment issued but not yet closed which increased a $151 million in the second quarter to $588 million. 
Also we expect middle market and small businesses will start borrowing as their working capital needs increase. As shown on slide 7, strong core deposit growth continued in the second quarter, as core deposits increased $1.7 billion including $1.3 billion increase in money market and NOW deposits and a $594 million increase in noninterest bearing deposits.
This was partially offset by $246 million decline in customer [CDs]. We had growth in all geographic markets and all business segments. The largest increase was in the financial services division, which primarily specializes in working with title and escrow companies and has expanded to include other deposit rich segments. 
We also saw a robust growth in Global Corporate Banking, Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, Small Business, Personal Banking and Wealth Management. Declines were noted in Commercial Real Estate as well as Middle Market. 
As outlined on slide eight, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points in the second quarter to 3.28%. Without the 23 basis point negative impact from excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.51% in the second quarter. The increase in the margin was driven primarily by maturities of higher-cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. 
Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3.7 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank in the second quarter, a $373 million decline from first quarter. The excess liquidity position at June 30 was $3.3 billion. We expect that excess liquidity will remain at these levels for the rest of the year due to sluggish loan demand and strong deposit levels. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity. 
Turning to slide nine, noninterest expenses decreased $7 million or 2% in the second quarter. Credit-related costs declined $14 million with ORE expense declining by $7 million and the provision for lending-related commitments down $7 million. 
Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore management of staff level is key. As you can see on this slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 4% from year-ago levels and is 20% lower than it was at the end of 2001. Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a result of annual merit increases, higher stock-based compensation and one more day in the quarter.
Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss credit quality starting on slide 10.

318670,108343947,68112,"Comerica Incorporated, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Good morning. For the third consecutive quarter we saw broad-based improvement in our credit metrics, and the improvement occurred at a faster pace than we expected. Net charge-offs and provision for credit losses improved considerably from first quarter",1087,"Good morning. For the third consecutive quarter we saw broad-based improvement in our credit metrics, and the improvement occurred at a faster pace than we expected. Net charge-offs and provision for credit losses improved considerably from first quarter levels. The second quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $27 million to $146 million in the second quarter.
Provision for credit losses of $126 million was $56 million less than the first quarter. The provision was less than charge-offs for the first time this cycle, reflecting our overall credit performance including improving migration trends. The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 86% of total non-performing loans.
Slide 11 provides detail on net loan charge-offs. Net credit-related charge-offs declined to $146 million, led by a $50 million decline in commercial real estate net charge-offs. Middle market net charge-offs were $71 million with $26 million attributed to a middle market National Specialty Group which manages a $500 million portfolio of higher leveraged transactions. We are exiting this business and have established incremental reserves. Excluding this group, middle market charge-offs were $45 million, up slightly from $39 million recorded in the first quarter and well below quarterly charge-off levels last year.
By market, charge-offs declined $17 million in Western, $17 million in Texas, $4 million in Midwest, and increased $19 million in other geographic markets, primarily due to the middle market specialty group I just discussed.
Turning to slide 12. Total non-performing assets declined $37 million to $1.2 billion. Importantly, the inflow to non-performing assets decreased by $46 million in the second quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of decline. We review workout strategies, reserves and the carrying values for each individual non-performing loan at least quarterly. This proactive strategy has contributed to the decline in non-performing assets as well as an average carrying value of our non-performing assets of 55% compared to contractual values.
On slide 13, we provide information and the makeup of the nonaccrual loans. The largest portion of the nonaccrual loans continues to be the commercial real estate line of business, which decreased $103 million in the quarter. Nonaccruals increased modestly from low levels in middle market by $31 million, private banking by $24 million and global corporate banking by $13 million.
During the second quarter $199 million of loan relationships, greater than $2 million, were transferred to nonaccrual status, a reduction of $46 million from the first quarter. Of these inflows, $118 million were in middle market, primarily Midwest and other markets; $33 million were in the commercial real estate business line, which is a $95 million decrease from last quarter; and $30 million were in private banking.
TDRs increased from $48 million to $99 million in the second quarter. We sold $47 million of non-performing loans in the quarter as well as $15 million in performing loans and $18 million in short sales, whereby we settle a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continues to support our analysis of valuations. On slide 14, we have our watch list loans which decreased by $851 million to $6.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, substandard and nonaccrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality. This is the third consecutive quarter of decline and reflects improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $115 million. While this is a $32 million increase from last quarter’s low level, it was almost half of the cyclical peak of $210 million a year ago. Loans past due 30 to 89 days decreased $118 million to $338 million.
Foreclosed property remained relatively stable at $93 million. On slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our commercial real estate line of business, which declined $305 million on a period end basis from the end of the first quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides.
Total outstandings of $4.3 billion were down $912 million from a year ago. This included a $584 million decrease in the Western Market, $159 million decrease in Florida and $149 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our commercial real estate line of business by project type and geography. Net charge-offs for commercial real estate decreased $50 million in the second quarter. Charge-offs declined as values continue to stabilize and even improve in certain locations. Charge-offs fell in every project type and in all markets except Michigan where we have a slide uptick from a relatively low level.
Inflows to nonaccrual greater than $2 million decreased substantially and nonaccrual and watch list loans also declined in the second quarter. We continue to believe that we will see some variability in charge-offs with a general downward trend.
I’d like to take a moment to address a couple of current areas of interest. As far as European exposure, we have no direct sovereign risk and our exposure to the European banking sector is predominantly within the higher rated countries and primarily relates to the facilitating trade and corporate banking activities for our customers. As far as the Gulf of Mexico drilling exposure within our $1.1 billion energy portfolio, we have only a handful of customers that service the Gulf and no customers that have substantial revenues derived from deepwater drilling. Finally, our municipality exposure is less than $100 million and has been performing well.
There are additional slides in the appendix which provide further detail on certain segments. The consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans continues to perform relatively well. The slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of these portfolios.
To conclude on credit, we are pleased that the continued improvement in credits metrics, we have seen over the past several quarters, including improving migration trends. These results support our updated outlook for net credit related charge-offs of $600 million to $650 million for the full-year 2010, which is a $75 million decrease from our previous outlook. We expect the provision for credit losses will be less than net charge-offs for the full year.
Now I will turn the call back to Beth.

Turning to slide 17 in our capital ratios, our capital position is strong and historically we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. We have maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity",596,"Thanks, John. Turning to slide 17 in our capital ratios, our capital position is strong and historically we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. We have maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years.
Turning to slide 18, we have provided an overview of the key pieces of financial reform that are relevant to Comerica. You can see that our assessment based on currently available information is that the expected direct impacts of financial reform are manageable. With rule making and a possible correction bill still to come, it will be some time before we can provide more precise estimates.
Importantly, we also see opportunities in financial reform and we will be working to develop product and pricing strategies that will enable Comerica to continue to grow profitably in this quickly evolving environment. Overall, we believe that the direct adverse impact of financial reform will be felt less like Comerica than by many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
Regarding Reg-E, our implementation remains on schedule and often rates are similar to our expectations. Based on the trends we have been seeing, we anticipate a reduction in fee income of approximately $5 million for the second half of the year.
Slide 19 provides an update on our outlook for 2010, which is based on uncertain pace of economic recovery. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer as loan growth typically lacks other positive economic indicators. We expect that C&I borrowings will grow as working capital needs increase and will be partially offset by declining commercial real estate outstandings as a results we believe loan outstandings will remain stable from June 30 period end to December 31 period end.
We expect the securities portfolio excluding auction rate securities to remain at the current level of about $6.5 billion. Excess liquidity has not dissipated as quickly as we have expected as strong deposit growth and continued subdued loan demand have deferred from our assumptions. Therefore we have lowered the net interest margin forecast by five basis points which solely reflects our updated expectations regarding excess liquidity continuing resulting in higher earning asset levels.
Our outlook is for net credit related charge off of 600 million to 650 million. The full year provision as we expect it to be less than net charge off. As John mentioned this is a $75 million decline from our prior outlook as a result of the continued positive trends we are seeing in our credit metrics. Noninterest income excluding 2009 securities gain is expected to decline low to mid single digits, this is a reduction from our prior outlook, primarily as a result of the lackluster performance of the stock market in the second quarter. We believe retail service charges on deposit accounts and market related fees such as brokerage and fiduciary will continue to be impacted by the cautious behavior of our customers.
Our expense outlook is unchanged, but continued careful control of cost is expected to result in a low single digit decrease in expenses. 
Overall, we saw many positive trends continue in the second quarter, such as improved credit metrics a slow pace of decline in loan demand terrific deposit growth and a significant increase in the net interest margin. We believe that our relationship approach has served us well throughout this economic cycle and will assist us in attracting new business and grow existing relationships as the recovery continues.
Now, we’d be happy to answer any questions you may have.

But, having said that, we see a lot of positive indicators in the quarter. And when we talk, you mention pipeline. It takes time for the pipeline to actually turn into business or in some cases we are making proposals to prospects that we may or may not get the business.
So there is mixture of things, deals in the pipeline that come at different paces. But if you look at the fact that line utilization is stabilized that our decline in commitment, not just loans, but in commitments in these second quarter was substantially less than the decline in commitments in the first quarter. We also saw an increase in new commitments, the best we’ve seen in the last five quarters and we did see growth in at period end in commercial part of things including real estate. 
So there are lot of things that feel like, there are loan outstanding coming they will come, it’s just a little slower than I think we had expected. And the economy was a little weaker in the second quarter than I think many of us expected.
In terms of the rest of the guidance the securities portfolio is the same (inaudible) as we gave in April and lastly though we are expecting little higher earning assets than we had previously expected because we were not assuming that the excess liquidity which is on deposit with the Fed. We had earlier said that that would dissipate through the balance of this year now we are saying it will remain through the balance of this year. That impacts margin because earning assets are higher, but it doesn’t necessarily impact our net interest income.

We had a higher stock compensation expense in the quarter, really resulting from; we updated the models that we used in the first quarter. So the first quarter ended up being lower than what it would normally have been. So the variance quarter over quarter is an increase in the second quarter.
So when you add all those things together, salaries were up, salary and benefits, up $10 million compared to the prior quarter.

As you know, we reach out in the second quarter and it is allowed by the regulators to try and get a verbal read on as many of these SNIC credits as we can and we continue to do that this year and reflected those items in the second quarter where it was appropriate. And as a result, our outlook for the third quarter on the SNIC portfolio, is that we will probably again continue to fare consistent with the way our portfolio goes overall. For example, SNIC outstandings have been down the last couple of quarters as following our portfolio trends.
Our SNIC charge-offs in the second quarter were $21 million versus $40 million in the first quarter are in PLs that are SNICS. We are $229 million at the end of the second quarter versus $283 million at the end of the first quarter. The watch list was down $400 million in the second quarter. So, the SNIC portfolio continues to mirror our overall portfolio and our relationship approach and we would expect those trends to continue on the third quarter.

We have always been looking for the right potential acquisitions that would increase or expand our presence in the urban market, so it’s especially Texas and California. My comment really was I think there will be some opportunities there. Having said that, we are beginning to ramp up our investment in our banking centers as we had slowed that during the significant downturn in the economy, we are not going back quite yet to where it was, but it is time with especially a lead time of approximately 18 months or so after you’re buying property to start ramping that back up. And so, we are being cautious, we think the turn is going to be slower than many of us expected, but I think there are going to be opportunities both for organic as well as potentially acquisition.

The dealer floor plan piece number one: it’s certainly always seasonal, but I would also tell you that we picked a number of new dealer relationships, simply by pursuing the strategy we have always pursued of dealing with top tier dealers and getting good referrals from our existing customer base. So, a growth that you have seen in the dealer book is at least partially due to the fact that we’ve got some new relationships. And when I talk about pipeline, our dealer pipeline is also quite nice for us and obviously for us that’s been a very successful business.
So, if there is much customer acquisition as it is, any increases in employing, and depending on auto sales obviously that will have a direct impact on the level of inventories, et cetera, et cetera. But it is seasonal. We are in kind of a seasonal low or we will be in the July-August timeframe, and then coming back out of that in the fall is the new model [set].
As it relates to the rest of the C&I book and clearly we are seeing a lot of good growth opportunities as we have indicated earlier in the Western Market and in Texas, and particularly in the middle market side in both California and Texas. And we’ve seen some opportunities in the Michigan or the Midwest market as well, and there is some nice pipeline there as well for good middle market small business type of customer.

Today, we reported second quarter net income of $70 million or $0.39 per share. Second quarter total revenue increased over the first quarter and was up almost 5% compared to the second quarter last year, excluding securities gains. Our financial results reflect the positive trends we have seen over several quarters. This includes three consecutive quarters of broad-based improvement in credit quality with leading indicators of future credit quality also pointing positive. 
Our net interest margin continued to expand and our expenses remained well controlled. We have strong capital and liquidity to support future growth with the flexibility to grow organically as well as by acquisition.
We continue to reach out to our customers, taking their pulse on the economy, their current financial needs and future plans. As a relationship-focused Main Street bank, this type of proactive outreach is how we differentiate ourselves. Since the onset of the economic downturn, we stepped up our calling efforts to be sure we were ideally positioned to assist our customers in navigating the economic environment and to meet their needs as the economy improves. 
While the pace of the economic recovery remains uncertain, and our customers remain cautious, they are preparing for future growth. This is reflected in our loan pipeline which is at its highest level in more than two years. Also, economic factors which support loan growth such as business fixed investment and inventories continue to rise. We view these as encouraging and hopeful signs for the future.
Middle Market Banking teams in all of our markets report they are seeing more opportunities, again due to consistent calling efforts of our relationship managers and executive teams. The resulting new business gains include customers and prospects with an eye on acquisitions or expansions. These are full-service relationships with good companies that look to us as their trusted financial advisor. 
We continue to see good opportunities in Texas and are adding a new Small Business Health Care Profession Group to capitalize on this growing segment.  In California, our Technology and Life Sciences Division has seen an increase in opportunities too, including the recent addition of more than 35 customers in the alternative energy sector. As the economy continues to improve, Technology and Life Sciences firms are turning the Comerica because of our experience and expertise in serving this segment.  In Michigan, backlogs are continuing to grow, and we are getting more interest from prospects as the economy continues to improve in that state. 
New and renewed loan commitments for our bank as a whole totaled $10.5 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an uptick in new commitments and the seasonality of renewals. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in the second quarter. We are pleased to see that line utilization has remained relatively stable since the middle of the first quarter. 
Second quarter average core deposits increased $1.7 billion from the first quarter. The continued broad-based improvement in credit quality reflects our early recognition of issues and our ability to quickly and proactively work through problem loans. 
Overall, charge-offs declined in the second quarter with a notable decrease in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs. The pace of improvement in credit quality is significant and faster than we had expected. A key indicator of future credit quality is our watch list loans which are down $851 million from the first quarter. As a result of the positive trends we have seen, we have reduced our charge-off outlook for full year 2010.
The net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.28% in the second quarter, primarily from maturing higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. We continue to focus on expense controls. Noninterest expenses decreased $7 million from the first quarter. 
Our capital position remains strong and together with our strong liquidity will help support our growth. As far as acquisition opportunities, we continue to look for those that would fit from a financial, geographic and cultural perspective. It is our sense that industry merger and acquisition activity will pick up much sooner than many may expect. We are focused on opportunities in the urban markets of Texas and California where we continue to grow organically through our banking center expansion program. 
With respect to financial reform, we have made a preliminary assessment of the impacts to Comerica. Beth will go into more detail, but the bottom line is we expect to compare quite favorably to our peers and  larger banks. While it would take some time for regulators to implement any new rules, both the industry and Comerica are expected to respond with new products and services to generate revenue opportunities and offset costs.
Our implementation efforts to support the Regulation E amendment continue on schedule, and our banking center personnel, relationship managers and customer contact staff have the tools they need to assist our customers with their participation decisions with respect to overdraft services. 
The Fed is now expecting slower economic growth. Regardless of the pace of recovery, we are focused on generating improving returns. We plan to do this a number of ways: through targeted investments and increasing market share in our higher growth markets; by the proactive management of credit issues just as we have done throughout this cycle; by maximizing relationship returns through the cross-selling of products and services and by our effective management of expenses. 
We will continue to grow new relationships and expand existing ones with confidence we are in the right markets with the right people and a full array of products and services to make a positive difference for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our second quarter results in more detail."

As I review our second quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.Turning to Slide 3, we outline the major components of our second quarter results compared to t",935,"Thank you, Ralph. As I review our second quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.
Turning to Slide 3, we outline the major components of our second quarter results compared to the prior period and to the same period a year ago. Today we reported second quarter 2010 net income from continuing operations of $70 million compared to $35 million for the first quarter. The diluted earnings per share were $0.39 for the second quarter. The second quarter results reflected a lower provision for credit losses and the benefit of the full redemption of the preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury in the first quarter. 
Second quarter total revenue increased over the first quarter and was up almost 5% in comparison with second quarter last year, excluding net securities gains.
Slide 4 provides highlights of the financial results for the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Credit quality metrics continue to improve. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased by $27 million from the first quarter to $146 million. The provision for credit losses was $126 million or $56 million less than the first quarter. 
Nonperforming assets declined $37 million and the inflow to nonaccrual slowed by $46 million to $199 million. The watch list declined by $851 million. The net interest margin in the second quarter increased 10 basis points to 3.28% with little change from the impact of excess liquidity. The increase in the margin was primarily due to the maturities of higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. We continue to carefully control expenses. Noninterest expenses decreased 2%, primarily a result of a decrease in credit-related expenses. Our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.11%.
The pace at which average loans declined continue to slow as shown on Slide 5. Average loans declined $641 million in the second quarter compared to the $1.4 billion decline in the first quarter. On a period end basis, total loans increased $62 million from March 31 to June 30, excluding Commercial Real Estate line of business which declined $305 million. We expect to see commercial loan growth as working capital needs increase, and this will be muted by declines in Commercial Real Estate loan outstandings. 
Over half of the decline in average outstandings in the second quarter was in Commercial Real Estate. Loan outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services, Private Banking and Technology and Life Sciences. Decreased average outstandings in the second quarter were noted in a number of areas with the largest declines in Commercial Real Estate, Global Corporate Banking, Energy and Middle Market.
Turning to Slide 6, our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole has remained stable at about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. Our customers are feeling cautiously optimistic, and we are seeing our loan pipelines grow. This includes commitments issued but not yet closed, which increased $151 million in the second quarter to $588 million. Also, we expect Middle Market and Small Businesses will start borrowing as their working capital needs increase.
As shown on Slide 7, strong core deposit growth continued in the second quarter. Our core deposits increased $1.7 billion, including a $1.3 billion increase in money market and NOW deposits and a $594 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. This was partially offset by a $246 million decline in customer CDs. 
We had growth in all geographic markets and all business segments. The largest increase was in the Financial Services Division, which primarily specializes in working with title and escrow companies and has expanded to include other deposit-rich segments. We also saw robust growth in Global Corporate Banking, Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, Small Business, Personal Banking and Wealth Management. Declines were noted in Commercial Real Estate as well as Middle Market.
As outlined on Slide 8, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points in the second quarter to 3.28%. Without the 23 basis point negative impact from excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.51% in the second quarter. The increase in the margin was driven primarily by maturities of higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. 
Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3.7 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank in the second quarter, a $373 million decline from the first quarter. The excess liquidity position at June 30 was $3.3 billion. We expect that excess liquidity will remain at these levels for the rest of the year due to sluggish loan demand and strong deposit levels. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the Investment Securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.
Turning to Slide 9, noninterest expenses decreased $7 million or 2% in the second quarter. Credit-related costs declined $14 million with ORE expense declining by $7 million, and the provision for lending-related commitment down $7 million. Our largest expense item is salaries, and therefore management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 4% from year-ago levels and is 20% lower than it was at the end of 2001. 
Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a result of annual merit increases, higher stock-based compensation and one more day in the quarter. Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer, will discuss credit quality starting on Slide 10."

For the third consecutive quarter, we saw broad-based improvement in our credit metrics and the improvement occurred at a faster pace than we expected. Net charge-offs and its provision for credit losses improved considerably from first quarter levels. 
The second quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $27 million to $146 million in the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $126 million was $56 million less than the first quarter. The provision was less than charge-offs for the first time this cycle, reflecting our overall credit performance, including improving migration trends.
The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 86% of total nonperforming loans. 
Slide 11 provides detail on net loan charge-offs. Net credit-related charge-offs declined to $146 million, led by a $50 million decline in Commercial Real Estate net charge-offs. Middle Market net charge-offs were $71 million with $26 million attributed to a Middle Market National Specialty Group which manages a $500 million portfolio of higher-leveraged transactions. We are exiting this business and have established incremental reserves.  Excluding this group, Middle Market charge-offs were $45 million, up slightly from $39 million recorded in the first quarter, and well below quarterly charge-off levels last year. By market, charge-offs declined $17 million in Western, $17 million in Texas, $4 million in Midwest and increased $19 million in other geographic markets, primarily due to the Middle Market Specialty Group I just discussed.
Turning to Slide 12, total nonperforming assets declined $37 million to $1.2 billion. Importantly, the inflow to nonperforming assets decreased by $46 million in the second quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of decline. We review workout strategies, reserves and the carrying values for each individual nonperforming loan at least quarterly. This proactive strategy has contributed to the decline in nonperforming assets, as well as an average carrying value of our nonperforming assets of 55% compared to contractual values.
On Slide 13, we provide information on the makeup of the nonaccrual loans. The largest portion of the nonaccrual loans continues to be the Commercial Real Estate line of business, which decreased $103 million in the quarter. Nonaccruals increased modestly from low levels in Middle Market by $31 million, Private Banking by $24 million and Global Corporate Banking by $13 million. 
During the second quarter, $199 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a reduction of $46 million from the first quarter. Of these inflows, $118 million were in Middle Market, primarily Midwest and other markets, $33 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which is a $95 million decrease from last quarter, and $30 million were in Private Banking.
TDRs increased from $48 million to $99 million in the second quarter. We sold $47 million of nonperforming loans in the quarter, as well as $15 million in performing loans and $18 million in short sales, whereby we settle a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continues to support our analysis of valuations.
On Slide 14, we have our watch list loans which decreased by $851 million to $6.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, substandard and nonaccrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality. This is the third consecutive quarter of decline and reflects improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business. 
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $115 million. While this is a $32 million increase from last quarter's low level, it was almost half of the cyclical peak of $210 million a year ago. Loans past dues 30 to 89 days decreased $118 million to $338 million. Foreclosed property remained relatively stable at $93 million.
On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $305 million on a period end basis from the end of the first quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. 
Total outstandings of $4.3 billion were down $912 million from a year ago. This included a $584 million decrease in the Western market, $159 million decrease in Florida and $149 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial Real Estate line of business by project type and geography. Net charge-offs for Commercial Real Estate decreased $50 million in the second quarter. Charge-offs declined as values continue to stabilize and even improve in certain locations. Charge-offs fell in every project type and in all markets except Michigan where we had a slight uptick from a relatively low level. Inflows to nonaccrual greater than $2 million decreased substantially, and nonaccrual and watch list loans also declined in the second quarter. We continue to believe that we will see some variability in charge-offs with a general downward trend.
I'd like to take a moment to address a couple of current areas of interest. As far as European exposure, we have no direct sovereign risk, and our exposure to the European banking sector is predominantly within the higher-rated countries and primarily relates to facilitating trade and corporate banking activities for our customers.  As far as Gulf of Mexico drilling exposure, within our $1.1 billion Energy portfolio, we have only a handful of customers that service the Gulf and no customers that have substantial revenues derived from deepwater drilling.  Finally, our Municipality's exposure is less than $100 million and has been performing well. There are additional slides in the appendix which provide further detail on certain segments.
The Consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans, continues to perform relatively well. Slides detailing our Auto Dealer and Automotive Supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of these portfolios. 
To conclude on credit, we are pleased that the continued improvement in credit metrics we have seen over the past several quarters, including improving migration trends. These results support our updated outlook for net credit-related charge-offs of $600 million to $650 million for full year 2010, which is a $75 million decrease from our previous outlook. We expect the provision for credit losses will be less than net charge-offs for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Our capital position is strong, and historically we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. We have maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years.
Turning to Slide 18, we have provided an overview of the key pieces of financial reform that are relevant to Comerica. You can see that our assessment, based on currently available information, is that the expected direct impacts of financial reform are manageable. With rule making and a possible correction bill still to come, it will be some time before we can provide more precise estimates.  Importantly, we also see opportunities in financial reform, and we will be working to develop product and pricing strategies that will enable Comerica to continue to grow profitably in this quickly-evolving environment. 
Overall, we believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than by many other major banks due to the nature of our business. Regarding Reg E, our implementation remains on schedule and often rates are similar to our expectations. Based on the trends we have been seeing, we anticipate a reduction in fee income of approximately $5 million for the second half of the year.
Slide 19 provides an update on our outlook for 2010, which is based on an uncertain pace of economic recovery. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We expect that C&I borrowings will grow as working capital needs increase and will be partially offset by declining Commercial Real Estate outstandings. As a result, we believe loan outstandings will remain stable from June 30 period end to December 31 period end. We expect the Securities portfolio, excluding auction rate securities, to remain at the current level of about $6.5 billion.
Excess liquidity has not dissipated as quickly as we had expected, as strong deposit growth and continued subdued loan demand have differed from our assumptions. Therefore, we have lowered the net interest margin forecast by five basis points which solely reflects our updated expectations regarding excess liquidity continuing, resulting in higher earning asset levels. 
Our outlook is for net credit-related charge-offs of $600 million to $650 million. The full year provision is expected to be less than net charge-offs. As John mentioned, this is a $75 million decline from our prior outlook as a result of the continued positive trends we are seeing in our credit metrics. Noninterest income, excluding 2009 securities gains, is expected to decline low to mid-single digits. This is a reduction from our prior outlook, primarily as a result of the lackluster performance of the stock market in the second quarter. We believe retail service charges on deposit accounts and market-related fees such as brokerage and fiduciary will continue to be impacted by the cautious behavior of our customers. Our expense outlook is unchanged. The continued careful control of cost is expected to result in a low single-digit decrease in expenses.
Overall, we saw many positive trends continue in the second quarter such as improved credit metrics, a slower pace of decline in loan demand, terrific deposit growth and a significant increase in the net interest margin. We believe that our relationship approach has served us well throughout this economic cycle and will assist us in attracting new business and grow existing relationships as the recovery continues. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

But having said that, we see a lot of positive indicators in the quarter. And when we talked -- you mentioned pipeline. It takes time for the pipeline to actually turn into business, or in some cases we are making proposals to prospects that we may or may not get the business. So there's a mixture of things, deals in the pipeline that come at different paces. But if you look at the fact that line utilization is stabilized, that our decline in commitments, not just loans but in commitments in the second quarter, was substantially less than the decline in commitments in the first quarter, we also saw an increase in new commitments, the best we've seen in the last five quarters. And we did see growth in a period end in Commercial side of things, including Real Estate. So there are a lot of things that feel like there are loan outstandings coming. They will come. It's just a little slower than I think we had expected. And the economy was a little weaker in the second quarter than I think many of us expected. In terms of the rest of the guidance, the Securities portfolio is the same at $6.5 billion as we gave in April. And lastly though, we are expecting a little higher earning assets than we had previously expected because we are not assuming that the excess liquidity, which is on deposit with the Fed, we had earlier said that, that would dissipate through the balance of this year. And now we are saying it will remain through the balance of this year. That impacts margin because earning assets are higher, but it doesn't necessarily impact net interest income."

Salaries were up in the quarter $10 million. We had several factors driving that despite having a lower headcount in the second quarter compared to the first. One is the annual merit increases. A year ago for many of our people, we weren't granting merit increases as an example. We had one more day in the quarter which also impacts things. We had higher stock compensation expense in the quarter really resulting from we updated the models that we used in the first quarter so the first quarter ended up being lower than what it would normally have been. So the variance quarter-over-quarter is an increase in the second quarter. So when you add all those things together, salaries were up -- salaries and benefits up $10 million compared to the prior quarter. But if you look at certainly levels year-over-year, we're still very stable in terms of the expense base despite a lot of different moving parts, whether it's healthcare expense, whether it's pension expense, et cetera."

As you know, we reach out in the second quarter, as is allowed by the regulators, to try and get a verbal read on as many of these SNC credits as we can. And we continue to do that this year and reflected those items in the second quarter where it was appropriate. And as a result, our outlook for the third quarter on the SNC portfolio is that we'll probably again continue to fare consistent with the way our portfolio goes overall. For example, SNC outstandings have been down the last couple of quarters following our portfolio trends. Our SNC charge-offs in the second quarter were $21 million versus $40 million in the first quarter. Our NPLs that are SNCs were $229 million at the end of the second quarter versus $283 million at the end of the first quarter. The watch list was down $400 million in the second quarter. So the SNC portfolio continues to mirror our overall portfolio and our relationship approach, and we would expect those trends to continue in the third quarter."

But I would also tell you that we picked up a number of new dealer relationships simply by pursuing a strategy we've always pursued of dealing with top tier dealers and getting good referrals from our existing customer base.

And when I talk about pipeline, Dealer pipeline is also quite nice for us, and obviously for us, that's been a very successful business.

A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website.
We continue to see good opportunities in Texas and are adding a new Small Business Health Care Profession Group to capitalize on this growing segment.  In California, our Technology and Life Sciences Division has seen an increase in opportunities too, including the recent addition of more than 35 customers in the alternative energy sector. As the economy continues to improve, Technology and Life Sciences firms are turning the Comerica because of our experience and expertise in serving this segment.  In Michigan, backlogs are continuing to grow, and we are getting more interest from prospects as the economy continues to improve in that state.
New and renewed loan commitments for our bank as a whole totaled $10.5 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an uptick in new commitments and the seasonality of renewals. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in the second quarter. We are pleased to see that line utilization has remained relatively stable since the middle of the first quarter.
Second quarter average core deposits increased $1.7 billion from the first quarter. The continued broad-based improvement in credit quality reflects our early recognition of issues and our ability to quickly and proactively work through problem loans.
Overall, charge-offs declined in the second quarter with a notable decrease in Commercial Real Estate charge-offs. The pace of improvement in credit quality is significant and faster than we had expected. A key indicator of future credit quality is our watch list loans which are down $851 million from the first quarter. As a result of the positive trends we have seen, we have reduced our charge-off outlook for full year 2010.
The net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.28% in the second quarter, primarily from maturing higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. We continue to focus on expense controls. Noninterest expenses decreased $7 million from the first quarter.
Our capital position remains strong and together with our strong liquidity will help support our growth. As far as acquisition opportunities, we continue to look for those that would fit from a financial, geographic and cultural perspective. It is our sense that industry merger and acquisition activity will pick up much sooner than many may expect. We are focused on opportunities in the urban markets of Texas and California where we continue to grow organically through our banking center expansion program.
With respect to financial reform, we have made a preliminary assessment of the impacts to Comerica. Beth will go into more detail, but the bottom line is we expect to compare quite favorably to our peers and  larger banks. While it would take some time for regulators to implement any new rules, both the industry and Comerica are expected to respond with new products and services to generate revenue opportunities and offset costs.
Our implementation efforts to support the Regulation E amendment continue on schedule, and our banking center personnel, relationship managers and customer contact staff have the tools they need to assist our customers with their participation decisions with respect to overdraft services.
The Fed is now expecting slower economic growth. Regardless of the pace of recovery, we are focused on generating improving returns. We plan to do this a number of ways: through targeted investments and increasing market share in our higher growth markets; by the proactive management of credit issues just as we have done throughout this cycle; by maximizing relationship returns through the cross-selling of products and services and by our effective management of expenses.
We will continue to grow new relationships and expand existing ones with confidence we are in the right markets with the right people and a full array of products and services to make a positive difference for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our second quarter results in more detail."
318670,108343947,68231,"Comerica Incorporated, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph. As I review our second quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.Turning to Slide 3, we outline the major components of our second quarter results compared to t",935,"Thank you, Ralph. As I review our second quarter results, I will be referring to slides that we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings.
Turning to Slide 3, we outline the major components of our second quarter results compared to the prior period and to the same period a year ago. Today we reported second quarter 2010 net income from continuing operations of $70 million compared to $35 million for the first quarter. The diluted earnings per share were $0.39 for the second quarter. The second quarter results reflected a lower provision for credit losses and the benefit of the full redemption of the preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury in the first quarter. Second quarter total revenue increased over the first quarter and was up almost 5% in comparison with second quarter last year, excluding net securities gains.
Slide 4 provides highlights of the financial results for the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Credit quality metrics continue to improve. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased by $27 million from the first quarter to $146 million. The provision for credit losses was $126 million or $56 million less than the first quarter.
Nonperforming assets declined $37 million and the inflow to nonaccrual slowed by $46 million to $199 million. The watch list declined by $851 million. The net interest margin in the second quarter increased 10 basis points to 3.28% with little change from the impact of excess liquidity. The increase in the margin was primarily due to the maturities of higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits. We continue to carefully control expenses. Noninterest expenses decreased 2%, primarily a result of a decrease in credit-related expenses. Our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.11%.
The pace at which average loans decline continued to slow as shown on Slide 5. Average loans declined $641 million in the second quarter compared to the $1.4 billion decline in the first quarter. On a period end basis, total loans increased $62 million from March 31 to June 30, excluding Commercial Real Estate line of business which declined $305 million. We expect to see commercial loan growth as working capital needs increase, and this will be muted by declines in Commercial Real Estate loan outstandings.
Over half of the decline in average outstandings in the second quarter was in Commercial Real Estate. Loan outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services, Private Banking and Technology and Life Sciences. Decreased average outstandings in the second quarter were noted in a number of areas with the largest declines in Commercial Real Estate, Global Corporate Banking, Energy and Middle Market.
Turning to Slide 6, our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole has remained stable at about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. Our customers are feeling cautiously optimistic, and we are seeing our loan pipelines grow. This includes commitments issued but not yet closed, which increased $151 million in the second quarter to $588 million. Also, we expect Middle Market and Small Businesses will start borrowing as their working capital needs increase.
As shown on Slide 7, strong core deposit growth continued in the second quarter. Our core deposits increased $1.7 billion, including a $1.3 billion increase in money market and NOW deposits and a $594 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. This was partially offset by a $246 million decline in customer CDs.
We had growth in all geographic markets and all business segments. The largest increase was in the Financial Services Division, which primarily specializes in working with title and escrow companies and has expanded to include other deposit-rich segments. We also saw robust growth in Global Corporate Banking, Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, Small Business, Personal Banking and Wealth Management. Declines were noted in Commercial Real Estate as well as Middle Market.
As outlined on Slide 8, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points in the second quarter to 3.28%. Without the 23 basis point negative impact from excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.51% in the second quarter. The increase in the margin was driven primarily by maturities of higher cost wholesale funding and a less costly blend of core deposits.
Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3.7 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank in the second quarter, a $373 million decline from the first quarter. The excess liquidity position at June 30 was $3.3 billion. We expect that excess liquidity will remain at these levels for the rest of the year due to sluggish loan demand and strong deposit levels. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the Investment Securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.
Turning to Slide 9, noninterest expenses decreased $7 million or 2% in the second quarter. Credit-related costs declined $14 million with ORE expense declining by $7 million, and the provision for lending-related commitment down $7 million. Our largest expense item is salaries, and therefore management of staff levels is key. As you can see on the slide, we have consistently reduced personnel over the past several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 4% from year-ago levels and is 20% lower than it was at the end of 2001.
Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a result of annual merit increases, higher stock-based compensation and one more day in the quarter. Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer, will discuss credit quality starting on Slide 10."

For the third consecutive quarter, we saw broad-based improvement in our credit metrics and the improvement occurred at a faster pace than we expected. Net charge-offs and its provision for credit losses improved considerably from first quarter levels.
The second quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $27 million to $146 million in the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $126 million was $56 million less than the first quarter. The provision was less than charge-offs for the first time this cycle, reflecting our overall credit performance, including improving migration trends.
The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 86% of total nonperforming loans.
Slide 11 provides detail on net loan charge-offs. Net credit-related charge-offs declined to $146 million, led by a $50 million decline in Commercial Real Estate net charge-offs. Middle Market net charge-offs were $71 million with $26 million attributed to a Middle Market National Specialty Group which manages a $500 million portfolio of higher-leveraged transactions. We are exiting this business and have established incremental reserves.  Excluding this group, Middle Market charge-offs were $45 million, up slightly from $39 million recorded in the first quarter, and well below quarterly charge-off levels last year. By market, charge-offs declined $17 million in Western, $17 million in Texas, $4 million in Midwest and increased $19 million in other geographic markets, primarily due to the Middle Market Specialty Group I just discussed.
Turning to Slide 12, total nonperforming assets declined $37 million to $1.2 billion. Importantly, the inflow to nonperforming assets decreased by $46 million in the second quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of decline. We review workout strategies, reserves and the carrying values for each individual nonperforming loan at least quarterly. This proactive strategy has contributed to the decline in nonperforming assets, as well as an average carrying value of our nonperforming assets of 55% compared to contractual values.
On Slide 13, we provide information on the makeup of the nonaccrual loans. The largest portion of the nonaccrual loans continues to be the Commercial Real Estate line of business, which decreased $103 million in the quarter. Nonaccruals increased modestly from low levels in Middle Market by $31 million, Private Banking by $24 million and Global Corporate Banking by $13 million.
During the second quarter, $199 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to nonaccrual status, a reduction of $46 million from the first quarter. Of these inflows, $118 million were in Middle Market, primarily Midwest and other markets, $33 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which is a $95 million decrease from last quarter, and $30 million were in Private Banking.
TDRs increased from $48 million to $99 million in the second quarter. We sold $47 million of nonperforming loans in the quarter, as well as $15 million in performing loans and $18 million in short sales, whereby we settle a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continues to support our analysis of valuations.
On Slide 14, we have our watch list loans which decreased by $851 million to $6.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, substandard and nonaccrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality. This is the third consecutive quarter of decline and reflects improvements in our portfolio in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business.
Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $115 million. While this is a $32 million increase from last quarter's low level, it was almost half of the cyclical peak of $210 million a year ago. Loans past dues 30 to 89 days decreased $118 million to $338 million. Foreclosed property remained relatively stable at $93 million.
On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $305 million on a period end basis from the end of the first quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides.
Total outstandings of $4.3 billion were down $912 million from a year ago. This included a $584 million decrease in the Western market, $159 million decrease in Florida and $149 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial Real Estate line of business by project type and geography. Net charge-offs for Commercial Real Estate decreased $50 million in the second quarter. Charge-offs declined as values continue to stabilize and even improve in certain locations. Charge-offs fell in every project type and in all markets except Michigan where we had a slight uptick from a relatively low level. Inflows to nonaccrual greater than $2 million decreased substantially, and nonaccrual and watch list loans also declined in the second quarter. We continue to believe that we will see some variability in charge-offs with a general downward trend.
I'd like to take a moment to address a couple of current areas of interest. As far as European exposure, we have no direct sovereign risk, and our exposure to the European banking sector is predominantly within the higher-rated countries and primarily relates to facilitating trade and corporate banking activities for our customers.  As far as Gulf of Mexico drilling exposure, within our $1.1 billion Energy portfolio, we have only a handful of customers that service the Gulf and no customers that have substantial revenues derived from deepwater drilling.  Finally, our Municipality's exposure is less than $100 million and has been performing well. There are additional slides in the appendix which provide further detail on certain segments.
The Consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans, continues to perform relatively well. Slides detailing our Auto Dealer and Automotive Supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of these portfolios.
To conclude on credit, we are pleased that the continued improvement in credit metrics we have seen over the past several quarters, including improving migration trends. These results support our updated outlook for net credit-related charge-offs of $600 million to $650 million for full year 2010, which is a $75 million decrease from our previous outlook. We expect the provision for credit losses will be less than net charge-offs for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Our capital position is strong, and historically we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. We have maintained a solid capital structure with a large component of common equity for many years.
Turning to Slide 18, we have provided an overview of the key pieces of financial reform that are relevant to Comerica. You can see that our assessment, based on currently available information, is that the expected direct impacts of financial reform are manageable. With rule making and a possible correction bill still to come, it will be some time before we can provide more precise estimates.  Importantly, we also see opportunities in financial reform, and we will be working to develop product and pricing strategies that will enable Comerica to continue to grow profitably in this quickly evolving environment.
Overall, we believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than by many other major banks due to the nature of our business. Regarding Reg E, our implementation remains on schedule and often rates are similar to our expectations. Based on the trends we have been seeing, we anticipate a reduction in fee income of approximately $5 million for the second half of the year.
Slide 19 provides an update on our outlook for 2010, which is based on an uncertain pace of economic recovery. We expect subdued loan demand for a while longer as loan growth typically lags other positive economic indicators. We expect that C&I borrowings will grow as working capital needs increase and will be partially offset by declining Commercial Real Estate outstandings. As a result, we believe loan outstandings will remain stable from June 30 period end to December 31 period end. We expect the Securities portfolio, excluding auction rate securities, to remain at the current level of about $6.5 billion.
Excess liquidity has not dissipated as quickly as we had expected, as strong deposit growth and continued subdued loan demand have differed from our assumptions. Therefore, we have lowered the net interest margin forecast by five basis points which solely reflects our updated expectations regarding excess liquidity continuing, resulting in higher earning asset levels.
Our outlook is for net credit-related charge-offs of $600 million to $650 million. The full year provision is expected to be less than net charge-offs. As John mentioned, this is a $75 million decline from our prior outlook as a result of the continued positive trends we are seeing in our credit metrics. Noninterest income, excluding 2009 securities gains, is expected to decline low to mid single digits. This is a reduction from our prior outlook, primarily as a result of the lackluster performance of the stock market in the second quarter. We believe retail service charges on deposit accounts and market-related fees such as brokerage and fiduciary will continue to be impacted by the cautious behavior of our customers. Our expense outlook is unchanged. The continued careful control of cost is expected to result in a low single-digit decrease in expenses.
Overall, we saw many positive trends continue in the second quarter such as improved credit metrics, a slower pace of decline in loan demand, terrific deposit growth and a significant increase in the net interest margin. We believe that our relationship approach has served us well throughout this economic cycle and will assist us in attracting new business and grow existing relationships as the recovery continues. Now we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

But having said that, we see a lot of positive indicators in the quarter. And when we talked -- you mentioned pipeline. It takes time for the pipeline to actually turn into business, or in some cases we are making proposals to prospects that we may or may not get the business. So there's a mixture of things, deals in the pipeline that come at different paces. But if you look at the fact that line utilization is stabilized, that our decline in commitments, not just loans but in commitments in the second quarter, was substantially less than the decline in commitments in the first quarter, we also saw an increase in new commitments, the best we've seen in the last five quarters. And we did see growth in a period end in Commercial side of things, including Real Estate. So there are a lot of things that feel like there are loan outstandings coming. They will come. It's just a little slower than I think we had expected. And the economy was a little weaker in the second quarter than I think many of us expected. In terms of the rest of the guidance, the Securities portfolio is the same at $6.5 billion as we gave in April. And lastly though, we are expecting a little higher earning assets than we had previously expected because we are not assuming that the excess liquidity, which is on deposit with the Fed, we had earlier said that, that would dissipate through the balance of this year. And now we are saying it will remain through the balance of this year. That impacts margin because earning assets are higher, but it doesn't necessarily impact net interest income."

Salaries were up in the quarter $10 million. We had several factors driving that despite having a lower headcount in the second quarter compared to the first. One is the annual merit increases. A year ago for many of our people, we weren't granting merit increases as an example. We had one more day in the quarter which also impacts things. We had higher stock compensation expense in the quarter really resulting from we updated the models that we used in the first quarter so the first quarter ended up being lower than what it would normally have been. So the variance quarter-over-quarter is an increase in the second quarter. So when you add all those things together, salaries were up -- salaries and benefits up $10 million compared to the prior quarter. But if you look at certainly levels year-over-year, we're still very stable in terms of the expense base despite a lot of different moving parts, whether it's healthcare expense, whether it's pension expense, et cetera."

As you know, we reach out in the second quarter, as is allowed by the regulators, to try and get a verbal read on as many of these SNC credits as we can. And we continue to do that this year and reflected those items in the second quarter where it was appropriate. And as a result, our outlook for the third quarter on the SNC portfolio is that we'll probably again continue to fare consistent with the way our portfolio goes overall. For example, SNC outstandings have been down the last couple of quarters following our portfolio trends. Our SNC charge-offs in the second quarter were $21 million versus $40 million in the first quarter. Our NPLs that are SNCs were $229 million at the end of the second quarter versus $283 million at the end of the first quarter. The watch list was down $400 million in the second quarter. So the SNC portfolio continues to mirror our overall portfolio and our relationship approach, and we would expect those trends to continue in the third quarter."

But I would also tell you that we picked up a number of new dealer relationships simply by pursuing a strategy we've always pursued of dealing with top tier dealers and getting good referrals from our existing customer base.

And when I talk about pipeline, Dealer pipeline is also quite nice for us, and obviously for us, that's been a very successful business. So it's as much customer acquisition as it is in the increases in flooring. And depending on auto sales, obviously, that will have a direct impact on the level of inventories, et cetera, et cetera.

That's going to take priority, I think, more than anything else. When we do come back to the real estate lending side of the equation, it will be in our growth markets. It will be with developers who we've got a good relationship with or who have referred us into a new relationship. It will be done differently than we've done it historically. We've learned a lot. Some of it has been somewhat painful. So we'll come back to that. And there will be some size limit for us in terms of individual deals and the overall level of the portfolio. But we're not there yet. You know, we've got work to do on the portfolio, and frankly, the real estate market is still suffering. And we're not anxious in the near term to jump back into the Commercial Real Estate segment in any meaningful way. There will be the occasional opportunity that we'll pursue, and we are pursuing, but it will be a while and it will be a different kind of approach that we take."

Today, we reported third quarter net income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average loans and lower fee income from customer activities. In",896,"Good morning. Today, we reported third quarter net income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average loans and lower fee income from customer activities. In this sluggish and still uncertain economic environment, our customers have remained understandably cautious. This is reflected in the weak loan demand and continued strong core deposit levels.
Our solid capital and liquidity position enabled us to fully redeem our trust preferred securities on October 1, which will reduce interest expense. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP and eliminated trust preferred securities.
Our third quarter financial results reflected the continued improvement in credit quality and careful control of expenses. Our skill-based, relationship-driven strategy and our prudent, conservative approach to banking continued to serve us well.
We believe we have a business model that cannot be replicated overnight. It takes years of experience and expertise to understand the credit cycle, small businesses, middle market companies and their owners, managers and employees, for whom we provide personal financial services. Relationships mean more than ever in this type of environment. While unemployment remains stubbornly high, there are some signals the economy is improving, albeit slowly.
Economic factors, which support loan growth, such as business fixed investment and inventories continue to improve. The Commerce Department recently indicated that investments in computers, communications equipment and machinery, for example, help spur capital goods orders in August, which is a good sign.
Here in Texas, which continues to outperform the national economy, we are establishing good full service relationships with solid companies as long-term calling by relationship managers and executive management is paying off. In California, a state whose economy is holding steady according to our chief economist, latest economic activity index, we are seeing more opportunities in Middle Market and Small Business Banking in addition to Technology and Life Sciences. 
In Michigan, a rebound in manufacturing is helping that state and the national economy emerge from the recession. U.S. light vehicle sales are headed in the right direction this year. We are seeing more encouraging and hopeful signs throughout our footprint. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in the third quarter.
Commercial loans increased modestly in the third quarter, and total loans increased in the month of September. Our loan pipeline continued its strong growth as evidenced by the commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased nearly 50% from the second quarter. Line utilization increased almost 1% to about 46% at September 30 after remaining at about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. We have loan growth in the third quarter in Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Energy Lending business lines. Commercial Real Estate accounted for about half of the decline in average loan outstandings in the third quarter as expected.
After six straight quarters of growth, the average deposit levels were relatively stable compared to the second quarter. The continued improvement in credit quality is reflected by the decline in net charge-offs for the fifth consecutive quarter, as well as the $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses compared to the second quarter.
The increase in inflows to non-accrual loans was primarily related to Commercial Real Estate, which we believe will continue to exhibit variability with a downward trend. Overall, credit migration has improved as evidenced by the $480 million decline in the watch list, which is our best early indicator of future credit quality. Our early recognition of credit issues and our ability to quickly and proactively work through them remains one of our key strengths. 
In light of the struggle and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter. Based on year-to-date positive trends as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter, our full year net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook. 
The net interest margin decreased five basis points to 3.23%, resulting from a variety of factors, which Beth will discuss shortly. We do expect our net interest margin to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels.
Our expenses remain well controlled. Non-interest expenses were relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Our capital ratios remain strong. The tangible common equity ratio increased 28 basis points to 10.39% at September 30, and the estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased 16 basis points to 9.97% at September 30 from June 30.
We will be closely following the development of the new Basel standards. Comerica has maintained a very strong capital base for a long time, and we expect we will comfortably be able to meet the proposed capital requirements. With respect to financial reform, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than by many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
In closing, we have remained focused on executing our relationship banking strategy and delivering outstanding customer service throughout this economic cycle. Positive trends in credit quality have continued, and we have strong capital and liquidity to grow organically or by acquisition.
And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

As I review our third quarter results, I will be referring to slides we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our third quarter 2010 results compared to the prior period and at the same period a year ago. Today, we reported third quarter 2010 net income of $59 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.33.
Slide 4 provides highlights of the financial results for the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Credit quality continue to improve. Net credit related charge-offs decreased by $14 million from the second quarter to $132 million. The provision for credit losses was $116 million, $10 million less than the second quarter. Also, the watch list declined by $480 million. The pace of decline in loans continued to slow in the third quarter. Average loans declined $470 million compared to declines of $641 million in the second quarter and $1.4 billion in the first quarter.
Average deposit levels remained strong, decreasing only 1% from the second quarter. Growth in business deposits was offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking deposits. The net interest margin in the third quarter was 3.23%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.42%. We continue to carefully control expenses with non-interest expenses relatively stable, and our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.39%. 
As I just mentioned, the pace at which average loans declined, continued to slow as shown on Slide 5. Average loans declined $570 million in the third quarter, and in the last month of the quarter, average loans increased $145 million. We are hoping that we have started to turn the corner on loan outstandings. Average commercial loans were up $57 million over last quarter. On a period-end basis, commercial loans increased $281 million from June 30 to September 30. As commercial loan growth returns, we expect it will be muted by declines in Commercial Real Estate loans. In fact, about half of the decline in average outstandings in the third quarter was in Commercial Real Estate.
Turning to Slide 6. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. In the third quarter, average loan outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services and Energy. Decreased average outstandings in the third quarter were noted in a number of areas, with the largest declines in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole increased almost 1% to about 46% after remaining about 45% since the middle of the first quarter.
While loan demand remains weak as our customers are understandably cautious, given the sluggish and uncertain economy, we are hopeful as our loan pipelines continue to grow. This includes commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased almost 50% in the third quarter to $871 million.
As shown on Slide 7, core deposits remained strong in the third quarter. Average core deposits decreased a modest $142 million after six consecutive quarters of growth. Our $327 million increase in money market and NOW deposits was offset by a $298 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits and $190 million decline in customers CDs. Overall, deposit growth in Commercial segments was offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking deposits. We had growth in several business segments led by Middle Market, Energy and Small Business, partially offset by a decrease in Global Corporate Banking.
Deposits declined in Private Banking as customers generally shifted in the money market accounts at Comerica Securities. A smaller decrease was noted in Personal Banking where in the Midwest, over half the decrease related to maturities of higher-priced CDs.
As outlined on Slide 8, the net interest margin of 3.23% decreased five basis points compared to the second quarter for several reasons. First of all, we had lower loan yields in the quarter. This was primarily a result of the lower fees in the margin. When a loan is prepaid, there is accelerated recognition of deferred loan fees. Due to the slower pace of loan prepayments in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, loan fees declined.
The reduction in LIBOR rates in the quarter also had a minor impact on loan yields. As a reminder, about 70% of our loans are floating rate, with about 70% LIBOR-based. Additionally, the increase in the impact from non-accrual loans and maturing interest rate swaps had a small negative impact on loan yields.
Of note, we have not seen any major loan-spread compression, only selectively for larger, better-rated corporations. Second, the yield on the securities portfolio was lower in the quarter. Mortgage rates fell significantly in the third quarter, resulting in accelerating prepayments of mortgage-backed securities throughout the quarter, particularly in September. In fact, prepayments were more than twice as high in September as they were in June. When prepayments occur, there is acceleration of the original purchase premium, which is being amortized over the security's expected life.
Finally, the impact from the reduction in excess liquidity, partially offset the decline in the yields on loans and securities. Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3 billion deposit with the Federal Reserve in the third quarter. This was a $736 million decline from the second quarter and declined less than we have anticipated due to continued weak loan demand and strong deposit levels.
The excess liquidity position of September 30 was $3 billion. We are proactively managing excess liquidity as evidenced by the prepayment without penalty of $2 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August, as well as fully redeeming $500 million in trust preferred securities at par on October 1. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.
Turning to Slide 9. Non-interest expenses remain well controlled in the third quarter. Credit-related costs declined with a $6 million decrease in the provision for lending-related commitments, partially offset by a $2 million increase in ORE expense. 
Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management and staff level is key. We have consistently reduced our workforce over the past several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 3% from year-ago levels. Compared to 2001, we have 20% fewer people today, while our assets are 10% larger.
Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a result of the impact of one additional day in the third quarter and included an increase in share-based compensation expense of $6 million related to stock grants in the quarter. 
Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer, will discuss credit quality starting on Slide 10."
318670,113542909,80383,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Good morning.

In the third quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit quality. Net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses and the watch list improved from second quarter levels.
The third quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit related charge-offs decreased $14 million to $132 million. Provision for credit losses, which includes loans as well as off-balance sheet commitments was $116 million. This was $10 million less than the second quarter, primarily due to declines in the Middle Market, Energy and Entertainment business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Private Banking and Commercial Real Estate business lines. The provision was less than charge-offs for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our overall credit performance, including improving migration trends for both loans as well as off-balance sheet commitments. The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 80% of total nonperforming loans. 
Slide 11 provides detail on net charge-offs, which decreased $14 million to $132 million in the third quarter. The decrease in net credit-related charge-offs resulted primarily from a $39 million decrease in the Middle Market, partially offset by a $24 million increase in the Commercial Real Estate business line, primarily in the Western and Midwest markets.
On Slide 12, we provide information on the inflow to non-accrual loans. During the third quarter, $294 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status. Of these inflows, $132 million were from the Commercial Real Estate business line, with almost 3/4 coming from the Western market, $91 million were from the Middle Market business line, primarily in the Midwest market and $28 million were from Energy Lending in the Texas market.
Based on our analysis of default rates, risk rating migration patterns and watch list results, the increase in the inflow to non-accruals is caused by previously identified problem credits moving along the normal route of the collection process. We believe we will continue to see a downward trend in the inflows to non-accrual with some variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly in Commercial Real Estate.
Turning to Slide 13. Total non-accrual loans increased $65 million to $1.2 billion. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the Commercial Real Estate line of business, which remains stable at $528 million in the quarter. Non-accruals increased in Middle Market by $41 million. Private Banking and Global Corporate Banking non-accruals declined. By geography, the decrease in non-accrual loans in the Midwest was offset by increases in Western and Texas.
Total TDRs increased from $99 million to $147 million in the third quarter. Of the total TDRs: $50 million were accruing, $28 million were reduced rate and $69 million were non-accrual. We sold $12 million of nonperforming loans in the quarter, as well as $7 million in performing loans. Additionally, we completed $42 million in short sales, of which $13 million were nonperforming loans, whereby we settled a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continued to support our analysis of valuations.
We review workout strategies, reserves and carrying values for each individual nonperforming loan, at least quarterly. This proactive strategy has contributed to the decline in net charge-offs, as well as an average carrying value of our non-accrual loans of 55% compared to contractual values.
On Slide 14, we have our watch list loans, which decreased by $480 million to $6.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, substandard and non-accrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of decline and reflects a significant decline in special mention loans.
Declines in the watch list were evidenced in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business, particularly in Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $104 million, an $11 million decrease from last quarter. 
Foreclosed property increased $27 million to $120 million, yet remains relatively small. Shared National Credit or SNC exam results were released in August. The results were consistent with the credit outlook we had given in July and overall, were not a factor in our third quarter results.
On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $202 million on a period-end basis from the end of the second quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides.
Total outstandings of $4.1 billion were down $892 million from a year ago. This included a $513 million decrease in the Western market and $137 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial Real Estate line of business by project type and geography. Net charge-offs for Commercial Real Estate were $60 million in the third quarter and were consistent with our expectation for continued improvement with some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Values have stabilized and even improved in certain locations. The largest portion of charge-offs were noted in residential properties and in the Western market. Inflows to non-accruals greater than $2 million increased from a very low level in the second quarter. Total non-accruals were stable, and watch list loans decreased in the third quarter. We believe these trends are consistent with what we would expect in the normal course of working through problem loans.
There are additional slides in the appendix, which provide further detail on certain segments. The consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans, continues to perform relatively well. Included in our consumer portfolio is only $1.6 billion in residential mortgages and $1.7 million in home equity loans. Given the size and makeup of the portfolio, we would expect any impact from the current industry foreclosure issues to be minimum.
Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of those portfolios.
To conclude on Credit, we are pleased with the continued improvement in credit quality, including improving migration trends. In light of the sluggish and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter. We expect the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter will continue to be less than net charge-offs. Based on our year-to-date positive trends and our expectations for the fourth quarter, full year net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook.
Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Turning to Slide 17, our capital position is strong and historically, we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. 
We fully redeemed our trust preferred securities at par on October 1. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP, as well as eliminated trust preferred from its capital structure. The elimination of these higher cost securities will result in significant interest savings for us.
Slide 18 outlines our summary analysis of the latest Basel proposal, if it is applied to Comerica. On the capital side, our assessment, based on currently available information, is that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital in the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. In fact, we believe we already meet the proposed capital ratio requirements.
On the liquidity side, there's a high degree of uncertainty regarding implementation and interpretation of the rules. We'll be closely following the development of these new standards.
We believe that the potential changes are manageable, given our proven ability to administer our balance sheet. Included in the appendix is a slide detailing the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. Essentially, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we believe the direct adverse impact of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
Slide 19 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect average earning assets of approximately $48 billion, largely reflecting a decline in average excess liquidity from $3 billion in the third quarter to about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect that average excess liquidity will decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to debt maturities, the redemption of the trust preferred and the full quarter effect of the $2 billion prepayment of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August.
We expect the net interest margin between 3.30% and 3.35%, primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity to $1 billion and assuming prepayments in the investment securities portfolio remaining at the same high level we experienced in September. Our outlook for fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs is that they will be similar to the third quarter. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.
We expect a low single-digit decline in non-interest income compared to the third quarter. This includes the impact of Reg E and based on the current trends, we continue to anticipate a reduction in fee income of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter. As far as non-interest expenses, we expect a low single-digit decrease compared to the third quarter. As previously announced, the fourth quarter will include a $5 million negative impact from the accelerated accretion of the remaining original issuance discount related to the redemption of the trust preferred securities.
Overall, we saw positive trends continue in the third quarter,, such as improved credit quality, a slower pace of decline in loan demand as well strong deposit and capital levels. We believe that our relationship approach have served us well throughout this cycle, economic cycle and will assist us in attracting new business and growing existing relationships as the economy improves.

We did see the increase in Commercial Real Estate NPA inflow and therefore, the increase in total NPAs. And we have consistently said over the past several quarters, there could be some variability in any one of these numbers or two of these numbers as we go forward in this kind of economic uncertainty. The story on the CRE inflow was really a very familiar story for us. The main part of the increase in NPA inflow was due to a Single Family, resi and retail. Again, showing some distress as we have frankly have for a couple of quarters in a row. But everything we have analyzed, Ken, from migration patterns to the watch list itself leads us to believe that these are all previously identified problem credits moving through the normal collection route and not a new wave of problems. Overall, we still expect credit metrics to continue to improve with some variability from quarter-to-quarter as we've seen in this quarter, particularly in the Commercial Real Estate sector, which as you know, is still struggling in this economic environment. So there's still a lot of work to do."

There are some, based on the numbers we have given you on the impact of excess liquidity on the margin, there will be some outlook for the margin is not quite as high that in terms of an increase in the fourth quarter. So we will continue to see two things as partial offsets to the excess liquidity going away. One is the impact you just mentioned, high prepayments we're assuming will continue and we'll be reinvesting at lower yields. And that will have a minor, but probably a little larger impact in the third quarter. And second, we have maturing interest rates swaps, which are maturing at positive spreads. So those will be going away, another $200 million in the $700 million matured in the third quarter, $200 million in the fourth.

Related to next year, when I think about the margin -- and we're not assuming an increase in the Fed funds rate next year. So we think that the margin looks pretty stable next year relative to where it's going to end up in the fourth quarter. And while there will still be further dissipation of the excess liquidity, which will be a positive for the margin next year versus 2010, we still will be working through, particularly in the first half of the year, some offsets to that through the maturing of swap. We have $800 million of swaps maturing that have positive spreads in the first quarter and also just working through these lower yield levels on the securities portfolio.

Today we reported Q3 net income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Q3 total revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average loans, and lower fee income from customer activities.  In this sluggish and still uncertain economic environment, our customers have remained understandably cautious.  This is reflected in the weak loan demand and continued strong core deposit levels. Our solid capital and liquidity position enabled us to fully redeem our trust preferred securities on October 1, which will reduce interest expense. 
This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP and eliminated trust-preferred securities.  Our Q3 financial results reflected the continued improvement in credit quality and careful control of expenses.  Our skill based relationship driven strategy and our prudent conservative approach to banking continued to serve us well.  We believe we have a business model that cannot be replicated overnight.  It takes years of experience and expertise to understand the credit cycle, small businesses, middle market companies and their owners, managers, and employees, for whom we provide personal financial services. 
Relationships mean more than ever in this type of environment. While unemployment remains stubbornly high, there are some signals the economy is improving, albeit slowly.  Economic factors which support loan growth, such as business fixed investment and inventories, continue to improve.  The Commerce Department recently indicated that investments in computers, communications equipment, and machinery, for example, helped spur capital goods orders in August, which is a good sign.
Here in Texas, which continues to outperform the national economy, we are establishing good, full service relationships with solid companies as long term calling by relationship managers and executive management is paying off.  In California, a state whose economy is holding steady, according to our chief economist’s latest economic activity index, we are seeing more opportunities in middle market and small business banking, in addition to technology and life sciences.
In Michigan, a rebound in manufacturing is helping that state, and the national economy emerge from the recession.  US light vehicle sales are headed in the right direction this year.
We are seeing more encouraging and hopeful signs throughout our footprint. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in Q3.  Commercial loans increased modestly in Q3, and total loans increased in the month of September. Our loan pipeline continued its strong growth as evidenced by the commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased nearly 50% from Q2.
Line utilization increased almost 1% to about 46% at September 30th , after remaining at about 45% since the middle of Q1. We had loan growth in Q3 in mortgage banker finance, national dealer services, and energy lending business lines. Commercial real estate accounted for about half of the decline in average loan outstandings in Q3, as expected.
After six straight quarters of growth, the average deposit levels were relatively stable compared to Q2.  The continued improvement in credit quality is reflected by the decline in net charge offs for the fifth consecutive quarter, as well as the $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses, compared to Q2. The increase in inflows to non-accrual loans was primarily related to commercial real estate, which we believe will continue to exhibit variability, with a downward trend.
Overall, credit migration has improved, as evidenced by the $480 million decline in the watch list, which is our best early indicator of future credit quality.  Our own recognition of credit issues, and our ability to quickly and proactively work through them remains one of our key strengths. In light of the struggle and uncertain economic environment, we expect Q4 net charge-offs to be similar to Q3.  
Based on year to date positive trends as well as our expectations for Q4, our full year net charge offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook. The net interest margin decreased five basis point, to 3.23%, resulting from a variety of factors which Beth will discuss shortly. We do expect our net interest margin to improve in Q4, from Q3 levels. Our expenses remain well controlled.  Non-interest expenses were relatively stable, compared to Q2. 
Our capital ratios remain strong.  The tangible common equity ratio increased 28 basis points, to 10.39% at September 30th , and the estimated tier one common ratio increased 16 basis points to 9.97% at September 30th, from June 30th .  We will be closely following the development of the new Basal (sp) standards. Comerica has maintained a very strong capital base for a long time, and we expect we will comfortably be able to meet the proposed capital requirements.
With respect to financial reform, our analysis has not changed.  Overall we believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will felt less by Comerica than by many other major banks, due to the nature of our business. 
In closing, we have remained focused on executing our relationship banking strategy, and delivering outstanding customer service throughout this economic cycle.  Positive trends and credit quality have continued, and we have strong capital and liquidity to grow organically or by acquisition. And now I’ll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our Q3 results in more detail.

As I review our Q3 results, I will be referring to the slides we have prepared, that provide additional details on our earnings.  Turning to slide three, we outline the major components of our Q3 2010 results. Compared to the prior period, and the same period a year ago.  Today, we reported Q3 2010 net income of $59 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.33. 
Slide four provides highlights of the financial results for Q3, compared to Q2. Credit quality continued to improve.  Net credit related charge offs decreased by $14 million from Q2, to $132 million. The provision for credit losses was $116 million, $10 million less than Q2.  Also, the watch list declined by $480 million. 
The pace of decline in loans continued to slow in Q3. Average loans declined $470 million, compared to declines of $641 million in Q2 and $1.4 billion in Q1. Average deposit levels remain strong, decreasing only 1% from Q2. Growth in business deposits was offset by reduced personal and private banking deposits. The net interest margin in Q3 was 3.23%.
Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.2%.  We continue to carefully control expenses, with non-interest expenses relatively stable.  Our capital position remains strong, as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.39%. 
As I just mentioned, the pace at which average loans declined continues to slow, as shown on slide five. Average loans declined $570 million in Q3, and in the last month of the quarter, average loans increased $145 million.  We are hoping that we have started to turn the corner on loan outstandings. Average commercial loans were up $57 million over last quarter.
On a period end basis, commercial loans increased $281 million from June 30 to September 3.  As commercial loan growth returns, we expect it will be muted by declines in commercial real estate loans.  In fact, about half of the decline in average outstandings in Q3 were in commercial real estate. Turning to slide six, our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geography.
In Q3, average loan outstandings increased in mortgage banker, national dealer services, and energy. Decreased average outstandings in Q3 were noted in a number of areas, with the largest decline in (inaudible 0:16:19) market, commercial real estate, and global corporate banking. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole increased almost 1%, to about 46%, after remaining about 45% since the middle of Q1. 
While loan demand remains weak, as our customers are understandably cautious, given the sluggish and uncertain economy, we are hopeful as our loan pipelines continue to grow. This includes commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased almost 50% in Q3, to $871 million. 
As shown on slide seven, core deposits remain strong in Q3. Average core deposits decreased a modest $142 million, after six consecutive quarters of growth. A $327 million increase in money market and NOW deposits was offset by a $298 million decrease in non-interest bearing deposits, and $119 million decline in customer CDs. Overall, deposit growth in commercial segments was offset by reduced personal and private banking deposits. 
We had growth in several business segments, led by middle market, energy, and small business, partially offset by a decrease in global corporate banking. Deposits declined in private banking, as customers generally shifted into money market accounts at Comerica Securities. A smaller decrease was noted in personal banking, where in the Midwest, over half the decrease related to maturities of higher priced CDs. 
As outline on slide eight, the net interest margin of 3.23% decreased five basis points compared to Q2, for several reasons. First of all, we had lower loan yields in the quarter. This was primarily a result of the lower fees in the margin. When a loan is pre-paid, there is accelerated recognition of deferred loan fees. Due to the slower pace of loan pre-payments in Q3, relative to the first half of the year, loan fees declined. The reduction of (inaudible 0:18:27) rates in the quarter also had a minor impact on loan yields.  As a reminder, about 70% of our loans are floating rates, with about 70% (inaudible 0:18:36) based. 
Additionally, the increase in the impact from non-accrual loans and maturing interest rate swaps had a small negative impact on loan yields.  Of note, we have not seen any major loan spread compression, only selectively for larger, better rated corporations.  Second, the yield on the securities portfolio was lower in the quarter.  Mortgage rates fell significantly in Q3, resulting in accelerated pre-payments of mortgage backed securities throughout the quarter, particularly in September. In fact, pre-payments were more than twice as high in September as they were in June. When pre-payments occur, there is an acceleration of the original purchase premium, which is being amortized over the security’s expected life.
Finally, the impact from the reduction in excess liquidity partially offset the decline in the yields of loans and securities. Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3 billion deposited with the Federal Reserve in Q3. This was a $736 million decline from Q2, and declined less than we had anticipated due to continued weak loan demand, and strong deposit levels. The excess liquidity position of September 30 was $3 billion. 
We are proactively managing our excess liquidity as evidenced by the pre-payment without penalty of $2 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August, as well as fully redeeming $500 million in trust-preferred securities at TARP, on October 1st. This excess liquidity is above and beyond the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity. 
Turning to slide nine, non-interest expenses remain well controlled in Q3. Credit related costs declined, and with a $6 million decrease in the provision for living related commitments, partially offset by $2 million for increase in ROE expense. Our largest expense item is salaries, and therefore management of staff levels is key. We have consistently reduced our work force over the past several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 3% from year ago levels. Compared to 2001, we have 20% fewer people today, while our assets are 10% larger. 
Salaries expense was higher in the quarter, as a result of the impact of one additional day in Q3, and included an increase in share based compensation expense, of $6 million, related to stock brands in the quarter. Now John Killian, our chief credit officer, will discuss credit quality, starting on slide ten.

Net charge offs, the provision for credit losses, and the watch list improved from Q2 levels. Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge offs.  Net credit related charge offs decreased $14 million to $132 million. Provision for credit losses, which includes loans as well as all balance sheet commitments, was $116 million.  This was $10 million less than Q2, primarily due to declines in the middle market, energy, and entertainment business lines, partially offset by an increase in the private banking and commercial real estate business lines. 
The provision was less than charge-offs, for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our overall credit performance, including improving migration trends for both loans, as well as off balance sheet commitments. The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans, and 80% of total non-performing loans. 
Slide 11 provides detail on net charge offs, which decreased $14 million, to $132 million in Q3. The decrease in net credit related charge offs resulted primarily from a $39 million decrease in the middle market, partially offset by a $24 million increase in the commercial real estate business line, primarily in the western and mid west markets.  On slide 12, we provide information on the inflow to non-accrual loans. During Q3, $294 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status. Of these inflows, $132 million were from the commercial real estate business line, with almost three-quarters coming from the western market, $91 million were from the middle market business line, primarily in the mid west market, and $28 million were from energy lending in the Texas market. 
Based on our analysis of the default breaks, risk rating migration patterns and watch list results, the  increase to non-accruals is caused by previously identified problem credits, moving along the normal route of the collection process. We believe we will continue to see a downward trend in the inflows to non-accrual, with some variability quarter to quarter, particularly in commercial real estate. 
Turning to slide 13, total non-accrual loans increased $65 million, to $1.2 billion. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the commercial real estate line of business, which remain stable at $528 million in the quarter. Net accruals increased in middle market by $41 million, private banking and global corporate banking non-accruals declined. 
By geography, the decrease in non-accrual loans in the Midwest was offset by increases in western and Texas. Total TDRs increased from $99 million into $147 million in Q3. Of the total TDRs, $50 million were accruing, $28 million were reduced rate, and $69 million were non-accrual. We sold $12 million of non-performing loans in the quarter, as well as $7 million in performing loans. Additionally, we completed $42 million in short sells, of which $13 million were non-performing loans, whereby we settle a note with the borrower at less than PAR. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. 
This continues to support our analysis of valuations. We review work out strategies, reserves and carrying values for each individual non-performing loan at least quarterly. This pro-active strategy has contributed to the decline in net charge offs, as well as an average carrying value of our non-accrual loans of 55%, compared to contractual values. On slide 14, we have our watch list loans, which decreased by $480 million, to $6.2 billion at the end of Q3. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, sub-standard, and non-accrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality.
This is the fourth consecutive quarter of decline, and reflects a significant decline in special interest loans. Declines in the watch list were evidenced in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business, particularly in middle market and in commercial real estate. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totals $104 million, an $11 million decrease from last quarter. Foreclosed property increased $27 million, to $120 million, yet remains relatively small. 
Shared national credit, or SNIC, exam results were released in August.  The results were consistent with the credit outlook we had given in July, and overall were not a factor in our Q3 results. On slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our commercial real estate line of business, which declined $202 million on a period end basis, from the end of Q2. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides. 
Total outstandings of $4.1 billion were down $892 million from a year ago.  This included a $513 million western market and $137 million decline in Michigan. Slide 16 provides net charge offs for our commercial real estate line of business by project type and geography.  Net charge offs for commercial real estate was $60 million in Q3, and were consistent with our expectation for continued improvement with some variability from quarter to quarter. 
Values have stabilized, and even improved in certain locations. The largest portion of charge offs were noted in residential properties, and in the western market. In flows to non-accruals greater than $2 million increased from a very low level in Q2. Total non-accruals were stable, and watch list loans decreased in Q3. We believe these trends are consistent with what we would expect in the normal course of working through problem loans. There are additional slides in the appendix, which provide further detail on certain segments.  The consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans, continues to perform relatively well. 
Included in our consumer portfolio is only $1.6 billion in residential mortgages, and $1.7 billion in home equity loans. Given the size and makeup of the portfolio, we would expect any impact from the current industry foreclosure issues to be minimal. Slide detail in our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of those portfolios.
To conclude on credit, we are pleased with the continued improvement in credit quality, including improving migration trends.  In light of the sluggish and uncertain economic environment, we expect Q4 net credit related charge offs to be similar to Q3. We expect a provision for credit losses in Q4 will continue to be less than net charge offs. Based on our year to date positive trends, and our expectations for Q4, full year net charge offs are expected to be lower than our higher outlook. Now I’ll turn the call back to Beth.

Turning to slide 17, our capital position is strong, and historically we have some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group. We’ve totally redeemed our trust preferred securities at PAR, on October 1st. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP as well as eliminated trust preferred from its capital structure. Elimination of these higher cost securities will result in significant interest savings for us. 
Slide 18 outlines our summary analysis of the latest Basal proposal, as applied to Comerica. On the capital side, our assessments based on currently available information, is at the expected impact from changes in the components of capital in the calculation of risk rated assets would not be material. In fact, we believe we already meet the proposed capital ratio requirements. On the liquidity side, there’s a high degree of uncertainty regarding implementation and interpretation of the rules. We’ll be closely following the development of these new standards. We believe that the potential changes are manageable, given our proven ability to administer our balance sheet. 
Included in the appendix is a slide detailing the impact Dodd-Frank Act. Essentially, our analysis has not changed.  We’ve always believed that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than many other major banks, due to the nature of our business. 
Slide 19 provides our outlook for Q4. Average earning assets of approximately $48 billion, largely reflecting a decline in average excess liquidity from $3 billion in Q3, to about $1 billion in Q4. We expect that average excess  liquidity will decline in Q4, primarily due to debt maturity, and redemption of the trust preferred, and the full quarter effect of the $2 billion pre-payment of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August.
We expect the net interest margin to be between 330  and 335, primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity to $1 billion and assuming pre-payments in the investment securities portfolio remaining at the same high level we experienced in September. Our outlook for Q4 net credit related charge offs is that they will be similar to Q3. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit related charge offs. We expect a low single digit decline in non-interest income, compared to Q3. This includes the impact of Reg-E, and based on the current trends, we continue to anticipate a reduction in fee income of approximately $3 million in Q4. 
As far as non-interest expenses, we expect a low single digit increase compared to Q3. As previously announced, Q4 will include a $5 million negative impact from the accelerated accretient of the remaining original issue of discount, related to the redemption of the trust securing securities. 
Overall, we saw a positive trend continue in Q3, such as improved credit quality, a slower pace of decline in loan demands, as well as drawing deposit and capital levels. We believe that our relationship approach has served us well, throughout this cycle, economic cycle, and will assist us in attracting new business, and growing existing relationships as the economy improves. Now we would be happy to answer any questions you have.

As you saw in Q3 again, that charge off provision, past dues, and most importantly the watch list, improved.  But we did see the increase in commercial real estate NPA inflow, and therefore the increase in total NPA, and we have consistently said, over the past several quarters there could be some variability in these, any one of these numbers, or two of these numbers, as we go forward in this kind of economic uncertainty.  The story on the CRE inflow was really a very familiar story for us, the main part of the increase in MPA inflow was due to single family, (inaudible 0:34:57) and retail, again showing some distress, as we have frankly had for a couple of quarters  in a row.  But everything we have analyzed, Ken, from migration patterns to the watch list itself leads us to believe that these are all previously identified problem credits moving through the normal collection route, and not a new wave of problems.  Overall, we still expect credit metrics to continue to improve with some variability from quarter to quarter, as we’ve seen in this quarter. Particularly in the commercial real estate sector, which as you know, is still struggling in this economic environment.  So there’s still a lot of work to do.

One is the impact you just mentioned, high pre-payments we’re assuming will continue, and will be reinvesting at lower yields, and that will have a minor but probably a larger impact than Q3, and second, we have maturing interest rate swaps which are maturing at positive spreads, so those will be going away, another $200 million in the $700 million matured in Q3, $200 million in Q4. So the positive, very positive impact from excess liquidity will be diminished a little by those two aspects as well.

A key element is obviously controlling people, and as we mentioned earlier, we have done I think a really good job over a long period of time of managing people.  As I mentioned in the script, just to repeat it, that we’re operating today with 20% fewer people and our bank is 10% bigger in terms of assets.  So the productivity, if you look at assets per employee, average assets per employee it’s almost 40% improvement. So we will continue to be focused on finding ways, not protecting the revenue base, the revenue producers, but finding ways to continue to do things more efficiently than we have in the past. Those jobs that we’ve taken out for that efficiency won’t come back, so the management of people is a big part of our expense base, we’re always looking at ways to do things more effectively, so it’s not something we do as part of a big program that we announce, it’s a two year program with a fancy name, this is literally part of a monthly process and even the management of people, to the extent they are different from what had been approved at budget levels, it has to come to the management policy committee to get approval. It’s meant to be bureaucratic and it is, because it really means that people are serious about needing that headcount, they’re going to come and ask the very senior people. So I think we have a very good process. I can give more color on kind of the dynamics for next year, in January, but be assured, it’s a big focus for the management team.

So that’s certainly all the dynamics of thinking about all the different aspects of the balance sheet are factored into the outlook we gave, of the 330 to 335 in Q4. Related to next year, when I think about the margin, and we’re not assuming an increase in the Fed Funds rate next year, so we think that the margin looks pretty stable next year, relative to where it’s going to end up in Q4. And while there will still be further dissipation of the excess liquidity which will be deposited for the margin next year, versus 2010, we still will be working through  -- particularly in the first half of the year, some offsets to that through the maturing of swaps.  We have $800 million of swaps maturing, that have positive spreads in Q1, and also just working through these lower yield levels on the securities portfolio.  So, there will be some positive from excess liquidity dissipating, particularly during the first half, offset by these other couple of factors that I mentioned.

Today, we reported third quarter net     income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third     quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second     quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average     loans and lower fee income from",896,"Good morning. Today, we reported third quarter net
     income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third
     quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second
     quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average
     loans and lower fee income from customer activities.
     In this sluggish and still uncertain economic
     environment, our customers have remained
     understandably cautious. This is reflected in the
     weak loan demand and continued strong core deposit
     levels.
     
     Our solid capital and liquidity position enabled us
     to fully redeem our trust preferred securities on
     October 1, which will reduce interest expense. This
     uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer
     group to have redeemed TARP and eliminated trust
     preferred securities.
     
     Our third quarter financial results reflected the
     continued improvement in credit quality and careful
     control of expenses. Our skill-based,
     relationship-driven strategy and our prudent,
     conservative approach to banking continued to serve
     us well.
     
     We believe we have a business model that cannot be
     replicated overnight. It takes years of experience
     and expertise to understand the credit cycle, small
     businesses, middle market companies and their
     owners, managers and employees, for whom we provide
     personal financial services. Relationships mean more
     than ever in this type of environment. While
     unemployment remains stubbornly high, there are some
     signals the economy is improving, albeit slowly.
     
     Economic factors, which support loan growth, such as
     business fixed investment and inventories continue
     to improve. The Commerce Department recently
     indicated that investments in computers,
     communications equipment and machinery, for example,
     help spur capital goods orders in August, which is a
     good sign.
     
     Here in Texas, which continues to outperform the
     national economy, we are establishing good full
     service relationships with solid companies as
     long-term calling by relationship managers and
     executive management is paying off. In California, a
     state whose economy is holding steady according to
     our chief economist’s latest economic activity index,
     we are seeing more opportunities in Middle Market
     and Small Business Banking in addition to Technology
     and Life Sciences.
     
     In Michigan, a rebound in manufacturing is helping
     that state and the national economy emerge from the
     recession. U.S. light vehicle sales are headed in
     the right direction this year. We are seeing more
     encouraging and hopeful signs throughout our
     footprint. The pace of decline in loan outstandings
     continued to slow in the third quarter.
     
     Commercial loans increased modestly in the third
     quarter, and total loans increased in the month of
     September. Our loan pipeline continued its strong
     growth as evidenced by the commitments issued, but
     not yet closed, which increased nearly 50% from the
     second quarter. Line utilization increased almost 1%
     to about 46% at September 30 after remaining at
     about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. We
     have loan growth in the third quarter in Mortgage
     Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Energy
     Lending business lines. Commercial Real Estate
     accounted for about half of the decline in average loan outstandings in the third quarter as expected.
     
     After six straight quarters of growth, the average
     deposit levels were relatively stable compared to
     the second quarter. The continued improvement in
     credit quality is reflected by the decline in net
     charge-offs for the fifth consecutive quarter, as
     well as the $10 million decline in the provision for
     credit losses compared to the second quarter.
     
     The increase in inflows to non-accrual loans was
     primarily related to Commercial Real Estate, which
     we believe will continue to exhibit variability with
     a downward trend. Overall, credit migration has
     improved as evidenced by the $480 million decline in
     the watch list, which is our best early indicator of
     future credit quality. Our early recognition of
     credit issues and our ability to quickly and
     proactively work through them remains one of our key
     strengths.
     
     In light of the struggle and uncertain economic
     environment, we expect fourth quarter net
     charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter.
     Based on year-to-date positive trends as well as our    
     expectations for the fourth quarter, our full year
     net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our
     prior outlook.
     
     The net interest margin decreased five basis points
     to 3.23%, resulting from a variety of factors, which
     Beth will discuss shortly. We do expect our net
     interest margin to improve in the fourth quarter
     from third quarter levels.
     
     Our expenses remain well controlled. Noninterest
     expenses were relatively stable compared to the
     second quarter. Our capital ratios remain strong.
     The tangible common equity ratio increased 28 basis
     points to 10.39% at September 30, and the estimated
     Tier 1 common ratio increased 16 basis points to
     9.97% at September 30 from June 30.
     
     We will be closely following the development of the
     new Basel standards. Comerica has maintained a very
     strong capital base for a long time, and we expect
     we will comfortably be able to meet the proposed
     capital requirements. With respect to financial
     reform, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we
     believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial 
     reform will be felt less by Comerica than by many
     other major banks due to the nature of our business.
     
     In closing, we have remained focused on executing
     our relationship banking strategy and delivering
     outstanding customer service throughout this
     economic cycle. Positive trends in credit quality
     have continued, and we have strong capital and
     liquidity to grow organically or by acquisition.
     
     And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John,
     who will discuss our third quarter results in more
     detail."

     results, I will be referring to slides we have

     earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major
     components of our third quarter 2010 results
     compared to the prior period and at the same period
     a year ago. Today, we reported third quarter 2010
     net income of $59 million and diluted earnings per
     share of $0.33.
     
     Slide 4 provides highlights of the financial results
     for the third quarter compared to the second
     quarter. Credit quality continue to improve. Net
     credit related charge-offs decreased by $14 million
     from the second quarter to $132 million. The
     provision for credit losses was $116 million,
     $10 million less than the second quarter. Also, the
     watch list declined by $480 million. The pace of
     decline in loans continued to slow in the third
     quarter. Average loans declined $470 million
     compared to declines of $641 million in the second
     quarter and $1.4 billion in the first quarter.
     
     Average deposit levels remained strong, decreasing
     only 1% from the second quarter. Growth in business
     deposits was offset by reduced Personal and Private
     Banking deposits. The net interest margin in the
     third quarter was 3.23%. Excluding the impact of
     excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have
     been 3.42%. We continue to carefully control
     expenses with non-interest expenses relatively
     stable, and our capital position remains strong as
     evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of
     10.39%.
     
     As I just mentioned, the pace at which average loans
     declined continued to slow as shown on Slide 5.
     Average loans declined $570 million in the third
     quarter, and in the last month of the quarter,
     average loans increased $145 million. We are hoping
     that we have started to turn the corner on loan
     outstandings. Average commercial loans were up
     $57 million over last quarter. On a period-end
     basis, commercial loans increased $281 million from
     June 30 to September 30. As commercial loan growth
     returns, we expect it will be muted by declines in
     Commercial Real Estate loans. In fact, about half of
     the decline in average outstandings in the third
     quarter was in Commercial Real Estate.
     
     Turning to Slide 6. Our loan portfolio is well
     diversified among many lines of business and
     geographies. In the third quarter, average loan
     outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National
     Dealer Services and Energy. Decreased average
     outstandings in the third quarter were noted in a
     number of areas, with the largest declines in Middle
     Market, Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate
     Banking. Line utilization for the portfolio as a
     whole increased almost 1% to about 46% after remaining about 45% since the middle of the first
     quarter.
     
     While loan demand remains weak as our customers are
     understandably cautious, given the sluggish and
     uncertain economy, we are hopeful as our loan
     pipelines continue to grow. This includes
     commitments issued, but not yet closed, which
     increased almost 50% in the third quarter to
     $871 million.
     
     As shown on Slide 7, core deposits remained strong
     in the third quarter. Average core deposits
     decreased a modest $142 million after six
     consecutive quarters of growth. Our $327 million
     increase in money market and NOW deposits was offset
     by a $298 million decrease in noninterest-bearing
     deposits and $119 million decline in customers CDs.
     Overall, deposit growth in Commercial segments was
     offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking
     deposits. We had growth in several business segments
     led by Middle Market, Energy and Small Business,
     partially offset by a decrease in Global Corporate
     Banking.
     Deposits declined in Private Banking as customers
     generally shifted in the money market accounts at
     Comerica Securities. A smaller decrease was noted in
     Personal Banking where in the Midwest, over half the
     decrease related to maturities of higher-priced CDs.
     
     As outlined on Slide 8, the net interest margin of
     3.23% decreased five basis points compared to the
     second quarter for several reasons. First of all, we
     had lower loan yields in the quarter. This was
     primarily a result of the lower fees in the margin.
     When a loan is prepaid, there is accelerated
     recognition of deferred loan fees. Due to the slower
     pace of loan prepayments in the third quarter
     relative to the first half of the year, loan fees
     declined.
     
     The reduction in LIBOR rates in the quarter also had
     a minor impact on loan yields. As a reminder, about
     70% of our loans are floating rate, with about 70%
     LIBOR-based. Additionally, the increase in the
     impact from non-accrual loans and maturing interest
     rate swaps had a small negative impact on loan
     yields.
     
     Of note, we have not seen any major loan-spread
     compression, only selectively for larger,
     better-rated corporations. Second, the yield on the
     securities portfolio was lower in the quarter.
     Mortgage rates fell significantly in the third
     quarter, resulting in accelerating prepayments of
     mortgage-backed securities throughout the quarter,
     particularly in September. In fact, prepayments were
     more than twice as high in September as they were in
     June. When prepayments occur, there is acceleration
     of the original purchase premium, which is being
     amortized over the security's expected life.
     
     Finally, the impact from the reduction in excess
     liquidity, partially offset the decline in the
     yields on loans and securities. Excess liquidity was
     represented by an average of $3 billion deposit with
     the Federal Reserve in the third quarter. This was a
     $736 million decline from the second quarter and
     declined less than we have anticipated due to
     continued weak loan demand and strong deposit
     levels.
     
     The excess liquidity position of September 30 was
     $3 billion. We are proactively managing excess liquidity as evidenced by the prepayment without penalty of $2 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank
     advances in late August, as well as fully redeeming
     $500 million in trust preferred securities at par on
     October 1. This excess liquidity is above and beyond
     the investment securities portfolio, which will
     continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity.
     
     Turning to Slide 9. Non-interest expenses remain
     well controlled in the third quarter. Credit-related
     costs declined with a $6 million decrease in the
     provision for lending-related commitments, partially
     offset by a $2 million increase in ORE expense.
     
     Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore,
     management and staff level is key. We have
     consistently reduced our workforce over the past
     several years. Our workforce decreased by
     approximately 3% from year-ago levels. Compared to
     2001, we have 20% fewer people today, while our
     assets are 10% larger.
     
     Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a
     result of the impact of one additional day in the
     third quarter and included an increase in share-based compensation expense of $6 million
     related to stock grants in the quarter.
     
     Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer, will
     discuss credit quality starting on Slide 10."

     improvement in our credit quality. Net charge-offs,
     the provision for credit losses and the watch list
     improved from second quarter levels.
     
     The third quarter marked the fifth consecutive
     quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit
     related charge-offs decreased $14 million to
     $132 million. Provision for credit losses, which
     includes loans as well as off-balance sheet
     commitments was $116 million. This was $10 million
     less than the second quarter, primarily due to
     declines in the Middle Market, Energy and
     Entertainment business lines, partially offset by an
     increase in the Private Banking and Commercial Real
     Estate business lines. The provision was less than
     charge-offs for the second consecutive quarter,
     reflecting our overall credit performance, including
     improving migration trends for both loans as well as
     off-balance sheet commitments. The allowance for
     loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 80% of
     total nonperforming loans.
     
     Slide 11 provides detail on net charge-offs, which
     decreased $14 million to $132 million in the third
     quarter. The decrease in net credit-related
     charge-offs resulted primarily from a $39 million
     decrease in the Middle Market, partially offset by a
     $24 million increase in the Commercial Real Estate
     business line, primarily in the Western and Midwest
     markets.
     
     On Slide 12, we provide information on the inflow to
     non-accrual loans. During the third quarter,
     $294 million of loan relationships greater than
     $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status.
     Of these inflows, $132 million were from the
     Commercial Real Estate business line, with almost
     3/4 coming from the Western market; $91 million were
     from the Middle Market business line, primarily in
     the Midwest market; and $28 million were from Energy
     Lending in the Texas market.
     Based on our analysis of default rates, risk rating
     migration patterns and watch list results, the
     increase in the inflow to non-accruals is caused by
     previously identified problem credits moving along
     the normal route of the collection process. We
     believe we will continue to see a downward trend in
     the inflows to non-accrual with some variability
     quarter-to-quarter, particularly in Commercial Real
     Estate.
     
     Turning to Slide 13. Total non-accrual loans
     increased $65 million to $1.2 billion. The largest
     portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the
     Commercial Real Estate line of business, which
     remains stable at $528 million in the quarter.
     Non-accruals increased in Middle Market by $41
     million. Private Banking and Global Corporate
     Banking non-accruals declined. By geography, the
     decrease in non-accrual loans in the Midwest was
     offset by increases in Western and Texas.
     
     Total TDRs increased from $99 million to
     $147 million in the third quarter. Of the total
     TDRs: $50 million were accruing, $28 million were
     reduced rate and $69 million were non-accrual. We
     sold $12 million of nonperforming loans in the
     quarter, as well as $7 million in performing loans.
     Additionally, we completed $42 million in short
     sales, of which $13 million were nonperforming
     loans, whereby we settled a note with the borrower
     at less than par. In total, prices approximated our
     carrying value plus reserves. This continued to
     support our analysis of valuations.
     
     We review workout strategies, reserves and carrying
     values for each individual nonperforming loan, at
     least quarterly. This proactive strategy has
     contributed to the decline in net charge-offs, as
     well as an average carrying value of our non-accrual
     loans of 55% compared to contractual values.
     
     On Slide 14, we have our watch list loans, which
     decreased by $480 million to $6.2 billion at the end
     of the third quarter. The watch list is primarily
     comprised of special mention, substandard and
     non-accrual loans. The watch list is the best early
     indicator we have of future credit quality. This is
     the fourth consecutive quarter of decline and
     reflects a significant decline in special mention
     loans.
     
     Declines in the watch list were evidenced in all
     geographic markets and across virtually all lines of
     business, particularly in Middle Market and
     Commercial Real Estate. Loans past due 90 days or
     more and still accruing totaled $104 million, an
     $11 million decrease from last quarter.
     
     Foreclosed property increased $27 million to
     $120 million, yet remains relatively small. Shared
     National Credit or SNC exam results were released in
     August. The results were consistent with the credit
     outlook we had given in July and overall, were not a
     factor in our third quarter results.
     
     On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by
     geography and project type of our Commercial Real
     Estate line of business, which declined $202 million
     on a period-end basis from the end of the second
     quarter. There is further detail provided in the
     appendix to these slides.
     
     Total outstandings of $4.1 billion were down
     $892 million from a year ago. This included a
     $513 million decrease in the Western market and
     $137 million decline in Michigan.
     
     Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial
     Real Estate line of business by project type and
     geography. Net charge-offs for Commercial Real
     Estate were $60 million in the third quarter and
     were consistent with our expectation for continued
     improvement with some variability from
     quarter-to-quarter. Values have stabilized and even
     improved in certain locations. The largest portion
     of charge-offs were noted in residential properties
     and in the Western market. Inflows to non-accruals
     greater than $2 million increased from a very low
     level in the second quarter. Total non-accruals were
     stable, and watch list loans decreased in the third
     quarter. We believe these trends are consistent with
     what we would expect in the normal course of working
     through problem loans.
     
     There are additional slides in the appendix, which
     provide further detail on certain segments. The
     consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10%
     of our total loans, continues to perform relatively
     well. Included in our consumer portfolio is only
     $1.6 billion in residential mortgages and $1.7 million in home equity loans. Given the size
     and makeup of the portfolio, we would expect any
     impact from the current industry foreclosure issues
     to be minimum.
     
     Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive
     supplier portfolio also can be found in the
     appendix. We continue to have excellent credit
     quality in both of those portfolios.
     
     To conclude on credit, we are pleased with the
     continued improvement in credit quality, including
     improving migration trends. In light of the sluggish
     and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth
     quarter net credit-related charge-offs to be similar
     to the third quarter. We expect the provision for
     credit losses in the fourth quarter will continue to
     be less than net charge-offs. Based on our
     year-to-date positive trends and our expectations
     for the fourth quarter, full year net charge-offs
     are expected to be lower than our prior outlook.
     
     Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

     position is strong and historically, we have had
     some of the highest capital ratios in our peer
     group.
     
     We fully redeemed our trust preferred securities at
     par on October 1. This uniquely positions us as the
     only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP,
     as well as eliminated trust preferred from its
     capital structure. The elimination of these higher
     cost securities will result in significant interest
     savings for us.
     
     Slide 18 outlines our summary analysis of the latest
     Basel proposal, if it is applied to Comerica. On the
     capital side, our assessment, based on currently
     available information, is that the expected impacts
     from changes in the components of capital in the
     calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be
     material. In fact, we believe we already meet the
     proposed capital ratio requirements.
     
     On the liquidity side, there's a high degree of
     uncertainty regarding implementation and
     interpretation of the rules. We'll be closely following the development of these new standards.
     
     We believe that the potential changes are
     manageable, given our proven ability to administer
     our balance sheet. Included in the appendix is a
     slide detailing the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act.
     Essentially, our analysis has not changed. Overall,
     we believe the direct adverse impact of financial
     reform will be felt less by Comerica than many other
     major banks due to the nature of our business.
     
     Slide 19 provides our outlook for the fourth
     quarter. We expect average earning assets of
     approximately $48 billion, largely reflecting a
     decline in average excess liquidity from $3 billion
     in the third quarter to about $1 billion in the
     fourth quarter. We expect that average excess
     liquidity will decline in the fourth quarter,
     primarily due to debt maturities, the redemption of
     the trust preferred and the full quarter effect of
     the $2 billion prepayment of the Federal Home Loan
     Bank advances in late August.
     
     We expect the net interest margin between 3.30% and
     3.35%, primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity to $1 billion and assuming prepayments in
     the investment securities portfolio remaining at the
     same high level we experienced in September. Our
     outlook for fourth quarter net credit-related
     charge-offs is that they will be similar to the
     third quarter. The provision for credit losses is
     expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.
     
     We expect a low single-digit decline in noninterest
     income compared to the third quarter. This includes
     the impact of Reg E and based on the current trends,
     we continue to anticipate a reduction in fee income
     of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter.
     As far as non-interest expenses, we expect a low
     single-digit increase compared to the third quarter.
     As previously announced, the fourth quarter will
     include a $5 million negative impact from the
     accelerated accretion of the remaining original
     issuance discount related to the redemption of the
     trust preferred securities.
     
     Overall, we saw positive trends continue in the
     third quarter, such as improved credit quality, a
     slower pace of decline in loan demand as well strong
     deposit and capital levels. We believe that our relationship approach have served us well throughout
     this cycle, economic cycle and will assist us in
     attracting new business and growing existing
     relationships as the economy improves.

     increase in Commercial Real Estate NPA inflow and
     therefore, the increase in total NPAs. And we have
     consistently said over the past several quarters,
     there could be some variability in any one of these
     numbers or two of these numbers as we go forward in
     this kind of economic uncertainty. The story on the
     CRE inflow was really a very familiar story for us.
     The main part of the increase in NPA inflow was due
     to a Single Family, resi and retail. Again, showing
     some distress as we have frankly have for a couple
     of quarters in a row. But everything we have
     analyzed, Ken, from migration patterns to the watch

     the normal collection route and not a new wave of

     the impact you just mentioned, high prepayments
     we're assuming will continue and we'll be
     reinvesting at lower yields. And that will have a
     minor, but probably a little larger impact in the

     meant to be bureaucratic, and it is because it

     We're calling on customers. We're calling on
     prospects. We're looking for the core Middle Market
     opportunities, particularly in Texas and California.
     And we have those good opportunities, we have a
     better quality backlog. But it will take some time,
     I think, to see any significant growth, if you will,
     in the C&I book. It's just going to be sort of an
     ongoing quarter-to-quarter blocking and tackling
     kind of an effort."

     much higher than year ago levels. And so while we
     have some seen some decline, I would expect that we
     could see a little modest decline in the fourth
     quarter in noninterest-bearing. So that's certainly
     all the dynamics of thinking about the different
     aspects of the balance sheet are factored into the
     outlook we gave of the 3.30% to 3.35% in the fourth

     the Fed funds rate next year. So we think that the
     margin looks pretty stable next year relative to
     where it's going to end up in the fourth quarter.
     And while there will still be further dissipation of
     the excess liquidity, which will be a positive for
     the margin next year versus 2010, we still will be
     working through, particularly in the first half of
     the year, some offsets to that through the maturing
     of swap. We have $800 million of swaps maturing that
     have positive spreads in the first quarter and also

Today, we reported third quarter net income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average loans and lower fee income from customer activities. In",896,"Good morning. Today, we reported third quarter net income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average loans and lower fee income from customer activities. In this sluggish and still uncertain economic environment, our customers have remained understandably  cautious. This is reflected in the weak loan demand and continued strong core deposit levels.
     
Our solid capital and liquidity position enabled us to fully redeem our trust preferred securities on October 1, which will reduce interest expense. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer      group to have redeemed TARP and eliminated trust preferred securities.
     
Our third quarter financial results reflected the continued improvement in credit quality and careful control of expenses. Our skill-based,      relationship-driven strategy and our prudent, conservative approach to banking continued to serve us well.  
 We believe we have a business model that cannot be replicated overnight. It takes years of experience and expertise to understand the credit cycle, small businesses, middle market companies and their owners, managers and employees, for whom we provide personal financial services. Relationships mean more than ever in this type of environment. While      unemployment remains stubbornly high, there are some signals the economy is improving, albeit slowly.
     
Economic factors, which support loan growth, such as business fixed investment and inventories continue to improve. The Commerce Department recently indicated that investments in computers, communications equipment and machinery, for example, help spur capital goods orders in August, which is a good sign.
     
Here in Texas, which continues to outperform the national economy, we are establishing good full service relationships with solid companies as ong-term calling by relationship managers and executive management is paying off. In California, a state whose economy is holding steady according to our chief economist’s latest economic activity index,    we are seeing more opportunities in Middle Market and Small Business Banking in addition to Technology and Life Sciences.
     
In Michigan, a rebound in manufacturing is helping that state and the national economy emerge from the recession. U.S. light vehicle sales are headed in the right direction this year. We are seeing more    encouraging and hopeful signs throughout our footprint. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in the third quarter.
     
Commercial loans increased modestly in the third quarter, and total loans increased in the month of September. Our loan pipeline continued its strong growth as evidenced by the commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased nearly 50% from the second quarter. Line utilization increased almost 1% to about 46% at September 30 after remaining at about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. We have loan growth in the third quarter in Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Energy Lending business lines. Commercial Real Estate accounted for about half of the decline in average loan outstandings in the third quarter as expected.
     
After six straight quarters of growth, the average deposit levels were relatively stable compared to the second quarter. The continued improvement in credit quality is reflected by the decline in net      charge-offs for the fifth consecutive quarter, as well as the $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses compared to the second quarter.
     
The increase in inflows to non-accrual loans was primarily related to Commercial Real Estate, which we believe will continue to exhibit variability with a downward trend. Overall, credit migration has      improved as evidenced by the $480 million decline in the watch list, which is our best early indicator of future credit quality. Our early recognition of credit issues and our ability to quickly and     proactively work through them remains one of our key strengths.
     
In light of the struggle and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter. Based on year-to-date positive trends as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter, our full year net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook.
     
The net interest margin decreased five basis points to 3.23%, resulting from a variety of factors, which Beth will discuss shortly. We do expect our net interest margin to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels.
     
Our expenses remain well controlled. Noninterest expenses were relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Our capital ratios remain strong.      The tangible common equity ratio increased 28 basis points to 10.39% at September 30, and the estimated tier 1 common ratio increased 16 basis points to 9.97% at September 30 from June 30.
     
We will be closely following the development of the new Basel standards. Comerica has maintained a very strong capital base for a long time, and we expect we will comfortably be able to meet the proposed capital requirements. With respect to financial reform, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than by many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
     
In closing, we have remained focused on executing our relationship banking strategy and delivering outstanding customer service throughout this economic cycle. Positive trends in credit quality have continued, and we have strong capital and liquidity to grow organically or by acquisition.
     
And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

As I review our third quarter results, I will be referring to slides we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our third quarter 2010 results compared to the prior period and at the same period a year ago. Today, we reported third quarter 2010 net income of $59 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.33.
     
Slide 4 provides highlights of the financial results for the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Credit quality continue to improve. Net credit related charge-offs decreased by $14 million from the second quarter to $132 million. The provision for credit losses was $116 million, $10 million less than the second quarter. Also, the watch list declined by $480 million. The pace of decline in loans continued to slow in the third quarter. Average loans declined $470 million compared to declines of $641 million in the second quarter and $1.4 billion in the first quarter.
     
Average deposit levels remained strong, decreasing only 1% from the second quarter. Growth in business deposits was offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking deposits. The net interest margin in the third quarter was 3.23%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.42%. We continue to carefully control expenses with non-interest expenses relatively stable, and our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.39%.
     
As I just mentioned, the pace at which average loans declined continued to slow as shown on Slide 5. Average loans declined $570 million in the third quarter, and in the last month of the quarter, average loans increased $145 million. We are hoping that we have started to turn the corner on loan outstandings. Average commercial loans were up $57 million over last quarter. On a period-end basis, commercial loans increased $281 million from June 30 to September 30. As commercial loan growth  returns, we expect it will be muted by declines in Commercial Real Estate loans. In fact, about half of the decline in average outstandings in the third quarter was in Commercial Real Estate.
     
Turning to Slide 6. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. In the third quarter, average loan outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services and Energy. Decreased average outstandings in the third quarter were noted in a number of areas, with the largest declines in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole increased almost 1% to about 46% after remaining about 45% since the middle of the first quarter.
     
While loan demand remains weak as our customers are understandably cautious, given the sluggish and uncertain economy, we are hopeful as our loan pipelines continue to grow. This includes commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased almost 50% in the third quarter to  $871 million.
     
As shown on Slide 7, core deposits remained strong in the third quarter. Average core deposits decreased a modest $142 million after six  consecutive quarters of growth. Our $327 million increase in money market and NOW deposits was offset by a $298 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits and $119 million decline in customers CDs. Overall, deposit growth in Commercial segments was offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking deposits. We had growth in several business segments led by Middle Market, Energy and Small Business, partially offset by a decrease in Global Corporate Banking.
Deposits declined in Private Banking as customers generally shifted in the money market accounts at Comerica Securities. A smaller decrease was noted in Personal Banking where in the Midwest, over half the decrease related to maturities of higher-priced CDs.   
As outlined on Slide 8, the net interest margin of 3.23% decreased five basis points compared to the second quarter for several reasons. First of all, we had lower loan yields in the quarter. This was primarily a result of the lower fees in the margin. When a loan is prepaid, there is accelerated recognition of deferred loan fees. Due to the slower pace of loan prepayments in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, loan fees declined.
     
The reduction in LIBOR rates in the quarter also had a minor impact on loan yields. As a reminder, about 70% of our loans are floating rate, with about 70% LIBOR-based. Additionally, the increase in the impact from non-accrual loans and maturing interest rate swaps had a small negative impact on loan yields.
     
Of note, we have not seen any major loan-spread compression, only selectively for larger, better-rated corporations. Second, the yield on the securities portfolio was lower in the quarter. Mortgage rates fell significantly in the third quarter, resulting in accelerating prepayments of mortgage-backed securities throughout the quarter, particularly in September. In fact, prepayments were more than twice as high in September as they were in June. When prepayments occur, there is acceleration  of the original purchase premium, which is being amortized over the security's expected life.
     
Finally, the impact from the reduction in excess liquidity, partially offset the decline in the yields on loans and securities. Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3 billion deposit with      the Federal Reserve in the third quarter. This was a $736 million decline from the second quarter and declined less than we have anticipated due to continued weak loan demand and strong deposit levels.
     
The excess liquidity position of September 30 was $3 billion. We are proactively managing excess liquidity as evidenced by the prepayment without penalty of $2 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August, as well as fully redeeming $500 million in trust preferred securities at par on October 1. This excess liquidity is above and beyond  the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity. 
     
Turning to Slide 9. Non-interest expenses remain well controlled in the third quarter. Credit-related costs declined with a $6 million decrease in the provision for lending-related commitments, partially offset by a $2 million increase in ORE expense. 
   
Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management and staff level is key. We have consistently reduced our workforce over the past  several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 3% from year-ago levels. Compared to 2001, we have 20% fewer people today, while our assets are 10% larger.
     
Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a result of the impact of one additional day in the third quarter and included an increase in  share-based compensation expense of $6 million related to stock grants in the quarter.
     
Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer, will discuss credit quality starting on Slide 10."

In the third quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit quality. Net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses and the watch list improved from second quarter levels.     The third quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter",1103,"Good morning. In the third quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit quality. Net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses and the watch list improved from second quarter levels.
     
The third quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit related charge-offs decreased $14 million to  $132 million. Provision for credit losses, which includes loans as well as off-balance sheet commitments was $116 million. This was $10 million  less than the second quarter, primarily due to declines in the Middle Market, Energy and Entertainment business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Private Banking and Commercial Real Estate business lines. The provision was less than charge-offs for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our overall credit performance, including improving migration trends for both loans as well as off-balance sheet commitments. The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 80% of total nonperforming loans.
     
Slide 11 provides detail on net charge-offs, which decreased $14 million to $132 million in the third quarter. The decrease in net credit-related  charge-offs resulted primarily from a $39 million decrease in the Middle Market, partially offset by a $24 million increase in the Commercial Real Estate business line, primarily in the Western and Midwest markets.
     
On Slide 12, we provide information on the inflow to non-accrual loans. During the third quarter, $294 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status. Of these inflows, $132 million were from the Commercial Real Estate business line, with almost 3/4 coming from the Western market; $91 million were from the Middle Market business line, primarily in the Midwest market; and $28 million were from Energy Lending in the Texas market.
Based on our analysis of default rates, risk rating migration patterns and watch list results, the increase in the inflow to non-accruals is caused by previously identified problem credits moving along the normal route of the collection process. We believe we will continue to see a downward trend in the inflows to non-accrual with some variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly in Commercial Real Estate.
     
Turning to Slide 13. Total non-accrual loans increased $65 million to $1.2 billion. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the Commercial Real Estate line of business, which remains stable at $528 million in the quarter. Non-accruals increased in Middle Market by $41 million. Private Banking and Global Corporate Banking non-accruals declined. By geography, the decrease in non-accrual loans in the Midwest was offset by increases in Western and Texas.
     
Total TDRs increased from $99 million to $147 million in the third quarter. Of the total TDRs: $50 million were accruing, $28 million were
reduced rate and $69 million were non-accrual. We sold $12 million of nonperforming loans in the quarter, as well as $7 million in performing loans. Additionally, we completed $42 million in short sales, of which $13 million were nonperforming loans, whereby we settled a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continued to support our analysis of valuations.
     
We review workout strategies, reserves and carrying values for each individual nonperforming loan, at least quarterly. This proactive strategy has contributed to the decline in net charge-offs, as well as an average carrying value of our non-accrual loans of 55% compared to contractual values.   
   
On Slide 14, we have our watch list loans, which decreased by $480 million to $6.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, substandard and non-accrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of decline and reflects a significant decline in special mention loans.
     
Declines in the watch list were evidenced in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business, particularly in Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $104 million, an $11 million decrease from last quarter.
     
Foreclosed property increased $27 million to $120 million, yet remains relatively small. Shared National Credit or SNC exam results were released in August. The results were consistent with the credit    outlook we had given in July and overall, were not a factor in our third quarter results.
     
On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $202 million on a period-end basis from the end of the second quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides.
     
Total outstandings of $4.1 billion were down $892 million from a year ago. This included a $513 million decrease in the Western market and
$137 million decline in Michigan.
     
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial Real Estate line of business by project type and geography. Net charge-offs for Commercial Real Estate were $60 million in the third quarter and were consistent with our expectation for continued improvement with some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Values have stabilized and even improved in certain locations. The largest portion of charge-offs were noted in residential properties and in the Western market. Inflows to non-accruals greater than $2 million increased from a very low level in the second quarter. Total non-accruals were stable, and watch list loans decreased in the third quarter. We believe these trends are consistent with what we would expect in the normal course of working through problem loans.
     
There are additional slides in the appendix, which provide further detail on certain segments. The consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans, continues to perform relatively well. Included in our consumer portfolio is only $1.6 billion in residential mortgages and $1.7 million in home equity loans. Given the size and makeup of the portfolio, we would expect any impact from the current industry foreclosure issues to be minimum.
     
Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of those portfolios.
     
To conclude on credit, we are pleased with the continued improvement in credit quality, including improving migration trends. In light of the sluggish and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth      quarter net credit-related charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter. We expect the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter will continue to be less than net charge-offs. Based on our year-to-date positive trends and our expectations for the fourth quarter, full year net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook.
     
Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

Turning to Slide 17, our capital position is strong and historically, we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group.

Turning to Slide 17, our capital position is strong and historically, we have had some of the highest capital ratios in our peer group.
     
We fully redeemed our trust preferred securities at par on October 1. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP, as well as eliminated trust preferred from its capital structure. The elimination of these higher cost securities will result in significant interest savings for us.
     
Slide 18 outlines our summary analysis of the latest Basel proposal, if it is applied to Comerica. On the capital side, our assessment, based on currently available information, is that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital in the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. In fact, we believe we already meet the     proposed capital ratio requirements.
     
On the liquidity side, there's a high degree of uncertainty regarding implementation and interpretation of the rules. We'll be closely  following the development of these new standards.
     
We believe that the potential changes are manageable, given our proven ability to administer our balance sheet. Included in the appendix is a  slide detailing the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. Essentially, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we believe the direct adverse impact of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
     
Slide 19 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect average earning assets of approximately $48 billion, largely reflecting a   decline in average excess liquidity from $3 billion in the third quarter to about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect that average excess liquidity will decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to debt maturities, the redemption of the trust preferred and the full quarter effect of the $2 billion prepayment of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August.
     
We expect the net interest margin between 3.30% and 3.35%, primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity to $1 billion and assuming prepayments in the investment securities portfolio remaining at the    same high level we experienced in September. Our outlook for fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs is that they will be similar to the third quarter. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.
     
We expect a low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to the third quarter. This includes the impact of Reg E and based on the current trends, we continue to anticipate a reduction in fee income  of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter. As far as non-interest expenses, we expect a low single-digit increase compared to the third quarter. As previously announced, the fourth quarter will include a $5 million negative impact from the accelerated accretion of the remaining original issuance discount related to the redemption of the trust preferred securities.
     
Overall, we saw positive trends continue in the third quarter, such as improved credit quality, a slower pace of decline in loan demand as well strong deposit and capital levels. We believe that our relationship  approach have served us well throughout this cycle, economic cycle and will assist us in attracting new business and growing existing  relationships as the economy improves.

We still have had four, five quarters in a row of improving credit metrics. And as you saw in the third quarter again, net charge-offs provision past dues and most importantly, the watch list improved. We did see the  increase in Commercial Real Estate NPA inflow and therefore, the increase in total NPAs. And we have consistently said over the past several quarters, there could be some variability in any one of these numbers or two of these numbers as we go forward in this kind of economic uncertainty. The story on the CRE inflow was really a very familiar story for us. The main part of the increase in NPA inflow was due to a Single Family, resi and retail. Again, showing some distress as we have frankly have for a couple of quarters in a row. But everything we have  analyzed, Ken, from migration patterns to the watch list itself leads us to believe that these are all previously identified problem credits moving through the normal collection route and not a new wave of problems. Overall, we still expect credit metrics to continue to improve with some variability from quarter-to-quarter as we've seen in this quarter, particularly in the Commercial Real Estate sector, which as you know, is still struggling in this economic environment. So there's still a lot of work to do."

So we will continue to see two things as partial offsets to the excess liquidity going away. One is the impact you just mentioned, high prepayments we're assuming will continue and we'll be reinvesting at lower yields. And that will have a minor, but probably a little larger impact in the third quarter. And second, we have maturing interest rates swaps, which are maturing at positive spreads. So those will be going away, another $200 million in the $700 million matured in the third quarter, $200 million in the fourth.

And a key element is obviously controlling people. And as we mentioned earlier, we have done, I think, a really good job over a long period of time of managing people. As I mentioned in the script, just     to repeat it, that we're operating today with 20% fewer people and our bank is 10% bigger in terms of assets. So the productivity, if you look at assets, average assets per employee, almost 40% improvement. And so we will continue to be focused on finding ways, not protecting the revenue base, the revenue producers, but finding ways to continue to do things more efficiently than we have in the past. And those jobs that we've taken out as part of that efficiency won't come back. So the management of people is a big part of our expense base. We're always looking at ways to do things more effectively. And so it's not something that we do as part of a big program that we announced. It's a two-year program with a fancy name. This is literally a part of a monthly process. And even the management of people to the extent they're different from what have been approved at budget levels, it has to come to the management policy committee to get approval. That's meant to be bureaucratic, and it is because it really means that people are serious about meeting that head count, they're going to come and ask the very senior people. So I think we have a very good process. We'll give more color on kind of the    dynamics for next year in January. But be assured, it's a big focus for the management team."

Today, we reported third quarter net income of $59 million or $0.33 per share. Third quarter total revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in average loans and lower fee income from customer activities. In this sluggish and still uncertain economic environment, our customers have remained understandably  cautious. This is reflected in the weak loan demand and continued strong core deposit levels.
Our solid capital and liquidity position enabled us to fully redeem our trust preferred securities on October 1, which will reduce interest expense. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer      group to have redeemed TARP and eliminated trust preferred securities.
Our third quarter financial results reflected the continued improvement in credit quality and careful control of expenses. Our skill-based,      relationship-driven strategy and our prudent, conservative approach to banking continued to serve us well.  
We believe we have a business model that cannot be replicated overnight. It takes years of experience and expertise to understand the credit cycle, small businesses, middle market companies and their owners, managers and employees, for whom we provide personal financial services. Relationships mean more than ever in this type of environment. While      unemployment remains stubbornly high, there are some signals the economy is improving, albeit slowly.
Economic factors, which support loan growth, such as business fixed investment and inventories continue to improve. The Commerce Department recently indicated that investments in computers, communications equipment and machinery, for example, help spur capital goods orders in August, which is a good sign.
Here in Texas, which continues to outperform the national economy, we are establishing good full service relationships with solid companies as ong-term calling by relationship managers and executive management is paying off. In California, a state whose economy is holding steady according to our chief economist’s latest economic activity index,    we are seeing more opportunities in Middle Market and Small Business Banking in addition to Technology and Life Sciences.
In Michigan, a rebound in manufacturing is helping that state and the national economy emerge from the recession. U.S. light vehicle sales are headed in the right direction this year. We are seeing more    encouraging and hopeful signs throughout our footprint. The pace of decline in loan outstandings continued to slow in the third quarter.
Commercial loans increased modestly in the third quarter, and total loans increased in the month of September. Our loan pipeline continued its strong growth as evidenced by the commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased nearly 50% from the second quarter. Line utilization increased almost 1% to about 46% at September 30 after remaining at about 45% since the middle of the first quarter. We have loan growth in the third quarter in Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Energy Lending business lines. Commercial Real Estate accounted for about half of the decline in average loan outstandings in the third quarter as expected.
After six straight quarters of growth, the average deposit levels were relatively stable compared to the second quarter. The continued improvement in credit quality is reflected by the decline in net      charge-offs for the fifth consecutive quarter, as well as the $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses compared to the second quarter.
The increase in inflows to non-accrual loans was primarily related to Commercial Real Estate, which we believe will continue to exhibit variability with a downward trend. Overall, credit migration has      improved as evidenced by the $480 million decline in the watch list, which is our best early indicator of future credit quality. Our early recognition of credit issues and our ability to quickly and     proactively work through them remains one of our key strengths.
In light of the struggle and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter. Based on year-to-date positive trends as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter, our full year net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook.
The net interest margin decreased five basis points to 3.23%, resulting from a variety of factors, which Beth will discuss shortly. We do expect our net interest margin to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels.
Our expenses remain well controlled. Noninterest expenses were relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Our capital ratios remain strong.      The tangible common equity ratio increased 28 basis points to 10.39% at September 30, and the estimated tier 1 common ratio increased 16 basis points to 9.97% at September 30 from June 30.
We will be closely following the development of the new Basel standards. Comerica has maintained a very strong capital base for a long time, and we expect we will comfortably be able to meet the proposed capital requirements. With respect to financial reform, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we believe that the direct adverse impacts of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than by many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
In closing, we have remained focused on executing our relationship banking strategy and delivering outstanding customer service throughout this economic cycle. Positive trends in credit quality have continued, and we have strong capital and liquidity to grow organically or by acquisition.
And now I'll turn the call over to Beth and John, who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

As I review our third quarter results, I will be referring to slides we have prepared that provide additional details on our earnings. Turning to Slide 3, we outlined the major components of our third quarter 2010 results compared to the prior period and at the same period a year ago. Today, we reported third quarter 2010 net income of $59 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.33.
Slide 4 provides highlights of the financial results for the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Credit quality continue to improve. Net credit related charge-offs decreased by $14 million from the second quarter to $132 million. The provision for credit losses was $116 million, $10 million less than the second quarter. Also, the watch list declined by $480 million. The pace of decline in loans continued to slow in the third quarter. Average loans declined $470 million compared to declines of $641 million in the second quarter and $1.4 billion in the first quarter.
Average deposit levels remained strong, decreasing only 1% from the second quarter. Growth in business deposits was offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking deposits. The net interest margin in the third quarter was 3.23%. Excluding the impact of excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.42%. We continue to carefully control expenses with non-interest expenses relatively stable, and our capital position remains strong as evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio of 10.39%.
As I just mentioned, the pace at which average loans declined continued to slow as shown on Slide 5. Average loans declined $570 million in the third quarter, and in the last month of the quarter, average loans increased $145 million. We are hoping that we have started to turn the corner on loan outstandings. Average commercial loans were up $57 million over last quarter. On a period-end basis, commercial loans increased $281 million from June 30 to September 30. As commercial loan growth  returns, we expect it will be muted by declines in Commercial Real Estate loans. In fact, about half of the decline in average outstandings in the third quarter was in Commercial Real Estate.
Turning to Slide 6. Our loan portfolio is well diversified among many lines of business and geographies. In the third quarter, average loan outstandings increased in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services and Energy. Decreased average outstandings in the third quarter were noted in a number of areas, with the largest declines in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking. Line utilization for the portfolio as a whole increased almost 1% to about 46% after remaining about 45% since the middle of the first quarter.
While loan demand remains weak as our customers are understandably cautious, given the sluggish and uncertain economy, we are hopeful as our loan pipelines continue to grow. This includes commitments issued, but not yet closed, which increased almost 50% in the third quarter to  $871 million.
As shown on Slide 7, core deposits remained strong in the third quarter. Average core deposits decreased a modest $142 million after six  consecutive quarters of growth. Our $327 million increase in money market and NOW deposits was offset by a $298 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits and $119 million decline in customers CDs. Overall, deposit growth in Commercial segments was offset by reduced Personal and Private Banking deposits. We had growth in several business segments led by Middle Market, Energy and Small Business, partially offset by a decrease in Global Corporate Banking.
Deposits declined in Private Banking as customers generally shifted in the money market accounts at Comerica Securities. A smaller decrease was noted in Personal Banking where in the Midwest, over half the decrease related to maturities of higher-priced CDs.   
As outlined on Slide 8, the net interest margin of 3.23% decreased five basis points compared to the second quarter for several reasons. First of all, we had lower loan yields in the quarter. This was primarily a result of the lower fees in the margin. When a loan is prepaid, there is accelerated recognition of deferred loan fees. Due to the slower pace of loan prepayments in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, loan fees declined.
The reduction in LIBOR rates in the quarter also had a minor impact on loan yields. As a reminder, about 70% of our loans are floating rate, with about 70% LIBOR-based. Additionally, the increase in the impact from non-accrual loans and maturing interest rate swaps had a small negative impact on loan yields.
Of note, we have not seen any major loan-spread compression, only selectively for larger, better-rated corporations. Second, the yield on the securities portfolio was lower in the quarter. Mortgage rates fell significantly in the third quarter, resulting in accelerating prepayments of mortgage-backed securities throughout the quarter, particularly in September. In fact, prepayments were more than twice as high in September as they were in June. When prepayments occur, there is acceleration  of the original purchase premium, which is being amortized over the security's expected life.
Finally, the impact from the reduction in excess liquidity, partially offset the decline in the yields on loans and securities. Excess liquidity was represented by an average of $3 billion deposit with      the Federal Reserve in the third quarter. This was a $736 million decline from the second quarter and declined less than we have anticipated due to continued weak loan demand and strong deposit levels.
The excess liquidity position of September 30 was $3 billion. We are proactively managing excess liquidity as evidenced by the prepayment without penalty of $2 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August, as well as fully redeeming $500 million in trust preferred securities at par on October 1. This excess liquidity is above and beyond  the investment securities portfolio, which will continue to provide a reservoir of liquidity. 
Turning to Slide 9. Non-interest expenses remain well controlled in the third quarter. Credit-related costs declined with a $6 million decrease in the provision for lending-related commitments, partially offset by a $2 million increase in ORE expense. 
Our largest expense item is salaries and therefore, management and staff level is key. We have consistently reduced our workforce over the past  several years. Our workforce decreased by approximately 3% from year-ago levels. Compared to 2001, we have 20% fewer people today, while our assets are 10% larger.
Salaries expense was higher in the quarter as a result of the impact of one additional day in the third quarter and included an increase in  share-based compensation expense of $6 million related to stock grants in the quarter.
Now John Killian, our Chief Credit Officer, will discuss credit quality starting on Slide 10."
318670,113542909,80621,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Good morning. In the third quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit quality.

In the third quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit quality. Net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses and the watch list improved from second quarter levels.
The third quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in net charge-offs. Net credit related charge-offs decreased $14 million to $132 million. Provision for credit losses, which includes loans as well as off-balance sheet commitments was $116 million. This was $10 million less than the second quarter, primarily due to declines in the Middle Market, Energy and Entertainment business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Private Banking and Commercial Real Estate business lines. The provision was less than charge-offs for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our overall credit performance, including improving migration trends for both loans as well as off-balance sheet commitments. The allowance for loan losses was 2.38% of total loans and 80% of total nonperforming loans.
Slide 11 provides detail on net charge-offs, which decreased $14 million to $132 million in the third quarter. The decrease in net credit-related charge-offs resulted primarily from a $39 million decrease in the Middle Market, partially offset by a $24 million increase in the Commercial Real Estate business line, primarily in the Western and Midwest markets.
On Slide 12, we provide information on the inflow to non-accrual loans. During the third quarter, $294 million of loan relationships greater than $2 million were transferred to non-accrual status. Of these inflows, $132 million were from the Commercial Real Estate business line, with almost 3/4 coming from the Western market; $91 million were from the Middle Market business line, primarily in the Midwest market; and $28 million were from Energy Lending in the Texas market.
Based on our analysis of default rates, risk rating migration patterns and watch list results, the increase in the inflow to non-accruals is caused by previously identified problem credits moving along the normal route of the collection process. We believe we will continue to see a downward trend in the inflows to non-accrual with some variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly in Commercial Real Estate.
Turning to Slide 13. Total non-accrual loans increased $65 million to $1.2 billion. The largest portion of the non-accrual loans continues to be the Commercial Real Estate line of business, which remains stable at $528 million in the quarter. Non-accruals increased in Middle Market by $41 million. Private Banking and Global Corporate Banking non-accruals declined. By geography, the decrease in non-accrual loans in the Midwest was offset by increases in Western and Texas.
Total TDRs increased from $99 million to $147 million in the third quarter. Of the total TDRs: $50 million were accruing, $28 million were
reduced rate and $69 million were non-accrual. We sold $12 million of nonperforming loans in the quarter, as well as $7 million in performing loans. Additionally, we completed $42 million in short sales, of which $13 million were nonperforming loans, whereby we settled a note with the borrower at less than par. In total, prices approximated our carrying value plus reserves. This continued to support our analysis of valuations.
We review workout strategies, reserves and carrying values for each individual nonperforming loan, at least quarterly. This proactive strategy has contributed to the decline in net charge-offs, as well as an average carrying value of our non-accrual loans of 55% compared to contractual values.   
On Slide 14, we have our watch list loans, which decreased by $480 million to $6.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. The watch list is primarily comprised of special mention, substandard and non-accrual loans. The watch list is the best early indicator we have of future credit quality. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of decline and reflects a significant decline in special mention loans.
Declines in the watch list were evidenced in all geographic markets and across virtually all lines of business, particularly in Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $104 million, an $11 million decrease from last quarter.
Foreclosed property increased $27 million to $120 million, yet remains relatively small. Shared National Credit or SNC exam results were released in August. The results were consistent with the credit    outlook we had given in July and overall, were not a factor in our third quarter results.
On Slide 15, we provide a detailed breakdown by geography and project type of our Commercial Real Estate line of business, which declined $202 million on a period-end basis from the end of the second quarter. There is further detail provided in the appendix to these slides.
Total outstandings of $4.1 billion were down $892 million from a year ago. This included a $513 million decrease in the Western market and
$137 million decline in Michigan.
Slide 16 provides net charge-offs for our Commercial Real Estate line of business by project type and geography. Net charge-offs for Commercial Real Estate were $60 million in the third quarter and were consistent with our expectation for continued improvement with some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Values have stabilized and even improved in certain locations. The largest portion of charge-offs were noted in residential properties and in the Western market. Inflows to non-accruals greater than $2 million increased from a very low level in the second quarter. Total non-accruals were stable, and watch list loans decreased in the third quarter. We believe these trends are consistent with what we would expect in the normal course of working through problem loans.
There are additional slides in the appendix, which provide further detail on certain segments. The consumer portfolio, representing approximately 10% of our total loans, continues to perform relatively well. Included in our consumer portfolio is only $1.6 billion in residential mortgages and $1.7 million in home equity loans. Given the size and makeup of the portfolio, we would expect any impact from the current industry foreclosure issues to be minimum.
Slides detailing our auto dealer and automotive supplier portfolio also can be found in the appendix. We continue to have excellent credit quality in both of those portfolios.
To conclude on credit, we are pleased with the continued improvement in credit quality, including improving migration trends. In light of the sluggish and uncertain economic environment, we expect fourth      quarter net credit-related charge-offs to be similar to the third quarter. We expect the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter will continue to be less than net charge-offs. Based on our year-to-date positive trends and our expectations for the fourth quarter, full year net charge-offs are expected to be lower than our prior outlook.
Now I'll turn the call back to Beth."

We fully redeemed our trust preferred securities at par on October 1. This uniquely positions us as the only bank in our peer group to have redeemed TARP, as well as eliminated trust preferred from its capital structure. The elimination of these higher cost securities will result in significant interest savings for us.
Slide 18 outlines our summary analysis of the latest Basel proposal, if it is applied to Comerica. On the capital side, our assessment, based on currently available information, is that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital in the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. In fact, we believe we already meet the     proposed capital ratio requirements.
On the liquidity side, there's a high degree of uncertainty regarding implementation and interpretation of the rules. We'll be closely  following the development of these new standards.
We believe that the potential changes are manageable, given our proven ability to administer our balance sheet. Included in the appendix is a  slide detailing the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. Essentially, our analysis has not changed. Overall, we believe the direct adverse impact of financial reform will be felt less by Comerica than many other major banks due to the nature of our business.
Slide 19 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect average earning assets of approximately $48 billion, largely reflecting a   decline in average excess liquidity from $3 billion in the third quarter to about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect that average excess liquidity will decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to debt maturities, the redemption of the trust preferred and the full quarter effect of the $2 billion prepayment of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances in late August.
We expect the net interest margin between 3.30% and 3.35%, primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity to $1 billion and assuming prepayments in the investment securities portfolio remaining at the    same high level we experienced in September. Our outlook for fourth quarter net credit-related charge-offs is that they will be similar to the third quarter. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.
We expect a low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to the third quarter. This includes the impact of Reg E and based on the current trends, we continue to anticipate a reduction in fee income  of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter. As far as non-interest expenses, we expect a low single-digit increase compared to the third quarter. As previously announced, the fourth quarter will include a $5 million negative impact from the accelerated accretion of the remaining original issuance discount related to the redemption of the trust preferred securities.
Overall, we saw positive trends continue in the third quarter, such as improved credit quality, a slower pace of decline in loan demand as well strong deposit and capital levels. We believe that our relationship  approach have served us well throughout this cycle, economic cycle and will assist us in attracting new business and growing existing  relationships as the economy improves.
Now we'd be happy to answer any questions you have."

We still have had four, five quarters in a row of improving credit metrics. And as you saw in the third quarter again, net charge-offs provision past dues and most importantly, the watch list improved. We did see the  increase in Commercial Real Estate NPA inflow and therefore, the increase in total NPAs. And we have consistently said over the past several quarters, there could be some variability in any one of these numbers or two of these numbers as we go forward in this kind of economic uncertainty. The story on the CRE inflow was really a very familiar story for us. The main part of the increase in NPA inflow was due to a Single Family, resi and retail. Again, showing some distress as we have frankly have for a couple of quarters in a row. But everything we have  analyzed, Ken, from migration patterns to the watch list itself leads us to believe that these are all previously identified problem credits moving through the normal collection route and not a new wave of problems. Overall, we still expect credit metrics to continue to improve with some variability from quarter-to-quarter as we've seen in this quarter, particularly in the Commercial Real Estate sector, which as you know, is still struggling in this economic environment. So there's still a lot of work to do."

One is the impact you just mentioned, high prepayments we're assuming will continue and we'll be reinvesting at lower yields. And that will have a minor, but probably a little larger impact in the third quarter. And second, we have maturing interest rates swaps, which are maturing at positive spreads. So those will be going away, another $200 million in the $700 million matured in the third quarter, $200 million in the fourth. So the positive, very positive impact from excess liquidity will be diminished a little by those two aspects as well."

Clearly, the Dealer business has shown growth. The Energy business as indicated has shown growth. Those backlogs continue to look good. And what we call the commitments to commit or the approved deals that we're waiting to close are up rather substantially this quarter over last quarter. And again, that's generally across the most of the segments: Middle Market, Technology and Life Sciences and so forth. So the quality of the backlog, if you will, is good in the sense that there are more deals that have been approved. They're waiting to close and the level of activity is generally a little better than it's been. So I would say that we're cautiously optimistic. But this is an uncertain time so while we're seeing some improvements and we're happy to see it, we're happy to see better usage, there's still an economy here     that most business people will tell you is concerning, troubling, uncertain."

So the productivity, if you look at assets, average assets per employee, almost 40% improvement. And so we will continue to be focused on finding ways, not protecting the revenue base, the revenue producers, but finding ways to continue to do things more efficiently than we have in the past. And those jobs that we've taken out as part of that efficiency won't come back. So the management of people is a big part of our expense base. We're always looking at ways to do things more effectively. And so it's not something that we do as part of a big program that we announced. It's a two-year program with a fancy name. This is literally a part of a monthly process. And even the management of people to the extent they're different from what have been approved at budget levels, it has to come to the management policy committee to get approval. That's meant to be bureaucratic, and it is because it really means that people are serious about meeting that head count, they're going to come and ask the very senior people.

I hope that, that's not correct."

But there's always the chance that there'll be some variability in any quarter in any particular credit metrics. So we're still pretty optimistic that the downward trend on a more expansive six or seven, eight quarter linked-quarter basis will hold. But from any quarter-to-quarter, there could be some variability. It's just that uncertain an economy."

That's after, as I mentioned, six consecutive quarters of growth. And so they're still much higher than year ago levels. And so while we have some seen some decline, I would expect that we could see a little modest decline in the fourth quarter in noninterest-bearing. So that's certainly all the dynamics of thinking about the different aspects of the balance sheet are factored into the outlook we gave of the 3.30% to 3.35% in the fourth quarter. Related to next year, when I think about the margin -- and we're not assuming an increase in the Fed funds rate next year. So we think that the margin looks pretty stable next year relative to where it's going to end up in the fourth quarter. And while there will still be further dissipation of the excess liquidity, which will be a positive for the margin next year versus 2010, we still will be working through, particularly in the first half of the year, some offsets to that through the maturing of swap. We have $800 million of swaps maturing that have positive spreads in the first quarter and also just working through these lower yield levels on the securities portfolio. But if you -- so there'll be some positives from excess liquidity dissipating, particularly in the first half offset by these other couple of factors I mentioned, but we see the margins table from fourth quarter levels into the next year."
