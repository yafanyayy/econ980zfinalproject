And we're pleased to report [indiscernible] in the advancement of",855,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. In many ways, 2009 was a transformational year for Celgene. We took major steps towards building a preeminent global biopharmaceutical company.  And we're pleased to report [indiscernible] in the advancement of our therapies for cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases, they are also reflected in our commercial, operational and financial results. We made extraordinary progress across all factors of our business, including continuing to grow as a global company with our therapies available in nearly 70 countries.  Our products are the global market leaders in their indications. REVLIMID is the global leader in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and its share in the marketplace continues to grow. Over the past six months, a continuous flow of positive clinical data has been released, demonstrating the breadth of REVLIMID's activities. These studies have shown there is potential for the development of REVLIMID to become the foundation of myeloma therapy from smoldering to salvage, as well as the new indications, creating the opportunity for changing treatment paradigms.  We are also expanding VIDAZA, the global market leader in MDS [Myelodysplastic Syndrome] through market share gains and geographic expansion in Europe and the rest of the world.Importantly, we're making substantial progress in the development of our deep and diversified pipeline by advancing more than 30 clinical programs to address high unmet medical needs in more than 25 serious and debilitating diseases. Some recent highlights include the reporting of positive clinical data in myelofibrosis and myeloma at major medical meetings and in peer reviewed journals for our new hematologic agent, pomalidomide. We plan to enter pivotal clinical trials with pomalidomide this year for both multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis. As we expand our hematology/oncology franchise, we recently added a new and strategic product, ISTODAX through the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals. Last quarter, ISTODAX received FDA approval for the second-line treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and will be our first entry into the important lymphoma market. We look to expand ISTODAX in peripheral T-cell lymphoma and potentially in a number of other diseases, while leveraging our current infrastructure. Our lead product candidate in our immune-inflammatory franchise, apremilast has made significant clinical progress. Apremilast reached the primary endpoint in two Phase II trials, one in psoriasis and one in psoriatic arthritis. We look forward to starting Phase III registration trials in these indications this year. This is an exciting new area of multibillion-dollar potential for Celgene, and we are proud to have developed apremilast in our own laboratories.This quarter, we plan to announce results from a trial of PDA-001, our cellular therapy in patients with Crohn's disease, and potentially extend this new therapy to other serious diseases with unmet medical needs. This will mark the first time this new therapy has been studied in humans. This new area of medicine places Celgene at the forefront of drug development in this area for many years to come.So why am I excited about Celgene's future? We have consistently performed in all aspects of our business, ranging from science to clinical, to manufacturing, to commercial, to financial, demonstrating we have the entrepreneurial culture and capability to continue to grow and sustain a leadership position in our industry. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in our pipeline. We're exploring next-generation programs that include small molecules, biologics, cellular therapies and vaccines. We have 20 Phase III and pivotal clinical trials underway, fueled by our prolific research and translational efforts towards the objective of ensuring the virtuous cycle of innovation continues to provide results for patients and Celgene's stakeholders around the world.Our robust pipeline strategically positions us to consistently produce unique therapies to seriously-ill patients. We will continue to grow our leading hematology franchise, which has one of the broadest portfolios of disease-altering therapies for blood cancers. Both internally, where we have an excellent track record and via business development, where we continue to demonstrate strategic partnerships and acquisitions. We will continue to expand in ways that will transform treatment paradigms, such as with our IMiD compounds, epigenetic therapeutics, HDAC inhibitors, cytokine inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, activin inhibitor, cellular therapies and more. We are opening the door to a new franchise, our Inflammatory business, where our current product candidates have the potential to treat millions of people, in addition to our hematology franchise, where we can impact the lives of over 2 million patients worldwide. We have the financial resources, the operational excellence, the scientific and clinical capabilities, the geographic breadth and most importantly, the excellent people with commitment to make a positive impact on the industry and lead to changing treatment paradigms. We will continue to grow our current products, while we acquire and develop new ones. We have delivered leading financial results year after year, and 2009 was no different. Our innovative and entrepreneurial culture is helping us growth into one of the premier global biopharmaceutical companies in the world. We are energized by this momentum and look forward to 2010 and beyond. Here to tell you more about our record financial results from 2009 and give you guidance on our 2010 outlook, is our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Gryska."

Despite challenges in the global economic environment, total non-GAAP revenue increased approximately 20% year-over-year to a record $2.7 billi",924,"Thanks, Sol. 2009 was an exceptional year in which Celgene again, delivered again record operating performance. Despite challenges in the global economic environment, total non-GAAP revenue increased approximately 20% year-over-year to a record $2.7 billion. This increase was driven primarily by exceptional growth from our REVLIMID franchise, the continued growth of the VIDAZA in the U.S. and a strong launch of VIDAZA in Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, total non-GAAP revenue increased approximately 22% year-over-year to $758 million. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $290 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62. Non-GAAP net income for 2009 was a record $971 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share have increased to $2.8.Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $722 million for the fourth quarter, up 22% from $591 million in the year-ago quarter. This is an increase of 9% over the third quarter of 2009.Fourth quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $497 million, an increase of 35% over the fourth quarter of 2008, and 11% increase over the third quarter of 2009.Full year 2009 REVLIMID net product sales were $1.7 billion, an increase of 29% from 2008 sales of $1.3 billion. Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $117 million, an increase of 68% in the year-ago quarter, and a 13% over the third quarter of 2009. THALOMID net sales were $108 million for the quarter, down 15% as compared to a year-ago quarter, and down 2% over the third quarter.For the fourth quarter of 2009, sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $291 million, and international sales were $206 million, representing an increase of 7% and 17%, respectively on a sequential quarterly basis. For the full year of 2009, REVLIMID international sales represented 39% of total REVLIMID sales. We expect international sales of REVLIMID to be approximately 45% of total REVLIMID sales for 2010.Our non-GAAP gross profit margin for 2009 was approximately 92%. For 2010, we expect an improvement in gross margin of approximately 100 basis points. Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the fourth quarter was $182 million, slightly higher than R&D expense of $178 million for the third quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $696 million for 2009. We will continue to strategically invest in our R&D in 2010, as we seek to advance our very deep and promising product pipeline. During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key development programs are guiding REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We will also conduct late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, amrubicin, ISTODAX and we will continue to advance other promising compounds with clinic, including ACE-001, PDA-001 and our kinase inhibitor programs. All of these development efforts are expected to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. As a result of continued commitments to R&D, we expect 2010 R&D expense to increase approximately 20% versus 2009.Taking a look at SG&A. Non-GAAP selling, general administrative expenses did increase to $193 million during the fourth quarter, as compared to $172 million during the third quarter of 2009. For 2009, non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $679 million. We expect SG&A expenses in 2010 to increase approximately 5% versus 2009, as we continue our global expansion of REVLIMID and VIDAZA in new markets and in particular, REVLIMID in Japan.Turning to taxes. Our non-GAAP tax rate for 2009 was approximately 21%. We anticipate to reduce the non-GAAP tax rate by approximately 100 basis points for 2010.  As you are aware, we hedged our balance sheet foreign currency exposures and our company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain euro-based revenue and expense. The impact of foreign currency on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we realized approximately $7 million in hedging and re-evaluation gains, which was included in other income.In summary, this was an exceptional year with record revenue and earnings. We ended 2009 with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion. In addition, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 4.3 million shares. For 2010, we expect our operations to generate approximately $1.2 billion in cash, and expect to spend approximately $115 million in capital expenditures. Turning to our financial outlook for 2010. We expect total revenue to increase by approximately 20% versus 2009 to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. We expect REVLIMID net product sales will increase approximately 25% year-over-year to a range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. We also anticipate that non-GAAP diluted earnings per share will increase approximately 25% to a range of $2.55 to $2.60 for 2010.In conclusion, our company has never been in a stronger position to execute on the global expansion plan for our Hematology, Oncoloy and Inflammation Franchises. As you can see, we have further improved our operating efficiency and leverage during 2009. Our clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and financial execution as well as our investment information technology have delivered one of the best operating margins, gross margins and tax rates in our peer group. We are truly well positioned to achieve our goals in 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, to expand on the global, commercial, clinical and regulatory achievements in the year and discuss the key objectives that will lead to continued success in 2010 and beyond."

We achieved or exceeded major corporate objectives across all areas of the company. Dave highlighted the exceptional fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. I'll review our most significant accomplishments in 2009 and outline the key drivers and objectives for continued excellent performance in 2010.At the beginning of 2009, we identified the strategic initiatives and activities required to deliver outstanding performance. We executed against these imperatives in 2009. Our results this past year are a clear reflection of operational excellence across the globe and across functions.Continued market penetration, market share gains and increased duration of our products drove year-on-year revenue growth. Our international expansion significantly contributed to our operating results with new markets filling [ph] revenue growth during the second half of 2009. We are beginning to realize the operating leverage from our investments to build a global franchise, with international markets contributing an increasing percentage of our revenue. In 2009, we advanced multiple late stage clinical programs with 20 pivotal trials now either underway or planned to start in 2010. Our medium-term pipeline is also more robust now than it was 12 months ago, with several key programs advancing to Phase II this year. Our teams advanced 12 compounds in development and numerous preclinical programs and we expanded important collaborations with our external partners.2009 was an exceptional year for Celgene into advancing these key strategic initiatives. In the following slides, I will share my perspective for these results in greater detail, and describe the key drivers for 2010.  The results of the fourth quarter were outstanding. Total revenue increased by more than 20% year-over-year, driven by strong REVLIMID and VIDAZA sales. The quarter was also highlighted by a significant new data on REVLIMID, apremilast, VIDAZA, THALOMID and pomalidomide. And in December, we announced the strategic acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.Our commercial teams performed well in all geographic territories. Global market penetration, increasing the treatment duration and international expansion all contributed to the outstanding fourth quarter and full-year REVLIMID performance. Total U.S. REVLIMID market share in the multiple myeloma market grew to approximately 37%. And in major European market, second-line share increased by more than 35% during the year. In the United States, duration grew to roughly 11.8 months, and in Europe, to approximately 7.5 months. Later in the fourth quarter, the commercial launch in Australia continued our track record of successfully securing REVLIMID pricing and reimbursement agreements across the globe.  Japan is our next major opportunity. With a regulatory decision expected mid-year and reimbursement and commercial launch targeted for late this year.Fourth quarter REVLIMID results provide a strong foundation for 2010. Share gains in early lines of therapy across major markets, full-year sales in the U.K., Canada, Australia and Latin America and increasing treatment duration remained the key growth drivers. The recent positive announcements by the U.S. cooperative group, CALGB and the French cooperative group IFM, regarding Phase III myeloma studies provide additional support for continuous REVLIMID therapy. We expect this important new data to be presented at major medical meetings later this year.Our position in the global MDS market has never been stronger. In 2009, our focus was on continued growth in the United States, while executing our best-in-class commercial launch in Europe. VIDAZA global sales increased 68% year-over-year, and 13% quarter-over-quarter. In the U.S., VIDAZA is the overwhelming market leader in higher-risk MDS, and in Europe, we are rapidly establishing a treatment standard for the disease. Following regulatory approvals in 2009, we're seeking VIDAZA reimbursement in Canada, Australia and Latin America. The presentation of the data from MDS-004, our controlled study of REVLIMID and Del 5Q MDS, at the American Society of Hematology meeting confirmed the significant clinical benefit of REVLIMID for the treatment of transfusion-dependent, low-risk Del 5Q MDS. We're actively developing regulatory strategies for key global markets with the combined MDS-003 and MDS-004 studies.Continuing the rapid adoption of VIDAZA in Europe for the treatment of all classifications of MDS and a subset of patients with AML is the most important growth driver in 2010. Our teams are focused on following the successful European launch in other markets. As the recognized standard of care, VIDAZA continues to be the subject of an intense clinical investigation. We expect and look forward to additional results of single-agent and combination studies, including those with REVLIMID at major medical meetings later this year.Data presented at the annual American Society of Hematology Meeting has historically been a major catalyst for our products. At the 2009 ASH Meeting, a record 218 abstracts and over 50 oral presentations were delivered on Celgene products. Leading investigators and cooperative groups presented significant new REVLIMID data across all stages of myeloma. As Sol mentioned, from smoldering to relapsed refractory. The interim data from the Phase III MM-015 trial highlighted the benefits of continuous REVLIMID therapy by significantly prolonging progression free survival compared with a fixed course of therapy.  In patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma, early results show that REVLIMID significantly delay the time to active disease. REVLIMID is the first treatment to show a benefit in this patient population. We expect additional updates of these studies in 2010.Building on a preclinical hypothesis of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or ADCC, encouraging Phase II data of REVLIMID with Rituxan was presented at ASH. This combination produced high-response rates in first line and relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma, including a 94% complete response rate in untreated follicular lymphoma. Promising data from this combination was also reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In heavily pretreated CLR patients, the overall response rate was 64% with generally manageable side effects.We're optimistic that the data from ASH 2009 will again be a catalyst for our clinical, commercial and regulatory programs. Immediately following ASH, the two cooperative groups that I mentioned earlier, CALGB and IFM, reported initial data from randomized Phase III studies evaluating REVLIMID, compared to placebo in multiple myeloma patients, following stem cell transplant. The independent data and safety monitoring boards reported that the trial had met their primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in progression free survival. Together with the MM-015 results, the IFM and CALGB trials add to a growing body of clinical evidence that continuous REVLIMID therapy significantly prolongs PFS in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. We'll continue to work with these groups as they fully evaluate and present these trial results this year.While there is great progress in the treatment of early-stage myeloma, there is a growing pool of myeloma patients who have failed all existing therapies. Pomalidomide data at ASH positions this next-generation IMiD compound as potentially the most important therapy in development for these patients. In heavily pretreated patients, including those previously treated with REVLIMID, THALOMID and bortezomib, pomalidomide demonstrated a 50% overall response rate of, which is the highest reported rate of all drugs in development for this indication. These responses were durable, and side effects were generally manageable. We're actively working with investigators and regulatory authorities to advance our pivotal trials.Additional ASH data highlighted pomalidomide's activity in myelofibrosis. Today, patients with this debilitating diseases rely on blood transfusions to treat chronic refractory anemia. Pomalidomide generated 25% to 40% response rates with more than 60% of responders achieving durable transfusion independence. Again, side effects were generally manageable. We are rapidly moving pomalidomide into pivotal mode.In December, we announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals. This strategic transaction provides Celgene with an entry into the U.S. lymphoma market. We will launch ISODAX in the second quarter in the United States for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The pivotal U.S. trial for peripheral T-cell lymphoma is now fully accrued, and we're evaluating global regulatory strategies for ISODAX in CTCL and PTCL.Data presented at major medical meetings and published in peer reviewed journals throughout 2009 substantially strengthened the clinical and commercial profile of REVLIMID in myeloma, MDS, lymphoma and CLL. With intellectual property protection through 2026, it is a key corporate objective to fully capitalize on REVLIMID's unique clinical profile. This slide reflects our continued investment in multiple Phase III program in numerous hematological and oncology indications.As we passed the four-year mark since the first FDA approval of REVLIMID, we would expect, as a normal course of their business and abbreviated new drug application filing by a generic manufacturer. We are well prepared to successfully defend our significant intellectual property.Beyond REVLIMID, the hematology and oncology pipeline continue to strengthen and deepen in 2009. In the fourth quarter, we completed the enrollment of the Phase III study of amrubicin in second line small cell lung cancer. This trial compares amrubicin to topotecan, the reference drug in this setting. We expect data to be available sometime late this year.Preliminary data reported at ASH on ACE-011 are now all [ph] activin inhibitor in developing with our partner Acceleron, showed increases in hemoglobin, and improvement in bone lesions in multiple myeloma patients. A Phase II study in chemotherapy-induced anemia and metastatic breast cancer patients is ongoing and other areas of clinical investigations are active.Our inflammation and immunology franchise gained significant traction in 2009. The franchise is a natural extension of our preclinical, clinical and overall research platform and fits well with our specialty focused Hematology/Oncology business. Serious inflammatory and immunologic diseases are also predominantly specialist-treated. Celgene is indeed fortunate to have several promising programs in the inflammation and immunology field. Let me briefly update you on our lead compounds, including the oral kinase inhibitor 930, PDA-001, our cellular therapy and the non-oncology applications of ACE-011. In 2009, we concluded proof of concept trials for CC-930, which demonstrated significant suppression of the kinase JNK in helping volunteers. Based on these results, we plan to initiate a Phase II study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis later this year.We're optimistic on the therapeutic potential of cellular therapy across multiple indications. Our team made excellent progress in 2009 advancing our proprietary program into the clinic. The treatment phase of the PDA-001 Crohn's disease trial concluded in September, and the six-month follow-up will be completed earlier this year. Our goal for 2010 is to initiate a Phase II study in Crohn's disease and trials with at least two other diseases.In addition to the cancer indications previously discussed, we're moving ACE-011 forward to non-oncology indications. Based upon our preclinical and clinical work, we plan to study ACE-011 as a potential treatment for chronic kidney disease. With multiple compounds and programs in inflammation and immunology, we see 2010 as an important year to execute on our late stage trials, advance our Phase I and II pipelines and deepen our research initiatives in this area.Let me spend a minute sharing my perspective on apremilast. With the completion of two important placebo-controlled Phase II trials in 2009, apremilast's potential has become clear. The data from these trials leads us to aggressively pursue Phase III trials in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Apremilast has shown a unique combination of activity and safety, and has the potential to be a meaningful therapy for these conditions. We've studied apremilast in approximately a thousand patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This slide summarizes the results from the Phase II trials. In the psoriatic arthritis 001 study, 44% of patients with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis achieved an ACR20, the key clinical measure of effectiveness. In the second study, psoriasis 005, showed that 41% of patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis achieved approximately positive [ph] 75 score in the range of biologic efficacy.This level of activity, together with the encouraging safety profile, is compelling. If a comparable level of activity in safety is demonstrated in the Phase III trial, there will be a major opportunity to excess [ph] at a minimum the 85% of the market held by existing oral therapies.  We'll continue to update you throughout the year as we advance our pivotal programs with apremilast.The future of any biopharmaceutical company is only as good as its pipeline, the source of future growth. At Celgene, we significantly advanced our hematology, oncology, inflammation and immunology pipelines in 2009. Our investment in R&D has led to the broad pipeline of 12 compounds in clinical development that you see here.  We'll have 20 pivotal clinical trials ongoing in 2010, and we're also advancing 16 preclinical programs in 25 serious and debilitating diseases. We look forward to reviewing the progress and potential of our pipeline with you at our R&D day on March 4 in New York City.In summary, 2009 was a great year for Celgene. Our products made an increasingly meaningful difference in the lives of tens of thousands of patients around the world. And because of this, we produced strong operating results. Our pipeline is more advanced, broader and deeper. And our global organization expanded and strengthened.Our talented and dedicated teams succeeded at converting 2009 objectives into exceptional accomplishments. The momentum that was built throughout the last year positioned us well to capitalize on the many opportunities outlined on this slide. In 2010, we're focused on key drivers of value creation, maximizing REVLIMID's global potential, extending our leadership in MDS and accelerating the clinical development of our early and late stage pipeline.  2010 will be the exciting year with clinical regulatory and commercial milestones that has the potential to significantly enhance our short- and long-term results. We very much look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you. Operator, we can now open the call to questions."

Some with the upside and somewhat with concerns on the downside. Japan is in the forecast in a very modest way. Because with the filing of the myeloma applications, the middle of last year, we're hopeful that the middle of this year, we'll have approval and then have a number of months to deal with getting the pricing and reimbursement done with the government, et cetera. So we have, I say, generally modest revenue late in the year in japan. In terms of impact on healthcare reform, we have different scenarios that go into the scenarios. Some of which do have some negative impact on healthcare reform and some that don't. I wouldn't say that we do anticipate dual eligibles to become treated as Medicaid versus Medicare and Part D this year or really in the foreseeable future. But there are things that maybe addressed in healthcare reform that could have a negative impact on us and for those of you and us that follow closely. It's pretty unclear how that's all going to play out and whether there will be some of those negative impacts coming this year or in the future or ever. One of the key things for us when we think about healthcare reform, clearly is the donor hold. And that one of the positive things about the progress of healthcare reform, which is, unfortunately, slow from this one perspective, is that there is recognition, I think, on all sides of the political landscape. But more importantly, in the medical community and in the healthcare community, generally that excessive kinds of deductibles and co-pays are not good for patients. And so one of the side benefits was really there is no recognition that we need to close that door, has a positive. So I think our guidance takes into effect a number of positives that we've talked about. But also takes into effect some of the concerns that outside the United States, the economy and the economy is generally not very strong in the United States or outside in the developing world. And has continued pressure economic pressure. So though we were successful in 2009 to navigate the pricing and reimbursement issues, and we're not aware of specific challenges that are going to happen in 2010 on the pricing and reimbursement front, but we're always cautious that with these kind of economic conditions, we could see unexpected things happen too on that pricing and reimbursement front. So bottom line is, we think the kind of growth projecting for the 30% with REVLIMID year-over-year and strong VIDAZA growth on a year-by-year basis, we think it's very robust. And there are scenarios where we could potentially do better. And there's scenarios that could impact us and we'll have more challenging outlook. But overall, we're trying to put those together and come up with what we think is a fair base case."

Certainly, the real angst and the real concern in the main street economy, globally, in the first quarter of last year, was more severe than the economic situation that we have today. But it is not a robust economy in any shape or form, in terms of unemployment and the nervousness in the economy. I think we are as well positioned as we can be. We've learned some lessons as to how to manage that in different markets, including United States. I think we're generally well positioned. I think we don't have quite the same level of anxiety. And it is early in the quarter to be able to have a firm outlook. And we're not here to give quarterly guidance. I would say clearly, it is our goal to target a growth in REVLIMID and in total revenue for the first quarter over the fourth quarter. So I think the first quarter is still a challenging quarter as new budgets come into play. There are new plan years for patients, they're starting new co-pays, et cetera. So it is a challenging quarter, especially when economic conditions are not strong. I think it is fair to say, it is not as challenging as the dire circumstances of last year. But I don't want to paint an overly rosy picture either. So I think that's why we're trying to give a very balanced view. And the first quarter is always challenging. But what we think we should -- our target is to do as well as possible. On the second thought, on the marketshare, the marketshare situation continues to be a very positive one. And in the frontline in the United States from independent third-party data that we and other people can get. it appears that physicians continue to prescribe REVLIMID as a leader in the first-line myeloma. I think the most recent data that I saw put it around 37% of the marketshare in first-line myeloma. And overall increasing in second line also. So positive trends there. Outside the United States, the real focus and, for us, as it is in the United States is to build second line share with the labeled indications are and ultimately getting approvals with MM-015 to broaden the labor force. So we actually take an active role in the promotional frontline.  The trends are positive also. I mean, we have basically seven percentage point increase in the main part of Europe over the course of last year and second line. And good increases in third line. So I think overall the tone continues to be positive, the trend is positive there. And frankly, our ambitions are going to be higher than they would've been a year or two from as to where we think ultimately will REVLIMID will top out in market shares in myeloma around the world."

And we've not seen a big change in those scripts over time. It's approximately 85% for myeloma, about 10% for MDS, and then lymphoma is the next and then leukemia is after that. But around 95% for myeloma and MDS. We do not get any further granularity as to which line of therapy and if it's maintenance. We're trying to call that out. So we understand what the upside potential is if we were able to get reimbursement and access. And then after the usage of REVLIMID as continuous therapy following stem-cell transplant, which I think is generally the one segment in the United States and other markets around the world where we have not had a significant market share because the paradigm there is, do stem-cell transplant, watch the patient until you see a relapse and then treat aggressively with REVLIMID or potentially, other therapies. And so I think there is a good upside there. So in terms of percentage of our revenue from one part of, I think, we don't have that data, we do make an internal estimate, but that's all they are, internal estimates. And related to THALOMID, I think people have different views on it. I happen to be in the view that it continues to be an important therapy in myeloma. And that I think over time, we'll see the patients who progressed through different stages of myeloma. We'll look at THALOMID more in the third, fourth, fifth line type of therapy. So I think it's going to continue to have a place in there. I would say what we're really excited about is hopefully, accelerating the development of pomalidomide, the rest of the patients that really ultimately eventually, we hope it's a long time before they go through REVLIMID follow portesimid, but use pomalidomide. That could be based on the data we've seen, one of the most beneficial aspects of myeloma patients in the next few years."

This is a very important issue when it comes to the growth of REVLIMID. And clearly, the data that we have been developing through many, many different clinical trials is really designed to produce the evidence that really demonstrates to the physicians, to patients, to payers, the value of continuous therapy. So I think there's a couple of issues here. One, I think the trends so far over the last couple of years have certainly benefited from an earlier treatment of disease. Healthier patients have clearly the capability of staying on drugs longer. And REVLIMID in myeloma is no exception to that general rule. And so we have benefited from that. Where duration will go, what the opportunity is in sort of the continuous post-transplant therapy is unclear. And we have different assessments internally here whether we look at different markets and different individuals or functions that come with different conclusions. But we don't have one specific outlook that we believe, from a guidance point view, we would be comfortable discussing publicly because it isn't certain enough from us. And we don't have the data to support some of the projections and conjecture that we have as to what the trends will be the next couple of years. But clearly, we continue to recognize the value of it. And I think you'll see more and more data on this front, we're very hopeful at ASCO, EHA and ASH this year. There will be a steady flow of more mature and new data that will really make it so clear about how to use REVLIMID and in for period of time and what stages. So I apologize that we can't give you the specific guidance, because we're still trying to accumulate the data. And the data is going to continue to evolve. And we think in a very positive way."

And we executed the trial the way they asked to with PFF as the endpoint. We are in the process now as you know, with essentially adjudication of all the responses and of the data. We have past, as we mentioned earlier in late last year, that we went past the 70% of events. We hope in the next few months, second quarter, to fully get the adjudication of those 70%. Put the package together and the second half of the year, get back to the EMEA for review. And following that, we do want to use MM-015 and hopefully, ECOG and SWOG data as the comprehensive package for approval outside of Europe, all around the world including the United States. And ultimately, when we do get the CALGB and IFM post-transplant continuous therapy data with REVLIMID, which obviously, all the signals are extremely, extremely positive data, we would make those decisions about regulatory implications of that data and had to expand the label with that data. But they're not linked and we're going to go forward with existing strategy. We've had no reason that we're aware of that we would change the strategy than -- it's just now an execution of getting it done as quickly and accurately, effectively as we can to get MM-015 to the 70% of events, adjudicated, put together.

We're discussing the trials as we speak the design endpoints with the FDA and with the European regulatory authorities. We're also, by the way, going to proceed with the Phase II trial in rheumatoid arthritis. Right now, our anticipation is that we have approximately four trials that would encompass both psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, get the appropriate patient population, get the appropriate endpoint and make sure that theres regulatory buy-in. The other thing that's important to recognize and it's a bit of a subtlety, is that our latest results in psoriasis were at the 30-milligram dosing, which was obviously very exciting and starts overlapping with the biologic range of activity. The previous result in psoriatic arthritis was with the 20 milligrams. So there's a significant potential at least to get even better results in that Phase II trial, now that we've demonstrated at least in the Phase II placebo controlled trial that the 30 milligrams can be a potentially better dose, more active while maintaining a very nice safety profile that it appears to have in Phase II trial. So we'll be looking at 30 milligrams in the pivotal trials. And that could give some upside as well. So in answer to the question, we anticipate four trials, four Phase III trials, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. We're in discussion with regulatory authorities.

If through scientific and medical exchange, we identify patients or physicians that may have these concerns, we look to bring them in contact with peers and educate them on some of the data, if they're interested. But we really think that for the most part in the U.S., the paradigm of immuno-modulatory therapy of treating to produce more durable responses has something that has gotten pretty good traction, I think there's still an opportunity that there are segments out there that have a more chemotherapy-type thing, hit the patient is hard as possible, give them a break, try knock the disease down without killing them. And then wait for the disease to come back and hit it again. So I think, there are probably pockets of that. I do think the IFM and CALGB data is very, very important. Obviously, because it is a segment of the population that is generally not treated globally. And so we think we have a label that already deals with continuous therapy after one part of therapy. But getting them the label I think, has big advantage for us. Obviously no one really has the data yet, it was just a fact that the data monitoring board saw the tremendous impact in both of these trials should be unblinded early because clearly, the placebo patient was at a significant disadvantage from a hazard ratio and risk respective and those people treated with REVLIMID following the transplant. So we're very hopeful and if there's anything we can do, whether it's financially or anything. We're going to support those cooperative groups to ensure they get the data as soon as possible. And present it at major medical meetings so that we then can get access to the data. And obviously, with cooperative groups, you got to be cautious and really review the quality of the data to ensure it's going to meet the kind of regulatory scrutiny that will be required. But it certainly is our intention to get what we believe to be incredibly important and promising data into our label globally. In one way or another."

Do you have a sense of what percent of post-transplant patients get THAL, and do you expect NCCN to pick up REVLIMID maintenance post-transplant? Second question is just on the 015, do you expect the RMP and MP induction arms to separate? When should we see that? And if they don't, can you still file? And final question, you mentioned the ANDA filing around REVLIMID that you expect, why shouldn't we worry about that? There are companies that traded much lower multiples where people worry about the ANDA. So maybe give us a strong case for your patents and why you think they're so strong?"

And if you think about the profile, the drug that has neuropathy, it's a very difficult situation to use that in a newly diagnosed post-transplant setting where t",601,"First, I don't think THAL on a post-transplant setting has gotten any real traction in that. And if you think about the profile, the drug that has neuropathy, it's a very difficult situation to use that in a newly diagnosed post-transplant setting where the patient has had a remission and has a high-quality life and concern for the ability to use those therapies later on if you induce neuropathy and sedation and kind of side effects that can come from drugs that have that kind of situation. I do think once the data is presented at a major medical meeting, whether it be guidelines, pathways, compendia listings, the investor conference, the cancer network, et cetera, those type of situations, we'll very expeditiously move to have REVLIMID as an important therapy in those guidelines. And obviously, that's up to them to do that. But we do this to help support, get the information in the public domain as quickly as possible, because I think I certainly believe anybody who is patient focus, just want to ensure those guidelines is going to be incurred. And as far as MM-015 goes, from a regulatory point of view, the prespecified regulatory objectives and endpoints or A versus C, or the MPR are versus MP, a fixed duration. So we're not aware of any reason why there should be any concern from a regulatory point of view. We do, as we look at that data and it gets more mature, we do think there'll be good analysis that will come out to give people perspective of A versus B, and B versus C, and C versus A on a continuing basis. And I think there will be more clarity over time. And I think it will be easier to understand the issues. But again, in a trial, try to answer multiple endpoints just sometimes got some information that will be complex to understand. But we don't see a regulatory issue. We do think, hopefully, in the relatively near term, major medical meetings, we'll see more mature, better analyzed data that MM-015 which will continue to support important paradigm of continuous REVLIMID treatment. And on the, and the question with REVLIMID, we are in extensive long-term on the THAL front and that continues to move quite slowly. So we're very pleased with the way the THAL medication has gone over these past three to four years. On REV, it's a very different situation, though. We have composition, a matter of patent. We've got a dozen patents in the Orange Book, wide range. And also, this is a strategy that we have been preparing for a long time. By the way, we're not aware of any generic filing or let's be clear about that. If that were to occur, we would make the public notification of that. You never can be 100% guarantee anything, but I can tell you that we think we have the best internal and external support. We have multiple firms. We're prepared, we've got all of the preparation that can be done if this were to happen. And we will vigorously defend our property and we feel very confident about what will happen in the end. Thanks very much for everyone's participation on the call. As we did mention, we will have an R&D Day on March 4 in New York City which will be webcast for those of you that don't attend.

We had two news releases today, one reporting another record quarter with excellent financial and operational results, and the other detailing our succession planning. Let me briefly comment on the latter, and then we'll transition to the results of the quarter.
I have been with Celgene for most of my career, where I've had the privilege of working with a superb management team and with exceptional people. Together, we built a remarkable global company with extraordinary financial, research and development, commercial and operational results and prospects. Indeed, we are the fastest growing biopharmaceutical company and one of the fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500.
I'm most proud that we develop products that profoundly affect the lives of seriously ill patients around the world. After decades at Celgene, I've decided that it is time for me to start pacing out of my responsibilities towards retirement. I am transitioning from my position as Chief Executive Officer at the upcoming annual meeting in June, when I will assume the position of Executive Chair, focusing on the overall management transition, board oversight and strategic initiatives.  On January 1, 2011, I will become Nonexecutive Chair and a consultant to the Corporation. It is a bittersweet event for me. On the one hand, I am transitioning from the company I love and the people I had great admiration for. On the other hand, I now can spend more time with my family, including my wife, my four children, and my 12 grandchildren, as well as devoting more time to charitable pursuits.
I am especially pleased to pass the leadership of Celgene on to Bob Hugin, with whom I have worked closely over the last 11 years. Bob brings strong leadership acumen, along with his strategic, financial and commercial capabilities. He has been instrumental during his tenure in building Celgene's success and transformation on a global scale and he will provide the continuity to our business plan to enable Celgene to continue our mission to become the premier global biopharmaceutical company.  Under Bob's leadership as CEO, I believe Celgene has the unique opportunity to continue to accelerate our continued delivery of strong financial and commercial results, and importantly to maintain an unwavering commitment to research and development, and the delivery of therapies for unmet medical needs to improve the lives of patients worldwide."

I'll now turn briefly to our results for the quarter, where we continue to deliver on our promise and potential as the global pre-eminent biopharmaceutical company. Our financial metrics were once again at record levels, with total revenues growing 31% year-over-year to $789 million, and revenue growing 46% year-over-year to factor the $30 million. 
We continue to aggressively invest in research and development while achieving the record non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, a 43% increase year-over-year. We also see a continued strengthening growth in our business as you will hear from Bob, notwithstanding the challenges related to the economic issues in Europe and rest of the world, as well as the potential financial impact to our business from recently passed healthcare reform legislation here in the U.S.  Dave and Bob will provide significant color to our results in a moment. 
I'd like to provide a strategic perspective on the quarter.  We are fully committed on a fundamental level to innovative science and transformational medicine that delivers better health care for better outcomes. This is reflected through our new state-of-the-art research facility in San Francisco, and the recent establishment of a world-class translational effort with our CITRE [Celgene Institute of Translational Research Europe] center in Spain. These centers will serve to drive and enhance our early-stage research capabilities, capabilities that are already producing multiple product opportunities across our key therapeutic areas: Hematology, oncology and inflammation immunology.
As you recently heard at our R&D day on April 8, Celgene is very fortunate to be strategically positioned from multiple perspectives: To continue its industry-leading growth potential for years to come based on a sustained pipeline of paradigm-changing innovation.  We've expanded our pipeline to encompass approximately 30 programs addressing high unmet medical needs in approximately 25 serious and debilitating diseases. This progress was highlighted at our recent R&D day, which focused on a sustainable innovation paradigm, demonstrating the breadth and scope of both the pipeline and our global leadership team responsible for advancing our discovery, clinical regulatory and commercial strategies that we believe will serve as the basis for the delivery of excellent clinical and commercial performance for years to come. 
We have multiple products with significant revenue potential that may enter the market over the next five years, including apremilast for psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and pomalidomide in multiple myeloma and myelophytosis. We are also conducting multiple pivotal trials evaluating REVLIMID in NHL and CLL. 
To accelerate our entry into the lymphoma market, we acquired Gloucester Pharmaceuticals. And it's important therapy, ISTODAX. ISTODAX is approved for continuous (sic) [cutaneous] T-cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we're working to gain approval for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and also to make it available on a global basis.
Our next major geographic expansion will be the second-largest oncology market, Japan, where we anticipate to have regulatory action for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma in the middle of the year and potentially launched by the end of the year.  Our commitment to innovative science and the drive to be bold in bringing even new treatments to patients is a mindset that drew us to Agios Pharmaceuticals. Just two weeks ago, we announced our collaboration with Agios related to their innovative cancer metabolism research platform. This collaboration is another example of Celgene's commitment to continually be at the forefront of new trends in medicine to sustain a pipeline of innovation for the future.
We also look forward to the important data on Celgene products that will be presented at numerous international meetings this year, including ASCO, EHA and ASH. The most important aspect of all of this is the fundamental understanding that the patient is the ultimate beneficiary of what we do. Our success as an organization and as a company will always be in direct proportion to the effort we make on behalf of our patients. We are today an industry leader in investing in research and development, which has positioned Celgene as the new paradigm for innovative, sustainable and profitable biopharmaceutical companies.
I've been fortunate to be part of establishing a unique company based on science and innovation at all levels and in all aspects, where people and ideals are valued, where extraordinary achievements are expected and delivered, and a sense of understanding the direct impact that each of us has on patients the world over is clear. The paradigm is doing well by doing good.

Non-GAAP total revenue for the first quarter was $789 million, a 31% increase versus the first quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $295 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63.
Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $757 million for the first quarter, up 32% from $572 million in the year-ago quarter.
First quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $530 million, an increase of 46% over the first quarter of 2009.  Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $120 million, an increase of 60% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $104 million for the quarter, down 9% as compared to the year-ago quarter.
For the first quarter, sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $305 million, and international sales were $225 million, representing an increase of 5% and 10% respectively on a sequential quarter basis. And when compared to the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 32% and 71% respectively.
As many of you are aware, Congress recently passed healthcare reform legislation. Key components of this legislation include an increase in Medicaid rebates and the extension of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations. Consequently, first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million due to this legislation.  We expect these two components of healthcare legislation will negatively impact full-year revenues by approximately $35 million to $40 million. Beginning in 2011, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies will be required to provide a 50% discount to Medicare Part D patients as they fund the doughnut hole. Collectively, the increase in the Medicaid rebate, the extension of this rebate to managed care organizations and the 50% discount for Medicaid Part D patients in the doughnut hole are expected to negatively impact 2011 revenues by approximately $80 million to $90 million.
It is important to note that a lack of clarity exists around several components of the healthcare legislation. Our estimates are based on assumptions that may change as legislation details are further communicated. Consequently, the effect on earnings-per-share beyond 2010 is difficult to quantify at this time. Not only do the uncertainty regarding how legislation will ultimately be implemented, but also due to the potential offsets to some of these elements, such as decreased co-pay business funding to nonprofit entities and the added benefit of patients getting healthcare coverage.
Now getting back to our first quarter results, our non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.6%. For the current year, we expect gross margins to improve to approximately 93%, primarily due to a change in product mix.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the first quarter was $186 million, an increase of 2% over the fourth quarter of 2009. As we discussed at our recent April R&D presentations, we will continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth, and we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $860 million to $885 million for the full year. 
During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III trials. Our key development programs are evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX, and are completing international approvals of REVLIMID in major markets such as Japan. In addition, we are continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in preclinical and early stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-selling, general and administrative expenses was $188 million during the first quarter, down nearly 3% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to activities relating to ASH, and to a limited extent, international launch activities in the fourth quarter.  We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $745 million to $765 million for the full year as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. 
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22%. We continue to expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve approximately 100 basis points from 2009 levels to approximately 20%. As for our share count, we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $469 million for the year.
As you are aware, we had hedge our balance sheet foreign currency exposures, and our company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses in foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial.  We are well-positioned with our hedging program to minimize the impact of various foreign currencies on our earnings for the year. In addition, other income includes approximately $4 million and hedging re-evaluation gains realized during the first quarter.
In summary, this was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, up from a previous range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, up from the previous range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.  And Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 as compared to a range of $2.55 to $2.60 that was previously reported.  We had a strong first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion.  It is important to note this updated 2010 guidance includes the anticipated impact to our business relating to U.S. healthcare legislation. 
In summary, we continue to execute from the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating efficiency and leverage, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goal in 2010 and beyond, and deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his update."

It certainly was an exceptional quarter especially impressive in the context of challenging economies and numerous markets around the world. The quarter was strong financially, and operationally in all functions and regions. We made excellent progress towards achieving our 2010 corporate objectives. 
Let me review our recent accomplishments and outline the major growth drivers for continued strong performance in 2010.  The first quarter results provide an outstanding start to the year. REVLIMID was the key growth driver, with positive trends and critical metrics across markets. Global REVLIMID sales were up 46% year-over-year. U.S. REVLIMID sales increased 5% quarter-over-quarter, while international sales rose approximately 10%. 
Growth was balanced across regions, with significant contributions from multiple international markets. VIDAZA global sales are also off to a good start for the year, up 60% year-over-year. Our European team continues to rapidly establish VIDAZA as the treatment standard for high-risk MDS. And the United States, VIDAZA continues to be the clear market leader.  
Market expansion through new regulatory approvals in additional geographies and expanded labels indications in existing markets remain important growth drivers for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma.  As Sol mention, the regulatory review process for our REVLIMID application in Japan is on track. We're targeting a midyear approval and are hopeful of a relatively rapid pricing and reimbursement process that would allow a fourth quarter commercial launch. Our team in Japan is doing an excellent job preparing to maximize the clinical and commercial potential of REVLIMID in this very important market.
During the quarter, we advanced our newly diagnosed myeloma filing strategy. Our first priority is to ensure that we expeditiously compile a high-quality European application that supports regulatory approval and expanded reimbursement across the region. We are making substantial progress aggregating, preparing and analyzing the new data cut from MMO 15, which now includes 70% of planned events, up from the 50% presented to ASH in December. It's our intention to complete central adjudication and analysis of the updated data in time for presentation at the European Hematology Association meeting in early June.  And our European submission is on track for the second half of the year, followed by the U.S. submission as soon as possible.
Our clinical and regulatory teams continue to execute on our priority trials. In the first quarter, we reached agreement with the FDA and European authorities on the trial designs for the Phase III pomalidomide studies in the last refractory myeloma and in myelofibrosis. Enrollment in our Phase III prostate cancer trial accelerated. And we initiated a global Phase III trial in MDS non del 5q patients. We're moving forward with our plans to initiate the apremilast Phase III trials in psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis. These trials are planned to start during the second half of this year.
I believe that the exceptional results achieved during the quarter across functions in regions of our company actively reflect the operational excellence achieved by our teams. Celgene is stronger and better positioned than ever before.
I'd like to take a minute or two to expand on Dave's comments on the impact of U.S. healthcare reform on our business. As Dave noted, there was a minor  impact on the first quarter, and we're comfortable with the $35 million to $40 million estimated impact for the year. Our best estimate for 2011, with all the caveats, there needs to be and will be clarifying implementation guidance and technical corrections in the legislation over the next nine months, is that our revenue could be reduced by as much as $80 million to $90 million next year.
There are also benefits from healthcare reform. Millions of additional Americans will eventually gain access to coverage. And importantly, the legislation addressed the challenging coverage gap or doughnut hole in Medicare Part D. For those patients enrolled in Medicare Part D plans, the legislation provides a significant reduction in the coverage gap beginning in 2011.  I'm optimistic that over time, there will be a real benefit to patients, physicians and caregivers who will be able to focus less on deductibles and co-payments and more on appropriate patient care.  I would also expect that foundations that support patient assistance will see a gradual decline in demand as the coverage gap shrinks.  All in all, we expect that over time, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Act will have a modest impact on Celgene.
Now let me turn back to the first quarter operating update. The strong momentum that we saw at the end of 2009 carried over into the first quarter. Our commercial teams continue to deliver impressive results. U.S. fundamentals were strong. New patient starts, total patients on therapy and greater treatment duration were all key growth drivers.  Total U.S. REVLIMID share in the multiple myeloma market grew to approximately 40% and to nearly 45% in the second line. Duration increased to approximately to 12.1 months. 
Improved planning and patient support programs contributed to enhanced patient access to reimbursement, certainly as compared to the first quarter of 2009. The slight decline in the percentage of free goods in the first quarter reflects the overall improved environment for patient access.
First quarter growth was also strong in core European markets. Second line share increased to more than 35% in major markets where REVLIMID is indicated for second line therapy. Third line share increased to approximately 45%, driven by share gains in the United Kingdom. But we don't have access to the United Kingdom. But we don't have access to the same data in Europe as available in the United States through RevAssist , duration trends also appear favorable in Europe. We're conducting market research and expect updated data in the coming quarters.
While the first quarter in Europe was strong, challenging economic circumstances exist in numerous countries. Significant pressure to reduce budget deficits is growing in many countries. As an example, legislative proposals to cut growth prices in Germany have been in the headlines. We're indeed fortunate that our growth have excellent value proposition supported by strong clinical data. Nevertheless, our financial outlook does reflect some impact from changes in reimbursement policies. And we are monitoring developments closely.
A range of other markets including Australia also made key contributions to the first quarter results. The fundamental drivers on our REVLIMID business are worth briefly repeating. Share gains in earlier lines of therapy across major markets, global expansion, including Japan in late 2010, and increasing treatment duration remain the engines of growth. Important new data, with the potential to further support additional growth, will be presented at major mid- and late- year medical meetings such as ASCO, EHA and ASH.
Our head of clinical development, Dr. Jean-Pierre Bizzari, highlighted the full range of data and clinical' trials supporting the development of REVLIMID in all stages of myeloma at our R&D day earlier this month. We're specially looking forward to the oral presentations of the Phase III results from the major cooperative groups, IFM and CALGB at the upcoming America Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in about a month. Together with MM-015, these trials add to the growing body of clinical evidence that continuous REVLIMID therapy significantly prolongs progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.
We also extended our MDS leadership position in the first quarter. In the U.S., VIDAZA hit a market share peak among patients with high-risk MDS and REVLIMID increased its leadership position in MDS del 5q. VIDAZA growth in Europe was strong and on plan for the quarter. Though despite VIDAZA's overwhelming survival advantage in the AZA-001 trial, the U.K.'s NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] recommended against the reimbursement of VIDAZA. And we're appealing this decision with a hearing scheduled in June.
Our global launch continues with our teams in Canada and Australia, now in the final stages of launch preparation. Our regulatory teams are preparing the MDS-004 data set for submission in Europe later this year. The recent initiation of our Phase III MDS-005 trial and the non del 5q MDS is an example of our continued investment to sustain our long-term growth in the MDS market.
We're making excellent progress in building a major MDS franchise in Europe. Our largest competitor remains best supportive care. Continued share gains and extending duration of therapy are keys to our success in 2010. On the clinical front, we expect additional results of single agent and combination studies, including with REVLIMID at medical meetings late this year.
As Sol mentioned in mid-January, we closed the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals providing us a strategic entry into the U.S. lymphoma market. We're now launching ISTODAX in the United States for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Initial results are encouraging. In the first quarter, we also completed enrollment of the U.S. SPA trial in patients with relapsed refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Based upon positive data from this trial, we plan to file for U.S. approval late this year.
This year's ASCO meeting is shaping up to be an important congress for Celgene, where we have more than 50 abstracts that have been accepted, and expect more than 10 oral presentations to be delivered. Among these, we look forward to the updated data from the Phase III study comparing melphalan, prednisone and REVLIMID versus high-dose therapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed myeloma patients, and follow up data on pomalidomide and REVLIMID in bortezomib refractory myeloma.
In addition to myeloma, we anticipate data in CLL and lymphoma. CLL front leaders [ph] from Indiana [ph] soon will present updated data on the use of REVLIMID for previously untreated elderly CLL patients. This data should support our Phase III registration studies, CLL-008, in that patient population. We also expect to see data from Phase II studies of REVLIMID in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with a non-GCB biomarker. And importantly, in combination with Rituxan in untreated Follicular Lymphoma. We're confident that the data from ASCO will be the ongoing catalyst for our clinical and regulatory programs.
At our recent R&D day, we articulated our strategies to build important franchises in hematology, oncology and inflammation immunology. We detailed many of the more than 20 pivotal trials that we're conducting and the numerous programs across multiple platforms targeting serious and debilitating diseases. 
We look forward to updating you throughout the year as we advance clinical program, especially for REVLIMID in smoldering myeloma, in lymphomas and CLL, pomalidomide and myeloma in myelofibrosis, and importantly, apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
We have strong momentum and are committed to realizing the full potential of our deep and diverse pipeline. It is only through innovative research that we can produce the breakthrough therapies that will change the course of serious diseases. And it's by making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients that we create value for Celgene.
Our outstanding first quarter results accurately reflect the soundness of our strategy, our focus on excellence and execution, and the high quality and dedication of our teams around the world. As we've outlined for you, 2010 is a year with many important events and milestones. The strong start to the year positions us well to achieve or exceed our major corporate objectives. The promise of Celgene is extremely bright. And we look forward to updating you further on our progress in our next call in July. Thank you very much. 
Operator, we can now open the call to questions."

So I absolutely do agree with you. It's critical for us to manage that effectively, have a plan. And we do have a plan for many, many different markets.

It will be the first time that, that data's presented. So in the post-transplant setting, which is really the one major segment of the market certainly in the United States, that we really have, where REVLIMID has not become market leader, because the conventional paradigm has been to not treat post-stem cell transplant generally. So once that data is presented, we're optimistic that we could see a change in that paradigm with treatment. Obviously, in other markets around the world, there are going to be specific regulatory and reimbursement changes that need to be made as that data becomes available and can be published and included in our label and negotiations, et cetera. So we think there's significant upside from both the post-transplant setting, where today REVLIMID is not actively used as a therapy. And hopefully, post the data, it will begin to be used. And in the non-transplant settings, we can see continued progress which contributes to a significant part of the duration extensions. But we also think when we get the data from IFM and CALGB at ASCO, and likely that 70% cut off the data of MM-015 at the European Hematology Association Meeting, we're optimistic that, that could have a positive impact on the non-transplant setting also, as the value of continuous therapy is made even clearer and clearer."

We had two news releases today, one reporting another record quarter with excellent financial and operational results, and the other detailing our succession planning. Let me briefly comment on the latter, and then we'll transition to the results of the quarter.
I have been with Celgene for most of my career, where I've had the privilege of working with a superb management team and with exceptional people. Together, we built a remarkable global company with extraordinary financial, research and development, commercial and operational results and prospects. Indeed, we are the fastest growing biopharmaceutical company and one of the fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500.
I'm most proud that we develop products that profoundly affect the lives of seriously ill patients around the world. After decades at Celgene, I've decided that it is time for me to start pacing out of my responsibilities towards retirement. I am transitioning from my position as Chief Executive Officer at the upcoming annual meeting in June, when I will assume the position of Executive Chair, focusing on the overall management transition, board oversight and strategic initiatives.  On January 1, 2011, I will become Nonexecutive Chair and a consultant to the Corporation. It is a bittersweet event for me. On the one hand, I am transitioning from the company I love and the people I had great admiration for. On the other hand, I now can spend more time with my family, including my wife, my four children, and my 12 grandchildren, as well as devoting more time to charitable pursuits.
I am especially pleased to pass the leadership of Celgene on to Bob Hugin, with whom I have worked closely over the last 11 years. Bob brings strong leadership acumen, along with his strategic, financial and commercial capabilities. He has been instrumental during his tenure in building Celgene's success and transformation on a global scale and he will provide the continuity to our business plan to enable Celgene to continue our mission to become the premier global biopharmaceutical company.  Under Bob's leadership as CEO, I believe Celgene has the unique opportunity to continue to accelerate our continued delivery of strong financial and commercial results, and importantly to maintain an unwavering commitment to research and development, and the delivery of therapies for unmet medical needs to improve the lives of patients worldwide.

I'll now turn briefly to our results for the quarter, where we continue to deliver on our promise and potential as the global pre-eminent biopharmaceutical company. Our financial metrics were once again at record levels, with total revenues growing 31% year-over-year to $789 million, and revenue growing 46% year-over-year to factor the $30 million. 
We continue to aggressively invest in research and development while achieving the record non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, a 43% increase year-over-year. We also see a continued strengthening growth in our business as you will hear from Bob, notwithstanding the challenges related to the economic issues in Europe and rest of the world, as well as the potential financial impact to our business from recently passed healthcare reform legislation here in the U.S.  Dave and Bob will provide significant color to our results in a moment. 
I'd like to provide a strategic perspective on the quarter.  We are fully committed on a fundamental level to innovative science and transformational medicine that delivers better health care for better outcomes. This is reflected through our new state-of-the-art research facility in San Francisco, and the recent establishment of a world-class translational effort with our CITRE [Celgene Institute of Translational Research Europe] center in Spain. These centers will serve to drive and enhance our early-stage research capabilities, capabilities that are already producing multiple product opportunities across our key therapeutic areas: Hematology, oncology and inflammation immunology.
As you recently heard at our R&D day on April 8, Celgene is very fortunate to be strategically positioned from multiple perspectives: To continue its industry-leading growth potential for years to come based on a sustained pipeline of paradigm-changing innovation.  We've expanded our pipeline to encompass approximately 30 programs addressing high unmet medical needs in approximately 25 serious and debilitating diseases. This progress was highlighted at our recent R&D day, which focused on a sustainable innovation paradigm, demonstrating the breadth and scope of both the pipeline and our global leadership team responsible for advancing our discovery, clinical regulatory and commercial strategies that we believe will serve as the basis for the delivery of excellent clinical and commercial performance for years to come. 
We have multiple products with significant revenue potential that may enter the market over the next five years, including apremilast for psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and pomalidomide in multiple myeloma and myelophytosis. We are also conducting multiple pivotal trials evaluating REVLIMID in NHL and CLL. 
To accelerate our entry into the lymphoma market, we acquired Gloucester Pharmaceuticals. And it's important therapy, ISTODAX. ISTODAX is approved for continuous (sic) [cutaneous] T-cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we're working to gain approval for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and also to make it available on a global basis.
Our next major geographic expansion will be the second-largest oncology market, Japan, where we anticipate to have regulatory action for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma in the middle of the year and potentially launched by the end of the year.  Our commitment to innovative science and the drive to be bold in bringing even new treatments to patients is a mindset that drew us to Agios Pharmaceuticals. Just two weeks ago, we announced our collaboration with Agios related to their innovative cancer metabolism research platform. This collaboration is another example of Celgene's commitment to continually be at the forefront of new trends in medicine to sustain a pipeline of innovation for the future.
We also look forward to the important data on Celgene products that will be presented at numerous international meetings this year, including ASCO, EHA and ASH. The most important aspect of all of this is the fundamental understanding that the patient is the ultimate beneficiary of what we do. Our success as an organization and as a company will always be in direct proportion to the effort we make on behalf of our patients. We are today an industry leader in investing in research and development, which has positioned Celgene as the new paradigm for innovative, sustainable and profitable biopharmaceutical companies.
I've been fortunate to be part of establishing a unique company based on science and innovation at all levels and in all aspects, where people and ideals are valued, where extraordinary achievements are expected and delivered, and a sense of understanding the direct impact that each of us has on patients the world over is clear. The paradigm is doing well by doing good.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Gryska, who will share the details of our financial accomplishments in the first quarter. Dave?

Non-GAAP total revenue for the first quarter was $789 million, a 31% increase versus the first quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $295 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63.
Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $757 million for the first quarter, up 32% from $572 million in the year-ago quarter.
First quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $530 million, an increase of 46% over the first quarter of 2009.  Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $120 million, an increase of 60% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $104 million for the quarter, down 9% as compared to the year-ago quarter.
For the first quarter, sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $305 million, and international sales were $225 million, representing an increase of 5% and 10% respectively on a sequential quarter basis. And when compared to the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 32% and 71% respectively.
As many of you are aware, Congress recently passed healthcare reform legislation. Key components of this legislation include an increase in Medicaid rebates and the extension of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations. Consequently, first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million due to this legislation.  We expect these two components of healthcare legislation will negatively impact full-year revenues by approximately $35 million to $40 million. Beginning in 2011, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies will be required to provide a 50% discount to Medicare Part D patients as they fund the doughnut hole. Collectively, the increase in the Medicaid rebate, the extension of this rebate to managed care organizations and the 50% discount for Medicaid Part D patients in the doughnut hole are expected to negatively impact 2011 revenues by approximately $80 million to $90 million.
It is important to note that a lack of clarity exists around several components of the healthcare legislation. Our estimates are based on assumptions that may change as legislation details are further communicated. Consequently, the effect on earnings-per-share beyond 2010 is difficult to quantify at this time. Not only do the uncertainty regarding how legislation will ultimately be implemented, but also due to the potential offsets to some of these elements, such as decreased co-pay business funding to nonprofit entities and the added benefit of patients getting healthcare coverage.
Now getting back to our first quarter results, our non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.6%. For the current year, we expect gross margins to improve to approximately 93%, primarily due to a change in product mix.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the first quarter was $186 million, an increase of 2% over the fourth quarter of 2009. As we discussed at our recent April R&D presentations, we will continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth, and we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $860 million to $885 million for the full year. 
During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III trials. Our key development programs are evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX, and are completing international approvals of REVLIMID in major markets such as Japan. In addition, we are continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in preclinical and early stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-selling, general and administrative expenses was $188 million during the first quarter, down nearly 3% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to activities relating to ASH, and to a limited extent, international launch activities in the fourth quarter.  We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $745 million to $765 million for the full year as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. 
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22%. We continue to expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve approximately 100 basis points from 2009 levels to approximately 20%. As for our share count, we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $469 million for the year.
As you are aware, we had hedge our balance sheet foreign currency exposures, and our company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses in foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial.  We are well-positioned with our hedging program to minimize the impact of various foreign currencies on our earnings for the year. In addition, other income includes approximately $4 million and hedging re-evaluation gains realized during the first quarter.
In summary, this was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, up from a previous range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, up from the previous range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.  And Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 as compared to a range of $2.55 to $2.60 that was previously reported.  We had a strong first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion.  It is important to note this updated 2010 guidance includes the anticipated impact to our business relating to U.S. healthcare legislation. 
In summary, we continue to execute from the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating efficiency and leverage, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goal in 2010 and beyond, and deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his update.

It certainly was an exceptional quarter especially impressive in the context of challenging economies and numerous markets around the world. The quarter was strong financially, and operationally in all functions and regions. We made excellent progress towards achieving our 2010 corporate objectives. 
Let me review our recent accomplishments and outline the major growth drivers for continued strong performance in 2010.  The first quarter results provide an outstanding start to the year. REVLIMID was the key growth driver, with positive trends and critical metrics across markets. Global REVLIMID sales were up 46% year-over-year. U.S. REVLIMID sales increased 5% quarter-over-quarter, while international sales rose approximately 10%. 
Growth was balanced across regions, with significant contributions from multiple international markets. VIDAZA global sales are also off to a good start for the year, up 60% year-over-year. Our European team continues to rapidly establish VIDAZA as the treatment standard for high-risk MDS. And the United States, VIDAZA continues to be the clear market leader.  
Market expansion through new regulatory approvals in additional geographies and expanded labels indications in existing markets remain important growth drivers for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma.  As Sol mention, the regulatory review process for our REVLIMID application in Japan is on track. We're targeting a midyear approval and are hopeful of a relatively rapid pricing and reimbursement process that would allow a fourth quarter commercial launch. Our team in Japan is doing an excellent job preparing to maximize the clinical and commercial potential of REVLIMID in this very important market.
During the quarter, we advanced our newly diagnosed myeloma filing strategy. Our first priority is to ensure that we expeditiously compile a high-quality European application that supports regulatory approval and expanded reimbursement across the region. We are making substantial progress aggregating, preparing and analyzing the new data cut from MMO 15, which now includes 70% of planned events, up from the 50% presented to ASH in December. It's our intention to complete central adjudication and analysis of the updated data in time for presentation at the European Hematology Association meeting in early June.  And our European submission is on track for the second half of the year, followed by the U.S. submission as soon as possible.
Our clinical and regulatory teams continue to execute on our priority trials. In the first quarter, we reached agreement with the FDA and European authorities on the trial designs for the Phase III pomalidomide studies in the last refractory myeloma and in myelofibrosis. Enrollment in our Phase III prostate cancer trial accelerated. And we initiated a global Phase III trial in MDS non del 5q patients. We're moving forward with our plans to initiate the apremilast Phase III trials in psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis. These trials are planned to start during the second half of this year.
I believe that the exceptional results achieved during the quarter across functions in regions of our company actively reflect the operational excellence achieved by our teams. Celgene is stronger and better positioned than ever before.
I'd like to take a minute or two to expand on Dave's comments on the impact of U.S. healthcare reform on our business. As Dave noted, there was a minor  impact on the first quarter, and we're comfortable with the $35 million to $40 million estimated impact for the year. Our best estimate for 2011, with all the caveats, there needs to be and will be clarifying implementation guidance and technical corrections in the legislation over the next nine months, is that our revenue could be reduced by as much as $80 million to $90 million next year.
There are also benefits from healthcare reform. Millions of additional Americans will eventually gain access to coverage. And importantly, the legislation addressed the challenging coverage gap or doughnut hole in Medicare Part D. For those patients enrolled in Medicare Part D plans, the legislation provides a significant reduction in the coverage gap beginning in 2011.  I'm optimistic that over time, there will be a real benefit to patients, physicians and caregivers who will be able to focus less on deductibles and co-payments and more on appropriate patient care.  I would also expect that foundations that support patient assistance will see a gradual decline in demand as the coverage gap shrinks.  All in all, we expect that over time, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Act will have a modest impact on Celgene.
Now let me turn back to the first quarter operating update. The strong momentum that we saw at the end of 2009 carried over into the first quarter. Our commercial teams continue to deliver impressive results. U.S. fundamentals were strong. New patient starts, total patients on therapy and greater treatment duration were all key growth drivers.  Total U.S. REVLIMID share in the multiple myeloma market grew to approximately 40% and to nearly 45% in the second line. Duration increased to approximately to 12.1 months. 
Improved planning and patient support programs contributed to enhanced patient access to reimbursement, certainly as compared to the first quarter of 2009. The slight decline in the percentage of free goods in the first quarter reflects the overall improved environment for patient access.
First quarter growth was also strong in core European markets. Second line share increased to more than 35% in major markets where REVLIMID is indicated for second line therapy. Third line share increased to approximately 45%, driven by share gains in the United Kingdom. But we don't have access to the United Kingdom. But we don't have access to the same data in Europe as available in the United States through RevAssist , duration trends also appear favorable in Europe. We're conducting market research and expect updated data in the coming quarters.
While the first quarter in Europe was strong, challenging economic circumstances exist in numerous countries. Significant pressure to reduce budget deficits is growing in many countries. As an example, legislative proposals to cut growth prices in Germany have been in the headlines. We're indeed fortunate that our growth have excellent value proposition supported by strong clinical data. Nevertheless, our financial outlook does reflect some impact from changes in reimbursement policies. And we are monitoring developments closely.
A range of other markets including Australia also made key contributions to the first quarter results. The fundamental drivers on our REVLIMID business are worth briefly repeating. Share gains in earlier lines of therapy across major markets, global expansion, including Japan in late 2010, and increasing treatment duration remain the engines of growth. Important new data, with the potential to further support additional growth, will be presented at major mid- and late- year medical meetings such as ASCO, EHA and ASH.
Our head of clinical development, Dr. Jean-Pierre Bizzari, highlighted the full range of data and clinical' trials supporting the development of REVLIMID in all stages of myeloma at our R&D day earlier this month. We're specially looking forward to the oral presentations of the Phase III results from the major cooperative groups, IFM and CALGB at the upcoming America Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in about a month. Together with MM-015, these trials add to the growing body of clinical evidence that continuous REVLIMID therapy significantly prolongs progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.
We also extended our MDS leadership position in the first quarter. In the U.S., VIDAZA hit a market share peak among patients with high-risk MDS and REVLIMID increased its leadership position in MDS del 5q. VIDAZA growth in Europe was strong and on plan for the quarter. Though despite VIDAZA's overwhelming survival advantage in the AZA-001 trial, the U.K.'s NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] recommended against the reimbursement of VIDAZA. And we're appealing this decision with a hearing scheduled in June.
Our global launch continues with our teams in Canada and Australia, now in the final stages of launch preparation. Our regulatory teams are preparing the MDS-004 data set for submission in Europe later this year. The recent initiation of our Phase III MDS-005 trial and the non del 5q MDS is an example of our continued investment to sustain our long-term growth in the MDS market.
We're making excellent progress in building a major MDS franchise in Europe. Our largest competitor remains best supportive care. Continued share gains and extending duration of therapy are keys to our success in 2010. On the clinical front, we expect additional results of single agent and combination studies, including with REVLIMID at medical meetings late this year.
As Sol mentioned in mid-January, we closed the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals providing us a strategic entry into the U.S. lymphoma market. We're now launching ISTODAX in the United States for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Initial results are encouraging. In the first quarter, we also completed enrollment of the U.S. SPA trial in patients with relapsed refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Based upon positive data from this trial, we plan to file for U.S. approval late this year.
This year's ASCO meeting is shaping up to be an important congress for Celgene, where we have more than 50 abstracts that have been accepted, and expect more than 10 oral presentations to be delivered. Among these, we look forward to the updated data from the Phase III study comparing melphalan, prednisone and REVLIMID versus high-dose therapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed myeloma patients, and follow up data on pomalidomide and REVLIMID in bortezomib refractory myeloma.
In addition to myeloma, we anticipate data in CLL and lymphoma. CLL front leaders [ph] from Indiana [ph] soon will present updated data on the use of REVLIMID for previously untreated elderly CLL patients. This data should support our Phase III registration studies, CLL-008, in that patient population. We also expect to see data from Phase II studies of REVLIMID in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with a non-GCB biomarker. And importantly, in combination with Rituxan in untreated Follicular Lymphoma. We're confident that the data from ASCO will be the ongoing catalyst for our clinical and regulatory programs.
At our recent R&D day, we articulated our strategies to build important franchises in hematology, oncology and inflammation immunology. We detailed many of the more than 20 pivotal trials that we're conducting and the numerous programs across multiple platforms targeting serious and debilitating diseases. 
We look forward to updating you throughout the year as we advance clinical program, especially for REVLIMID in smoldering myeloma, in lymphomas and CLL, pomalidomide and myeloma in myelofibrosis, and importantly, apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
We have strong momentum and are committed to realizing the full potential of our deep and diverse pipeline. It is only through innovative research that we can produce the breakthrough therapies that will change the course of serious diseases. And it's by making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients that we create value for Celgene.
Our outstanding first quarter results accurately reflect the soundness of our strategy, our focus on excellence and execution, and the high quality and dedication of our teams around the world. As we've outlined for you, 2010 is a year with many important events and milestones. The strong start to the year positions us well to achieve or exceed our major corporate objectives. The promise of Celgene is extremely bright. And we look forward to updating you further on our progress in our next call in July. Thank you very much.

It will be the first time that, that data's presented. So in the post-transplant setting, which is really the one major segment of the market certainly in the United States, that we really have, where REVLIMID has not become market leader, because the conventional paradigm has been to not treat post-stem cell transplant generally. So once that data is presented, we're optimistic that we could see a change in that paradigm with treatment. Obviously, in other markets around the world, there are going to be specific regulatory and reimbursement changes that need to be made as that data becomes available and can be published and included in our label and negotiations, et cetera. So we think there's significant upside from both the post-transplant setting, where today REVLIMID is not actively used as a therapy. And hopefully, post the data, it will begin to be used. And in the non-transplant settings, we can see continued progress which contributes to a significant part of the duration extensions. But we also think when we get the data from IFM and CALGB at ASCO, and likely that 70% cut off the data of MM-015 at the European Hematology Association Meeting, we're optimistic that, that could have a positive impact on the non-transplant setting also, as the value of continuous therapy is made even clearer and clearer.

And in the first quarter of 2010, things have continued to go well for us. The value proposition for REVLIMID and VIDAZA are both very strong in all markets. And so despite the pressures, we still feel good about how this will play out. And our strategies are very country-specific, very payor-specific, to ensure that we ensure the maximum patient access. But yet, we're sensitive to ensure that we don't make things difficult for the long-term success of REVLIMID.

It will still exist because there still are people seven times the poverty level that have to put up a significant co-pay of 25% in the doughnut hole and other deductibles, et cetera.

We had two news releases today, one reporting another record quarter with excellent financial and operational results, and the other detailing our succession planning. Let me briefly comment on the latter, and then we'll transition to the results of the quarter.
I have been with Celgene for most of my career, where I've had the privilege of working with a superb management team and with exceptional people. Together, we built a remarkable global company with extraordinary financial, research and development, commercial and operational results and prospects. Indeed, we are the fastest growing biopharmaceutical company and one of the fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500.
I'm most proud that we develop products that profoundly affect the lives of seriously ill patients around the world. After decades at Celgene, I've decided that it is time for me to start pacing out of my responsibilities towards retirement. I am transitioning from my position as Chief Executive Officer at the upcoming annual meeting in June, when I will assume the position of Executive Chair, focusing on the overall management transition, board oversight and strategic initiatives.  On January 1, 2011, I will become Nonexecutive Chair and a consultant to the Corporation. It is a bittersweet event for me. On the one hand, I am transitioning from the company I love and the people I had great admiration for. On the other hand, I now can spend more time with my family, including my wife, my four children, and my 12 grandchildren, as well as devoting more time to charitable pursuits.
I am especially pleased to pass the leadership of Celgene on to Bob Hugin, with whom I have worked closely over the last 11 years. Bob brings strong leadership acumen, along with his strategic, financial and commercial capabilities. He has been instrumental during his tenure in building Celgene's success and transformation on a global scale and he will provide the continuity to our business plan to enable Celgene to continue our mission to become the premier global biopharmaceutical company.  Under Bob's leadership as CEO, I believe Celgene has the unique opportunity to continue to accelerate our continued delivery of strong financial and commercial results, and importantly to maintain an unwavering commitment to research and development, and the delivery of therapies for unmet medical needs to improve the lives of patients worldwide."

In addition, today's conference call webcast will include a presentation, which you can access by going to the Investor Relations section of our website at celgene.com. 
Before we start, we want to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Our actual results, performance or achievements could be materially different from those projected by these forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ from our forward-looking statements are discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. 
Also, our discussions during this conference call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparison between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of our earnings releases at Celgene's website at celgene.com in the Investor Relations section.
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sol Barer."

I'll now turn briefly to our results for the quarter, where we continue to deliver on our promise and potential as the global pre-eminent biopharmaceutical company. Our financial metrics were once again at record levels, with total revenues growing 31% year-over-year to $789 million, and revenue growing 46% year-over-year to factor the $30 million. 
We continue to aggressively invest in research and development, while achieving a record non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, a 43% increase year-over-year. We also see a continued strengthening growth in our business, as you will hear from Bob, notwithstanding the challenges related to the economic issues in Europe and rest of the world, as well as the potential financial impact to our business from recently passed healthcare reform legislation here in the U.S.  Dave and Bob will provide significant color to our results in a moment. 
I'd like to provide a strategic perspective on the quarter. We are fully committed on a fundamental level to innovative science and transformational medicine that delivers better healthcare for better outcomes. This is reflected through our new state-of-the-art research facility in San Francisco, and the recent establishment of a world-class translational effort with our CITRE [Celgene Institute of Translational Research Europe] center in Spain. These centers will serve to drive and enhance our early-stage research capabilities, capabilities that are already producing multiple product opportunities across our key therapeutic areas: hematology, oncology and inflammation immunology.
As you recently heard at our R&D day on April 8, Celgene is very fortunate to be strategically positioned from multiple perspectives: To continue its industry-leading growth potential for years to come based on a sustained pipeline of paradigm-changing innovation. We've expanded our pipeline to encompass approximately 30 programs addressing high unmet medical needs in approximately 25 serious and debilitating diseases. This progress was highlighted at our recent R&D day, which focused on a sustainable innovation paradigm, demonstrating the breadth and scope of both the pipeline and our global leadership team responsible for advancing our discovery, clinical regulatory and commercial strategies, that we believe will serve as the basis for the delivery of excellent clinical and commercial performance for years to come. 
We have multiple products with significant revenue potential that may enter the market over the next five years, including apremilast for psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and pomalidomide in multiple myeloma and myelophytosis. We are also conducting multiple pivotal trials evaluating REVLIMID in NHL and CLL. 
To accelerate our entry into the lymphoma market, we acquired Gloucester Pharmaceuticals. And it's important therapy, ISTODAX. ISTODAX is approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in the U.S., and we're working to gain approval for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and also to make it available on a global basis.
Our next major geographic expansion will be the second-largest oncology market, Japan, where we anticipate to have regulatory action for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma in the middle of the year and potentially launched by the end of the year.  Our commitment to innovative science and the drive to be bold in bringing new treatments to patients is a mindset that drew us to Agios Pharmaceuticals. Just two weeks ago, we announced our collaboration with Agios related to their innovative cancer metabolism research platform. This collaboration is another example of Celgene's commitment to continually be at the forefront of new trends in medicine to sustain a pipeline of innovation for the future.
We also look forward to the important data on Celgene products that will be presented at numerous international meetings this year, including ASCO, EHA and ASH. The most important aspect of all of this is the fundamental understanding that the patient is the ultimate beneficiary of what we do. Our success as an organization and as a company will always be into direct proportion to the effort we make on behalf of our patients. We are today an industry leader in investing in research and development, which has positioned Celgene as the new paradigm for innovative, sustainable and profitable biopharmaceutical companies.
I've been fortunate to be part of establishing a unique company based on science and innovation at all levels and in all aspects, where people and ideals are valued, where extraordinary achievements are expected and delivered, and a sense of understanding the direct impact that each of us has on patients the world over is clear. The paradigm is doing well by doing good.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Gryska, who will share the details of our financial accomplishments in the first quarter. Dave?"

Now I'll take you through our record financial results. Non-GAAP total revenue for the first quarter was $789 million, a 31% increase versus the first quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $295 million, and non-GAAP d",1046,"Thanks, Sol. Now I'll take you through our record financial results. Non-GAAP total revenue for the first quarter was $789 million, a 31% increase versus the first quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $295 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63.  Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $757 million for the first quarter, up 32% from $572 million in the year-ago quarter.
First quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $530 million, an increase of 46% over the first quarter of 2009. Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $120 million, an increase of 60% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $104 million for the quarter, down 9% as compared to the year-ago quarter.
For the first quarter, sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $305 million, and international sales were $225 million, representing an increase of 5% and 10%, respectively, on a sequential quarter basis. And when compared to the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 32% and 71%, respectively.
As many of you are aware, Congress recently passed healthcare reform legislation. Key components of this legislation include an increase in Medicaid rebates and the extension of Medicaid rebates to managed care organizations. Consequently, first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million due to this legislation.  We expect these two components of healthcare legislation will negatively impact full-year revenues by approximately $35 million to $40 million. 
Beginning in 2011, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies will be required to provide a 50% discount to Medicare Part D patients as they fund the doughnut hole. Collectively, the increase in the Medicaid rebate, the extension of this rebate to managed care organizations and the 50% discount for Medicaid Part D patients in the doughnut hole are expected to negatively impact 2011 revenues by approximately $80 million to $90 million.
It is important to note that a lack of clarity exists around several components of the healthcare legislation. Our estimates are based on assumptions that may change, as legislation details are further communicated. Consequently, the effect on earnings per share beyond 2010 is difficult to quantify at this time. Not only do the uncertainty regarding how legislation will ultimately be implemented, but also due to the potential offsets to some of these elements, such as decreased co-pay assistance funding to nonprofit entities and the added benefit of patients getting healthcare coverage.
Now getting back to our first quarter results, our non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.6%. For the current year, we expect gross margins to improve to approximately 93%, primarily due to a change in product mix.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the first quarter was $186 million, an increase of 2% over the fourth quarter of 2009. As we discussed at our recent April R&D presentations, we will continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth, and we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $860 million to $885 million for the full year. 
During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III trials. Our key development programs are evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We're also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX, and are completing international approvals of REVLIMID in major markets such as Japan. In addition, we are continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in preclinical and early stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-selling, general and administrative expenses was $188 million during the first quarter, down nearly 3% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to activities relating to ASH, and to a limited extent, international launch activities in the fourth quarter.  We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $745 million to $765 million for the full year as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. 
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22%. We continue to expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve approximately 100 basis points from 2009 levels to approximately 20%. As for our share count, we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $469 million for the year.
As you are aware, we had hedge our balance sheet foreign currency exposures, and our company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses in foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial.  We are well-positioned with our hedging program to minimize the impact of various foreign currencies on our earnings for the year. In addition, other income includes approximately $4 million and hedging re-evaluation gains realized during the first quarter.
In summary, this was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, up from a previous range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, up from the previous range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.  And Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.60 to $2.65 as compared to a range of $2.55 to $2.60 that was previously reported.  We had a strong first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion.  It is important to note this updated 2010 guidance includes the anticipated impact to our business relating to U.S. healthcare legislation. 
In summary, we continue to execute from the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating efficiency and leverage, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goal in 2010 and beyond, and deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his update."

It certainly was an exceptional quarter especially impressive in the context of challenging economies and numerous markets around the world. The quarter was strong financially, and operationally in all functions and regions. We made excellent progress towards achieving our 2010 corporate objectives. 
Let me review our recent accomplishments and outline the major growth drivers for continued strong performance in 2010.  The first quarter results provide an outstanding start to the year. REVLIMID was the key growth driver, with positive trends and critical metrics across markets. Global REVLIMID sales were up 46% year-over-year. U.S. REVLIMID sales increased 5% quarter-over-quarter, while international sales rose approximately 10%. 
Growth was balanced across regions, with significant contributions from multiple international markets. VIDAZA global sales are also off to a good start for the year, up 60% year-over-year. Our European team continues to rapidly establish VIDAZA as the treatment standard for high-risk MDS. And the United States, VIDAZA continues to be the clear market leader.  
Market expansion through new regulatory approvals in additional geographies and expanded labels indications in existing markets remain important growth drivers for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma.  As Sol mention, the regulatory review process for our REVLIMID application in Japan is on track. We're targeting a midyear approval and are hopeful of a relatively rapid pricing and reimbursement process that would allow a fourth quarter commercial launch. Our team in Japan is doing an excellent job preparing to maximize the clinical and commercial potential of REVLIMID in this very important market.
During the quarter, we advanced our newly diagnosed myeloma filing strategy. Our first priority is to ensure that we expeditiously compile a high-quality European application that supports regulatory approval and expanded reimbursement across the region. We are making substantial progress aggregating, preparing and analyzing the new data cut from MMO 15, which now includes 70% of planned events, up from the 50% presented to ASH in December. It's our intention to complete central adjudication and analysis of the updated data in time for presentation at the European Hematology Association meeting in early June.  And our European submission is on track for the second half of the year, followed by the U.S. submission as soon as possible.
Our clinical and regulatory teams continue to execute on our priority trials. In the first quarter, we reached agreement with the FDA and European authorities on the trial designs for the Phase III pomalidomide studies in the last refractory myeloma and in myelofibrosis. Enrollment in our Phase III prostate cancer trial accelerated. And we initiated a global Phase III trial in MDS non del 5q patients. We're moving forward with our plans to initiate the apremilast Phase III trials in psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis. These trials are planned to start during the second half of this year.
I believe that the exceptional results achieved during the quarter across functions in regions of our company actively reflect the operational excellence achieved by our teams. Celgene is stronger and better positioned than ever before.
I'd like to take a minute or two to expand on Dave's comments on the impact of U.S. healthcare reform on our business. As Dave noted, there was a minor  impact on the first quarter, and we're comfortable with the $35 million to $40 million estimated impact for the year. Our best estimate for 2011, with all the caveats, there needs to be and will be clarifying implementation guidance and technical corrections in the legislation over the next nine months, is that our revenue could be reduced by as much as $80 million to $90 million next year.
There are also benefits from healthcare reform. Millions of additional Americans will eventually gain access to coverage. And importantly, the legislation addressed the challenging coverage gap or doughnut hole in Medicare Part D. For those patients enrolled in Medicare Part D plans, the legislation provides a significant reduction in the coverage gap beginning in 2011.  I'm optimistic that over time, there will be a real benefit to patients, physicians and caregivers who will be able to focus less on deductibles and co-payments and more on appropriate patient care.  I would also expect that foundations that support patient assistance will see a gradual decline in demand as the coverage gap shrinks.  All in all, we expect that over time, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Act will have a modest impact on Celgene.
Now let me turn back to the first quarter operating update. The strong momentum that we saw at the end of 2009 carried over into the first quarter. Our commercial teams continue to deliver impressive results. U.S. fundamentals were strong. New patient starts, total patients on therapy and greater treatment duration were all key growth drivers.  Total U.S. REVLIMID share in the multiple myeloma market grew to approximately 40% and to nearly 45% in the second line. Duration increased to approximately to 12.1 months. 
Improved planning and patient support programs contributed to enhanced patient access to reimbursement, certainly as compared to the first quarter of 2009. The slight decline in the percentage of free goods in the first quarter reflects the overall improved environment for patient access.
First quarter growth was also strong in core European markets. Second line share increased to more than 35% in major markets where REVLIMID is indicated for second line therapy. Third line share increased to approximately 45%, driven by share gains in the United Kingdom. But we don't have access to the United Kingdom. But we don't have access to the same data in Europe as available in the United States through RevAssist , duration trends also appear favorable in Europe. We're conducting market research and expect updated data in the coming quarters.
While the first quarter in Europe was strong, challenging economic circumstances exist in numerous countries. Significant pressure to reduce budget deficits is growing in many countries. As an example, legislative proposals to cut growth prices in Germany have been in the headlines. We're indeed fortunate that our growth have excellent value proposition supported by strong clinical data. Nevertheless, our financial outlook does reflect some impact from changes in reimbursement policies. And we are monitoring developments closely.
A range of other markets, including Australia, also made key contributions to the first quarter results. The fundamental drivers on our REVLIMID business are worth briefly repeating. Share gains in earlier lines of therapy across major markets, global expansion, including Japan in late 2010, and increasing treatment duration remain the engines of growth. Important new data, with the potential to further support additional growth, will be presented at major mid- and late-year medical meetings such as ASCO, EHA and ASH.
Our head of clinical development, Dr. Jean-Pierre Bizzari, highlighted the full range of data and clinical trials supporting the development of REVLIMID in all stages of myeloma at our R&D day earlier this month. We're specially looking forward to the oral presentations of the Phase III results from the major cooperative groups, IFM and CALGB at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in about a month. Together with MM-015, these trials add to the growing body of clinical evidence that continuous REVLIMID therapy significantly prolongs progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.
We also extended our MDS leadership position in the first quarter. In the U.S., VIDAZA hit a market share peak among patients with high-risk MDS, and REVLIMID increased its leadership position in MDS del 5q. VIDAZA growth in Europe was strong and on plan for the quarter. Though despite VIDAZA's overwhelming survival advantage in the AZA-001 trial, the U.K.'s NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] recommended against the reimbursement of VIDAZA. And we're appealing this decision with a hearing scheduled in June.
Our global launch continues with our teams in Canada and Australia, now in the final stages of launch preparation. Our regulatory teams are preparing the MDS-004 data set for submission in Europe later this year. The recent initiation of our Phase III MDS-005 trial and non-del 5q MDS is an example of our continued investment to sustain our long-term growth in the MDS market.
We're making excellent progress in building a major MDS franchise in Europe. Our largest competitor remains best supportive care. Continued share gains and extending duration of therapy are keys to our success in 2010. On the clinical front, we expect additional results of single agent and combination studies, including with REVLIMID at medical meetings late this year.
As Sol mentioned in mid-January, we closed the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, providing us a strategic entry into the U.S. lymphoma market. We're now launching ISTODAX in the United States for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Initial results are encouraging. In the first quarter, we also completed enrollment of the U.S. SPA trial in patients with relapsed refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Based upon positive data from this trial, we plan to file for U.S. approval late this year.
This year's ASCO meeting is shaping up to be an important congress for Celgene, where we have more than 50 abstracts that have been accepted, and expect more than 10 oral presentations to be delivered. Among these, we look forward to the updated data from the Phase III study comparing melphalan, prednisone and REVLIMID versus high-dose therapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed myeloma patients, and follow up data on pomalidomide and REVLIMID in bortezomib refractory myeloma.
In addition to myeloma, we anticipate data in CLL and lymphoma. CLL thought leaders from Indiana soon will present updated data on the use of REVLIMID for previously untreated elderly CLL patients. This data should support our Phase III registration studies, CLL-008, in that patient population. We also expect to see data from Phase II studies of REVLIMID in Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma patients with a non-GCB biomarker, and importantly, in combination with Rituxan in untreated Follicular Lymphoma. We're confident that the data from ASCO will be the ongoing catalyst for our clinical and regulatory programs.
At our recent R&D day, we articulated our strategies to build important franchises in hematology, oncology and inflammation immunology. We detailed many of the more than 20 pivotal trials that we're conducting and the numerous programs across multiple platforms targeting serious and debilitating diseases. 
We look forward to updating you throughout the year as we advance clinical program, especially for REVLIMID in smoldering myeloma, in lymphomas and CLL, pomalidomide and myeloma in myelofibrosis, and importantly, apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
We have strong momentum and are committed to realizing the full potential of our deep and diverse pipeline. It is only through innovative research that we can produce the breakthrough therapies that will change the course of serious diseases. And it's by making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients that we create value for Celgene.
Our outstanding first quarter results actively reflect the soundness of our strategy, our focus on excellence and execution, and the high quality and dedication of our teams around the world. As we've outlined for you, 2010 is a year with many important events and milestones. The strong start to the year position us well to achieve or exceed our major corporate objectives. The promise of Celgene is extremely bright. And we look forward to updating you further on our progress on our next call in July. Thank you very much.

It will be the first time that, that data's presented. So in the post-transplant setting, which is really the one major segment of the market certainly in the United States, that we really have, where REVLIMID has not become market leader, because the conventional paradigm has been to not treat post-stem cell transplant generally. So once that data is presented, we're optimistic that we could see a change in that paradigm with treatment. Obviously, in other markets around the world, there are going to be specific regulatory and reimbursement changes that need to be made as that data becomes available and can be published and included in our label and negotiations, et cetera. So we think there's significant upside from both the post-transplant setting, where today REVLIMID is not actively used as a therapy. And hopefully, post the data, it will begin to be used. And in the non-transplant settings, we can see continued progress which contributes to a significant part of the duration extensions. But we also think when we get the data from IFM and CALGB at ASCO, and likely that 70% cut off the data of MM-015 at the European Hematology Association Meeting, we're optimistic that, that could have a positive impact on the non-transplant setting also, as the value of continuous therapy is made even clearer and clearer."

And so despite the pressures, we still feel good about how this will play out. And our strategies are very country-specific, very payor-specific, to ensure that we ensure the maximum patient access. But yet, we're sensitive to ensure that we don't make things difficult for the long-term success of REVLIMID. So I can't give you a specific answer, but I think our plans do recognize that there will be some pressures in different markets, some we think will be at more success than others.

It will still exist because there still are people seven times the poverty level that have to put up a significant co-pay of 25% in the doughnut hole and other deductibles, et cetera. So I think the important role of independent third-party co-payment providers, those foundations are still going to be very valuable in the marketplace. We're still going to have co-pays and deductibles. I think also over time, the financial impact where our contributions probably will go down.

Before we start, we want to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements exclude the effects of the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience unless noted. Our actual results, performance or achievements could be materially different from those projected by these forward-looking statements.

Also, our discussions during this conference call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of our earnings releases on Celgene's website at www.celgene.com in the Investor Relations section.

The second quarter was an outstanding quarter for Celgene across all functions and geographies. Our exceptional global team produced full of excellent operating results and achieved multiple significant milestones that has a potential to create meaningful benefits for patients and strong returns for shareholders for years to come. Early this morning, we announced record-financial results with total revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $850 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 50% year-over-year to $0.69. 
Before we review the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, I'd like to highlight several of the key strategic developments of the last three months. Though not yet completed, the announcement of Abraxis BioScience acquisition broadens our therapeutic focus into the solid tumor market. Their lead product, ABRAXANE, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the United States and international markets, has also shown significant promise in pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials. The transaction provides the opportunity for us to leverage our global, commercial, clinical and regulatory organizations and further strengthens our pipeline, which multiple candidates from the Abraxis' proprietary Nab Technology portfolio. 
Advancing our hematology pipeline is also a strategic imperative. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Hematology meetings in June, there were many presentations that highlighted important new data supporting our key products and programs. Perhaps the most significant data were results from three Phase III studies, demonstrating the substantial benefit achieved by multiple myeloma patients receiving continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
Our international expansion strategy continues to be an important growth driver for our products. On June 25, REVLIMID was approved in Japan for the treatment of second-line multiple myeloma. Governmental reimbursement was achieved in less than a month following approval, actually reflecting the importance of REVLIMID therapy in myeloma and a validation of the quality of the planning and execution of the Celgene team in Japan. 
We are now in the early stages of a thoughtfully-planned commercial launch in this, the second largest oncology market in the world. The investments we have made in Japan and in other international markets will enable us to capture the full value of REVLIMID and the many other opportunities in our pipeline in all major markets. 
During the quarter, substantial progress was achieved in advancing multiple pipeline programs, highlighted by the initiation of our first pivotal Phase III trial for our lead anti-inflammatory product, apremilast, in psoriatic arthritis, and the initiation of our Phase I cancer clinical study of our novel dual mTOR Kinase Inhibitor CC-223, a product of our research labs in San Diego. The significant progress in this quarter further strengthens our belief that sustained long-term growth comes best through an unwavering commitment to invest in multiple programs designed to produce breakthrough therapies for patients with serious unmet medical needs. I'd like now to hand the call over to Dave Gryska, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our second quarter financial results. Dave?"

Now I'll take you through our record financial results. Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter was $850 million, a 36% increase versus the second quarter of 2009.

Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter was $850 million, a 36% increase versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for second quarter was $323 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.69. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $821 million for the second quarter, up 38% from $596 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $587 million, an increase of 48% over second quarter of 2009. Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 43% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $98 million for the quarter, down 7% as compared to year-ago quarter.
The second quarter sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $351 million, representing an increase of 15% on a sequential-quarter basis, and a 44% increase when compared to second quarter of 2009. International sales were $236 million, representing an increase of 5% on a sequential-quarter basis and a 54% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.4%. Gross margins were slightly negatively impacted from the quarter by nonrecurring inventory manufacturing charges. It is important to note that inventory levels are virtually unchanged as compared to the first quarter. We continue to expect gross margins to be approximately 93% for the full year. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the second quarter was $202 million, an increase of 9% over the first quarter of 2010. We are continuing to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth. During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key development programs are valuing REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. 
In addition, we're continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in pre-clinical and early-stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in a range of $845 million to $865 million for the full year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-GAAP selling, general, administrative expenses were $197 million during the second quarter, an increase of approximately 5% from the first quarter of 2010. We now expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $675 million to $785 million for 2010, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID, VIDAZA and our patient support programs in the U.S.
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 18%. This improvement in the tax rate is the result of a onetime benefit from the settlement related to state taxes. We expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve to approximately 19.5% for the year. 
As you were aware, we hedged our balance sheet, foreign currency exposures in our company, foreign-currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses based on foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on total revenue on a sequential-quarter basis was immaterial. We are well-positioned with our hedging programs to minimize the volatility of various foreign currencies effects on our earnings for the year. In addition, during the second quarter, we realized approximately $5 million in hedging and re-evaluation losses, which are included in other income and expense.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock during the quarter. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion, up from a previous range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This update of revenue guidance does not include Abraxis BioScience. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.65 to $2.70, as compared to a range of $2.6 to $2.65 that was previously reported. We updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes approximately $0.05 dilution from the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience. 
In summary, we continue to execute on the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating leverage and efficiency, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goals in 2010 and beyond, and continue to deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his further update."

The operating results of the quarter were highlighted by strong REVLIMID revenue growth, with sales growing 48% year-over-year and 11% over the last quarter. Sales were up 15% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., with 4% seq",1764,"Thank you, Dave. Quite a quarter. The operating results of the quarter were highlighted by strong REVLIMID revenue growth, with sales growing 48% year-over-year and 11% over the last quarter. Sales were up 15% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., with 4% sequential growth internationally. Many factors contributed to this excellent performance, most notably recent data highlighted at ASH, ASCO and EHA, all supporting continuous REVLIMID therapy. VIDAZA growth accelerated in the quarter. Year-over-year, global sales increased 43% with 10% growth quarter-over-quarter. Europe was the primary driver of this growth, and international sales now represent greater than 50% of total sales. 
In addition to new markets, label expansion has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June -- new markets are important to our expansion and growth. Label expansion also has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June, positive updated data from MM-015  was presented. The Phase III trial in newly diagnosed myeloma patient will be the backbone of our submission to European Regulatory Authorities later this year. 
As we deliver on our near-term value drivers, we're also focused on long-term value creation. We remain committed to maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID worldwide with pivotal studies ongoing in lymphoma, CLL, MDS and prostate cancer. Recently, we enrolled our first patients in our Phase III trial,  PSA-002, for apremilast and patients with psoriatic arthritis. We're optimistic that we'll be able to close the Abraxis acquisition in the coming two to three months. We look forward to updating you on our strategy for capitalizing on the opportunities and synergies of the combined companies, as we clear regulatory hurdles.
The fundamentals in our Core Myeloma business remained very strong. Growth in the U.S. was driven by increasing new patient starts and duration gains. Our core European markets also produced robust results despite an increasingly challenging economic environment. Second line market share increased to nearly 40% in the four major European markets where REVLIMID's book were reimbursed. 
In the United Kingdom, where REVLIMID is reimbursed in the third line, market share is over 50%. We're monitoring the environment closely and believe that our guidance appropriately reflects the current economic reality. In other international markets, we also saw a strong sequential growth and are making good progress. The full growth in Japan represents the most significant commercial development in the quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of initiating a well-planned launch in Japan, which includes the introduction of our proprietary risk management system, RevMate, to nearly 250 sites across Japan. We believe that our long-term interest are best served by ensuring that hematologists in Japan are well educated on the effective and safe use of REVLIMID to ensure positive-first experience. A proper foundation will pay significant long-term dividends. 
Physician practice in oncology is data-driven. New data is the lifeblood of hematology/oncology products. In early June, data was presented for more than 100 posters and more than 20 oral presentations at the ASCO in EHA meetings. By every measure, these meetings were a great success for Celgene products. Data from the three pivotal studies demonstrated the continuous treatment for REVLIMID for patients with multiple myeloma, has the potential to become the standard of care. 
In addition, Abraxis will present a demonstrated REVLIMID activity in lymphomas and leukemias, and exciting new data are pomalidomide and relapsed or refractory myeloma was also highlighted. Based on the clinical and commercial potential of these results, we continue to accelerate the development of these products as an indication, as rapidly as possible. 
We believe that we're just seeing the beginning of the impact of the paradigm changing data that supports continuous use of REVLIMID. In the IFM and CALGB's studies presented at ASCO continuous REVLIMID therapy demonstrated unprecedented reductions in the risk of disease progression in the post stem-cell transplant setting, with 54% and 58% risk reduction, respectively. A week later, updated data that included 70% of advanced MM-015 were presented at the EHA, and the results were consistent, a 58% reduced risk of overall progression in the non stem-cell transplant population. The data presented from the podium from MM-015 and the IFM and CALGB studies all illustrated the progression-free survival advantage of continuous REVLIMID therapy. The three Phase III studies represent a pillar of myeloma strategy, the generation of supportive data for early and continuous treatment of the disease. 
In addition to MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies, other presentations at ASCO presented data demonstrating that REVLIMID combined with dexamethasone is a highly inactive induction therapy, and that REVLIMID may even represent an alternative to stem-cell transplant in certain patient populations. 
We continue to develop our critical strategy for the treatment of high-risk smoldering myeloma, while at the same time accelerating the development of pomalidomide for the treatment of relapsed refractory myeloma, where studies have demonstrated a 50% response rate, representing the highest response rate of any single agent in relapse, refractory disease. We're committed to improving the treatment options in all lines of therapy for patients of multiple myeloma. 
Paradigm-changing data, increased market share and duration, and global expansion, all of these factors contributed to the very strong results that were produced this past quarter. As we seek to broaden our labeled indication and as physicians become more aware of this new data, we're optimistic that our strong performance in this market will continue. 
VIDAZA also produce excellent results in the second quarter. International VIDAZA growth was particularly strong as we continue to establish a leadership position in major European countries and other key markets. In United States, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter, maintaining market share leadership. VIDAZA remains the only agent in this class worldwide that demonstrated survival advantage of MDS, AML. We have a number of ongoing studies to strengthen VIDAZA's role in the treatment of MDS and AML. 
Positive trends continue in the MDS del 5q market with REVLIMID. We're optimistic that we'll receive regulatory approval in Japan later this year and are on track for an MDS del 5q submission in Europe, soon after the MM-015 myeloma filing in Europe. The international launch of VIDAZA is ongoing, with global expansion and share gains, coupled with increasing duration, driving growth. Additional data on both REVLIMID and VIDAZA and MDS is expected at this year's American Society of Hematology meeting in December. 
In addition to the outstanding REVLIMID data and multiple myeloma the was presented in ASCO, there were numerous other abstracts that highlighted the potential of REVLIMID and are broader in hematology and oncology pipeline. Groundbreaking data from a study that evaluated the novel R2, REVLIMID plus Rituxan, combination of patients with follicular lymphoma demonstrated 97% response rate, which included a complete response rate of 86% with duration now greater than six months. This represents a significant opportunity for REVLIMID in lymphoma, and we expect to begin a pivotal Celgene sponsor study in the coming months. 
We also recently initiated an adaptive design study in patients with defused large T-cell lymphoma. The concept of this study is based upon the differential response rate data seen in the bio-market defined subset of the patient population. In addition to these studies, we'll continue to maximize the potential of REVLIMID in lymphoma with additional pivotal studies melphalan lymphoma and diffused large B-cell lymphoma. 
In leukemia, positive data was presented at ASCO to illustrate the potential of pivotal CLL-008 trial, which is evaluating REVLIMID as a first-line therapy in elderly CLL patients. 
In addition to REVLIMID, our hematology/oncology pipeline have seven compounds in all stages of development. We expect to have results from our pivotal studies evaluating ISTODAX in relapse refractory multiple T-cell lymphoma in the next coming few weeks. 
With approximately 15 pivotal in Phase III trials from the hemo pipeline, there will be a steady flow of important new data for the next several years, leading to what we believe will be another five to 10 new indications in this period. I do look forward to our next presentation when we should be able to add ABRAXANE and the Abraxis pipeline to this slide. 
Speaking of Abraxis, we're on track with all of our regulatory filings related to the transaction. Both companies submitted the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings two weeks ago and the explore proxy statement was submitted earlier this morning. Once the filing is declared effective by the SEC, there will be an Abraxis shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. The transaction is expected to close shortly after that meeting. We do expect this transaction will close before our next conference call in late October and look forward to updating you on our progress and plans at that time. 
In addition to hematology/oncology discussions, we continue to feel a substantial portfolio of assets in our inflammation and immunology franchise. We now have six candidates in clinical development. This pipeline was a major focus at our R&D in April, and it continues to make excellent progress since then. We're now initiating our first trial with ACE-011 in renal anemia, moving rapidly into Phase II in Crohn's Disease with our cellular therapy, PDA-001, and advancing our JNK inhibitor in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. 
Our most program is Apremilast. In just a past few weeks, we have dosed our first patients in TFA-002, the first of our pivotal trials. We have an extensive development program for Apremilast in Psoriatic Arthritis, Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and other serious immune-inflammatory diseases. All of our pivotal trials and Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis are targeted to be initiated before the end of this year. 
It was an exceptional quarter both in terms of financial and operating results and also in terms of positioning Celgene for the future. While producing strong bottom-line results, we're also investing the future to sustain the success and high growth that we've achieved. We're executing on our plans and managing the challenges of Healthcare Reform in the U.S. and budgetary pressures in the EU, while making the sound strategic decision to expand our capabilities around the world and to expand therapeutic franchise and to capitalize on our existing strengths. 
As we close, I want to recognize and thank the Celgene team worldwide, who all contributed to these extraordinary results for this past quarter. Superb results achieved in the challenging global economy. It's their dedication, their passion for the patient, their creativity and expertise, that makes us so optimistic about the future. Thank you for joining this morning, and we look forward to answer your questions. So operator, please, you can now open the call to questions."

And end markets clearly have differentiating characteristics.
Japan is a market with a very, very significant sensitivity to past effects of drugs, with birth defects, and overall, end market, very sensitive to side effect management. And so we're being very prudent here to ensure that we've got the right risk management system. It's something that we've developed, and our team has developed in very strong concert with important other constituencies in Japan, including the ministry and patient groups, et cetera. So it's been thoughtfully done. It's well planned out. We do not think it will have any long-term negative impediment. We've got people confidence that it's a very safe system and its going to be well controlled and managed. That being said, putting the risk management system aside, Japan is a great market, and REVLIMID is spectacularly well-situated compound that fit extraordinarily well with the conditions in market of Japan. At oral therapy with very manageable side effects with strong effectiveness demonstrated in the labeled indication. And so that's very important for us to establish Japan early on and make sure that physicians are very comfortable with having administrative drugs, how to safely do it, how to manage the side effects. And that's the marketplace that you establish a strong initial presence and physicians are comfortable with having used the drug with the initial one, two, three patients. You're going to see a very rapid uptake over the longer term. But in the near term, even we're talking about, we want to make sure that people don't get overly enthusiastic to see a dramatic ramp. We're playing Japan and we're positioning ourself for very strong long term excellent performance. But we're going to do it the right way to ensure education is there, good solid risk management systems so that physicians, patients and the government and we are all comfortable that it's being done in a very prudent manner. And that's not to say that we are just incredibly excited about having the approval on June 25, and to get pricing and reimbursement in such a short period of time really does reflect, I think, a few things. One, the importance of the new therapy for myeloma in Japan, the need for REVLIMID to get out to patients and also, I think, the execution, the planning, the strategy of our Celgene team in Japan to produce that in such a short period of time. So we're excited, but we're going to do it in the best way position for long-term success."

That was the only meaningful event in the second quarter. Clearly, people are focused on Germany for later this year with a 10% increase in the rebate in Germany, and the specifics of that is still being finalized but that looks pretty clear. I mean, as we lookout past 2010, our marketplace -- we'd look at it country by country and clearly, there's lots of pressure. I think the impact is more on just budgetary pressures, less on specific price declines but we're going to see continued price decline and that's the reason why when we started REVLIMID internationally, we established the benchmark price that we did. And so on our regional forecast, we were expecting to see pressure just in normal course of events in 2011. So in some respect, we're not going to be as dramatically hit by their all other price increases. So I think as we look out, it's a little early for us to get too granular and specific about 2011, but our outlook at this far and advance, using all of the information we have and the outlook for pressures in Europe, is pretty consistent with what we've seen. Their expectation is in line with our plans, what we think the growth of revenue will be over the next five years. So again, these are tough times out there, but our team in each individual market, I think, are crafting a very unique and specific strategy to the market. It is part of our strategy. We have got to manage price and duration overtime, and there's nothing unusual in terms of what we were expecting and we're ready to manage the circumstances, though, it's certainly is a challenging environment, but we think 2011 initially looks pretty encouraging to us."

So as you have a very strong ramping new patients and you have increasing duration that, that bodes well for the future. So we always have to work very hard to ensure we have the best strategy and results in the U.S., but the trends are very positive there. In Europe, the underlying trends were very strong also on a comparative basis and market-to-market. There were some countries where growth was a little bit slower than it has been, where there've been pressure on budgets, not specifically price cuts but just authorities, hospital, leaders saying, ""Listen, where can we cut cost, just to produce some fiscal restraint. That's our bigger issue that the companies need the come to grips with the fiscal challenges they have. We're going to have to make sure that the value proposition of Celgene is very, very clearly delineated, that's one of the great success of the REVLIMID, that we have such a great value proposition and why continues to grow in all markets, and we saw in some market accelerating growth. The U.K., Canada were both very strong in the quarter. So I think we're going to continue to see some markets where we're going to be budgetary pressures on those where the duration and increasing market shares will offset that. So overall we feel very good about what's happening in Europe and the growth there will continue to be very strong over the next few years."

And we'll look for other compounds to use the nab technology to develop. So we're going to focus on the synergies up it, but also the growth opportunities of Abraxis.

Certainly, melphalan, prednisone is not a high-growth regimen generally in the myeloma population. So I think our own strategy of doing MMO-20, which is our big, largest Phase III trial in the myeloma market place, which really examines REVLIMID and dexamethasone versus the melphalan-based lidomide regimen, is really designed to say, ""Listen, if we are able to get the broadest label possible and all the data presented from all the clinical trial, that we were hopefully that physicians will have the full course of options to say, which specific patient would benefit best from  REVLIMID dexamethasone, which patient would benefit most from melphalan prednisone and REVLIMID or other theraphies. So I think we're getting a good range of data from multiple clinical trials, Phase III trial. Certainly the REVLIMID once have all the positive, positive results and we're optimistic that in the next year or two as we get the NO 20 data, we'll have even more information to give physician more guidance as to what is best for newly diagnosed myeloma patients. I think we're very encouraged by what MM-015 had an impact already in the marketplace. We're optimistic the impact that will have in the regulatory ability to expand the label.

We are very, very optimistic about the potential of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan and for all the reasons that we've discussed. And we're hopeful that you will keep your estimates as low as possible in the near term for us. But seriously, we think that the success -- it's important to do it properly with a strong education emphasis and ensure that people have a good positive experience because the potential for Japan is such and such an important market to us over the next few years. They want to do it right and do it with the right trajectory. But we're very optimistic about what potential is there. And I think since our last call or certainly through the last quarterly conference call, the very important Phase II pomalidomide trial is very rapidly finished accruing. And we'll hopefully look forward to that data as soon as it's available and there's a potential in the next three or four quarters, we'll see that data and that we'll initiate the Phase III trial in pomalidomide by the end of the year. So I have to tell you, when we think about priorities here as we think about the rest of this year and 2011, the acceleration of pomalidomide and making that available to the last refractory myeloma population and the myelofibrosis patient population is a critical corporate objective because it remains in that last refractory population a serious unmet medical need, it's an indication that we feel so strongly about the need to serve myeloma patients, so we're very encouraged by what we're seeing the results. As soon as we get the Phase II results, we'll share them and see how they can be used and we'll accelerate the Phase III trial and we're accruing the pivotal trial on myelofibrosis. So that really is hard to imagine in a higher priority for us than acceleration of pomalidomide development.

The second quarter was an outstanding quarter for Celgene across all functions and geographies. Our exceptional global team produced full of excellent operating results and achieved multiple significant milestones that has a potential to create meaningful benefits for patients and strong returns for shareholders for years to come. Early this morning, we announced record-financial results with total revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $850 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 50% year-over-year to $0.69. 
Before we review the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, I'd like to highlight several of the key strategic developments of the last three months. Though not yet completed, the announcement of Abraxis BioScience acquisition broadens our therapeutic focus into the solid tumor market. Their lead product, ABRAXANE, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the United States and international markets, has also shown significant promise in pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials. The transaction provides the opportunity for us to leverage our global, commercial, clinical and regulatory organizations and further strengthens our pipeline, which multiple candidates from the Abraxis' proprietary Nab Technology portfolio. 
Advancing our hematology pipeline is also a strategic imperative. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Hematology meetings in June, there were many presentations that highlighted important new data supporting our key products and programs. Perhaps the most significant data were results from three Phase III studies, demonstrating the substantial benefit achieved by multiple myeloma patients receiving continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
Our international expansion strategy continues to be an important growth driver for our products. On June 25, REVLIMID was approved in Japan for the treatment of second-line multiple myeloma. Governmental reimbursement was achieved in less than a month following approval, actually reflecting the importance of REVLIMID therapy in myeloma and a validation of the quality of the planning and execution of the Celgene team in Japan. 
We are now in the early stages of a thoughtfully-planned commercial launch in this, the second largest oncology market in the world. The investments we have made in Japan and in other international markets will enable us to capture the full value of REVLIMID and the many other opportunities in our pipeline in all major markets. 
During the quarter, substantial progress was achieved in advancing multiple pipeline programs, highlighted by the initiation of our first pivotal Phase III trial for our lead anti-inflammatory product, apremilast, in psoriatic arthritis, and the initiation of our Phase I cancer clinical study of our novel dual mTOR Kinase Inhibitor CC-223, a product of our research labs in San Diego. The significant progress in this quarter further strengthens our belief that sustained long-term growth comes best through an unwavering commitment to invest in multiple programs designed to produce breakthrough therapies for patients with serious unmet medical needs. I'd like now to hand the call over to Dave Gryska, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our second quarter financial results. Dave?"

Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter was $850 million, a 36% increase versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for second quarter was $323 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.69. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $821 million for the second quarter, up 38% from $596 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $587 million, an increase of 48% over second quarter of 2009. Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 43% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $98 million for the quarter, down 7% as compared to year-ago quarter.
The second quarter sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $351 million, representing an increase of 15% on a sequential-quarter basis, and a 44% increase when compared to second quarter of 2009. International sales were $236 million, representing an increase of 5% on a sequential-quarter basis and a 54% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.4%. Gross margins were slightly negatively impacted from the quarter by nonrecurring inventory manufacturing charges. It is important to note that inventory levels are virtually unchanged as compared to the first quarter. We continue to expect gross margins to be approximately 93% for the full year. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the second quarter was $202 million, an increase of 9% over the first quarter of 2010. We are continuing to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth. During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key development programs are valuing REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. 
In addition, we're continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in pre-clinical and early-stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in a range of $845 million to $865 million for the full year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-GAAP selling, general, administrative expenses were $197 million during the second quarter, an increase of approximately 5% from the first quarter of 2010. We now expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $675 million to $785 million for 2010, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID, VIDAZA and our patient support programs in the U.S.
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 18%. This improvement in the tax rate is the result of a onetime benefit from the settlement related to state taxes. We expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve to approximately 19.5% for the year. 
As you were aware, we hedged our balance sheet, foreign currency exposures in our company, foreign-currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses based on foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on total revenue on a sequential-quarter basis was immaterial. We are well-positioned with our hedging programs to minimize the volatility of various foreign currencies effects on our earnings for the year. In addition, during the second quarter, we realized approximately $5 million in hedging and re-evaluation losses, which are included in other income and expense.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock during the quarter. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion, up from a previous range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This update of revenue guidance does not include Abraxis BioScience. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.65 to $2.70, as compared to a range of $2.6 to $2.65 that was previously reported. We updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes approximately $0.05 dilution from the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience. 
In summary, we continue to execute on the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating leverage and efficiency, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goals in 2010 and beyond, and continue to deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his further update."

The operating results of the quarter were highlighted by strong REVLIMID revenue growth, with sales growing 48% year-over-year and 11% over the last quarter. Sales were up 15% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., with 4% sequential growth internationally. Many factors contributed to this excellent performance, most notably recent data highlighted at ASH, ASCO and EHA, all supporting continuous REVLIMID therapy. VIDAZA growth accelerated in the quarter. Year-over-year, global sales increased 43% with 10% growth quarter-over-quarter. Europe was the primary driver of this growth, and international sales now represent greater than 50% of total sales. 
In addition to new markets, label expansion has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June -- new markets are important to our expansion and growth. Label expansion also has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June, positive updated data from MM-015  was presented. The Phase III trial in newly diagnosed myeloma patient will be the backbone of our submission to European Regulatory Authorities later this year. 
As we deliver on our near-term value drivers, we're also focused on long-term value creation. We remain committed to maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID worldwide with pivotal studies ongoing in lymphoma, CLL, MDS and prostate cancer. Recently, we enrolled our first patients in our Phase III trial,  PSA-002, for apremilast and patients with psoriatic arthritis. We're optimistic that we'll be able to close the Abraxis acquisition in the coming two to three months. We look forward to updating you on our strategy for capitalizing on the opportunities and synergies of the combined companies, as we clear regulatory hurdles.
The fundamentals in our core Myeloma business remained very strong. Growth in the U.S. was driven by increasing new patient starts and duration gains. Our core European markets also produced robust results despite an increasingly challenging economic environment. Second-line market share increased to nearly 40% in the four major European markets where REVLIMID is reimbursed. In the United Kingdom, where REVLIMID is reimbursed in the third line, market share is over 50%. We're monitoring the environment closely and believe that our guidance appropriately reflects the current economic reality. 
In other international markets, we also saw a strong sequential growth and are making good progress. The approval in Japan represents the most significant commercial development in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of initiating a well-planned launch in Japan, which includes the introduction of our proprietary risk management system, RevMate, to nearly 250 sites across Japan. We believe that our long-term interest are best served by ensuring that hematologists in Japan are well educated on the effective and safe use of REVLIMID to ensure a positive first experience. A proper foundation will pay significant long-term dividends. 
Physician practice in oncology is data-driven. New data is the lifeblood of hematology/oncology products. In early June, data was presented for more than 100 posters and more than 20 oral presentations at the ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] and EHA [European Hematology Association] meetings. By every measure, these meetings were a great success for Celgene products. Data from three pivotal studies demonstrated the continuous treatment with REVLIMID for patients with multiple myeloma has the potential to become the standard of care. 
In addition, abstracts were presented to demonstrate REVLIMID's activity in lymphomas and leukemias, and exciting new data, our pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma was also highlighted. Based on the clinical and commercial potential of these results, we continue to accelerate the development of these products and indications as rapidly as possible. 
We believe that we're just seeing the beginning of the impact of the paradigm changing data that supports continuous use of REVLIMID. In the IFM and CALGB studies presented at ASCO, continuous REVLIMID therapy demonstrated unprecedented reductions in the risk of disease progression in the post-stem cell transplant setting, with 54% and 58% risk reduction respectively. A week later, updated data that included 70% of advanced MM-015 were presented at the EHA, and the results were consistent, a 58% reduced risk of overall progression in the non-stem cell transplant population. The data presented from the podium from MM-015 and the IFM and CALGB studies all illustrated the progression-free survival advantage of continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
The three Phase III studies represent a pillar of our myeloma strategy, the generation of supportive data for early and continuous treatment of the disease. In addition to MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies, other presentations at ASCO presented data demonstrating that REVLIMID, combined with dexamethasone, is a highly inactive induction therapy, and that REVLIMID may even represent an alternative to stem cell transplant in certain patient populations. 
We're continuing to develop our clinical strategy for the treatment of high-risk smoldering myeloma, while at the same time accelerating the development of pomalidomide for the treatment of relapsed/refractory myeloma, where studies have demonstrated a 50% response rate, representing the highest response rate of any single agent in relapsed/refractory disease. We're committed to improving the treatment options in all lines of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. 
Paradigm-changing data, increased market share and duration and global expansion, all of these factors contributed to the very strong results that were produced this past quarter. As we seek to broaden our labeled indication and as physicians become more aware of this new data, we're optimistic that our strong performance in this market will continue. 
VIDAZA also produced excellent results in the second quarter. International VIDAZA growth was particularly strong as we continue to establish a leadership position in major European countries and other key markets. In United States, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter, maintaining market share leadership. VIDAZA remains the only agent in this class worldwide that demonstrated survival advantage of MDS/AML. We have a number of ongoing studies to strengthen VIDAZA's role in the treatment of MDS and AML. 
Positive trends continue in the MDS del 5q market with REVLIMID. We're optimistic that we'll receive regulatory approval in Japan later this year and are on track for an MDS del 5q submission in Europe, soon after the MM-015 myeloma filing in Europe. 
The international launch of VIDAZA is ongoing, with global expansion and share gains, coupled with increasing duration, driving growth. Additional data on both REVLIMID and VIDAZA in MDS is expected at this year's American Society of Hematology Meeting in December. 
In addition to the outstanding REVLIMID data and multiple myeloma the was presented at ASCO, there were numerous other abstracts that highlighted the potential of REVLIMID and our broader hematology/oncology pipeline. Groundbreaking data from a study that evaluated the novel R2 [ph], REVLIMID plus Rituxan, combination of patients with follicular lymphoma, demonstrated 97% response rate, which included a complete response rate of 86% with duration now greater than six months. This represents a significant opportunity for REVLIMID in lymphoma, and we expect to begin a pivotal Celgene sponsor study in the coming months. 
We also recently initiated an adaptive design study in patients with diffuse large T-cell lymphoma. The concept for this study was based upon the differential response rate data seen in the biomarker defined subset of the patient population. In addition to these studies, we'll continue to maximize the potential of REVLIMID in lymphoma with additional pivotal studies of mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In leukemia, positive data was presented at ASCO that illustrates the potential of our pivotal CLL-008 trial, which is evaluating REVLIMID as a first-line therapy in elderly CLL patients. 
In addition to REVLIMID, our hematology/oncology pipeline has seven compounds in all stages of development. We expect to have results from our pivotal studies evaluating ISTODAX in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the next coming few weeks. 
With approximately 15 pivotal in Phase III trials from the hemo pipeline, there will be a steady flow of important new data for the next several years, leading to what we believe will be another five to 10 new indications in this period. I do look forward to our next presentation when we should be able to add Abraxane and the Abraxis pipeline to this slide. 
Speaking of Abraxis, we're on track with all of our regulatory filings related to the transaction. Both companies submitted the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings two weeks ago and the explore proxy statement was submitted earlier this morning. Once the filing is declared effective by the SEC, there will be an Abraxis shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. The transaction is expected to close shortly after that meeting. We do expect this transaction will close before our next conference call in late October and look forward to updating you on our progress and plans at that time. 
In addition to hematology/oncology discussions, we continue to feel a substantial portfolio of assets in our inflammation and immunology franchise. We now have six candidates in clinical development. This pipeline was a major focus at our R&D day in April, and it continues to make excellent progress since then. We're now initiating our first trial with ACE-011 in renal anemia, moving rapidly into Phase II in Crohn's Disease with our cellular therapy, PDA-001, and advancing our JNK inhibitor in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Our most advanced program is Apremilast. In just the past few weeks, we have dosed our first patients in PSA-002, the first of our pivotal trials. We have an extensive development program for Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis, moderate-to-severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and other serious immune/inflammatory diseases. All of our pivotal trials in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are targeted to be initiated before the end of this year. 
It was an exceptional quarter both in terms of financial and operating results and also in terms of positioning Celgene for the future. While producing strong bottom line results, we're also investing the future to sustain the success and high growth that we've achieved. We're executing on our plan and managing the challenges of healthcare reform in the U.S. and budgetary pressures in the EU, while making the sound strategic decisions to extend our capabilities around the world and to expand therapeutic franchises that capitalize on our existing strengths. 
As we close, I want to recognize and thank the Celgene team worldwide, who all contributed to these extraordinary results of this past quarter, superb results achieved in the challenging global economy. It's their dedication, their passion for the patient, their creativity and expertise that make us so optimistic about the future. Thank you for joining this morning, and we look forward to answer your questions. So operator, please, you can now open the call to questions."

With the uncertainty in the marketplace, we certainly wanted to increase the guidance, the second quarter in a row. So the guidance for the year, the beginning of the year, has turned out so far to be fairly conservative.

Japan is a market with a very, very significant sensitivity to past effects of drugs, with birth defects, and overall, end market, very sensitive to side effect management. And so we're being very prudent here to ensure that we've got the right risk management system. It's something that we've developed, and our team has developed in very strong concert with important other constituencies in Japan, including the ministry and patient groups, et cetera. So it's been thoughtfully done. It's well planned out. We do not think it will have any long-term negative impediment. We've got people confidence that it's a very safe system and its going to be well controlled and managed. That being said, putting the risk management system aside, Japan is a great market, and REVLIMID is spectacularly well-situated compound that fit extraordinarily well with the conditions in market of Japan. At oral therapy with very manageable side effects with strong effectiveness demonstrated in the labeled indication. And so that's very important for us to establish Japan early on and make sure that physicians are very comfortable with having administrative drugs, how to safely do it, how to manage the side effects. And that's the marketplace that you establish a strong initial presence and physicians are comfortable with having used the drug with the initial one, two, three patients. You're going to see a very rapid uptake over the longer term. But in the near term, even we're talking about, we want to make sure that people don't get overly enthusiastic to see a dramatic ramp. We're playing Japan and we're positioning ourself for very strong long term excellent performance. But we're going to do it the right way to ensure education is there, good solid risk management systems so that physicians, patients and the government and we are all comfortable that it's being done in a very prudent manner. And that's not to say that we are just incredibly excited about having the approval on June 25, and to get pricing and reimbursement in such a short period of time really does reflect, I think, a few things. One, the importance of the new therapy for myeloma in Japan, the need for REVLIMID to get out to patients and also, I think, the execution, the planning, the strategy of our Celgene team in Japan to produce that in such a short period of time. So we're excited, but we're going to do it in the best way position for long-term success."

That was the only meaningful event in the second quarter. Clearly, people are focused on Germany for later this year with a 10% increase in the rebate in Germany, and the specifics of that is still being finalized but that looks pretty clear. I mean, as we lookout past 2010, our marketplace -- we'd look at it country by country and clearly, there's lots of pressure. I think the impact is more on just budgetary pressures, less on specific price declines but we're going to see continued price decline and that's the reason why when we started REVLIMID internationally, we established the benchmark price that we did. And so on our regional forecast, we were expecting to see pressure just in normal course of events in 2011. So in some respect, we're not going to be as dramatically hit by their all other price increases. So I think as we look out, it's a little early for us to get too granular and specific about 2011, but our outlook at this far and advance, using all of the information we have and the outlook for pressures in Europe, is pretty consistent with what we've seen. Their expectation is in line with our plans, what we think the growth of revenue will be over the next five years. So again, these are tough times out there, but our team in each individual market, I think, are crafting a very unique and specific strategy to the market. It is part of our strategy. We have got to manage price and duration overtime, and there's nothing unusual in terms of what we were expecting and we're ready to manage the circumstances, though, it's certainly is a challenging environment, but we think 2011 initially looks pretty encouraging to us."

So as you have a very strong ramping new patients and you have increasing duration that, that bodes well for the future. So we always have to work very hard to ensure we have the best strategy and results in the U.S., but the trends are very positive there. In Europe, the underlying trends were very strong also on a comparative basis and market-to-market. There were some countries where growth was a little bit slower than it has been, where there've been pressure on budgets, not specifically price cuts but just authorities, hospital, leaders saying, ""Listen, where can we cut cost, just to produce some fiscal restraint. That's our bigger issue that the companies need the come to grips with the fiscal challenges they have. We're going to have to make sure that the value proposition of Celgene is very, very clearly delineated, that's one of the great success of the REVLIMID, that we have such a great value proposition and why continues to grow in all markets, and we saw in some market accelerating growth. The U.K., Canada were both very strong in the quarter. So I think we're going to continue to see some markets where we're going to be budgetary pressures on those where the duration and increasing market shares will offset that. So overall we feel very good about what's happening in Europe and the growth there will continue to be very strong over the next few years."

And we'll look for other compounds to use the nab technology to develop. So we're going to focus on the synergies up it, but also the growth opportunities of Abraxis.

Certainly, melphalan, prednisone is not a high-growth regimen generally in the myeloma population. So I think our own strategy of doing MMO-20, which is our big, largest Phase III trial in the myeloma market place, which really examines REVLIMID and dexamethasone versus the melphalan-based lidomide regimen, is really designed to say, ""Listen, if we are able to get the broadest label possible and all the data presented from all the clinical trial, that we were hopefully that physicians will have the full course of options to say, which specific patient would benefit best from  REVLIMID dexamethasone, which patient would benefit most from melphalan prednisone and REVLIMID or other theraphies. So I think we're getting a good range of data from multiple clinical trials, Phase III trial. Certainly the REVLIMID once have all the positive, positive results and we're optimistic that in the next year or two as we get the NO 20 data, we'll have even more information to give physician more guidance as to what is best for newly diagnosed myeloma patients. I think we're very encouraged by what MM-015 had an impact already in the marketplace. We're optimistic the impact that will have in the regulatory ability to expand the label.

We are very, very optimistic about the potential of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan and for all the reasons that we've discussed. And we're hopeful that you will keep your estimates as low as possible in the near term for us. But seriously, we think that the success -- it's important to do it properly with a strong education emphasis and ensure that people have a good positive experience because the potential for Japan is such and such an important market to us over the next few years. They want to do it right and do it with the right trajectory. But we're very optimistic about what potential is there. And I think since our last call or certainly through the last quarterly conference call, the very important Phase II pomalidomide trial is very rapidly finished accruing. And we'll hopefully look forward to that data as soon as it's available and there's a potential in the next three or four quarters, we'll see that data and that we'll initiate the Phase III trial in pomalidomide by the end of the year. So I have to tell you, when we think about priorities here as we think about the rest of this year and 2011, the acceleration of pomalidomide and making that available to the last refractory myeloma population and the myelofibrosis patient population is a critical corporate objective because it remains in that last refractory population a serious unmet medical need, it's an indication that we feel so strongly about the need to serve myeloma patients, so we're very encouraged by what we're seeing the results. As soon as we get the Phase II results, we'll share them and see how they can be used and we'll accelerate the Phase III trial and we're accruing the pivotal trial on myelofibrosis. So that really is hard to imagine in a higher priority for us than acceleration of pomalidomide development.

The second quarter was an outstanding quarter for Celgene across all functions and geographies. Our exceptional global team produced full of excellent operating results and achieved multiple significant milestones that has a potential to create meaningful benefits for patients and strong returns for shareholders for years to come. Early this morning, we announced record-financial results with total revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $850 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 50% year-over-year to $0.69. 
Before we review the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, I'd like to highlight several of the key strategic developments of the last three months. Though not yet completed, the announcement of Abraxis BioScience acquisition broadens our therapeutic focus into the solid tumor market. Their lead product, ABRAXANE, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the United States and international markets, has also shown significant promise in pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials. The transaction provides the opportunity for us to leverage our global, commercial, clinical and regulatory organizations and further strengthens our pipeline, which multiple candidates from the Abraxis' proprietary Nab Technology portfolio. 
Advancing our hematology pipeline is also a strategic imperative. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Hematology meetings in June, there were many presentations that highlighted important new data supporting our key products and programs. Perhaps the most significant data were results from three Phase III studies, demonstrating the substantial benefit achieved by multiple myeloma patients receiving continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
Our international expansion strategy continues to be an important growth driver for our products. On June 25, REVLIMID was approved in Japan for the treatment of second-line multiple myeloma. Governmental reimbursement was achieved in less than a month following approval, actually reflecting the importance of REVLIMID therapy in myeloma and a validation of the quality of the planning and execution of the Celgene team in Japan. 
We are now in the early stages of a thoughtfully-planned commercial launch in this, the second largest oncology market in the world. The investments we have made in Japan and in other international markets will enable us to capture the full value of REVLIMID and the many other opportunities in our pipeline in all major markets. 
During the quarter, substantial progress was achieved in advancing multiple pipeline programs, highlighted by the initiation of our first pivotal Phase III trial for our lead anti-inflammatory product, apremilast, in psoriatic arthritis, and the initiation of our Phase I cancer clinical study of our novel dual mTOR Kinase Inhibitor CC-223, a product of our research labs in San Diego. The significant progress in this quarter further strengthens our belief that sustained long-term growth comes best through an unwavering commitment to invest in multiple programs designed to produce breakthrough therapies for patients with serious unmet medical needs. I'd like now to hand the call over to Dave Gryska, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our second quarter financial results. Dave?"

Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter was $850 million, a 36% increase versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for second quarter was $323 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.69. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $821 million for the second quarter, up 38% from $596 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $587 million, an increase of 48% over second quarter of 2009. Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 43% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $98 million for the quarter, down 7% as compared to year-ago quarter.
The second quarter sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $351 million, representing an increase of 15% on a sequential-quarter basis, and a 44% increase when compared to second quarter of 2009. International sales were $236 million, representing an increase of 5% on a sequential-quarter basis and a 54% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.4%. Gross margins were slightly negatively impacted from the quarter by nonrecurring inventory manufacturing charges. It is important to note that inventory levels are virtually unchanged as compared to the first quarter. We continue to expect gross margins to be approximately 93% for the full year. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the second quarter was $202 million, an increase of 9% over the first quarter of 2010. We are continuing to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth. During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key development programs are valuing REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. 
In addition, we're continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in pre-clinical and early-stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in a range of $845 million to $865 million for the full year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-GAAP selling, general, administrative expenses were $197 million during the second quarter, an increase of approximately 5% from the first quarter of 2010. We now expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $675 million to $785 million for 2010, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID, VIDAZA and our patient support programs in the U.S.
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 18%. This improvement in the tax rate is the result of a onetime benefit from the settlement related to state taxes. We expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve to approximately 19.5% for the year. 
As you were aware, we hedged our balance sheet, foreign currency exposures in our company, foreign-currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses based on foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on total revenue on a sequential-quarter basis was immaterial. We are well-positioned with our hedging programs to minimize the volatility of various foreign currencies effects on our earnings for the year. In addition, during the second quarter, we realized approximately $5 million in hedging and re-evaluation losses, which are included in other income and expense.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock during the quarter. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion, up from a previous range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This update of revenue guidance does not include Abraxis BioScience. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.65 to $2.70, as compared to a range of $2.6 to $2.65 that was previously reported. We updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes approximately $0.05 dilution from the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience. 
In summary, we continue to execute on the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating leverage and efficiency, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goals in 2010 and beyond, and continue to deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his further update."

The operating results of the quarter were highlighted by strong REVLIMID revenue growth, with sales growing 48% year-over-year and 11% over the last quarter. Sales were up 15% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., with 4% sequential growth internationally. Many factors contributed to this excellent performance, most notably recent data highlighted at ASH, ASCO and EHA, all supporting continuous REVLIMID therapy. VIDAZA growth accelerated in the quarter. Year-over-year, global sales increased 43% with 10% growth quarter-over-quarter. Europe was the primary driver of this growth, and international sales now represent greater than 50% of total sales. 
In addition to new markets, label expansion has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June -- new markets are important to our expansion and growth. Label expansion also has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June, positive updated data from MM-015  was presented. The Phase III trial in newly diagnosed myeloma patient will be the backbone of our submission to European Regulatory Authorities later this year. 
As we deliver on our near-term value drivers, we're also focused on long-term value creation. We remain committed to maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID worldwide with pivotal studies ongoing in lymphoma, CLL, MDS and prostate cancer. Recently, we enrolled our first patients in our Phase III trial,  PSA-002, for apremilast and patients with psoriatic arthritis. We're optimistic that we'll be able to close the Abraxis acquisition in the coming two to three months. We look forward to updating you on our strategy for capitalizing on the opportunities and synergies of the combined companies, as we clear regulatory hurdles.
The fundamentals in our core Myeloma business remained very strong. Growth in the U.S. was driven by increasing new patient starts and duration gains. Our core European markets also produced robust results despite an increasingly challenging economic environment. Second-line market share increased to nearly 40% in the four major European markets where REVLIMID is reimbursed. In the United Kingdom, where REVLIMID is reimbursed in the third line, market share is over 50%. We're monitoring the environment closely and believe that our guidance appropriately reflects the current economic reality. 
In other international markets, we also saw a strong sequential growth and are making good progress. The approval in Japan represents the most significant commercial development in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of initiating a well-planned launch in Japan, which includes the introduction of our proprietary risk management system, RevMate, to nearly 250 sites across Japan. We believe that our long-term interest are best served by ensuring that hematologists in Japan are well educated on the effective and safe use of REVLIMID to ensure a positive first experience. A proper foundation will pay significant long-term dividends. 
Physician practice in oncology is data-driven. New data is the lifeblood of hematology/oncology products. In early June, data was presented for more than 100 posters and more than 20 oral presentations at the ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] and EHA [European Hematology Association] meetings. By every measure, these meetings were a great success for Celgene products. Data from three pivotal studies demonstrated the continuous treatment with REVLIMID for patients with multiple myeloma has the potential to become the standard of care. 
In addition, abstracts were presented to demonstrate REVLIMID's activity in lymphomas and leukemias, and exciting new data, our pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma was also highlighted. Based on the clinical and commercial potential of these results, we continue to accelerate the development of these products and indications as rapidly as possible. 
We believe that we're just seeing the beginning of the impact of the paradigm changing data that supports continuous use of REVLIMID. In the IFM and CALGB studies presented at ASCO, continuous REVLIMID therapy demonstrated unprecedented reductions in the risk of disease progression in the post-stem cell transplant setting, with 54% and 58% risk reduction respectively. A week later, updated data that included 70% of advanced MM-015 were presented at the EHA, and the results were consistent, a 58% reduced risk of overall progression in the non-stem cell transplant population. The data presented from the podium from MM-015 and the IFM and CALGB studies all illustrated the progression-free survival advantage of continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
The three Phase III studies represent a pillar of our myeloma strategy, the generation of supportive data for early and continuous treatment of the disease. In addition to MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies, other presentations at ASCO presented data demonstrating that REVLIMID, combined with dexamethasone, is a highly inactive induction therapy, and that REVLIMID may even represent an alternative to stem cell transplant in certain patient populations. 
We're continuing to develop our clinical strategy for the treatment of high-risk smoldering myeloma, while at the same time accelerating the development of pomalidomide for the treatment of relapsed/refractory myeloma, where studies have demonstrated a 50% response rate, representing the highest response rate of any single agent in relapsed/refractory disease. We're committed to improving the treatment options in all lines of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. 
Paradigm-changing data, increased market share and duration and global expansion, all of these factors contributed to the very strong results that were produced this past quarter. As we seek to broaden our labeled indication and as physicians become more aware of this new data, we're optimistic that our strong performance in this market will continue. 
VIDAZA also produced excellent results in the second quarter. International VIDAZA growth was particularly strong as we continue to establish a leadership position in major European countries and other key markets. In United States, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter, maintaining market share leadership. VIDAZA remains the only agent in this class worldwide that demonstrated survival advantage of MDS/AML. We have a number of ongoing studies to strengthen VIDAZA's role in the treatment of MDS and AML. 
Positive trends continue in the MDS del 5q market with REVLIMID. We're optimistic that we'll receive regulatory approval in Japan later this year and are on track for an MDS del 5q submission in Europe, soon after the MM-015 myeloma filing in Europe. 
The international launch of VIDAZA is ongoing, with global expansion and share gains, coupled with increasing duration, driving growth. Additional data on both REVLIMID and VIDAZA in MDS is expected at this year's American Society of Hematology Meeting in December. 
In addition to the outstanding REVLIMID data and multiple myeloma the was presented at ASCO, there were numerous other abstracts that highlighted the potential of REVLIMID and our broader hematology/oncology pipeline. Groundbreaking data from a study that evaluated the novel R2 [ph], REVLIMID plus Rituxan, combination of patients with follicular lymphoma, demonstrated 97% response rate, which included a complete response rate of 86% with duration now greater than six months. This represents a significant opportunity for REVLIMID in lymphoma, and we expect to begin a pivotal Celgene sponsor study in the coming months. 
We also recently initiated an adaptive design study in patients with diffuse large T-cell lymphoma. The concept for this study was based upon the differential response rate data seen in the biomarker defined subset of the patient population. In addition to these studies, we'll continue to maximize the potential of REVLIMID in lymphoma with additional pivotal studies of mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In leukemia, positive data was presented at ASCO that illustrates the potential of our pivotal CLL-008 trial, which is evaluating REVLIMID as a first-line therapy in elderly CLL patients. 
In addition to REVLIMID, our hematology/oncology pipeline has seven compounds in all stages of development. We expect to have results from our pivotal studies evaluating ISTODAX in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the next coming few weeks. 
With approximately 15 pivotal in Phase III trials from the hemo pipeline, there will be a steady flow of important new data for the next several years, leading to what we believe will be another five to 10 new indications in this period. I do look forward to our next presentation when we should be able to add Abraxane and the Abraxis pipeline to this slide. 
Speaking of Abraxis, we're on track with all of our regulatory filings related to the transaction. Both companies submitted the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings two weeks ago and the explore proxy statement was submitted earlier this morning. Once the filing is declared effective by the SEC, there will be an Abraxis shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. The transaction is expected to close shortly after that meeting. We do expect this transaction will close before our next conference call in late October and look forward to updating you on our progress and plans at that time. 
In addition to hematology/oncology discussions, we continue to feel a substantial portfolio of assets in our inflammation and immunology franchise. We now have six candidates in clinical development. This pipeline was a major focus at our R&D day in April, and it continues to make excellent progress since then. We're now initiating our first trial with ACE-011 in renal anemia, moving rapidly into Phase II in Crohn's Disease with our cellular therapy, PDA-001, and advancing our JNK inhibitor in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Our most advanced program is Apremilast. In just the past few weeks, we have dosed our first patients in PSA-002, the first of our pivotal trials. We have an extensive development program for Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis, moderate-to-severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and other serious immune/inflammatory diseases. All of our pivotal trials in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are targeted to be initiated before the end of this year. 
It was an exceptional quarter both in terms of financial and operating results and also in terms of positioning Celgene for the future. While producing strong bottom line results, we're also investing the future to sustain the success and high growth that we've achieved. We're executing on our plan and managing the challenges of healthcare reform in the U.S. and budgetary pressures in the EU, while making the sound strategic decisions to extend our capabilities around the world and to expand therapeutic franchises that capitalize on our existing strengths. 
As we close, I want to recognize and thank the Celgene team worldwide, who all contributed to these extraordinary results of this past quarter, superb results achieved in the challenging global economy. It's their dedication, their passion for the patient, their creativity and expertise that make us so optimistic about the future. Thank you for joining this morning, and we look forward to answer your questions. So operator, please, you can now open the call to questions."

Japan is a market with a very, very significant sensitivity to past effects of drugs, with birth defects, and overall, end market, very sensitive to side effect management. And so we're being very prudent here to ensure that we've got the right risk management system. It's something that we've developed, and our team has developed in very strong concert with important other constituencies in Japan, including the ministry and patient groups, et cetera. So it's been thoughtfully done. It's well planned out. We do not think it will have any long-term negative impediment. We've got people confidence that it's a very safe system and its going to be well controlled and managed. That being said, putting the risk management system aside, Japan is a great market, and REVLIMID is spectacularly well-situated compound that fit extraordinarily well with the conditions in market of Japan. At oral therapy with very manageable side effects with strong effectiveness demonstrated in the labeled indication. And so that's very important for us to establish Japan early on and make sure that physicians are very comfortable with having administrative drugs, how to safely do it, how to manage the side effects. And that's the marketplace that you establish a strong initial presence and physicians are comfortable with having used the drug with the initial one, two, three patients. You're going to see a very rapid uptake over the longer term. But in the near term, even we're talking about, we want to make sure that people don't get overly enthusiastic to see a dramatic ramp. We're playing Japan and we're positioning ourself for very strong long term excellent performance. But we're going to do it the right way to ensure education is there, good solid risk management systems so that physicians, patients and the government and we are all comfortable that it's being done in a very prudent manner. And that's not to say that we are just incredibly excited about having the approval on June 25, and to get pricing and reimbursement in such a short period of time really does reflect, I think, a few things. One, the importance of the new therapy for myeloma in Japan, the need for REVLIMID to get out to patients and also, I think, the execution, the planning, the strategy of our Celgene team in Japan to produce that in such a short period of time. So we're excited, but we're going to do it in the best way position for long-term success."

That was the only meaningful event in the second quarter. Clearly, people are focused on Germany for later this year with a 10% increase in the rebate in Germany, and the specifics of that is still being finalized but that looks pretty clear. I mean, as we lookout past 2010, our marketplace -- we'd look at it country by country and clearly, there's lots of pressure. I think the impact is more on just budgetary pressures, less on specific price declines but we're going to see continued price decline and that's the reason why when we started REVLIMID internationally, we established the benchmark price that we did. And so on our regional forecast, we were expecting to see pressure just in normal course of events in 2011. So in some respect, we're not going to be as dramatically hit by their all other price increases. So I think as we look out, it's a little early for us to get too granular and specific about 2011, but our outlook at this far and advance, using all of the information we have and the outlook for pressures in Europe, is pretty consistent with what we've seen. Their expectation is in line with our plans, what we think the growth of revenue will be over the next five years. So again, these are tough times out there, but our team in each individual market, I think, are crafting a very unique and specific strategy to the market. It is part of our strategy. We have got to manage price and duration overtime, and there's nothing unusual in terms of what we were expecting and we're ready to manage the circumstances, though, it's certainly is a challenging environment, but we think 2011 initially looks pretty encouraging to us."

So as you have a very strong ramping new patients and you have increasing duration that, that bodes well for the future. So we always have to work very hard to ensure we have the best strategy and results in the U.S., but the trends are very positive there. In Europe, the underlying trends were very strong also on a comparative basis and market-to-market. There were some countries where growth was a little bit slower than it has been, where there've been pressure on budgets, not specifically price cuts but just authorities, hospital, leaders saying, ""Listen, where can we cut cost, just to produce some fiscal restraint. That's our bigger issue that the companies need the come to grips with the fiscal challenges they have. We're going to have to make sure that the value proposition of Celgene is very, very clearly delineated, that's one of the great success of the REVLIMID, that we have such a great value proposition and why continues to grow in all markets, and we saw in some market accelerating growth. The U.K., Canada were both very strong in the quarter. So I think we're going to continue to see some markets where we're going to be budgetary pressures on those where the duration and increasing market shares will offset that. So overall we feel very good about what's happening in Europe and the growth there will continue to be very strong over the next few years."

And we'll look for other compounds to use the nab technology to develop. So we're going to focus on the synergies up it, but also the growth opportunities of Abraxis.

Certainly, melphalan, prednisone is not a high-growth regimen generally in the myeloma population. So I think our own strategy of doing MMO-20, which is our big, largest Phase III trial in the myeloma market place, which really examines REVLIMID and dexamethasone versus the melphalan-based lidomide regimen, is really designed to say, ""Listen, if we are able to get the broadest label possible and all the data presented from all the clinical trial, that we were hopefully that physicians will have the full course of options to say, which specific patient would benefit best from  REVLIMID dexamethasone, which patient would benefit most from melphalan prednisone and REVLIMID or other theraphies. So I think we're getting a good range of data from multiple clinical trials, Phase III trial. Certainly the REVLIMID once have all the positive, positive results and we're optimistic that in the next year or two as we get the NO 20 data, we'll have even more information to give physician more guidance as to what is best for newly diagnosed myeloma patients. I think we're very encouraged by what MM-015 had an impact already in the marketplace. We're optimistic the impact that will have in the regulatory ability to expand the label.

We are very, very optimistic about the potential of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan and for all the reasons that we've discussed. And we're hopeful that you will keep your estimates as low as possible in the near term for us. But seriously, we think that the success -- it's important to do it properly with a strong education emphasis and ensure that people have a good positive experience because the potential for Japan is such and such an important market to us over the next few years. They want to do it right and do it with the right trajectory. But we're very optimistic about what potential is there. And I think since our last call or certainly through the last quarterly conference call, the very important Phase II pomalidomide trial is very rapidly finished accruing. And we'll hopefully look forward to that data as soon as it's available and there's a potential in the next three or four quarters, we'll see that data and that we'll initiate the Phase III trial in pomalidomide by the end of the year. So I have to tell you, when we think about priorities here as we think about the rest of this year and 2011, the acceleration of pomalidomide and making that available to the last refractory myeloma population and the myelofibrosis patient population is a critical corporate objective because it remains in that last refractory population a serious unmet medical need, it's an indication that we feel so strongly about the need to serve myeloma patients, so we're very encouraged by what we're seeing the results. As soon as we get the Phase II results, we'll share them and see how they can be used and we'll accelerate the Phase III trial and we're accruing the pivotal trial on myelofibrosis. So that really is hard to imagine in a higher priority for us than acceleration of pomalidomide development.

The second quarter was an outstanding quarter for Celgene across all functions and geographies. Our exceptional global team produced full of excellent operating results and achieved multiple significant milestones that has a potential to create meaningful benefits for patients and strong returns for shareholders for years to come. Early this morning, we announced record-financial results with total revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $850 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 50% year-over-year to $0.69. 
Before we review the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, I'd like to highlight several of the key strategic developments of the last three months. Though not yet completed, the announcement of Abraxis BioScience acquisition broadens our therapeutic focus into the solid tumor market. Their lead product, ABRAXANE, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the United States and international markets, has also shown significant promise in pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials. The transaction provides the opportunity for us to leverage our global, commercial, clinical and regulatory organizations and further strengthens our pipeline, which multiple candidates from the Abraxis' proprietary Nab Technology portfolio. 
Advancing our hematology pipeline is also a strategic imperative. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Hematology meetings in June, there were many presentations that highlighted important new data supporting our key products and programs. Perhaps the most significant data were results from three Phase III studies, demonstrating the substantial benefit achieved by multiple myeloma patients receiving continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
Our international expansion strategy continues to be an important growth driver for our products. On June 25, REVLIMID was approved in Japan for the treatment of second-line multiple myeloma. Governmental reimbursement was achieved in less than a month following approval, actually reflecting the importance of REVLIMID therapy in myeloma and a validation of the quality of the planning and execution of the Celgene team in Japan. 
We are now in the early stages of a thoughtfully-planned commercial launch in this, the second largest oncology market in the world. The investments we have made in Japan and in other international markets will enable us to capture the full value of REVLIMID and the many other opportunities in our pipeline in all major markets. 
During the quarter, substantial progress was achieved in advancing multiple pipeline programs, highlighted by the initiation of our first pivotal Phase III trial for our lead anti-inflammatory product, apremilast, in psoriatic arthritis, and the initiation of our Phase I cancer clinical study of our novel dual mTOR Kinase Inhibitor CC-223, a product of our research labs in San Diego. The significant progress in this quarter further strengthens our belief that sustained long-term growth comes best through an unwavering commitment to invest in multiple programs designed to produce breakthrough therapies for patients with serious unmet medical needs. I'd like now to hand the call over to Dave Gryska, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our second quarter financial results. Dave?"

Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter was $850 million, a 36% increase versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for second quarter was $323 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.69. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $821 million for the second quarter, up 38% from $596 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $587 million, an increase of 48% over second quarter of 2009. Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 43% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $98 million for the quarter, down 7% as compared to year-ago quarter.
The second quarter sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $351 million, representing an increase of 15% on a sequential-quarter basis, and a 44% increase when compared to second quarter of 2009. International sales were $236 million, representing an increase of 5% on a sequential-quarter basis and a 54% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.4%. Gross margins were slightly negatively impacted from the quarter by nonrecurring inventory manufacturing charges. It is important to note that inventory levels are virtually unchanged as compared to the first quarter. We continue to expect gross margins to be approximately 93% for the full year. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense during the second quarter was $202 million, an increase of 9% over the first quarter of 2010. We are continuing to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth. During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key development programs are valuing REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. 
In addition, we're continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in pre-clinical and early-stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in a range of $845 million to $865 million for the full year.
Taking a look at SG&A, non-GAAP selling, general, administrative expenses were $197 million during the second quarter, an increase of approximately 5% from the first quarter of 2010. We now expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $675 million to $785 million for 2010, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID, VIDAZA and our patient support programs in the U.S.
Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 18%. This improvement in the tax rate is the result of a onetime benefit from the settlement related to state taxes. We expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve to approximately 19.5% for the year. 
As you were aware, we hedged our balance sheet, foreign currency exposures in our company, foreign-currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue expenses based on foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on total revenue on a sequential-quarter basis was immaterial. We are well-positioned with our hedging programs to minimize the volatility of various foreign currencies effects on our earnings for the year. In addition, during the second quarter, we realized approximately $5 million in hedging and re-evaluation losses, which are included in other income and expense.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock during the quarter. We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion, up from a previous range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This update of revenue guidance does not include Abraxis BioScience. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of $2.65 to $2.70, as compared to a range of $2.6 to $2.65 that was previously reported. We updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes approximately $0.05 dilution from the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience. 
In summary, we continue to execute on the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating leverage and efficiency, as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well-positioned to achieve our goals in 2010 and beyond, and continue to deliver record operating results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his further update."

The operating results of the quarter were highlighted by strong REVLIMID revenue growth, with sales growing 48% year-over-year and 11% over the last quarter. Sales were up 15% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., with 4% sequential growth internationally. Many factors contributed to this excellent performance, most notably recent data highlighted at ASH, ASCO and EHA, all supporting continuous REVLIMID therapy. VIDAZA growth accelerated in the quarter. Year-over-year, global sales increased 43% with 10% growth quarter-over-quarter. Europe was the primary driver of this growth, and international sales now represent greater than 50% of total sales. 
In addition to new markets, label expansion has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June -- new markets are important to our expansion and growth. Label expansion also has a potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June, positive updated data from MM-015  was presented. The Phase III trial in newly diagnosed myeloma patient will be the backbone of our submission to European Regulatory Authorities later this year. 
As we deliver on our near-term value drivers, we're also focused on long-term value creation. We remain committed to maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID worldwide with pivotal studies ongoing in lymphoma, CLL, MDS and prostate cancer. Recently, we enrolled our first patients in our Phase III trial,  PSA-002, for apremilast and patients with psoriatic arthritis. We're optimistic that we'll be able to close the Abraxis acquisition in the coming two to three months. We look forward to updating you on our strategy for capitalizing on the opportunities and synergies of the combined companies, as we clear regulatory hurdles.
The fundamentals in our core Myeloma business remained very strong. Growth in the U.S. was driven by increasing new patient starts and duration gains. Our core European markets also produced robust results despite an increasingly challenging economic environment. Second-line market share increased to nearly 40% in the four major European markets where REVLIMID is reimbursed. In the United Kingdom, where REVLIMID is reimbursed in the third line, market share is over 50%. We're monitoring the environment closely and believe that our guidance appropriately reflects the current economic reality. 
In other international markets, we also saw a strong sequential growth and are making good progress. The approval in Japan represents the most significant commercial development in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of initiating a well-planned launch in Japan, which includes the introduction of our proprietary risk management system, RevMate, to nearly 250 sites across Japan. We believe that our long-term interest are best served by ensuring that hematologists in Japan are well educated on the effective and safe use of REVLIMID to ensure a positive first experience. A proper foundation will pay significant long-term dividends. 
Physician practice in oncology is data-driven. New data is the lifeblood of hematology/oncology products. In early June, data was presented for more than 100 posters and more than 20 oral presentations at the ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] and EHA [European Hematology Association] meetings. By every measure, these meetings were a great success for Celgene products. Data from three pivotal studies demonstrated the continuous treatment with REVLIMID for patients with multiple myeloma has the potential to become the standard of care. 
In addition, abstracts were presented to demonstrate REVLIMID's activity in lymphomas and leukemias, and exciting new data, our pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma was also highlighted. Based on the clinical and commercial potential of these results, we continue to accelerate the development of these products and indications as rapidly as possible. 
We believe that we're just seeing the beginning of the impact of the paradigm changing data that supports continuous use of REVLIMID. In the IFM and CALGB studies presented at ASCO, continuous REVLIMID therapy demonstrated unprecedented reductions in the risk of disease progression in the post-stem cell transplant setting, with 54% and 58% risk reduction respectively. A week later, updated data that included 70% of advanced MM-015 were presented at the EHA, and the results were consistent, a 58% reduced risk of overall progression in the non-stem cell transplant population. The data presented from the podium from MM-015 and the IFM and CALGB studies all illustrated the progression-free survival advantage of continuous REVLIMID therapy. 
The three Phase III studies represent a pillar of our myeloma strategy, the generation of supportive data for early and continuous treatment of the disease. In addition to MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies, other presentations at ASCO presented data demonstrating that REVLIMID, combined with dexamethasone, is a highly inactive induction therapy, and that REVLIMID may even represent an alternative to stem cell transplant in certain patient populations. 
We're continuing to develop our clinical strategy for the treatment of high-risk smoldering myeloma, while at the same time accelerating the development of pomalidomide for the treatment of relapsed/refractory myeloma, where studies have demonstrated a 50% response rate, representing the highest response rate of any single agent in relapsed/refractory disease. We're committed to improving the treatment options in all lines of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. 
Paradigm-changing data, increased market share and duration and global expansion, all of these factors contributed to the very strong results that were produced this past quarter. As we seek to broaden our labeled indication and as physicians become more aware of this new data, we're optimistic that our strong performance in this market will continue. 
VIDAZA also produced excellent results in the second quarter. International VIDAZA growth was particularly strong as we continue to establish a leadership position in major European countries and other key markets. In United States, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter, maintaining market share leadership. VIDAZA remains the only agent in this class worldwide that demonstrated survival advantage of MDS/AML. We have a number of ongoing studies to strengthen VIDAZA's role in the treatment of MDS and AML. 
Positive trends continue in the MDS del 5q market with REVLIMID. We're optimistic that we'll receive regulatory approval in Japan later this year and are on track for an MDS del 5q submission in Europe, soon after the MM-015 myeloma filing in Europe. 
The international launch of VIDAZA is ongoing, with global expansion and share gains, coupled with increasing duration, driving growth. Additional data on both REVLIMID and VIDAZA in MDS is expected at this year's American Society of Hematology Meeting in December. 
In addition to the outstanding REVLIMID data and multiple myeloma the was presented at ASCO, there were numerous other abstracts that highlighted the potential of REVLIMID and our broader hematology/oncology pipeline. Groundbreaking data from a study that evaluated the novel R2 [ph], REVLIMID plus Rituxan, combination of patients with follicular lymphoma, demonstrated 97% response rate, which included a complete response rate of 86% with duration now greater than six months. This represents a significant opportunity for REVLIMID in lymphoma, and we expect to begin a pivotal Celgene sponsor study in the coming months. 
We also recently initiated an adaptive design study in patients with diffuse large T-cell lymphoma. The concept for this study was based upon the differential response rate data seen in the biomarker defined subset of the patient population. In addition to these studies, we'll continue to maximize the potential of REVLIMID in lymphoma with additional pivotal studies of mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In leukemia, positive data was presented at ASCO that illustrates the potential of our pivotal CLL-008 trial, which is evaluating REVLIMID as a first-line therapy in elderly CLL patients. 
In addition to REVLIMID, our hematology/oncology pipeline has seven compounds in all stages of development. We expect to have results from our pivotal studies evaluating ISTODAX in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the next coming few weeks. 
With approximately 15 pivotal in Phase III trials from the hemo pipeline, there will be a steady flow of important new data for the next several years, leading to what we believe will be another five to 10 new indications in this period. I do look forward to our next presentation when we should be able to add Abraxane and the Abraxis pipeline to this slide. 
Speaking of Abraxis, we're on track with all of our regulatory filings related to the transaction. Both companies submitted the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings two weeks ago and the explore proxy statement was submitted earlier this morning. Once the filing is declared effective by the SEC, there will be an Abraxis shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. The transaction is expected to close shortly after that meeting. We do expect this transaction will close before our next conference call in late October and look forward to updating you on our progress and plans at that time. 
In addition to hematology/oncology discussions, we continue to feel a substantial portfolio of assets in our inflammation and immunology franchise. We now have six candidates in clinical development. This pipeline was a major focus at our R&D day in April, and it continues to make excellent progress since then. We're now initiating our first trial with ACE-011 in renal anemia, moving rapidly into Phase II in Crohn's Disease with our cellular therapy, PDA-001, and advancing our JNK inhibitor in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Our most advanced program is Apremilast. In just the past few weeks, we have dosed our first patients in PSA-002, the first of our pivotal trials. We have an extensive development program for Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis, moderate-to-severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and other serious immune/inflammatory diseases. All of our pivotal trials in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are targeted to be initiated before the end of this year. 
It was an exceptional quarter both in terms of financial and operating results and also in terms of positioning Celgene for the future. While producing strong bottom line results, we're also investing the future to sustain the success and high growth that we've achieved. We're executing on our plan and managing the challenges of healthcare reform in the U.S. and budgetary pressures in the EU, while making the sound strategic decisions to extend our capabilities around the world and to expand therapeutic franchises that capitalize on our existing strengths. 
As we close, I want to recognize and thank the Celgene team worldwide, who all contributed to these extraordinary results of this past quarter, superb results achieved in the challenging global economy. It's their dedication, their passion for the patient, their creativity and expertise that make us so optimistic about the future. Thank you for joining this morning, and we look forward to answer your questions. So operator, please, you can now open the call to questions."

With the uncertainty in the marketplace, we certainly wanted to increase the guidance, the second quarter in a row. So the guidance for the year, the beginning of the year, has turned out so far to be fairly conservative.

Japan is a market with a very, very significant sensitivity to past effects of drugs, with birth defects, and overall, end market, very sensitive to side effect management. And so we're being very prudent here to ensure that we've got the right risk management system. It's something that we've developed, and our team has developed in very strong concert with important other constituencies in Japan, including the ministry and patient groups, et cetera. So it's been thoughtfully done. It's well planned out. We do not think it will have any long-term negative impediment. We've got people confidence that it's a very safe system and its going to be well controlled and managed. That being said, putting the risk management system aside, Japan is a great market, and REVLIMID is spectacularly well-situated compound that fit extraordinarily well with the conditions in market of Japan. At oral therapy with very manageable side effects with strong effectiveness demonstrated in the labeled indication. And so that's very important for us to establish Japan early on and make sure that physicians are very comfortable with having administrative drugs, how to safely do it, how to manage the side effects. And that's the marketplace that you establish a strong initial presence and physicians are comfortable with having used the drug with the initial one, two, three patients. You're going to see a very rapid uptake over the longer term. But in the near term, even we're talking about, we want to make sure that people don't get overly enthusiastic to see a dramatic ramp. We're playing Japan and we're positioning ourself for very strong long term excellent performance. But we're going to do it the right way to ensure education is there, good solid risk management systems so that physicians, patients and the government and we are all comfortable that it's being done in a very prudent manner. And that's not to say that we are just incredibly excited about having the approval on June 25, and to get pricing and reimbursement in such a short period of time really does reflect, I think, a few things. One, the importance of the new therapy for myeloma in Japan, the need for REVLIMID to get out to patients and also, I think, the execution, the planning, the strategy of our Celgene team in Japan to produce that in such a short period of time. So we're excited, but we're going to do it in the best way position for long-term success."

That was the only meaningful event in the second quarter. Clearly, people are focused on Germany for later this year with a 10% increase in the rebate in Germany, and the specifics of that is still being finalized but that looks pretty clear. I mean, as we lookout past 2010, our marketplace -- we'd look at it country by country and clearly, there's lots of pressure. I think the impact is more on just budgetary pressures, less on specific price declines but we're going to see continued price decline and that's the reason why when we started REVLIMID internationally, we established the benchmark price that we did. And so on our regional forecast, we were expecting to see pressure just in normal course of events in 2011. So in some respect, we're not going to be as dramatically hit by their all other price increases. So I think as we look out, it's a little early for us to get too granular and specific about 2011, but our outlook at this far and advance, using all of the information we have and the outlook for pressures in Europe, is pretty consistent with what we've seen. Their expectation is in line with our plans, what we think the growth of revenue will be over the next five years. So again, these are tough times out there, but our team in each individual market, I think, are crafting a very unique and specific strategy to the market. It is part of our strategy. We have got to manage price and duration overtime, and there's nothing unusual in terms of what we were expecting and we're ready to manage the circumstances, though, it's certainly is a challenging environment, but we think 2011 initially looks pretty encouraging to us."

So as you have a very strong ramping new patients and you have increasing duration that, that bodes well for the future. So we always have to work very hard to ensure we have the best strategy and results in the U.S., but the trends are very positive there. In Europe, the underlying trends were very strong also on a comparative basis and market-to-market. There were some countries where growth was a little bit slower than it has been, where there've been pressure on budgets, not specifically price cuts but just authorities, hospital, leaders saying, ""Listen, where can we cut cost, just to produce some fiscal restraint. That's our bigger issue that the companies need the come to grips with the fiscal challenges they have. We're going to have to make sure that the value proposition of Celgene is very, very clearly delineated, that's one of the great success of the REVLIMID, that we have such a great value proposition and why continues to grow in all markets, and we saw in some market accelerating growth. The U.K., Canada were both very strong in the quarter. So I think we're going to continue to see some markets where we're going to be budgetary pressures on those where the duration and increasing market shares will offset that. So overall we feel very good about what's happening in Europe and the growth there will continue to be very strong over the next few years."

And we'll look for other compounds to use the nab technology to develop. So we're going to focus on the synergies up it, but also the growth opportunities of Abraxis.

Certainly, melphalan, prednisone is not a high-growth regimen generally in the myeloma population. So I think our own strategy of doing MMO-20, which is our big, largest Phase III trial in the myeloma market place, which really examines REVLIMID and dexamethasone versus the melphalan-based lidomide regimen, is really designed to say, ""Listen, if we are able to get the broadest label possible and all the data presented from all the clinical trial, that we were hopefully that physicians will have the full course of options to say, which specific patient would benefit best from  REVLIMID dexamethasone, which patient would benefit most from melphalan prednisone and REVLIMID or other theraphies. So I think we're getting a good range of data from multiple clinical trials, Phase III trial. Certainly the REVLIMID once have all the positive, positive results and we're optimistic that in the next year or two as we get the NO 20 data, we'll have even more information to give physician more guidance as to what is best for newly diagnosed myeloma patients. I think we're very encouraged by what MM-015 had an impact already in the marketplace. We're optimistic the impact that will have in the regulatory ability to expand the label.

We are very, very optimistic about the potential of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan and for all the reasons that we've discussed. And we're hopeful that you will keep your estimates as low as possible in the near term for us. But seriously, we think that the success -- it's important to do it properly with a strong education emphasis and ensure that people have a good positive experience because the potential for Japan is such and such an important market to us over the next few years. They want to do it right and do it with the right trajectory. But we're very optimistic about what potential is there. And I think since our last call or certainly through the last quarterly conference call, the very important Phase II pomalidomide trial is very rapidly finished accruing. And we'll hopefully look forward to that data as soon as it's available and there's a potential in the next three or four quarters, we'll see that data and that we'll initiate the Phase III trial in pomalidomide by the end of the year. So I have to tell you, when we think about priorities here as we think about the rest of this year and 2011, the acceleration of pomalidomide and making that available to the last refractory myeloma population and the myelofibrosis patient population is a critical corporate objective because it remains in that last refractory population a serious unmet medical need, it's an indication that we feel so strongly about the need to serve myeloma patients, so we're very encouraged by what we're seeing the results. As soon as we get the Phase II results, we'll share them and see how they can be used and we'll accelerate the Phase III trial and we're accruing the pivotal trial on myelofibrosis. So that really is hard to imagine in a higher priority for us than acceleration of pomalidomide development.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our third quarter results and the significant progress that we have made since we last spoke in July. Earlier this morning, we announced record operating and financial results. These results reflect a strong momentum in our businesses and the excellent execution by our teams.
Numerous important developments in the quarter have the potential to further accelerate our growth prospects, delivering both short- and long-term value to our shareholders. Before Jackie and I talk about the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, let me highlight some of these milestones.
On October 15, we closed the Abraxis acquisition, adding ABRAXANE and the proprietary nab technology platform to our portfolio. This acquisition provides Celgene with an immediate commercial presence in solid tumor oncology and substantially expands our solid tumor pipeline. We're off to a good start launching Celgene oncology. I'll talk more about the transaction in a few minutes. 
Our confidence to expand our therapeutic focus into oncology is a direct result of the outstanding performance of all functions and geographies in our core Hematology business. In our commercial operations, key business metrics are encouraging across markets, and we continue to expand globally into new territory such as Japan, Russia and China. Our deep and diverse pipeline is a direct result of our sustained R&D investment over the last decade. We now have 25 pivotal trials investigating REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ISTODAX, pomalidomide, apremilast and now ABRAXANE across a number of diseases with high unmet medical needs. With numerous major clinical and regulatory milestones later this year and next, we are beginning to realize the benefits of these investments.
In addition to the strong progress in hematology and oncology, I'm also excited about the significant accomplishments we have made in our inflammation and immunology programs. We now have six compounds and multiple research programs ongoing. This work is highlighted by the initiation this year of four pivotal studies investigating apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
We're fortunate to be in a position of strength as we seek to maximize our opportunities and effectively manage through the challenges of uncertain economic times and dynamic markets. 
Before I turn the call over to Jackie, I would like to thank her and her team for their leadership and superb execution of our recent $1.25 billion debut debt offering. Thank you.

And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results",1274,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results for what was a record quarter for the company.
Starting with the top line. Non-GAAP total revenue for the third quarter was $908 million, a 31% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This contributed to year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth of 33%. The strong growth was driven by global unit sales growth in our key products REVLIMID and VIDAZA.
Within total non-GAAP revenues, total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $884 million for the third quarter, up 33% versus the year-ago quarter and bringing year-to-date growth to 34%.
Furthermore, sequential quarter-to-quarter growth in non-GAAP net product sales was 8%.
Driven by that revenue growth, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter rose to $350 million, an increase of 35% over the third quarter of 2009. This translates to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75, up 34% versus the third quarter of 2009.
As you can see from these results, we are leveraging our operating model to produce strong EPS growth at the same time as we invest in a robust R&D pipeline and the ramp-up of our global commercialization infrastructure.
Turning to individual product results. Third quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $641 million, an increase of 43% over the third quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by share and duration gains, as well as continued geographic expansion. Global REVLIMID sequential quarter growth was 9%. 
VIDAZA net product sales for the quarter were $141 million, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter, and global VIDAZA sequential quarter growth was 7%.
THALOMID net sales were $94 million for the quarter, down 14% as compared to the year-ago period.
Moving on to the geographic breakdown of REVLIMID sales for the third quarter. Sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $374 million, representing an increase of 7% on a sequential quarter basis and a 37% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. International sales were $267 million, representing an increase of 13% on a sequential quarter basis and a 51% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The international expansion of REVLIMID continues to progress well, and the launch of the product in Japan is on track.
Our non-GAAP product gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2010 was 92.9%, an improvement of 50 basis points over the second quarter of 2010 and about 40 basis points over Q3 of 2009, as REVLIMID contributes positively to our sales mix. We expect the gross margins to come in at about 93% for the full year 2010 for Celgene before including ABRAXANE. ABRAXANE sales in Q4 will somewhat negatively impact Q4 gross margin with a modest effect on the full year.
With respect to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense during the third quarter was $232 million, a sequential increase of 15% over the second quarter. And this quarter, we saw the continuing ramp-up of patient enrollment in our many clinical trials. Versus 2009, for the quarter, we grew R&D by 30%, and for the year-to-date, we have grown R&D expense by 21% as we continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth profile.
Our development efforts cover multiple compounds in more than 25 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key programs include evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. 
We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX.
In addition, we have more than 20 promising compounds in preclinical and early-stage development.
We now expect non-GAAP R&D expense for the full year to be in a range of $890 million to $900 million, including Abraxis. 
Taking a look at SG&A. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $204 million for the third quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4% from the second quarter. Compared to 2009, SG&A grew 18% for the third quarter and 21% for the nine months year-to-date.
We now expect full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $830 million to $840 million, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA, and including estimated integration costs for Abraxis. The current rate of spending in SG&A was driven by investments we are making in our global commercialization infrastructure, and we expect to be able to leverage this spend in future years.
Turning to taxes. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year-to-date through September 30 was 19.4%, and we expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 19% for the full year. For just the third quarter, the rate was 18.5%.
With respect to foreign currency hedging, as you are aware, we hedged our currency exposures, which include balance sheet and transactional exposures as well as non-U.S. dollar exposures related to revenues and expenses. 
This quarter, the impact of foreign currency, including hedging results, on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. During the third quarter, in other income, we realized approximately $6 million in hedging and revaluation gains.
Our hedging objective is to reduce volatility in both cash flow and EPS. Though our single largest exposure continues to be the euro, our currency mix is becoming more diversified as we continue our international expansion.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue, earnings and cash flow, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.5 billion. After considering the cash required to complete the Abraxis acquisition and the cash received from the recently completed debt offering, we expect to end 2010 with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Now I'm pleased to provide you with an update on our 2010 full year outlook. Global REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to come in at about $2.45 billion, up from our previous guidance range for REVLIMID of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion. Total global revenue, including Abraxis, is now expected to be approximately $3.6 billion, up from our previous range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $2.78 to $2.80. This compares to a previous range of $2.65 to $2.70. This updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes dilution from the acquisition of Abraxis.
And now to conclude my remarks for today, let me reiterate that the global expansion of all of our franchises continues to progress extremely well. We are producing strong financial performance as a result of excellent operating efficiency and leverage. We are well-positioned to deliver a strong finish to 2010 and are well-prepared to deliver for 2011 and beyond. Investments we are making in both R&D and our global infrastructure today allow us to remain an industry leader with respect to future growth and profitability. 
In order to strengthen our financial flexibility so we can continue to grow via both internal development projects as well as the appropriate external opportunity, in October, we diversified our capital base by executing our first ever public market debt issuance. That issuance went very well and 16-some investors recognized the value of the Celgene model and our prospects for the future. We are quite pleased with the reception we received in the debt markets and can look to the future with a strong balance sheet and access to capital. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob who will elaborate on the activities driving our numbers."

Excellent results across the globe and across functions. The third quarter was once again an outstanding quarter for REVLIMID. Sales were up 44% year-over-year, with international sales increasing 13% over last quarter.",1770,"Thanks, Jackie. Quite a quarter. Excellent results across the globe and across functions. The third quarter was once again an outstanding quarter for REVLIMID. Sales were up 44% year-over-year, with international sales increasing 13% over last quarter. 
VIDAZA also continued its positive trajectory in the third quarter. Total global sales grew 7% quarter-over-quarter to $141 million with international markets contributing 52% of total sales. Strong operating performance across the board. 
Importantly, substantial advancements were also achieved in our pipeline of late-stage assets. Key regulatory trials studying REVLIMID, pomalidomide, apremilast and our proprietary cellular therapy, PDA-001, progressed meaningfully in the quarter. These trials will lead to important near-term new data and ultimately to regulatory filings.
In addition to the outstanding operational and financial results and the advancement of key late-stage programs, several significant key corporate priorities were achieved, including the Abraxis transaction and the recent balance sheet strengthening of initial debt offering. Overall, great progress in our businesses during the quarter.
REVLIMID continued its impressive performance in the third quarter. Growth was strong in all major markets. In the United States, REVLIMID gained market share and now has a 42% share of the overall myeloma market. Increasing duration also remains a key growth driver.
The data from three Phase III trials supporting continuous therapy with REVLIMID has impacted uptake in duration of treatment in the United States. In MDS, our market position in deletion 5Q remains strong. New patient starts were up in the third quarter, and REVLIMID continues to hold an approximately 64% market share in this patient segment.
Similar to the U.S., increases in share and duration drove performance in Europe. In the four major European countries where REVLIMID is reimbursed second line, market share is now approximately 45%. Line 3 share in the five major European markets has also reached 45%.
During our last call, I spoke of the imminent launch of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan. I'm pleased to say that our team in Japan is making substantial progress. We have almost 2,000 physicians registered in REVLIMID, our proprietary risk-management system and early customer experiences have been positive.
We continue to expand access to REVLIMID around the world. We now expect reimbursement in Russia in the first half of 2011. In August, we achieved reimbursement approval in Turkey and during the third quarter, we received regulatory approvals in several countries in Asia and Latin America. REVLIMID is now approved in over 60 countries around the globe.
VIDAZA also had a strong quarter with 37% year-over-year growth. VIDAZA is the only agent to show a survival benefit in MDS and AML patients, and as such, has a very strong position in the market. In the U.S., VIDAZA has a greater than 80% share of newly diagnosed MDS patients who are treated with a hypomethylator. 
In Europe, solid performance in our core markets led to a very positive quarter. VIDAZA continued to gain share and duration of treatment lengthened. As we look ahead, our commercial teams across markets are focused on highlighting the benefits of active therapy for MDS patients, as well as increasing the duration of treatment.
We recently initiated a Phase III study of VIDAZA in elderly patients with AML, and are also exploring multiple combinations with VIDAZA, REVLIMID and other agents across MDS and AML. 
In addition, we have seen positive early results from studies testing oral azacitidine, and we're initiating a clinical development plan to bring this differentiated agent to patients.
Our commercial portfolio has been enhanced by the Abraxis acquisition. The addition of ABRAXANE increases our revenue growth potential and together with the other nab technology products enhances our pipeline. In the near term, our goal is to leverage the strength of our commercial organization and improve the performance of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer. We are integrating sales forces and optimizing marketing campaigns. These activities will continue through the fourth quarter and our plan is to accelerate sales in breast cancer in 2011.
In non-small cell lung cancer, our focus is on filing a quality dossier with the FDA in the first half of next year. We anticipate having top line progression-free survival data by the end of the year or early next year. As you may know, the Phase III study is a double-blind control trial of 1,050 patients with Stage IIIB and Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Response rate is that FDA-approved primary endpoint of the study, while progression-free survival and overall survival are important secondary endpoints. The trial has already met its primary endpoint and as I mentioned, we're awaiting the actual PFS and overall survival data.
We're also very encouraged by the impressive response rate and survival data seen in a Phase II trial evaluating ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. We are increasing the patient size of the Phase III pivotal study from 630 patients to approximately 840 patients to improve the power of the trial. This Phase III trial continues to enrol very well, and expected enrollment will be complete towards the end of 2011.
In addition to breast, lung and pancreatic cancers, ABRAXANE has shown potential in multiple other solid tumors. In the third quarter, ABRAXANE received compendia listing for relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer and has also shown promise in melanoma and bladder cancer. We expect multiple peer-reviewed publications throughout 2011 from these programs.
The Abraxis acquisition was a major strategic transaction, and we're working hard to expeditiously integrate our companies and accelerate key programs and initiatives.
As you can see from the slide, with the addition of Abraxis, we have a meaningful oncology pipeline with multiple compounds, an asset in numerous late-stage trials and a technology platform that enables us to innovate and create potential new therapies.
The trials at our late-stage pipeline have a potential to lead to five additional indications in the next five years. In addition, we're advancing a number of early-stage programs including our torque inhibitor, multiple other research programs from our teams in California and New Jersey, as well as our new nab technology programs from Abraxis.
Our late-stage hematology pipeline is also advancing, and we now have 15 pivotal trials ongoing or planned in hematology. We initiated a Phase III study of pomalidomide and myelofibrosis during the quarter and will soon begin a Phase III international study investigating pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma. 
Promising REVLIMID programs in lymphoma and CLL continued to enroll, and MM-020, the largest myeloma study ever conducted is expected to complete accruing patients by the end of this year.
Based on our ongoing clinical programs, there is a potential for five to 10 additional approvals in distinct hematological indications by 2015.
Many of our hematology programs will be highlighted at the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting in December in Orlando. We're currently aware of more than 140 submitted abstracts on Celgene products in numerous disease settings. 
At this year's ASH, data will be presented that supports REVLIMID's usage in myeloma, MDS, CLL and lymphoma.
Data from a pivotal study evaluating ISTODAX in peripheral T-cell lymphoma will be presented at an oral session. Additionally, new and updated data on pomalidomide and VIDAZA will also be presented. Compelling clinical data is the most important driver of our Hematology/Oncology business. Improved patient outcomes lead to regulatory approvals and ultimately to changes in medical practice.
These [ph] (29:48) ASH abstracts will become available in November. We look forward to sharing data with you at ASH in December. 
As you can see from this slide, there's an incredible amount of activity across our pipeline in the next 15 months. We'll be completing enrollment in many key trials across all three of our franchises. At upcoming major medical meetings there will be extensive clinical data examining the usage of our drugs in numerous disease settings. We expect data from these meetings to support an array of regulatory filings, including submissions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, for REVLIMID and MDS deletion 5q, ISTODAX and PTCL, and ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. 
The Abraxis acquisition represents a major strategic initiative as we expand our therapeutic focus to include solid tumor oncology. Our emerging immune-inflammatory programs represent another high potential therapeutic franchise expansion for Celgene. 
During the last two quarters, we have initiated four out of our six pivotal studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with apremilast. Our Phase III program encompasses approximately 3,500 patients at 450 sites worldwide. Our ambitious but obtainable corporate objective is to have all patients that are pivotal studies enroll by the end of 2011, with data available as early as mid-2012.
Our proprietary cellular therapies represent an important part of our immune-inflammatory pipeline. We recently initiated a Phase II study of PDA-001 in Crohn's Disease following encouraging data from our Phase I Crohn's study. We're also planning to initiate additional proof of concept studies in a variety of indications later this year and early next year, including multiple sclerosis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.
We believe that our products have great potential on immune-inflammatory conditions. We've made a significant investment in this franchise and are building a deep and diverse pipeline that includes CC-930, our JNK inhibitor, CC-11050, pomalidomide in scleroderma, H11 and PDA-001, a combination of internally discovered and a partner-generated compounds. We feel that inflammation immunology holds great promise for Celgene. By 2015, our goal is to achieve a number of approvals for apremilast while continuing to accelerate the development of this pipeline.
Tremendous progress has been achieved across all three of our major therapeutic franchises. We're  committed to building a preeminent, fully integrated market-leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with unmet medical needs in cancer and immune-inflammatory disease. This mission unifies and focuses us on the urgency of what we do. We have made considerable progress toward the accomplishment of this ambitious goal, and we're committed to accelerating this progress. 
Our businesses have exceptional momentum and are poised to capitalize on the significant R&D investment of the past decade. We now have more than 25 Phase III and pivotal trials that have the potential to produce transformational new data on our products and program in the coming years.
We're expanding our therapeutic franchise with an increasing investment in high-potential internal and external research and development program to sustain long-term growth. It is our responsibility and objective to maximize this opportunity, to leverage our operating momentum and our financial and strategic assets to fully capitalize on the global potential of Celgene.

It was strong in unit growth across markets and obviously, duration gains contributed. Clearly, in certain markets, the growth parameters will be different. We have market share opportunities across markets. We have more opportunities in terms of market share in some markets, where regulatory approvals are critical to access to newly diagnosed markets. And ultimately, duration gains will be important across all markets, so very much depending on the stage of -- we're talking specifically about myeloma here, we're talking about the market share depending on where we are in terms of development, where we are in terms of duration and regulatory approvals and reimbursement access. And what is also incredibly exciting about REVLIMID is that we expect to see regulatory filings in both the newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe, but also the rest, the deletion 5q MDS in Europe and in other markets, and we're accelerating our development of the follicular lymphoma space and the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and we're looking to continue to accelerate our CLL program. So we've got significant growth and opportunities in myeloma in different regions, with different impacts, depending on where the stage of development is, and also in other indications. So we think we're still not near the end of the REVLIMID growth story."

So that market segment, over time, assuming a regulatory approval and also we had -- and reimbursement discussions. So there's considerable work to be done. Even with a regulatory approval, we need to make sure that the value proposition will continue to be sustained, because one of the great accomplishments of REVLIMID has been that strong value proposition, the nice endorsement, the regulatory and reimbursement across the globe in terms of Japan, Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden, et cetera. So it's very important that as we get regulatory approvals, as we broaden the label, we've got to, at the same time, make sure that value proposition is sustained by the data to ensure that we get the same kind of broad reimbursement access that we have in the existing label as we go forward."

Obviously, a regulatory process is one that goes on for a period of time, and there's the review process, though we have very constructive discussions. Now, there could always be review issues that come up with any application. I can't predict the future, but our goal with REVLIMID is to get a broad front-line approval and broad maintenance claims. Obviously, we're doing many trials. MM-020, which is the R&D trial, we really agree melphalan is not a great agent, and it is one that is problematic. It's not widely prescribed in the United States at all. So it is important, if we're going to fully penetrate newly diagnosed myeloma over time,  we would want R&D as a newly diagnosed therapy eventually included in the label. But hopefully, our steps will be get the existing data from MM-015 [ph] (44:02) and IFM and CALGB, get the label expanded to newly diagnosed and maintenance and then continue to broaden it as the additional MM-020 data comes out. So it is actually important that the label reflect the best therapies available but -- in summary, we're committed, as soon as possible, to get newly diagnosed and maintenance label claims in the global label around the world and the United States."

The question was about in the similar stage of commercialization of REVLIMID in Europe versus United States, is the duration about the same? Was that the question? I will answer that question anyway. I think, generally, we have seen slightly slower duration gains at the same stage of development in Europe, United States. I think there's a couple of reasons. One, there has been a bit of a more historic focus on treat to best response in Europe, at least that's what we've seen in our commercial efforts so far, and we've made good progress on that front. Additionally, country by country reimbursement, we've had to continue to have to prove the value of extended therapy. And we have been unbelievably successful. I'll give you some example, I don't want to name the country, but there was one country that said you can only have eight months of therapy, max. It took us about 12 months and we got that lifted unlimited. We had other ones that said 10 months or 11 months, so I think initially, it is a more complex payer environment. There were more standards set that we have had to overcome. But in the scheme of things, though we started later in Europe, I think we're taking the experience of understanding how to communicate our messages effectively. And I believe that over time, we're going to see a relatively close duration in Europe versus United States. Certainly, in the major markets of Europe."

Joining me are Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Hugin, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dr. Sol Barer, our Executive Chairman. 
Before we start, we want to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements include the effects of the acquisition of Abraxis BioScience unless noted. Our actual results, performance or achievements could be materially different from those projected by these forward-looking statements.
The factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ from our forward-looking statements are discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports.
Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.
Also, our discussions during this conference call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of our earnings releases on Celgene's website at www.celgene.com in the Investor Relations section.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our third quarter results and the significant progress that we have made since we last spoke in July. Earlier this morning, we announced record operating and financial results. These results reflect a strong momentum in our businesses and the excellent execution by our teams.
Numerous important developments in the quarter have the potential to further accelerate our growth prospects, delivering both short- and long-term value to our shareholders. Before Jackie and I talk about the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, let me highlight some of these milestones.
On October 15, we closed the Abraxis acquisition, adding ABRAXANE and the proprietary nab technology platform to our portfolio. This acquisition provides Celgene with an immediate commercial presence in solid tumor oncology and substantially expands our solid tumor pipeline. We're off to a good start launching Celgene oncology. I'll talk more about the transaction in a few minutes. 
Our confidence to expand our therapeutic focus into oncology is a direct result of the outstanding performance of all functions and geographies in our core Hematology business. In our commercial operations, key business metrics are encouraging across markets, and we continue to expand globally into new territory such as Japan, Russia and China. Our deep and diverse pipeline is a direct result of our sustained R&D investment over the last decade. We now have 25 pivotal trials investigating REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ISTODAX, pomalidomide, apremilast and now ABRAXANE across a number of diseases with high unmet medical needs. With numerous major clinical and regulatory milestones later this year and next, we are beginning to realize the benefits of these investments.
In addition to the strong progress in hematology and oncology, I'm also excited about the significant accomplishments we have made in our inflammation and immunology programs. We now have six compounds and multiple research programs ongoing. This work is highlighted by the initiation this year of four pivotal studies investigating apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
We're fortunate to be in a position of strength as we seek to maximize our opportunities and effectively manage through the challenges of uncertain economic times and dynamic markets. 
Before I turn the call over to Jackie, I would like to thank her and her team for their leadership and superb execution of our recent $1.25 billion debut debt offering. Thank you.

258769,114610289,82756,"Celgene Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results",1274,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results for what was a record quarter for the company.
Starting with the top line. Non-GAAP total revenue for the third quarter was $908 million, a 31% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This contributed to year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth of 33%. The strong growth was driven by global unit sales growth in our key products REVLIMID and VIDAZA.
Within total non-GAAP revenues, total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $884 million for the third quarter, up 33% versus the year-ago quarter and bringing year-to-date growth to 34%.
Furthermore, sequential quarter-to-quarter growth in non-GAAP net product sales was 8%.
Driven by that revenue growth, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter rose to $350 million, an increase of 35% over the third quarter of 2009. This translates to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75, up 34% versus the third quarter of 2009.
As you can see from these results, we are leveraging our operating model to produce strong EPS growth at the same time as we invest in a robust R&D pipeline and the ramp-up of our global commercialization infrastructure.
Turning to individual product results. Third quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $641 million, an increase of 43% over the third quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by share and duration gains, as well as continued geographic expansion. Global REVLIMID sequential quarter growth was 9%. 
VIDAZA net product sales for the quarter were $141 million, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter, and global VIDAZA sequential quarter growth was 7%.
THALOMID net sales were $94 million for the quarter, down 14% as compared to the year-ago period.
Moving on to the geographic breakdown of REVLIMID sales for the third quarter. Sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $374 million, representing an increase of 7% on a sequential quarter basis and a 37% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. International sales were $267 million, representing an increase of 13% on a sequential quarter basis and a 51% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The international expansion of REVLIMID continues to progress well, and the launch of the product in Japan is on track.
Our non-GAAP product gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2010 was 92.9%, an improvement of 50 basis points over the second quarter of 2010 and about 40 basis points over Q3 of 2009, as REVLIMID contributes positively to our sales mix. We expect the gross margins to come in at about 93% for the full year 2010 for Celgene before including ABRAXANE. ABRAXANE sales in Q4 will somewhat negatively impact Q4 gross margin with a modest effect on the full year.
With respect to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense during the third quarter was $232 million, a sequential increase of 15% over the second quarter. And this quarter, we saw the continuing ramp-up of patient enrollment in our many clinical trials. Versus 2009, for the quarter, we grew R&D by 30%, and for the year-to-date, we have grown R&D expense by 21% as we continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth profile.
Our development efforts cover multiple compounds in more than 25 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key programs include evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. 
We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX.
In addition, we have more than 20 promising compounds in preclinical and early-stage development.
We now expect non-GAAP R&D expense for the full year to be in a range of $890 million to $900 million, including Abraxis. 
Taking a look at SG&A. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $204 million for the third quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4% from the second quarter. Compared to 2009, SG&A grew 18% for the third quarter and 21% for the nine months year-to-date.
We now expect full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $830 million to $840 million, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA, and including estimated integration costs for Abraxis. The current rate of spending in SG&A was driven by investments we are making in our global commercialization infrastructure, and we expect to be able to leverage this spend in future years.
Turning to taxes. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year-to-date through September 30 was 19.4%, and we expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 19% for the full year. For just the third quarter, the rate was 18.5%.
With respect to foreign currency hedging, as you are aware, we hedged our currency exposures, which include balance sheet and transactional exposures as well as non-U.S. dollar exposures related to revenues and expenses. 
This quarter, the impact of foreign currency, including hedging results, on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. During the third quarter, in other income, we realized approximately $6 million in hedging and revaluation gains.
Our hedging objective is to reduce volatility in both cash flow and EPS. Though our single largest exposure continues to be the euro, our currency mix is becoming more diversified as we continue our international expansion.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue, earnings and cash flow, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.5 billion. After considering the cash required to complete the Abraxis acquisition and the cash received from the recently completed debt offering, we expect to end 2010 with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Now I'm pleased to provide you with an update on our 2010 full year outlook. Global REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to come in at about $2.45 billion, up from our previous guidance range for REVLIMID of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion. Total global revenue, including Abraxis, is now expected to be approximately $3.6 billion, up from our previous range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $2.78 to $2.80. This compares to a previous range of $2.65 to $2.70. This updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes dilution from the acquisition of Abraxis.
And now to conclude my remarks for today, let me reiterate that the global expansion of all of our franchises continues to progress extremely well. We are producing strong financial performance as a result of excellent operating efficiency and leverage. We are well-positioned to deliver a strong finish to 2010 and are well-prepared to deliver for 2011 and beyond. Investments we are making in both R&D and our global infrastructure today allow us to remain an industry leader with respect to future growth and profitability. 
In order to strengthen our financial flexibility so we can continue to grow via both internal development projects as well as the appropriate external opportunity, in October, we diversified our capital base by executing our first ever public market debt issuance. That issuance went very well and 16-some investors recognized the value of the Celgene model and our prospects for the future. We are quite pleased with the reception we received in the debt markets and can look to the future with a strong balance sheet and access to capital. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob who will elaborate on the activities driving our numbers.

The third quarter was once again an outstanding quarter for REVLIMID. Sales were up 44% year-over-year, with international sales increasing 13% over last quarter. 
VIDAZA also continued its positive trajectory in the third quarter. Total global sales grew 7% quarter-over-quarter to $141 million with international markets contributing 52% of total sales. Strong operating performance across the board. 
Importantly, substantial advancements were also achieved in our pipeline of late-stage assets. Key regulatory trials studying REVLIMID, pomalidomide, apremilast and our proprietary cellular therapy, PDA-001, progressed meaningfully in the quarter. These trials will lead to important near-term new data and ultimately to regulatory filings.
In addition to the outstanding operational and financial results and the advancement of key late-stage programs, several significant key corporate priorities were achieved, including the Abraxis transaction and the recent balance sheet strengthening of initial debt offering. Overall, great progress in our businesses during the quarter.
REVLIMID continued its impressive performance in the third quarter. Growth was strong in all major markets. In the United States, REVLIMID gained market share and now has a 42% share of the overall myeloma market. Increasing duration also remains a key growth driver.
The data from three Phase III trials supporting continuous therapy with REVLIMID has impacted uptake in duration of treatment in the United States. In MDS, our market position in deletion 5Q remains strong. New patient starts were up in the third quarter, and REVLIMID continues to hold an approximately 64% market share in this patient segment.
Similar to the U.S., increases in share and duration drove performance in Europe. In the four major European countries where REVLIMID is reimbursed second line, market share is now approximately 45%. Line 3 share in the five major European markets has also reached 45%.
During our last call, I spoke of the imminent launch of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan. I'm pleased to say that our team in Japan is making substantial progress. We have almost 2,000 physicians registered in REVLIMID, our proprietary risk-management system and early customer experiences have been positive.
We continue to expand access to REVLIMID around the world. We now expect reimbursement in Russia in the first half of 2011. In August, we achieved reimbursement approval in Turkey and during the third quarter, we received regulatory approvals in several countries in Asia and Latin America. REVLIMID is now approved in over 60 countries around the globe.
VIDAZA also had a strong quarter with 37% year-over-year growth. VIDAZA is the only agent to show a survival benefit in MDS and AML patients, and as such, has a very strong position in the market. In the U.S., VIDAZA has a greater than 80% share of newly diagnosed MDS patients who are treated with a hypomethylator. 
In Europe, solid performance in our core markets led to a very positive quarter. VIDAZA continued to gain share and duration of treatment lengthened. As we look ahead, our commercial teams across markets are focused on highlighting the benefits of active therapy for MDS patients, as well as increasing the duration of treatment.
We recently initiated a Phase III study of VIDAZA in elderly patients with AML, and are also exploring multiple combinations with VIDAZA, REVLIMID and other agents across MDS and AML. 
In addition, we have seen positive early results from studies testing oral azacitidine, and we're initiating a clinical development plan to bring this differentiated agent to patients.
Our commercial portfolio has been enhanced by the Abraxis acquisition. The addition of ABRAXANE increases our revenue growth potential and together with the other nab technology products enhances our pipeline. In the near term, our goal is to leverage the strength of our commercial organization and improve the performance of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer. We are integrating sales forces and optimizing marketing campaigns. These activities will continue through the fourth quarter and our plan is to accelerate sales in breast cancer in 2011.
In non-small cell lung cancer, our focus is on filing a quality dossier with the FDA in the first half of next year. We anticipate having top line progression-free survival data by the end of the year or early next year. As you may know, the Phase III study is a double-blind control trial of 1,050 patients with Stage IIIB and Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Response rate is that FDA-approved primary endpoint of the study, while progression-free survival and overall survival are important secondary endpoints. The trial has already met its primary endpoint and as I mentioned, we're awaiting the actual PFS and overall survival data.
We're also very encouraged by the impressive response rate and survival data seen in a Phase II trial evaluating ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. We are increasing the patient size of the Phase III pivotal study from 630 patients to approximately 840 patients to improve the power of the trial. This Phase III trial continues to enrol very well, and expected enrollment will be complete towards the end of 2011.
In addition to breast, lung and pancreatic cancers, ABRAXANE has shown potential in multiple other solid tumors. In the third quarter, ABRAXANE received compendia listing for relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer and has also shown promise in melanoma and bladder cancer. We expect multiple peer-reviewed publications throughout 2011 from these programs.
The Abraxis acquisition was a major strategic transaction, and we're working hard to expeditiously integrate our companies and accelerate key programs and initiatives.
As you can see from the slide, with the addition of Abraxis, we have a meaningful oncology pipeline with multiple compounds, an asset in numerous late-stage trials and a technology platform that enables us to innovate and create potential new therapies.
The trials at our late-stage pipeline have a potential to lead to five additional indications in the next five years. In addition, we're advancing a number of early-stage programs including our torque inhibitor, multiple other research programs from our teams in California and New Jersey, as well as our new nab technology programs from Abraxis.
Our late-stage hematology pipeline is also advancing, and we now have 15 pivotal trials ongoing or planned in hematology. We initiated a Phase III study of pomalidomide and myelofibrosis during the quarter and will soon begin a Phase III international study investigating pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma. 
Promising REVLIMID programs in lymphoma and CLL continued to enroll, and MM-020, the largest myeloma study ever conducted is expected to complete accruing patients by the end of this year.
Based on our ongoing clinical programs, there is a potential for five to 10 additional approvals in distinct hematological indications by 2015.
Many of our hematology programs will be highlighted at the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting in December in Orlando. We're currently aware of more than 140 submitted abstracts on Celgene products in numerous disease settings. 
At this year's ASH, data will be presented that supports REVLIMID's usage in myeloma, MDS, CLL and lymphoma.
Data from a pivotal study evaluating ISTODAX in peripheral T-cell lymphoma will be presented at an oral session. Additionally, new and updated data on pomalidomide and VIDAZA will also be presented. Compelling clinical data is the most important driver of our Hematology/Oncology business. Improved patient outcomes lead to regulatory approvals and ultimately to changes in medical practice.
These [ph] (29:48) ASH abstracts will become available in November. We look forward to sharing data with you at ASH in December. 
As you can see from this slide, there's an incredible amount of activity across our pipeline in the next 15 months. We'll be completing enrollment in many key trials across all three of our franchises. At upcoming major medical meetings there will be extensive clinical data examining the usage of our drugs in numerous disease settings. We expect data from these meetings to support an array of regulatory filings, including submissions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, for REVLIMID and MDS deletion 5q, ISTODAX and PTCL, and ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. 
The Abraxis acquisition represents a major strategic initiative as we expand our therapeutic focus to include solid tumor oncology. Our emerging immune-inflammatory programs represent another high potential therapeutic franchise expansion for Celgene. 
During the last two quarters, we have initiated four out of our six pivotal studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with apremilast. Our Phase III program encompasses approximately 3,500 patients at 450 sites worldwide. Our ambitious but obtainable corporate objective is to have all patients that are pivotal studies enroll by the end of 2011, with data available as early as mid-2012.
Our proprietary cellular therapies represent an important part of our immune-inflammatory pipeline. We recently initiated a Phase II study of PDA-001 in Crohn's Disease following encouraging data from our Phase I Crohn's study. We're also planning to initiate additional proof of concept studies in a variety of indications later this year and early next year, including multiple sclerosis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.
We believe that our products have great potential on immune-inflammatory conditions. We've made a significant investment in this franchise and are building a deep and diverse pipeline that includes CC-930, our JNK inhibitor, CC-11050, pomalidomide in scleroderma, H11 and PDA-001, a combination of internally discovered and a partner-generated compounds. We feel that inflammation immunology holds great promise for Celgene. By 2015, our goal is to achieve a number of approvals for apremilast while continuing to accelerate the development of this pipeline.
Tremendous progress has been achieved across all three of our major therapeutic franchises. We're  committed to building a preeminent, fully integrated market-leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with unmet medical needs in cancer and immune-inflammatory disease. This mission unifies and focuses us on the urgency of what we do. We have made considerable progress toward the accomplishment of this ambitious goal, and we're committed to accelerating this progress. 
Our businesses have exceptional momentum and are poised to capitalize on the significant R&D investment of the past decade. We now have more than 25 Phase III and pivotal trials that have the potential to produce transformational new data on our products and program in the coming years.
We're expanding our therapeutic franchise with an increasing investment in high-potential internal and external research and development program to sustain long-term growth. It is our responsibility and objective to maximize this opportunity, to leverage our operating momentum and our financial and strategic assets to fully capitalize on the global potential of Celgene.

It was strong in unit growth across markets and obviously, duration gains contributed. Clearly, in certain markets, the growth parameters will be different. We have market share opportunities across markets. We have more opportunities in terms of market share in some markets, where regulatory approvals are critical to access to newly diagnosed markets. And ultimately, duration gains will be important across all markets, so very much depending on the stage of -- we're talking specifically about myeloma here, we're talking about the market share depending on where we are in terms of development, where we are in terms of duration and regulatory approvals and reimbursement access. And what is also incredibly exciting about REVLIMID is that we expect to see regulatory filings in both the newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe, but also the rest, the deletion 5q MDS in Europe and in other markets, and we're accelerating our development of the follicular lymphoma space and the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and we're looking to continue to accelerate our CLL program. So we've got significant growth and opportunities in myeloma in different regions, with different impacts, depending on where the stage of development is, and also in other indications. So we think we're still not near the end of the REVLIMID growth story.

Even with a regulatory approval, we need to make sure that the value proposition will continue to be sustained, because one of the great accomplishments of REVLIMID has been that strong value proposition, the nice endorsement, the regulatory and reimbursement across the globe in terms of Japan, Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden, et cetera. So it's very important that as we get regulatory approvals, as we broaden the label, we've got to, at the same time, make sure that value proposition is sustained by the data to ensure that we get the same kind of broad reimbursement access that we have in the existing label as we go forward.

Obviously, a regulatory process is one that goes on for a period of time, and there's the review process, though we have very constructive discussions. Now, there could always be review issues that come up with any application. I can't predict the future, but our goal with REVLIMID is to get a broad front-line approval and broad maintenance claims. Obviously, we're doing many trials. MM-020, which is the R&D trial, we really agree melphalan is not a great agent, and it is one that is problematic. It's not widely prescribed in the United States at all. So it is important, if we're going to fully penetrate newly diagnosed myeloma over time,  we would want R&D as a newly diagnosed therapy eventually included in the label. But hopefully, our steps will be get the existing data from MM-015 [ph] (44:02) and IFM and CALGB, get the label expanded to newly diagnosed and maintenance and then continue to broaden it as the additional MM-020 data comes out. So it is actually important that the label reflect the best therapies available but -- in summary, we're committed, as soon as possible, to get newly diagnosed and maintenance label claims in the global label around the world and the United States.

The question was about in the similar stage of commercialization of REVLIMID in Europe versus United States, is the duration about the same? Was that the question? I will answer that question anyway. I think, generally, we have seen slightly slower duration gains at the same stage of development in Europe, United States. I think there's a couple of reasons. One, there has been a bit of a more historic focus on treat to best response in Europe, at least that's what we've seen in our commercial efforts so far, and we've made good progress on that front. Additionally, country by country reimbursement, we've had to continue to have to prove the value of extended therapy. And we have been unbelievably successful. I'll give you some example, I don't want to name the country, but there was one country that said you can only have eight months of therapy, max. It took us about 12 months and we got that lifted unlimited. We had other ones that said 10 months or 11 months, so I think initially, it is a more complex payer environment. There were more standards set that we have had to overcome. But in the scheme of things, though we started later in Europe, I think we're taking the experience of understanding how to communicate our messages effectively. And I believe that over time, we're going to see a relatively close duration in Europe versus United States. Certainly, in the major markets of Europe.

I believe the patent runs to December 2023 plus 85 days, so there was some additional extensions of it, granted so that -- I think the patent they've made say 2023, but it is early in 2024 that it would expire.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our third quarter results and the significant progress that we have made since we last spoke in July. Earlier this morning, we announced record operating and financial results. These results reflect a strong momentum in our businesses and the excellent execution by our teams.
Numerous important developments in the quarter have the potential to further accelerate our growth prospects, delivering both short- and long-term value to our shareholders. Before Jackie and I talk about the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, let me highlight some of these milestones.
On October 15, we closed the Abraxis acquisition, adding ABRAXANE and the proprietary nab technology platform to our portfolio. This acquisition provides Celgene with an immediate commercial presence in solid tumor oncology and substantially expands our solid tumor pipeline. We're off to a good start launching Celgene oncology. I'll talk more about the transaction in a few minutes. 
Our confidence to expand our therapeutic focus into oncology is a direct result of the outstanding performance of all functions and geographies in our core Hematology business. In our commercial operations, key business metrics are encouraging across markets, and we continue to expand globally into new territory such as Japan, Russia and China. Our deep and diverse pipeline is a direct result of our sustained R&D investment over the last decade. We now have 25 pivotal trials investigating REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ISTODAX, pomalidomide, apremilast and now ABRAXANE across a number of diseases with high unmet medical needs. With numerous major clinical and regulatory milestones later this year and next, we are beginning to realize the benefits of these investments.
In addition to the strong progress in hematology and oncology, I'm also excited about the significant accomplishments we have made in our inflammation and immunology programs. We now have six compounds and multiple research programs ongoing. This work is highlighted by the initiation this year of four pivotal studies investigating apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
We're fortunate to be in a position of strength as we seek to maximize our opportunities and effectively manage through the challenges of uncertain economic times and dynamic markets. 
Before I turn the call over to Jackie, I would like to thank her and her team for their leadership and superb execution of our recent $1.25 billion debut debt offering. Thank you.

And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results",1274,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results for what was a record quarter for the company.
Starting with the top line. Non-GAAP total revenue for the third quarter was $908 million, a 31% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This contributed to year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth of 33%. The strong growth was driven by global unit sales growth in our key products REVLIMID and VIDAZA.
Within total non-GAAP revenues, total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $884 million for the third quarter, up 33% versus the year-ago quarter and bringing year-to-date growth to 34%.
Furthermore, sequential quarter-to-quarter growth in non-GAAP net product sales was 8%.
Driven by that revenue growth, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter rose to $350 million, an increase of 35% over the third quarter of 2009. This translates to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75, up 34% versus the third quarter of 2009.
As you can see from these results, we are leveraging our operating model to produce strong EPS growth at the same time as we invest in a robust R&D pipeline and the ramp-up of our global commercialization infrastructure.
Turning to individual product results. Third quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $641 million, an increase of 43% over the third quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by share and duration gains, as well as continued geographic expansion. Global REVLIMID sequential quarter growth was 9%. 
VIDAZA net product sales for the quarter were $141 million, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter, and global VIDAZA sequential quarter growth was 7%.
THALOMID net sales were $94 million for the quarter, down 14% as compared to the year-ago period.
Moving on to the geographic breakdown of REVLIMID sales for the third quarter. Sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $374 million, representing an increase of 7% on a sequential quarter basis and a 37% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. International sales were $267 million, representing an increase of 13% on a sequential quarter basis and a 51% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The international expansion of REVLIMID continues to progress well, and the launch of the product in Japan is on track.
Our non-GAAP product gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2010 was 92.9%, an improvement of 50 basis points over the second quarter of 2010 and about 40 basis points over Q3 of 2009, as REVLIMID contributes positively to our sales mix. We expect the gross margins to come in at about 93% for the full year 2010 for Celgene before including ABRAXANE. ABRAXANE sales in Q4 will somewhat negatively impact Q4 gross margin with a modest effect on the full year.
With respect to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense during the third quarter was $232 million, a sequential increase of 15% over the second quarter. And this quarter, we saw the continuing ramp-up of patient enrollment in our many clinical trials. Versus 2009, for the quarter, we grew R&D by 30%, and for the year-to-date, we have grown R&D expense by 21% as we continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth profile.
Our development efforts cover multiple compounds in more than 25 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key programs include evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. 
We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX.
In addition, we have more than 20 promising compounds in preclinical and early-stage development.
We now expect non-GAAP R&D expense for the full year to be in a range of $890 million to $900 million, including Abraxis. 
Taking a look at SG&A. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $204 million for the third quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4% from the second quarter. Compared to 2009, SG&A grew 18% for the third quarter and 21% for the nine months year-to-date.
We now expect full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $830 million to $840 million, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA, and including estimated integration costs for Abraxis. The current rate of spending in SG&A was driven by investments we are making in our global commercialization infrastructure, and we expect to be able to leverage this spend in future years.
Turning to taxes. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year-to-date through September 30 was 19.4%, and we expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 19% for the full year. For just the third quarter, the rate was 18.5%.
With respect to foreign currency hedging, as you are aware, we hedge our currency exposures, which include balance sheet and transactional exposures as well as non-U.S. dollar exposures related to revenues and expenses. 
This quarter, the impact of foreign currency, including hedging results, on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. During the third quarter, in other income, we realized approximately $6 million in hedging and revaluation gains.
Our hedging objective is to reduce volatility in both cash flow and EPS. Though our single largest exposure continues to be the euro, our currency mix is becoming more diversified as we continue our international expansion.
This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue, earnings and cash flow, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.5 billion. After considering the cash required to complete the Abraxis acquisition and the cash received from the recently completed debt offering, we expect to end 2010 with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Now I'm pleased to provide you with an update on our 2010 full year outlook. Global REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to come in at about $2.45 billion, up from our previous guidance range for REVLIMID of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion. Total global revenue, including Abraxis, is now expected to be approximately $3.6 billion, up from our previous range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $2.78 to $2.80. This compares to a previous range of $2.65 to $2.70. This updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes dilution from the acquisition of Abraxis.
And now to conclude my remarks for today, let me reiterate that the global expansion of all of our franchises continues to progress extremely well. We are producing strong financial performance as a result of excellent operating efficiency and leverage. We are well-positioned to deliver a strong finish to 2010 and are well-prepared to deliver for 2011 and beyond. Investments we are making in both R&D and our global infrastructure today allow us to remain an industry leader with respect to future growth and profitability. 
In order to strengthen our financial flexibility so we can continue to grow via both internal development projects as well as the appropriate external opportunity, in October, we diversified our capital base by executing our first ever public market debt issuance. That issuance went very well and 16-some investors recognized the value of the Celgene model and our prospects for the future. We are quite pleased with the reception we received in the debt markets and can look to the future with a strong balance sheet and access to capital. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob who will elaborate on the activities driving our numbers."

The third quarter was once again an outstanding quarter for REVLIMID. Sales were up 44% year-over-year, with international sales increasing 13% over last quarter. 
VIDAZA also continued its positive trajectory in the third quarter. Total global sales grew 7% quarter-over-quarter to $141 million with international markets contributing 52% of total sales. Strong operating performance across the board. 
Importantly, substantial advancements were also achieved in our pipeline of late-stage assets. Key regulatory trials studying REVLIMID, pomalidomide, apremilast and our proprietary cellular therapy, PDA-001, progressed meaningfully in the quarter. These trials will lead to important near-term new data and ultimately to regulatory filings.
In addition to the outstanding operational and financial results and the advancement of key late-stage programs, several significant key corporate priorities were achieved, including the Abraxis transaction and the recent balance sheet strengthening of initial debt offering. Overall, great progress in our businesses during the quarter.
REVLIMID continued its impressive performance in the third quarter. Growth was strong in all major markets. In the United States, REVLIMID gained market share and now has a 42% share of the overall myeloma market. Increasing duration also remains a key growth driver.
The data from three Phase III trials supporting continuous therapy with REVLIMID has impacted uptake in duration of treatment in the United States. In MDS, our market position in deletion 5Q remains strong. New patient starts were up in the third quarter, and REVLIMID continues to hold an approximately 64% market share in this patient segment.
Similar to the U.S., increases in share and duration drove performance in Europe. In the four major European countries where REVLIMID is reimbursed second line, market share is now approximately 45%. Line 3 share in the five major European markets has also reached 45%.
During our last call, I spoke of the imminent launch of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan. I'm pleased to say that our team in Japan is making substantial progress. We have almost 2,000 physicians registered in REVLIMID, our proprietary risk-management system and early customer experiences have been positive.
We continue to expand access to REVLIMID around the world. We now expect reimbursement in Russia in the first half of 2011. In August, we achieved reimbursement approval in Turkey and during the third quarter, we received regulatory approvals in several countries in Asia and Latin America. REVLIMID is now approved in over 60 countries around the globe.
VIDAZA also had a strong quarter with 37% year-over-year growth. VIDAZA is the only agent to show a survival benefit in MDS and AML patients, and as such, has a very strong position in the market. In the U.S., VIDAZA has a greater than 80% share of newly diagnosed MDS patients who are treated with a hypomethylator. 
In Europe, solid performance in our core markets led to a very positive quarter. VIDAZA continued to gain share and duration of treatment lengthened. As we look ahead, our commercial teams across markets are focused on highlighting the benefits of active therapy for MDS patients, as well as increasing the duration of treatment.
We recently initiated a Phase III study of VIDAZA in elderly patients with AML, and are also exploring multiple combinations with VIDAZA, REVLIMID and other agents across MDS and AML. 
In addition, we have seen positive early results from studies testing oral azacitidine, and we're initiating a clinical development plan to bring this differentiated agent to patients.
Our commercial portfolio has been enhanced by the Abraxis acquisition. The addition of ABRAXANE increases our revenue growth potential and together with the other nab technology products enhances our pipeline. In the near term, our goal is to leverage the strength of our commercial organization and improve the performance of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer. We are integrating sales forces and optimizing marketing campaigns. These activities will continue through the fourth quarter and our plan is to accelerate sales in breast cancer in 2011.
In non-small cell lung cancer, our focus is on filing a quality dossier with the FDA in the first half of next year. We anticipate having top line progression-free survival data by the end of the year or early next year. As you may know, the Phase III study is a double-blind control trial of 1,050 patients with Stage IIIB and Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Response rate is the FDA-approved primary endpoint of the study, while progression-free survival and overall survival are important secondary endpoints. The trial has already met its primary endpoint and as I mentioned, we're awaiting the actual PFS and overall survival data.
We're also very encouraged by the impressive response rate and survival data seen in a Phase II trial evaluating ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. We are increasing the patient size of the Phase III pivotal study from 630 patients to approximately 840 patients to improve the power of the trial. This Phase III trial continues to enrol very well, and expected enrollment will be complete towards the end of 2011.
In addition to breast, lung and pancreatic cancers, ABRAXANE has shown potential in multiple other solid tumors. In the third quarter, ABRAXANE received compendia listing for relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer and has also shown promise in melanoma and bladder cancer. We expect multiple peer-reviewed publications throughout 2011 from these programs.
The Abraxis acquisition was a major strategic transaction, and we're working hard to expeditiously integrate our companies and accelerate key programs and initiatives.
As you can see from the slide, with the addition of Abraxis, we have a meaningful oncology pipeline with multiple compounds, an asset in numerous late-stage trials and a technology platform that enables us to innovate and create potential new therapies.
The trials at our late-stage pipeline have a potential to lead to five additional indications in the next five years. In addition, we're advancing a number of early-stage programs including our torque inhibitor, multiple other research programs from our teams in California and New Jersey, as well as our new nab technology programs from Abraxis.
Our late-stage hematology pipeline is also advancing, and we now have 15 pivotal trials ongoing or planned in hematology. We initiated a Phase III study of pomalidomide and myelofibrosis during the quarter and will soon begin a Phase III international study investigating pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma. 
Promising REVLIMID programs in lymphoma and CLL continued to enroll, and MM-020, the largest myeloma study ever conducted is expected to complete accruing patients by the end of this year.
Based on our ongoing clinical programs, there is a potential for five to 10 additional approvals in distinct hematological indications by 2015.
Many of our hematology programs will be highlighted at the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting in December in Orlando. We're currently aware of more than 140 submitted abstracts on Celgene products in numerous disease settings. 
At this year's ASH, data will be presented that supports REVLIMID's usage in myeloma, MDS, CLL and lymphoma.
Data from a pivotal study evaluating ISTODAX in peripheral T-cell lymphoma will be presented at an oral session. Additionally, new and updated data on pomalidomide and VIDAZA will also be presented. Compelling clinical data is the most important driver of our Hematology/Oncology business. Improved patient outcomes lead to regulatory approvals and ultimately to changes in medical practice.
These [ph] (29:48) ASH abstracts will become available in November. We look forward to sharing data with you at ASH in December. 
As you can see from this slide, there's an incredible amount of activity across our pipeline in the next 15 months. We'll be completing enrollment in many key trials across all three of our franchises. At upcoming major medical meetings there will be extensive clinical data examining the usage of our drugs in numerous disease settings. We expect data from these meetings to support an array of regulatory filings, including submissions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, for REVLIMID and MDS deletion 5q, ISTODAX and PTCL, and ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. 
The Abraxis acquisition represents a major strategic initiative as we expand our therapeutic focus to include solid tumor oncology. Our emerging immune-inflammatory programs represent another high potential therapeutic franchise expansion for Celgene. 
During the last two quarters, we have initiated four out of our six pivotal studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with apremilast. Our Phase III program encompasses approximately 3,500 patients at 450 sites worldwide. Our ambitious but obtainable corporate objective is to have all patients in our pivotal studies enrolled by the end of 2011, with data available as early as mid-2012.
Our proprietary cellular therapies represent an important part of our immune-inflammatory pipeline. We recently initiated a Phase II study of PDA-001 in Crohn's Disease following encouraging data from our Phase I Crohn's study. We're also planning to initiate additional proof of concept studies in a variety of indications later this year and early next year, including multiple sclerosis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.
We believe that our products have great potential on immune-inflammatory conditions. We've made a significant investment in this franchise and are building a deep and diverse pipeline that includes CC-930, our JNK inhibitor, CC-11050, pomalidomide in scleroderma, H11 and PDA-001, a combination of internally discovered and a partner-generated compounds. We feel that inflammation immunology holds great promise for Celgene. By 2015, our goal is to achieve a number of approvals for apremilast while continuing to accelerate the development of this pipeline.
Tremendous progress has been achieved across all three of our major therapeutic franchises. We're  committed to building a preeminent, fully integrated market-leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with unmet medical needs in cancer and immune-inflammatory disease. This mission unifies and focuses us on the urgency of what we do. We have made considerable progress toward the accomplishment of this ambitious goal, and we're committed to accelerating this progress. 
Our businesses have exceptional momentum and are poised to capitalize on the significant R&D investment of the past decade. We now have more than 25 Phase III and pivotal trials that have the potential to produce transformational new data on our products and programs in the coming years.
We're expanding our therapeutic franchise and increasing our investments in high-potential internal and external research and development program to sustain long-term growth. It is our responsibility and objective to maximize this opportunity, to leverage our operating momentum and our financial and strategic assets to fully capitalize on the global potential of Celgene.

There was strong in unit growth across markets and obviously, duration gains contributed. Clearly, in certain markets, the growth parameters will be different. We have market share opportunities across markets. We have more opportunities in terms of market share in some markets, where regulatory approvals are critical to access to newly diagnosed markets. And ultimately, duration gains will be important across all markets, so very much depending on the stage of -- we're talking specifically about myeloma here, we're talking about the market share depending on where we are in terms of development, where we are in terms of duration and regulatory approvals and reimbursement access. And what is also incredibly exciting about REVLIMID is that we expect to see regulatory filings in both the newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe, but also the rest, the deletion 5q MDS in Europe and in other markets, and we're accelerating our development of the follicular lymphoma space and the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and we're looking to continue to accelerate our CLL program. So we've got significant growth and opportunities in myeloma in different regions, with different impacts, depending on where the stage of development is, and also in other indications. So we think we're still not near the end of the REVLIMID growth story."

So it's very important that as we get regulatory approvals, as we broaden the label, we've got to, at the same time, make sure that value proposition is sustained by the data to ensure that we get the same kind of broad reimbursement access that we have in the existing label as we go forward."

Obviously, a regulatory process is one that goes on for a period of time, and there's the review process, though we have very constructive discussions now, there could always be review issues that come up with any application. I can't predict the future, but our goal with REVLIMID is to get a broad front-line approval and broad maintenance claims. Obviously, we're doing many trials. MM-020, which is the R&D trial, we really agree melphalan is not a great agent, and it is one that is problematic. It's not widely prescribed in the United States at all. So it is important, if we're going to fully penetrate newly diagnosed myeloma over time,  we would want R&D as a newly diagnosed therapy eventually included in the label. But hopefully, our steps will be get the existing data from MM-015 and IFM and CALGB, get the label expanded to newly diagnosed and maintenance and then continue to broaden it as the additional MM-020 data comes out. So it is actually important that the label reflect the best therapies available but just -- in summary, we're committed, as soon as possible, to get newly diagnosed and maintenance label claims in the global label around the world and the United States."

The question was about in the similar stage of commercialization of REVLIMID in Europe versus United States, is the duration about the same? Was that the question? I will answer that question anyway. I think, generally, we have seen slightly slower duration gains at the same stage of development in Europe, United States. I think there's a couple of reasons. One, there has been a bit of a more historic focus on treat to best response in Europe, at least that's what we've seen in our commercial efforts so far, and we've made good progress on that front. Additionally, country by country reimbursement, we've had to continue to have to prove the value of extended therapy. And we have been unbelievably successful. I'll give you some example, I don't want to name the country, but there was one country that said you can only have eight months of therapy, max. It took us about 12 months and we got that lifted unlimited. We had other ones that said 10 months or 11 months, so I think initially, it is a more complex payer environment. There were more standards set that we've had to overcome. But in the scheme of things, though we started later in Europe, I think we're taking the experience of understanding how to communicate our messages effectively. And I believe that over time, we're going to see a relatively close duration in Europe versus United States. Certainly, in the major markets of Europe."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our third quarter results and the significant progress that we have made since we last spoke in July. Earlier this morning, we announced record operating and financial results. These results reflect a strong momentum in our businesses and the excellent execution by our teams.
 Numerous important developments in the quarter have the potential to further accelerate our growth prospects, delivering both short- and long-term value to our shareholders. Before Jackie and I talk about the specific operating and financial results of the quarter, let me highlight some of these milestones.
 On October 15, we closed the Abraxis acquisition, adding ABRAXANE and the proprietary nab technology platform to our portfolio. This acquisition provides Celgene with an immediate commercial presence in solid tumor oncology and substantially expands our solid tumor pipeline. We're off to a good start launching Celgene oncology. I'll talk more about the transaction in a few minutes.
 Our confidence to expand our therapeutic focus into oncology is a direct result of the outstanding performance of all functions and geographies in our core Hematology business. In our commercial operations, key business metrics are encouraging across markets, and we continue to expand globally into new territory such as Japan, Russia and China. Our deep and diverse pipeline is a direct result of our sustained R&D investment over the last decade. We now have 25 pivotal trials investigating REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ISTODAX, pomalidomide, apremilast and now ABRAXANE across a number of diseases with high unmet medical needs. With numerous major clinical and regulatory milestones later this year and next, we are beginning to realize the benefits of these investments.
 In addition to the strong progress in hematology and oncology, I'm also excited about the significant accomplishments we have made in our inflammation and immunology programs. We now have six compounds and multiple research programs ongoing. This work is highlighted by the initiation this year of four pivotal studies investigating apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
 We're fortunate to be in a position of strength as we seek to maximize our opportunities and effectively manage through the challenges of uncertain economic times and dynamic markets.
 Before I turn the call over to Jackie, I would like to thank her and her team for their leadership and superb execution of our recent $1.25 billion debut debt offering. Thank you.
 Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.

And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement result",1274," Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call this morning. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call with Celgene, and I'm happy to begin my comments today with some highlights of our income statement results for what was a record quarter for the company.
 Starting with the top line. Non-GAAP total revenue for the third quarter was $908 million, a 31% increase over the third quarter of 2009. This contributed to year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth of 33%. The strong growth was driven by global unit sales growth in our key products REVLIMID and VIDAZA.
 Within total non-GAAP revenues, total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $884 million for the third quarter, up 33% versus the year-ago quarter and bringing year-to-date growth to 34%.
 Furthermore, sequential quarter-to-quarter growth in non-GAAP net product sales was 8%.
 Driven by that revenue growth, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter rose to $350 million, an increase of 35% over the third quarter of 2009. This translates to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75, up 34% versus the third quarter of 2009.
 As you can see from these results, we are leveraging our operating model to produce strong EPS growth at the same time as we invest in a robust R&D pipeline and the ramp-up of our global commercialization infrastructure.
 Turning to individual product results. Third quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $641 million, an increase of 43% over the third quarter of 2009. This growth was driven by share and duration gains, as well as continued geographic expansion. Global REVLIMID sequential quarter growth was 9%.
 VIDAZA net product sales for the quarter were $141 million, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter, and global VIDAZA sequential quarter growth was 7%.
 THALOMID net sales were $94 million for the quarter, down 14% as compared to the year-ago period.
 Moving on to the geographic breakdown of REVLIMID sales for the third quarter. Sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were $374 million, representing an increase of 7% on a sequential quarter basis and a 37% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. International sales were $267 million, representing an increase of 13% on a sequential quarter basis and a 51% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The international expansion of REVLIMID continues to progress well, and the launch of the product in Japan is on track.
 Our non-GAAP product gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2010 was 92.9%, an improvement of 50 basis points over the second quarter of 2010 and about 40 basis points over Q3 of 2009, as REVLIMID contributes positively to our sales mix. We expect the gross margins to come in at about 93% for the full year 2010 for Celgene before including ABRAXANE. ABRAXANE sales in Q4 will somewhat negatively impact Q4 gross margin with a modest effect on the full year.
 With respect to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expense during the third quarter was $232 million, a sequential increase of 15% over the second quarter. And this quarter, we saw the continuing ramp-up of patient enrollment in our many clinical trials. Versus 2009, for the quarter, we grew R&D by 30%, and for the year-to-date, we have grown R&D expense by 21% as we continue to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth profile.
 Our development efforts cover multiple compounds in more than 25 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key programs include evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma, as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL.
 We are also conducting late-stage trials for apremilast, pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX.
 In addition, we have more than 20 promising compounds in preclinical and early-stage development.
 We now expect non-GAAP R&D expense for the full year to be in a range of $890 million to $900 million, including Abraxis.
 Taking a look at SG&A. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $204 million for the third quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4% from the second quarter. Compared to 2009, SG&A grew 18% for the third quarter and 21% for the nine months year-to-date.
 We now expect full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in a range of $830 million to $840 million, as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID and VIDAZA, and including estimated integration costs for Abraxis. The current rate of spending in SG&A was driven by investments we are making in our global commercialization infrastructure, and we expect to be able to leverage this spend in future years.
 Turning to taxes. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year-to-date through September 30 was 19.4%, and we expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 19% for the full year. For just the third quarter, the rate was 18.5%.
 With respect to foreign currency hedging, as you are aware, we hedged our currency exposures, which include balance sheet and transactional exposures as well as non-U.S. dollar exposures related to revenues and expenses.
 This quarter, the impact of foreign currency, including hedging results, on top line revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. During the third quarter, in other income, we realized approximately $6 million in hedging and revaluation gains.
 Our hedging objective is to reduce volatility in both cash flow and EPS. Though our single largest exposure continues to be the euro, our currency mix is becoming more diversified as we continue our international expansion.
 This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue, earnings and cash flow, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.5 billion. After considering the cash required to complete the Abraxis acquisition and the cash received from the recently completed debt offering, we expect to end 2010 with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
 Now I'm pleased to provide you with an update on our 2010 full year outlook. Global REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to come in at about $2.45 billion, up from our previous guidance range for REVLIMID of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion. Total global revenue, including Abraxis, is now expected to be approximately $3.6 billion, up from our previous range of $3.4 billion to $3.45 billion. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $2.78 to $2.80. This compares to a previous range of $2.65 to $2.70. This updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes dilution from the acquisition of Abraxis.
 And now to conclude my remarks for today, let me reiterate that the global expansion of all of our franchises continues to progress extremely well. We are producing strong financial performance as a result of excellent operating efficiency and leverage. We are well-positioned to deliver a strong finish to 2010 and are well-prepared to deliver for 2011 and beyond. Investments we are making in both R&D and our global infrastructure today allow us to remain an industry leader with respect to future growth and profitability.
 In order to strengthen our financial flexibility so we can continue to grow via both internal development projects as well as the appropriate external opportunity, in October, we diversified our capital base by executing our first ever public market debt issuance. That issuance went very well and 16-some investors recognized the value of the Celgene model and our prospects for the future. We are quite pleased with the reception we received in the debt markets and can look to the future with a strong balance sheet and access to capital.
 Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob who will elaborate on the activities driving our numbers.

Excellent results across the globe and across functions. The third quarter was once again an outstanding quarter for REVLIMID. Sales were up 44% year-over-year, with international sales increasing 13% over last quarter.",1770," Thanks, Jackie. Quite a quarter. Excellent results across the globe and across functions. The third quarter was once again an outstanding quarter for REVLIMID. Sales were up 44% year-over-year, with international sales increasing 13% over last quarter.
 VIDAZA also continued its positive trajectory in the third quarter. Total global sales grew 7% quarter-over-quarter to $141 million with international markets contributing 52% of total sales. Strong operating performance across the board.
 Importantly, substantial advancements were also achieved in our pipeline of late-stage assets. Key regulatory trials studying REVLIMID, pomalidomide, apremilast and our proprietary cellular therapy, PDA-001, progressed meaningfully in the quarter. These trials will lead to important near-term new data and ultimately to regulatory filings.
 In addition to the outstanding operational and financial results and the advancement of key late-stage programs, several significant key corporate priorities were achieved, including the Abraxis transaction and the recent balance sheet strengthening of initial debt offering. Overall, great progress in our businesses during the quarter.
 REVLIMID continued its impressive performance in the third quarter. Growth was strong in all major markets. In the United States, REVLIMID gained market share and now has a 42% share of the overall myeloma market. Increasing duration also remains a key growth driver.
 The data from three Phase III trials supporting continuous therapy with REVLIMID has impacted uptake in duration of treatment in the United States. In MDS, our market position in deletion 5Q remains strong. New patient starts were up in the third quarter, and REVLIMID continues to hold an approximately 64% market share in this patient segment.
 Similar to the U.S., increases in share and duration drove performance in Europe. In the four major European countries where REVLIMID is reimbursed second line, market share is now approximately 45%. Line 3 share in the five major European markets has also reached 45%.
 During our last call, I spoke of the imminent launch of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan. I'm pleased to say that our team in Japan is making substantial progress. We have almost 2,000 physicians registered in REVLIMID, our proprietary risk-management system and early customer experiences have been positive.
 We continue to expand access to REVLIMID around the world. We now expect reimbursement in Russia in the first half of 2011. In August, we achieved reimbursement approval in Turkey and during the third quarter, we received regulatory approvals in several countries in Asia and Latin America. REVLIMID is now approved in over 60 countries around the globe.
 VIDAZA also had a strong quarter with 37% year-over-year growth. VIDAZA is the only agent to show a survival benefit in MDS and AML patients, and as such, has a very strong position in the market. In the U.S., VIDAZA has a greater than 80% share of newly diagnosed MDS patients who are treated with a hypomethylator.
 In Europe, solid performance in our core markets led to a very positive quarter. VIDAZA continued to gain share and duration of treatment lengthened. As we look ahead, our commercial teams across markets are focused on highlighting the benefits of active therapy for MDS patients, as well as increasing the duration of treatment.
 We recently initiated a Phase III study of VIDAZA in elderly patients with AML, and are also exploring multiple combinations with VIDAZA, REVLIMID and other agents across MDS and AML.
 In addition, we have seen positive early results from studies testing oral azacitidine, and we're initiating a clinical development plan to bring this differentiated agent to patients.
 Our commercial portfolio has been enhanced by the Abraxis acquisition. The addition of ABRAXANE increases our revenue growth potential and together with the other nab technology products enhances our pipeline. In the near term, our goal is to leverage the strength of our commercial organization and improve the performance of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer. We are integrating sales forces and optimizing marketing campaigns. These activities will continue through the fourth quarter and our plan is to accelerate sales in breast cancer in 2011.
 In non-small cell lung cancer, our focus is on filing a quality dossier with the FDA in the first half of next year. We anticipate having top line progression-free survival data by the end of the year or early next year. As you may know, the Phase III study is a double-blind control trial of 1,050 patients with Stage IIIB and Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Response rate is that FDA-approved primary endpoint of the study, while progression-free survival and overall survival are important secondary endpoints. The trial has already met its primary endpoint and as I mentioned, we're awaiting the actual PFS and overall survival data.
 We're also very encouraged by the impressive response rate and survival data seen in a Phase II trial evaluating ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. We are increasing the patient size of the Phase III pivotal study from 630 patients to approximately 840 patients to improve the power of the trial. This Phase III trial continues to enrol very well, and expected enrollment will be complete towards the end of 2011.
 In addition to breast, lung and pancreatic cancers, ABRAXANE has shown potential in multiple other solid tumors. In the third quarter, ABRAXANE received compendia listing for relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer and has also shown promise in melanoma and bladder cancer. We expect multiple peer-reviewed publications throughout 2011 from these programs.
 The Abraxis acquisition was a major strategic transaction, and we're working hard to expeditiously integrate our companies and accelerate key programs and initiatives.
 As you can see from the slide, with the addition of Abraxis, we have a meaningful oncology pipeline with multiple compounds, an asset in numerous late-stage trials and a technology platform that enables us to innovate and create potential new therapies.
 The trials at our late-stage pipeline have a potential to lead to five additional indications in the next five years. In addition, we're advancing a number of early-stage programs including our torque inhibitor, multiple other research programs from our teams in California and New Jersey, as well as our new nab technology programs from Abraxis.
 Our late-stage hematology pipeline is also advancing, and we now have 15 pivotal trials ongoing or planned in hematology. We initiated a Phase III study of pomalidomide and myelofibrosis during the quarter and will soon begin a Phase III international study investigating pomalidomide in relapsed/refractory myeloma.
 Promising REVLIMID programs in lymphoma and CLL continued to enroll, and MM-020, the largest myeloma study ever conducted is expected to complete accruing patients by the end of this year.
 Based on our ongoing clinical programs, there is a potential for five to 10 additional approvals in distinct hematological indications by 2015.
 Many of our hematology programs will be highlighted at the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting in December in Orlando. We're currently aware of more than 140 submitted abstracts on Celgene products in numerous disease settings.
 At this year's ASH, data will be presented that supports REVLIMID's usage in myeloma, MDS, CLL and lymphoma.
 Data from a pivotal study evaluating ISTODAX in peripheral T-cell lymphoma will be presented at an oral session. Additionally, new and updated data on pomalidomide and VIDAZA will also be presented. Compelling clinical data is the most important driver of our Hematology/Oncology business. Improved patient outcomes lead to regulatory approvals and ultimately to changes in medical practice.
 These [ph] (29:48) ASH abstracts will become available in November. We look forward to sharing data with you at ASH in December.
 As you can see from this slide, there's an incredible amount of activity across our pipeline in the next 15 months. We'll be completing enrollment in many key trials across all three of our franchises. At upcoming major medical meetings there will be extensive clinical data examining the usage of our drugs in numerous disease settings. We expect data from these meetings to support an array of regulatory filings, including submissions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, for REVLIMID and MDS deletion 5q, ISTODAX and PTCL, and ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer.
 The Abraxis acquisition represents a major strategic initiative as we expand our therapeutic focus to include solid tumor oncology. Our emerging immune-inflammatory programs represent another high potential therapeutic franchise expansion for Celgene.
 During the last two quarters, we have initiated four out of our six pivotal studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with apremilast. Our Phase III program encompasses approximately 3,500 patients at 450 sites worldwide. Our ambitious but obtainable corporate objective is to have all patients that are pivotal studies enroll by the end of 2011, with data available as early as mid-2012.
 Our proprietary cellular therapies represent an important part of our immune-inflammatory pipeline. We recently initiated a Phase II study of PDA-001 in Crohn's Disease following encouraging data from our Phase I Crohn's study. We're also planning to initiate additional proof of concept studies in a variety of indications later this year and early next year, including multiple sclerosis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.
 We believe that our products have great potential on immune-inflammatory conditions. We've made a significant investment in this franchise and are building a deep and diverse pipeline that includes CC-930, our JNK inhibitor, CC-11050, pomalidomide in scleroderma, H11 and PDA-001, a combination of internally discovered and a partner-generated compounds. We feel that inflammation immunology holds great promise for Celgene. By 2015, our goal is to achieve a number of approvals for apremilast while continuing to accelerate the development of this pipeline.
 Tremendous progress has been achieved across all three of our major therapeutic franchises. We're  committed to building a preeminent, fully integrated market-leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with unmet medical needs in cancer and immune-inflammatory disease. This mission unifies and focuses us on the urgency of what we do. We have made considerable progress toward the accomplishment of this ambitious goal, and we're committed to accelerating this progress.
 Our businesses have exceptional momentum and are poised to capitalize on the significant R&D investment of the past decade. We now have more than 25 Phase III and pivotal trials that have the potential to produce transformational new data on our products and program in the coming years.
 We're expanding our therapeutic franchise with an increasing investment in high-potential internal and external research and development program to sustain long-term growth. It is our responsibility and objective to maximize this opportunity, to leverage our operating momentum and our financial and strategic assets to fully capitalize on the global potential of Celgene.
 Thank you for your attention on the call. We look forward to answering your questions.

It was strong in unit growth across markets and obviously, duration gains contributed. Clearly, in certain markets, the growth parameters will be different. We have market share opportunities across markets. We have more opportunities in terms of market share in some markets, where regulatory approvals are critical to access to newly diagnosed markets. And ultimately, duration gains will be important across all markets, so very much depending on the stage of -- we're talking specifically about myeloma here, we're talking about the market share depending on where we are in terms of development, where we are in terms of duration and regulatory approvals and reimbursement access. And what is also incredibly exciting about REVLIMID is that we expect to see regulatory filings in both the newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe, but also the rest, the deletion 5q MDS in Europe and in other markets, and we're accelerating our development of the follicular lymphoma space and the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and we're looking to continue to accelerate our CLL program. So we've got significant growth and opportunities in myeloma in different regions, with different impacts, depending on where the stage of development is, and also in other indications. So we think we're still not near the end of the REVLIMID growth story.

So that market segment, over time, assuming a regulatory approval and also we had -- and reimbursement discussions. So there's considerable work to be done. Even with a regulatory approval, we need to make sure that the value proposition will continue to be sustained, because one of the great accomplishments of REVLIMID has been that strong value proposition, the nice endorsement, the regulatory and reimbursement across the globe in terms of Japan, Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden, et cetera. So it's very important that as we get regulatory approvals, as we broaden the label, we've got to, at the same time, make sure that value proposition is sustained by the data to ensure that we get the same kind of broad reimbursement access that we have in the existing label as we go forward.

Japan went from zero to what it achieved. But again, as I mentioned last call, we're building Japan with a quality organization. It's done a great job in terms of approval and reimbursements and making sure that the drug is early, so it had not a major impact on the growth for the third quarter or the second quarter. And though every sale in Japan in the third quarter goes to growth, and there was zero sales in the second quarter, but it was not a meaningful driver of the revenue growth in the quarter.

Obviously, a regulatory process is one that goes on for a period of time, and there's the review process, though we have very constructive discussions. Now, there could always be review issues that come up with any application. I can't predict the future, but our goal with REVLIMID is to get a broad front-line approval and broad maintenance claims. Obviously, we're doing many trials. MM-020, which is the R&D trial, we really agree melphalan is not a great agent, and it is one that is problematic. It's not widely prescribed in the United States at all. So it is important, if we're going to fully penetrate newly diagnosed myeloma over time,  we would want R&D as a newly diagnosed therapy eventually included in the label. But hopefully, our steps will be get the existing data from MM-015 [ph] (44:02) and IFM and CALGB, get the label expanded to newly diagnosed and maintenance and then continue to broaden it as the additional MM-020 data comes out. So it is actually important that the label reflect the best therapies available but -- in summary, we're committed, as soon as possible, to get newly diagnosed and maintenance label claims in the global label around the world and the United States.

The question was about in the similar stage of commercialization of REVLIMID in Europe versus United States, is the duration about the same? Was that the question? I will answer that question anyway. I think, generally, we have seen slightly slower duration gains at the same stage of development in Europe, United States. I think there's a couple of reasons. One, there has been a bit of a more historic focus on treat to best response in Europe, at least that's what we've seen in our commercial efforts so far, and we've made good progress on that front. Additionally, country by country reimbursement, we've had to continue to have to prove the value of extended therapy. And we have been unbelievably successful. I'll give you some example, I don't want to name the country, but there was one country that said you can only have eight months of therapy, max. It took us about 12 months and we got that lifted unlimited. We had other ones that said 10 months or 11 months, so I think initially, it is a more complex payer environment. There were more standards set that we have had to overcome. But in the scheme of things, though we started later in Europe, I think we're taking the experience of understanding how to communicate our messages effectively. And I believe that over time, we're going to see a relatively close duration in Europe versus United States. Certainly, in the major markets of Europe.

With respect to the U.S. sales organization, they'll be fully up and running for a great year in 2011, starting first thing in January there. So everything is on track. And we'll give you an update with the specifics of the details on the dilution estimates when we get to January and give you our guidance for 2011.

And it has always been our intention of divesting non-core assets. Obviously, the closing was less than two weeks ago, so we're just beginning that process, but we are looking at the right process of doing that. And we hope to do that expeditiously, so that would also have a financial impact over time. So as that becomes clearer, we'll provide you an update, but I think Jackie really covered most of it.

And so then we'll begin for follow-up. So that's on track, and I wouldn't anticipate any change to that. On the ABRAXANE data in non-small cell lung cancer, we do expect top line datas to presented. Exactly what is, until we see the data, I can't specifically tell you. But I would expect that at either medical meetings or through other really just -- there will be a very complete review of subset analyses, and all kinds of analysis that will be very important to both the reimbursement of the drug and usage of the drug hopefully following approval and non-small cell lung cancer. So I am optimistic that we'll see a good complete review of the data as quickly possible, and we'll have to determine what the right setting is for that data to be disseminated. But certainly, you'd expect to see good complete data.

I think that there is increasing data being demonstrated -- that the potential synergies of REVLIMID and Rituxan in a number of settings, and specifically one that we aggressively exploring with both investigators and the regulatory agencies around the world, is the REVLIMID Rituxan combination of follicular lymphoma. And obviously, there's some -- as you bring these combinations together, and we want to move this early in treatment as possible to have the maximum new type of patients, we are discussing the exact endpoints and the trial designs. So it is the key corporate goal to have that trial underway as soon as possible. It's not going to be this year, but we're certainly optimistic that it will certainly be in the first half of next year. And we are looking at other uses of that combination, in other leukemias and other other subsets of lymphoma. Thank you very much for your participation and interest, and we look forward to updating you as developments occur, and speaking to you in January. Thank you very much.
