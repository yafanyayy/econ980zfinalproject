For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.For the first quarter, our EPS was $0.22 per share. The first quarter came in above the midpoint of our December guidance by $0.12 per share. This was driven by a few things. First, the $0.05 per share gain during the quarter from the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis. Second, revenue yields that came in better than expected, declining 2.3% in constant dollars versus our December guidance of down 3% to 4%, which was worth $0.04, which came from higher than expected pricing on last minute bookings. Third, a variety of cost-saving measures and timing of certain expenses, which benefited us to the tune of $0.05 per share. All of this was partially offset by higher fuel prices, costing $0.02 per share. In addition, there were other small items going both ways that netted out to zero. Now let's take a look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 9.6% for the first quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 14.5%, while our North American brands grew 5%. As I previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency declined 2.3% in the first quarter versus the prior year.Now let's take a look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields, we saw a yield decline of 4% in local currency. Our North American brands were down 2.6%, driven by declines in all itineraries. Our European brands experienced 6% lower local-currency ticket yields, driven by a challenging winter season in the Brazilian market, which had significant increases in capacity this past winter. If you exclude the six ships we had in Brazil, the European brands only saw a yield decline of 1% in local currency on significantly higher capacity for our continental European brands.For net on board and other yields, we recorded a yield increase of 3% in local currency. The increase was driven by minimum guaranteed payments for calendar year 2009, and a one-time other revenue item related to a litigation settlement. Without these items, the first quarter on board and other yields would have been essentially flat. This is a trend which we anticipated and we are forecasting for the remainder of the year.In summary, because of our advanced bookings, we all know that there's a time lag between the price changes and our revenue yield. So let's keep in mind that as a result of this time lag, for the first quarter of last year, our net revenue yields in local currency only declined 5.2% as the quarter benefited from bookings that were taken prior to the financial crisis in late 2008. However, in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year, we experienced revenue yields that were down about 10% to 12%, thus feeling the full effect of the economic crisis. Therefore, we are very encouraged by the 2.3% decline in the first quarter of this year. I say this because if you combine this year's decline of 2.3% with the 5.2% decline from last year, the combined decline of 7.5% is less than the 10% to 12% decline in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year. We also expect the sequential improvement that we saw in the first quarter will continue throughout the remainder of the year.On the cost side, in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison, you need to exclude the $44 million reduction in other ship operating expenses for the recognition of the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis. When you do that, our cruise costs per lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 4.5% versus the prior year. However, because of the timing of certain expenses, the best measure of cruise costs are on an annual basis, which I'll touch on in a moment.The strength of our revenue and cost performance in the first quarter 2010 was clearly mapped by rising fuel prices. Fuel prices this quarter were 80% higher than last year, and that caused us an additional $176 million or $0.22 per share. However, as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, I'm happy to report that our fuel consumption per ALBD declined 3.1% in the first quarter, continuing our multiple year savings trend.Turning to our 2010 outlook, I'll skip the net revenue yield as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day for the full year, again excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be down 2% to 3%. The decline is driven by the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis, lower drydock costs and tight cost control. Based on the current spike price for fuel, the fuel price for the full year is projected to be $507 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton for 2009, costing an additional $483 million or $0.60 per share. So in the end, fuel is driving our costs up and therefore, in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5%. At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard."

As we indicated in the press release, as a result of the continuing strength of the booking pattern during wave season, we have been able to increase revenue yield items on a local currency basis for 2010 to a 2% to 3% range, from a flat to 1% increase from our previous guidance. Current dollar revenue yields are still forecasted to increase in the 2% to 3% range, as a result of the weakening sterling and euro currencies. During the last nine-week period, on a fleet-wide basis, bookings for the next three quarters are up 8%, with pricing for these bookings running 17% higher on a year-over-year basis. Breaking this down by markets, North American brand bookings are higher by 7%, with pricing up 26% on these bookings and European brand bookings are higher by 10%, with local currency pricing up by 6%.As we indicated during the last quarter call, our cumulative level of bookings had essentially caught up with historical booking levels. And during the late fall, we started to selectively raise pricing. During the wave season, we have been able to more broadly increase pricing and still achieved booking volumes consistent with our capacity increase for the remainder of 2010. North American brands, which have a 3% increase in capacity over the next nine months, pricing on bookings for this last nine-week period had been higher for all itineraries, with particular pricing strength in Europe in long and exotic cruises. As a result of the reduced capacity in the Alaska market, Alaska pricing is showing some improvement, but is still well behind pricing we achieved in prior years. The current strength in the booking pattern for all itineraries is a very positive development for our seasonally-strong third quarter.All North American brands with the exception of Seabourn, are forecasting increased yields for the year, with more significant yield increases forecasted for our premium brands. However, I should remind you that the premium brands took the biggest pricing hit last year, so it's not surprising to see the stronger comeback. Seabourn, our six-star luxury brand, which has a 57% increase in capacity, is forecasting lower yields for the year. So given the attractiveness of Seabourn's pricing in the market, it's a good time for all of you out there who are listening to book a luxury Seabourn cruise.For our European brands, our capacity is up 11% over the remaining three quarters. Pricing for bookings during the last nine-week period is higher for virtually all itineraries, with pricing for European cruises, which makes up the majority of European brand itineraries, running nicely higher year-over-year. With the exception of Costa and AIDA, which have a significant capacity increases, the remaining European brands are forecasting flat pricing in 2010. Pricing for Costa and AIDA is expected to be slightly lower for the year. But given the continuing softness in European economies, this is not a surprising result. Most of the pricing erosion for the Continental European brands will be in the first half of the year, with Costa and Ibero being particularly impacted by a challenging winter season in the Brazil market, that which is what David pointed out, which had a significant increases in capacity in the first quarter.Despite the continuing softness in Spain's economy, our Spanish cruise company, Ibero Cruises has begun to show improvement, with favorable revenue yields forecasted for the remainder of the year, and that's what the 31% increase in capacity. Although the Spanish market continues to be a challenge, we believe this is a market has a great potential and once the economy recovers, Ibero will be a very profitable business for us. To provide some perspective on our European business, it's important to remember that the decline in European revenue yields in 2009 year was far less than what we experienced for our North American brands. Something in the neighborhood of down 6% for Europe versus down 13% in North America. So looking at our yield performance over the two-year period, our European brand revenue yields have held up far better than the North American brands, and the European brands have added far more capacity during this period.On a fleet-wide basis, since our previous guidance last December, we have raised constant dollar revenue forecast by approximately $170 million for 2010. We are also forecasting that cost and expenses, including interest and other items will be lower by approximately $112 million. Offsetting these positive variances, from our December guidance is increased forecasted cost for fuel for the year of $117 million and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which amounts to about $85 million. The net result of all these changes from our previous December guidance is a positive swing of $80 million. So we are increasing our December guidance by $0.10 a share to $2.25 to $2.35 for the year or a midpoint of $2.30.Now let me give you some color on each of the quarters for the remainder of 2010. For the second quarter on an overall basis, our fleet-wide capacity is up 8.3%, 4% for our North American brands, 13% for our European brands. At this juncture, fleet-wide occupancies are about level with last year, slightly higher in North America and slightly lower in Europe, which given the 13% capacity increase in European brands is well within our expectations. We have experienced continued pricing strength in the second quarter bookings during the last nine weeks and as a result, we are now forecasting local currency yield increases in the range of 1% to 2%. With respect to our North American brands for the second quarter, Caribbean itineraries represent 57% of capacity and long and exotic cruises 26%, with the balance of various other itineraries. Pricing for North American brands is slightly higher than a year ago and continues to improve, but of course, there was still -- there is very little inventory left to sell. We expect second quarter North American revenue yields to be higher by approximately 2%.European brands' capacity is 57% in Europe and 35% in long and exotic cruises, with the balance in other itineraries. At the present time, local currency pricing for European brands is slightly lower than last year's levels. Similar to North American brands, there is very little inventory left to sell. European itinerary pricing and occupancy are slightly lower than last year, and we are forecasting local currency European yields also to be slightly lower for the second quarter. As I previously mentioned, for the second quarter, fleet-wide local currency revenue yields are forecasted to be up 1% to 2% and on a current dollar basis, 2.5% to 3.5% versus last year. However, fuel costs are expected to be higher by $176 million versus last year or approximately $0.22 a share. Based on these factors, we are guiding to a $0.26 to $0.30 earnings per share range for the second quarter versus $0.33 for the year-ago second quarter.Now turning to the very important, seasonally important third quarter. On a fleet-wide basis, capacity for the third quarter is up 6.2%. 3.7% of that is for our North American company and 8% for our European company. Fleet-wide occupancies in the third quarter are nicely higher, more significantly higher for North American brands but also higher for our European brands, despite the 8% capacity increase. North American brand capacity in the third quarter is 40% Caribbean, 25% in Alaska, which is down from last year and 16% in Europe, which is also down from last year. Currently, pricing and occupancy are higher for virtually all itineraries, with solid pricing improvements in Europe for the North American brand European programs and more modest pricing improvement for the Alaska programs. While we are seeing pricing improvement in Alaska because of the reduced capacity, Alaska Cruise Tour business is down again from last year and continues to be a challenge for us. Pricing for Caribbean and all other programs is higher and booking momentum over the last nine weeks had been strong. Because of the strong booking environment and currently higher year-over-year occupancies, we have been able to raise ticket pricing and are now forecasting significant increases in North American brand yields in the third quarter.As you know, our forecasted yield guidance includes both ticket prices and onboard and other revenues. But because of the wide dispersion of forecasted pricing in the two revenue streams for our North American brands in the third quarter, I will provide guidance estimates for each revenue stream. Our forecasted ticket revenue yield for the North American brands is now expected to increase in the low double-digit level in the third quarter, reflecting the stronger-than-expected comeback from last year's deeply discounted prices. And our onboard and other pricing is currently forecasted at flat on a year-over-year basis. Combining the two revenue streams, we are forecasting revenue yield improvement in the high single-digit levels for the third quarter. And this is for North America, now I'm talking about.European brands, which are substantially in European itineraries in the third quarter, currently on a combined basis, European brand pricing is slightly lower than a year ago but the pricing gap continues to close as booking demand remains strong. Based on the current booking pattern, we are forecasting flattish to perhaps slightly lower local currency revenue yields for our European brands for the third quarter. As previously said, this is an entirely satisfactory result given the capacity increase in our European brands, combined with the sluggish European economies. On a fleet-wide basis, for the third quarter, combining North America and Europe and our Asia-Pacific brands, we are now forecasting a local currency revenue yield increase in the mid-single-digit levels for the third quarter.Turning now to the fourth quarter. On a fleet-wide basis, capacity for the fourth quarter is up 6%, 6.1%. 1.7% of that is for North American brands and 10.6% for European brands. The fourth quarter booking picture is encouraging, but it's still early in the booking cycle. So I caution not to read too much into the early picture that I will provide you. For North American brands, we are 50%; in Caribbean itineraries, 28%; in long and exotic cruises with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing is higher in virtually all fourth quarter itineraries but with currently lower occupancies. However, fourth quarter booking demand is strengthening at significantly higher pricing and the occupancy gap has closed over the last nine weeks.For European brands, 73% in Europe, the balance in various other itineraries. European itinerary occupancies and local currency pricing are higher year-over-year, and booking demand for European brands is holding steady at pricing well above last year. While it's still early to have a more precise picture for fleet-wide fourth quarter pricing, we are forecasting that local currency revenue yields will be nicely higher in the fourth quarter.And with that, that summary of the outlook, I will turn it back to the operator for questions from everyone. Thank you."

And really the other half has a lot to do with the fact that we perhaps underestimated the favorable impact of all the actions that we had taken to reduce costs.

And now they're feeling, years later, they are now feeling the full impact of the initiative. It will take a similar, if not longer amount of time, to recover. And there are a number of ways to recover and then it's not just additional capacity, but also, as Howard pointed out, our Cruise Tour business, which is what from an economic point of view, is the best business for Alaska because it's into the interior, it's on the motor coaches, it's on the railcars. It's into the hotels in Alaska. That business has been really very, very highly impacted. And to get those jobs back and to get that economic engine going again, it's not just beds but it's cruise tours that have to be sold and marketed.

So I think the operating companies that forecasts their onboard revenue, I think have a tendency not to get overly aggressive in that area.

But onboard, of course, is at the moment, and it's hard to know. In theory, what you're saying should be true. I mean I think once the ticket prices go up and you're getting a slightly different customer buying that or they're feeling better about spending money, you'd expect to see some increase in onboard revenues. But to be honest with you, we haven't put that into the estimates, into the forecast right now. And if it happens, all the better. There's also some changes in the dynamics of onboard revenues. People are spending money differently. There's less challenge in the casino areas because casinos have become so popular on land and that sort of thing. And we were constantly looking for new ways to increase onboard revenues and we've had some good successes. But where it all comes out at the end of the day, we'll know.

For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.For the first quarter, our EPS was $0.22 per share. The first quarter came in above the midpoint of our December guidance by $0.12 per share. This was driven by a few things. First, the $0.05 per share gain during the quarter from the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis. Second, revenue yields that came in better than expected, declining 2.3% in constant dollars versus our December guidance of down 3% to 4%, which was worth $0.04, which came from higher than expected pricing on last minute bookings. Third, a variety of cost-saving measures and timing of certain expenses, which benefited us to the tune of $0.05 per share. All of this was partially offset by higher fuel prices, costing $0.02 per share. In addition, there were other small items going both ways that netted out to zero. Now let's take a look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 9.6% for the first quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 14.5%, while our North American brands grew 5%. As I previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency declined 2.3% in the first quarter versus the prior year.Now let's take a look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields, we saw a yield decline of 4% in local currency. Our North American brands were down 2.6%, driven by declines in all itineraries. Our European brands experienced 6% lower local-currency ticket yields, driven by a challenging winter season in the Brazilian market, which had significant increases in capacity this past winter. If you exclude the six ships we had in Brazil, the European brands only saw a yield decline of 1% in local currency on significantly higher capacity for our continental European brands.For net on board and other yields, we recorded a yield increase of 3% in local currency. The increase was driven by minimum guaranteed payments for calendar year 2009, and a one-time other revenue item related to a litigation settlement. Without these items, the first quarter on board and other yields would have been essentially flat. This is a trend which we anticipated and we are forecasting for the remainder of the year.In summary, because of our advanced bookings, we all know that there's a time lag between the price changes and our revenue yield. So let's keep in mind that as a result of this time lag, for the first quarter of last year, our net revenue yields in local currency only declined 5.2% as the quarter benefited from bookings that were taken prior to the financial crisis in late 2008. However, in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year, we experienced revenue yields that were down about 10% to 12%, thus feeling the full effect of the economic crisis. Therefore, we are very encouraged by the 2.3% decline in the first quarter of this year. I say this because if you combine this year's decline of 2.3% with the 5.2% decline from last year, the combined decline of 7.5% is less than the 10% to 12% decline in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year. We also expect the sequential improvement that we saw in the first quarter will continue throughout the remainder of the year.On the cost side, in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison, you need to exclude the $44 million reduction in other ship operating expenses for the recognition of the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis. When you do that, our cruise costs per lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 4.5% versus the prior year. However, because of the timing of certain expenses, the best measure of cruise costs are on an annual basis, which I'll touch on in a moment.The strength of our revenue and cost performance in the first quarter 2010 was clearly mapped by rising fuel prices. Fuel prices this quarter were 80% higher than last year, and that caused us an additional $176 million or $0.22 per share. However, as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, I'm happy to report that our fuel consumption per ALBD declined 3.1% in the first quarter, continuing our multiple year savings trend.Turning to our 2010 outlook, I'll skip the net revenue yield as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day for the full year, again excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be down 2% to 3%. The decline is driven by the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis, lower drydock costs and tight cost control. Based on the current spike price for fuel, the fuel price for the full year is projected to be $507 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton for 2009, costing an additional $483 million or $0.60 per share. So in the end, fuel is driving our costs up and therefore, in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5%. At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard."

As we indicated in the press release, as a result of the continuing strength of the booking pattern during wave season, we have been able to increase revenue yield items on a local currency basis for 2010 to a 2% to 3% range, from a flat",1822,"Thank you, David. As we indicated in the press release, as a result of the continuing strength of the booking pattern during wave season, we have been able to increase revenue yield items on a local currency basis for 2010 to a 2% to 3% range, from a flat to 1% increase from our previous guidance. Current dollar revenue yields are still forecasted to increase in the 2% to 3% range, as a result of the weakening sterling and euro currencies. During the last nine-week period, on a fleet-wide basis, bookings for the next three quarters are up 8%, with pricing for these bookings running 17% higher on a year-over-year basis. Breaking this down by markets, North American brand bookings are higher by 7%, with pricing up 26% on these bookings and European brand bookings are higher by 10%, with local currency pricing up by 6%.As we indicated during the last quarter call, our cumulative level of bookings had essentially caught up with historical booking levels. And during the late fall, we started to selectively raise pricing. During the wave season, we have been able to more broadly increase pricing and still achieved booking volumes consistent with our capacity increase for the remainder of 2010. North American brands, which have a 3% increase in capacity over the next nine months, pricing on bookings for this last nine-week period had been higher for all itineraries, with particular pricing strength in Europe in long and exotic cruises. As a result of the reduced capacity in the Alaska market, Alaska pricing is showing some improvement, but is still well behind pricing we achieved in prior years. The current strength in the booking pattern for all itineraries is a very positive development for our seasonally-strong third quarter.All North American brands with the exception of Seabourn, are forecasting increased yields for the year, with more significant yield increases forecasted for our premium brands. However, I should remind you that the premium brands took the biggest pricing hit last year, so it's not surprising to see the stronger comeback. Seabourn, our six-star luxury brand, which has a 57% increase in capacity, is forecasting lower yields for the year. So given the attractiveness of Seabourn's pricing in the market, it's a good time for all of you out there who are listening to book a luxury Seabourn cruise.For our European brands, our capacity is up 11% over the remaining three quarters. Pricing for bookings during the last nine-week period is higher for virtually all itineraries, with pricing for European cruises, which makes up the majority of European-brand itineraries, running nicely higher year-over-year. With the exception of Costa and AIDA, which have a significant capacity increases, the remaining European brands are forecasting flat pricing in 2010. Pricing for Costa and AIDA is expected to be slightly lower for the year. But given the continuing softness in European economies, this is not a surprising result. Indeed, most of the pricing erosion for the Continental European brands will be in the first half of the year, with Costa and Ibero being particularly impacted by a challenging winter season in the Brazil market, that which is what David pointed out, which had a significant increase in capacity in the first quarter.Despite the continuing softness in Spain's economy, our Spanish cruise company, Ibero Cruises has begun to show improvement, with stable revenue yields forecasted for the remainder of the year, and that's worth the 31% increase in capacity. Although the Spanish market continues to be a challenge, we believe this is a market has a great potential and once the economy recovers, Ibero will be a very profitable business for us. To provide some perspective on our European business, it's important to remember that the decline in European revenue yields in the 2009 year was far less than what we experienced for our North American brands; something in the neighborhood of down 6% for Europe versus down 13% in North America. So looking at our yield performance over the two-year period, our European brand revenue yields have held up far better than the North American brands, and the European brands have added far more capacity during this period.On a fleet-wide basis, since our previous guidance last December, we have raised constant dollar revenue forecast by approximately $170 million for 2010. We are also forecasting that cost and expenses, including interest and other items, will be lower by approximately $112 million. Offsetting these positive variances, from our December guidance is increased forecasted cost for fuel for the year of $117 million and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which amounts to about $85 million. The net result of all these changes from our previous December guidance is a positive swing of $80 million. So we are increasing our December guidance by $0.10 a share to $2.25 to $2.35 for the year or a midpoint of $2.30.Now let me give you some color on each of the quarters for the remainder of 2010. For the second quarter on an overall basis, our fleet-wide capacity is up 8.3%, 4% for our North American brands, 13% for our European brands. At this juncture, fleet-wide occupancies are about level with last year, slightly higher in North America and slightly lower in Europe, which given the 13% capacity increase in European brands is well within our expectations. We have experienced continued pricing strength in the second quarter bookings during the last nine weeks and as a result, we are now forecasting local currency yield increases in the range of 1% to 2%. With respect to our North American brands for the second quarter, Caribbean itineraries represent 57% of capacity and long and exotic cruises 26%, with the balance of various other itineraries. Pricing for North American brands is slightly higher than a year ago and continues to improve, but of course, there is very little inventory left to sell. We expect second quarter North American revenue yields to be higher by approximately 2%.European brands' capacity is 57% in Europe and 35% in long and exotic cruises, with the balance in other itineraries. At the present time, local currency pricing for European brands is slightly lower than last year's levels. Similar to North American brands, there is very little inventory left to sell. European itinerary pricing and occupancy are slightly lower than last year, and we are forecasting local currency European yields also to be slightly lower for the second quarter. As I previously mentioned, for the second quarter, fleet-wide local currency revenue yields are forecasted to be up 1% to 2% and on a current dollar basis, 2.5% to 3.5% versus last year. However, fuel costs are expected to be higher by $176 million versus last year or approximately $0.22 a share. Based on these factors, we are guiding to a $0.26 to $0.30 earnings per share range for the second quarter versus $0.33 for the year-ago second quarter.Now turning to the very important, seasonally important third quarter. On a fleet-wide basis, capacity for the third quarter is up 6.2%. 3.7% of that is for our North American company and 8% for our European company. Fleet-wide occupancies in the third quarter are nicely higher, more significantly higher for North American brands but also higher for our European brands, despite the 8% capacity increase. North American brand capacity in the third quarter is 40% Caribbean, 25% in Alaska, which is down from last year and 16% in Europe, which is also down from last year. Currently, pricing and occupancy are higher for virtually all itineraries, with solid pricing improvements in Europe for the North American brand European programs and more modest pricing improvement for the Alaska programs. While we are seeing pricing improvement in Alaska because of the reduced capacity, Alaska Cruise Tour business is down again from last year and continues to be a challenge for us. Pricing for Caribbean and all other programs is higher and booking momentum over the last nine weeks has been strong. Because of the strong booking environment and currently higher year-over-year occupancies, we have been able to raise ticket pricing and are now forecasting significant increases in North American brand yields in the third quarter.As you know, our forecasted yield guidance includes both ticket prices and onboard and other revenues. But because of the wide dispersion of forecasted pricing in the two revenue streams for our North American brands in the third quarter, I will provide guidance estimates for each revenue stream. Our forecasted ticket revenue yield for the North American brands is now expected to increase in the low double-digit level in the third quarter, reflecting the stronger-than-expected comeback from last year's deeply discounted prices. And our onboard and other pricing is currently forecasted at flat on a year-over-year basis. Combining the two revenue streams, we are forecasting revenue yield improvement in the high single-digit levels for the third quarter. And this is for North America, now I'm talking about.European brands, which are substantially in European itineraries in the third quarter, currently on a combined basis, European brand pricing is slightly lower than a year ago, but the pricing gap continues to close as booking demand remains strong. Based on the current booking pattern, we are forecasting flattish to perhaps slightly lower local currency revenue yields for our European brands for the third quarter. As previously said, this is an entirely satisfactory result given the capacity increase in our European brands, combined with the sluggish European economies. On a fleet-wide basis, for the third quarter, combining North America, Europe and our Asia-Pacific brands, we are now forecasting a local currency revenue yield increase in the mid-single-digit levels for the third quarter.Turning now to the fourth quarter. On a fleet-wide basis, capacity for the fourth quarter is up 6%, 6.1%. 1.7% of that is for North American brands and 10.6% for European brands. The fourth quarter booking picture is encouraging, but it's still early in the booking cycle. So I caution not to read too much into the early picture that I will provide you. For North American brands, we are 50%; in Caribbean itineraries, 28%; in long and exotic cruises with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing is higher in virtually all fourth quarter itineraries, but with currently lower occupancies. However, fourth quarter booking demand is strengthening at significantly higher pricing and the occupancy gap has closed over the last nine weeks.For European brands, 73% in Europe, the balance in various other itineraries. European itinerary occupancies and local currency pricing are higher year-over-year, and booking demand for European brands is holding steady at pricing well above last year. While it's still early to have a more precise picture for fleet-wide fourth quarter pricing, we are forecasting that local currency revenue yields will be nicely higher in the fourth quarter.And with that, that summary of the outlook, I will turn it back to the operator for questions from everyone. Thank you."

I think a large measure, a lot of that business has come from a demographic that's not as much affected by the economic cycles and unemployment issues and so forth. And you know, even in the UK, unemployment is not at the same levels as they are in the U.S. They're somewhere in the mid-7% I think. So basically, business is holding up quite nicely in the UK. We are adding the P&O Azura, which arrives in April, starts to sail in April. And then at the end of the year, I think some time September, we have the Queen Elizabeth that's added to the Cunard feet.

And there are a number of ways to recover and then it's not just additional capacity, but also, as Howard pointed out, our Cruise Tour business, which is what from an economic point of view, is the best business for Alaska because it's into the interior, it's on the motor coaches, it's on the railcars. It's into the hotels in Alaska. That business has been really very, very highly impacted. And to get those jobs back and to get that economic engine going again, it's not just beds but it's cruise tours that have to be sold and marketed.

I don't think we're going to know that for a while, but clearly, that's the focus of our revenue managers. But it does look like it is coming back a lot faster in North America.

I mean I think once the ticket prices go up and you're getting a slightly different customer buying that or they're feeling better about spending money, you'd expect to see some increase in onboard revenues. But to be honest with you, we haven't put that into the estimates, into the forecast right now. And if it happens, all the better. There's also some changes in the dynamics of onboard revenues. People are spending money differently. There's less challenge in the casino areas because casinos have become so popular on land and that sort of thing. And we were constantly looking for new ways to increase onboard revenues and we've had some good successes. But where it all comes out at the end of the day, we'll know.

For the second quarter our earnings per share was $0.32. The second quarter came in above the midpoint of our March guidance by $0.04 per share, despite a $0.02 impact from the volcanic ash and the Chilean earthquake disruption.
Net revenue yields in local currency came in at 2%, and the higher end of our March guidance, which was worth $0.02 per share, even with these disruptions which impacted yields by half a point. In addition, our ongoing cost reductions were better than forecasted and were also worth $0.02 per share.
Now let us take a look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year, our capacity increased 8% for the second quarter of 2010 with the majority of the increase going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 13% while our North American brands grew 4%. As I previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency increased 2% in the second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.
Now let’s take a look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields we saw a yield increase of 1.6% in local currency. Our North American brands were up 3.8% driven by increases in Europe, Alaska and other exotic itineraries. Our European brands experienced 1.2% lower local currency ticket yields, which were in line with our expectation. Similar to the first quarter the declines were driven by challenging winter season in the Brazilian market, with significant increases this past winter. If you exclude the five ships that Costa Nibura [ph] had in Brazil in the month of March, the European brands net ticket revenue yields in local currency was flat. We were pleased with this performance given the economic uncertainty and the significantly higher capacity for our continental European brands.
For net onboard and other yields, we reported a yield increase of 3.1% in local currency. The increase occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. Our North American brands were up 4.6%, and our European brands were up 3.2% in local currency. This was clearly better than had expected in our March guidance. Keep in mind that the second quarter actual is again easy comps as the second quarter last year was at the low point for on board and other revenue yields. As a result of our second quarter performance, the operating companies have raised their forecast for onboard and other revenue yield slightly for the back half of the year.
On the March call, I indicated that excluding a couple of one-time first-quarter items, our expectations for the full year was flat given that the first quarter was flat. However, given the increase in the second quarter, our June guidance for the full year, also excluding the same one-time items in the first quarter, is an increase of approximately 1%.
In summary, we were very encouraged by the 2% increase in net revenue yields in the second quarter, which was the first time we saw positive revenue yields since late 2008. As Howard will discuss later, we expect greater improvements in yields the reminder of the year.
On the cost side, cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 4.9% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by fewer dry docks, economies of scale relating to double-digit growth at certain of our brands, benefits from cost reduction programs, a low inflationary environment, and the timing of certain SG&A expenses. However, the strength of our revenue and cost performance in the second quarter of 2010 were once again masked by rising fuel prices. Fuel prices this quarter were 64% higher than last year, costing us $162 million or $0.20 per share. One final note on cost, as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, our fuel consumption per ALB day declined 3.3% in the second quarter, continuing our multiple year savings trend.
Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yield outlook, as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day for the third quarter, excluding fuel and in local currency are projected to be up 1% to 2%. This was driven by $39 million charge relating to a closed multi-employer pension plan for certain British officers. The multi-employer pension plan accounting rules require us to expense required participant contribution to fund plan deficit, when the invoices are received.
Excluding this charge, net cruise cost for available lower berth day, excluding fuel in the third quarter would have been projected to be flat to down 1%. For the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency are projected to be down 2.5% to 3.5%. This decline is driven by our ongoing cost reductions, the first quarter gain on the sale of the P&O Cruises' Artemis and lower dry dock costs.
Since we first gave guidance for 2010 six months ago, we have taken a full percentage point of our cost guidance. Our ongoing cost reduction programs are yielding more savings than we anticipated in a variety of areas such as insurance, ports, and crew travel just to name a few. Based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $495 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton for 2009, costing an additional $440 million or $0.55 per share. So in the end fuel is driving our cost up and therefore in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% to 2%.
At this point I will turn the call back over to Howard.

On a fleet-wide basis, booking volumes and pricing since our last earnings call, that is for the last 13 weeks or so. Covering the next three quarters have held up quite well. Even booking volumes for the last six weeks, during the significant downturn in global equity markets have held up well, although we have seen reduced booking volumes for certain itineraries, which I will comment on later.
For our North American brands on slightly lower year-over-year booking volumes for the last 13 weeks, we have experienced double-digit price increases. Keep in mind our comparisons of this year's booking volumes are against a 26% increase in booking volumes for the same period as last year, when we were selling at deeply discounted prices to move our inventory.
With respect to bookings per itinerary, during the last 13 weeks for North American brands we have seen strong volumes in pricing for Caribbean programs, which comprise 52% of North American brand capacity over the next three quarters. Alaska, which is 11% of our North American capacity on lower booking volumes have experienced significantly higher year-over-year pricing, and Europe itineraries, which comprise 9% of our capacity has also experienced lower booking volumes, but with significantly higher pricing as well.
We have also seen stronger year-over-year pricing for our Mexican Riviera itineraries for the first time in a while. All of our North American brand itineraries have booked quite well during this 13 week period with good pricing.
For our European brands during the last 13 weeks, booking volumes for the next three quarters have been quite strong with moderate year-over-year local pricing improvements. Booking volumes for European itineraries during the 13 week period, which comprise two thirds of European brand capacity during the next nine months, had been higher and are keeping pace with year-over-year European brand capacity increases. These bookings are showing moderate increases in prices on a local currency basis, which is quite satisfactory considering the large increase in European brand capacity during the next nine months.
So looking back over the last 13 weeks, it is fair to say that demand for cruises has been solid, and we have continued to achieve higher year-over-year price increases. Now let me talk a little bit about the last six weeks, beginning in early May the effect of the volcanic ash issue in the UK and Western Europe did cause nervousness about air travel, particularly for North American consumers taking airline flights across the Atlantic. Compounding this was the European sovereign debt crisis and the resultant negative effect it had on global equity markets. Indeed, from late April to let May, US equity markets as we all know were down about 12% or so.
We believe this caused consumers, especially those in North America, to rethink their discretionary travel decisions. But even with these events, fleetwide bookings for the last six weeks for our cruises over the next three quarters continue to run ahead of last year on a fleetwide basis, significantly ahead for Europe, France and just slightly behind for North American brands and prices for bookings for North America and Europe brands continue to be running nicely.
Looking at bookings over the last six weeks by major trades for North American brands, Caribbean itineraries, which are more than 50% of North American capacity over the next nine months continue to be strong at higher prices. Bookings for Alaska cruises, however, ran behind the last six week period, but at substantially higher prices. But fortunately there is very little Alaskan inventory left to sell.
Bookings for North American brands Europe programs were also lower, but there was also not much inventory left to sell in Europe for the remainder of the year. Despite the brief slowdown in these trades, we're still expecting significant year-over-year price improvement for Alaska and Europe for 2010. We have seen anecdotally over the last couple of weeks with the recent strength in the equity markets that demand in North America for these trades have started to pick up.
Interestingly, the effect of these external events seems to have been felt more in North American markets than in European markets. Our European brand bookings during the last six week period had held up extremely well with significant improvement in booking volumes and solid improvement in year-over-year local currency pricing. This is yet another example of how the European consumer appears to be more resilient to geopolitical and economic events than is their American counterpart.
So to sum this all up, despite the events that have occurred around the world over the last six weeks, people are still booking their vacations and our business has held up quite well.
Now turning to our full-year earnings guidance, as we indicated in the press release we are maintaining earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 a share. Since our first quarter guidance, currency movements, largely the result of the strengthening dollar, net of lower forecasted fuel prices for the second half of the year have caused a 7% per share downdraft in our earnings. Offsetting this has been the better than forecasted second quarter earnings of $0.04, and another $0.03 resulting from lower than expected costs in the second half of the year. When we combine these moments we get back to the same earnings guidance as we provided last March.
Now let me take you through some of the color for each of the next three quarters. For the third quarter fleetwide capacity is 6.2% higher than last year, 3.7% in North America, 8% for Europe brands. At this point with very little inventory left to sell in the quarter, fleetwide capacity is slightly ahead, or fleetwide occupancy, I should say, is slightly ahead year-over-year with local currency pricing well ahead.
The North American brands during the quarter had 41% in the Caribbean, 25% in Alaska, 17% in Europe. Overall pricing for North American brands is well ahead of last year with slightly better occupancies. Even pricing for Mexican Riviera cruises out of California, which has been a struggle for us over the last couple of years to showing nice improvement. We're expecting that third-quarter ticket pricing for North American brands increase in the low double-digit levels by the time the third quarter closes.
For European brands there are 97% in European itineraries in the third quarter. Currently pricing for Europe brands is slightly higher year-over-year, which is a very positive sign given the 8% capacity increase in our European fleet during the quarter. All brands are performing well, although pricing for our Spanish cruise brand, Ibero Cruises, which had a 37% increase in capacity in the quarter is expected to be lower.
By the time the quarter closes out, we're expecting European brands pricing to be flattish year-over-year, which is a very good result, given the 8% increase in capacity. As I indicated in the press release, or as we indicated in the press release, we are forecasting third quarter fleetwide revenue yields will increase in the 5% to 6% range on a local currency basis, flat to up slightly on a current dollar basis. Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be higher by 1% to 2% on a local currency basis largely as a result of the British officer pension fund charge that David referred to earlier.
On a local currency basis, costs excluding fuel are expected to be lower in the 2% to 3% range. Fuel costs for the third quarter is expected to be higher by $74 million year-over-year, or $0.09 a share, and as we indicated in the press release, earnings are forecasted to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.47 for the quarter versus a $1.33 in the third quarter of 2009. So it is nice to get back to positive earnings improvements on a quarterly basis.
Now turning to the fourth quarter, fleetwide capacity is up 6.1% in the quarter, 1.7% in North America and 10.6% in Europe. One an overall basis, fourth-quarter occupancy is slightly lower with local currency pricing running nicely higher. North American brands in the fourth quarter are 50% in the Caribbean, with all other itineraries individually below 10%. At the present time, pricing is running nicely ahead year-over-year with lower occupancies. However, booking volumes for the fourth quarter for North American brands continue to be strong, and by the time the quarter closes we are expecting pricing to be nicely higher year-over-year.
European brands were 73% in Europe in the fourth quarter with all other itineraries individually under 10%. Europe itinerary pricing on a local currency basis is nicely ahead of last year with slightly better occupancy. Bookings continued to be strong for the fourth quarter, and we are forecasting that by the time the fourth quarter closes, Europe brand local currency pricing will be higher year-over-year, which is a very good result, considering that 10% plus capacity increase that we had during the quarter. On a fleetwide basis, we expect fourth-quarter revenue yields to be up approximately 3% on a local currency basis. That is combining Europe and North America, and I should add it is nice to see a positive sign for European pricing, which we haven't had in quite some time, and that is despite the considerable increases we have had in capacity, which has been absorbed quite nicely. And we have been able to expand our markets at the same time in Europe.
So now I'm going to turn to the fourth-quarter of 2011, where our fleetwide capacity is going to be up 6.6%, 3.8% for North American brands and 11.7% for European brands. Let me emphasize that the first quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development, and it is provided to give you a picture of how the quarter is shaping up at the present time. Overall, first quarter pricing is running higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancy running slightly behind. This is a pattern that is similar to the fourth-quarter for 2010. North American brands are 66%, and the Caribbean 11%, and Mexican Riviera cruise is the balance in all other itineraries. Presently Caribbean pricing is slightly higher on lower occupancies, and Mexican Riviera pricing is higher on higher occupancies. Pricing on virtually all other itineraries, mostly longer premium price cruises is higher on lower occupancies.
European brands are 25% in European itineraries, 23% in the Caribbean, and 18% in South America, with the remaining in various other itineraries. Local currency pricing for Europe and South America cruises is running higher on lower occupancies, and pricing for European brand Caribbean cruises is higher on higher occupancy. Overall pricing in local currency for European brand cruises is nicely higher at this time, with occupancies when you combine it all are at the same level as the prior year, and that is adjusted for the 11.7% capacity we had in the first quarter. Again, I caution, this is an early picture for Q1 of 2011, and not to read too much into this information.
And with that Sarah, I'm going to turn back to you for questions. Thank you.

There might be a slight increase in fuel consumption, because we had to navigate around what may be the worst areas, but the ships are being inspected every time they return to the US. We haven't had to clean a haul once, yet, we have seen no slowdown in booking pattern.
Clearly we are offering an outstanding vacation option for people in that region, and one that they don't have to concern themselves with the spill during their vacation. We are, in an attempt to try to help the region, we are encouraging on Carnival’s website people stay a day or two before and after the cruise in the region to try to kind of stimulate tourism in the region. But from our point of view it hasn't affected business at all.

For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For the second quarter, our earnings per share was $0.32. The second quarter came in above the midpoint of our March guidance by $0.04 per share, despite a $0.02 impact from the volcanic ash and the Chilean earthquake disruption. Net revenue yields in local currency came in up 2% at the higher end of our March guidance, which was worth $0.02 per share, even with these disruptions, which impacted yields by half a point. In addition, our ongoing cost reductions were better than forecasted and were also worth $0.02 per share.
Now let's take a look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 8% for the second quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 13%, while our North American brands grew 4%. As I've previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency increased 2% in the second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.
Now let's take a look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields, we saw our yield increase up 1.6% in local currency. Our North American brands were up 3.8%, driven by increases in Europe, Alaska and other exotic itineraries. Our European brands experienced 1.2% lower local currency ticket yields, which were in line with our expectations.
Similar to the first quarter, the declines were driven by challenging winter season in the Brazilian market, with significant capacity increases this past winter. If you exclude the five ships that Costa and Ibero had in Brazil in the month of March, the European brands' net ticket revenue yields in local currency was flat. We were pleased with this performance, given the economic uncertainty and the significantly higher capacity for our Continental European brands.
For net onboard and other revenue yields, we reported a yield increase up 3.1% in local currency. The increase occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. Our North American brands were up 4.6%, and our European brands were up 3.2% in local currency. This was clearly better than we had expected in our March guidance.
Keep in mind that the second quarter actual is against easy comps, as the second quarter last year was at the low point for onboard and other revenue yields. As a result of our second quarter performance, the operating companies have raised their forecasts for onboard and other revenue yields slightly for the back half of the year.
On the March call, I indicated that excluding a couple of onetime first quarter items, our expectations for the full year was flat, given that the first quarter was flat. However, given the increase in the second quarter, our June guidance for the full year, also excluding the same onetime items in the first quarter, is an increase of approximately 1%.
In summary, we were very encouraged by the 2% increase in net revenue yields in the second quarter, which was the first time we saw positive revenue yields since late 2008. As Howard will discuss later, we expect greater improvement in yields for the remainder of the year.
On the cost side, cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 4.9% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by fewer dry docks, economies of scale relating to double-digit growth at certain of our brands, benefits from cost reduction programs, a low inflationary environment and the timing of certain SG&A expenses. However, the strength of our revenue and cost performance in the second quarter of 2010 were once again masked by rising fuel prices. Fuel prices this quarter were 64% higher than last year, costing us $162 million or $0.20 per share. One final note on costs. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, our fuel consumption per ALBD declined 3.3% in the second quarter, continuing our multiple-year savings trend.
Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day for the third quarter, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be up 1% to 2%. This was driven by a $39 million charge, relating to a closed multi-employer pension plan for certain British officers. The multi-employer pension plan accounting rules require us to expense required participant contribution to fund plan deficits when the invoices are received. Excluding this charge, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel for the third quarter would've been projected to be flat to down 1%. 
For the full year, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency are projected to be down 2.5% to 3.5%. The decline is driven by our ongoing cost reductions, the first quarter gain on the sale of the P&O Cruises' Artemis and lower dry dock costs. 
Since we first gave guidance for 2010 six months ago, we have taken a full percentage point off our cost guidance. Our ongoing cost-reduction programs are yielding more savings than we anticipated in a variety of areas such as insurance, ports and crew travel, just to name a few.
Based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $495 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton for 2009, costing an additional $440 million or $0.55 per share. So in the end, fuel is driving our costs up. And therefore in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% to 2%. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard."

Okay, let me go over the tone of business with you. On a fleet-wide basis, booking volumes and pricing since our last earnings call, that's in the last 13 weeks or so, covering the next three quarters have held up quite well.",1852,"Thank you. Thank you, David. Okay, let me go over the tone of business with you. On a fleet-wide basis, booking volumes and pricing since our last earnings call, that's in the last 13 weeks or so, covering the next three quarters have held up quite well. Even booking volumes for the last six weeks during the significant downturn in global equity  markets have held up well. Although we have seen reduced booking volumes for certain itineraries, which I'll comment on later. 
For our North American brands on slightly lower year-over-year booking volumes for the last 13 weeks, we have experienced double-digit price increases. Keep in mind, our comparisons of this year's booking volumes are against a 26% increase in booking volumes for the same period as last year, when we were selling at deeply discounted prices to move our inventory.
With respect to bookings by itinerary, during the last 13 weeks for North American brands, we have seen strong volumes and pricing for Caribbean programs, which comprise 52% of North American brand capacity over the next three quarters. Alaska, which is 11% of our North American capacity, on lower booking volumes have experienced significantly higher year-over-year pricing. And Europe itineraries, which comprise 9% of our capacity has also experienced lower booking volumes, but with significantly higher pricing as well. We have also seen stronger year-over-year pricing for our Mexican Riviera itinerary for first time in a while. All of our North American brand itineraries have booked quite well during this 13-week period with good pricing.
For our European brands during the last 13 weeks, booking volumes for the next three quarters have been quite strong, with moderate year-over-year local current pricing improvements. Booking volumes for European itineraries during the 13-week period, which comprise 2/3 of European brand capacity during the next nine months have been higher and are keeping pace with year-over-year European brand capacity increases. These bookings are showing moderate increases in prices on a local currency basis, which is quite satisfactory considering the large increase in European brand capacity during the next nine months. So looking back over the last 13 weeks, it's fair to say that demand for cruises had been solid, and we have continued to achieve higher year-over-year price increases.
Now let me talk a little bit about the last six weeks. Beginning in early May, the effect of the volcanic ash issue in the U.K. and Western Europe did cause nervousness about air travel, particularly for North American consumers taking airline flights across the Atlantic. Compounding this was the European sovereign debt crisis and the resulting negative effect it had on global equity markets. Indeed from late April to late May, U.S. equity markets, as we all know, were down about 12% or so. We believe this caused consumers, especially those in North America, to rethink their discretionary travel decisions. But even with these events, fleet-wide bookings for the last six weeks for our cruises over the next three quarters continue to run ahead of last year on a fleet-wide basis, significantly ahead for Europe brands and just slightly behind for North American brands. And prices for bookings for North America and Europe brands continue to be running nicely higher.
Looking at bookings over the last six weeks by major trades for North American brands, Carribean itineraries, which are more than 50% of North American capacity over the next nine months continued to be strong at higher prices. Bookings for Alaska cruises, however, ran behind the last six-week period but at substantially higher prices. But fortunately, there is very little Alaska inventory left to sell.
Bookings from North American brand Europe programs were also lower, but there also not much inventory left to sell in Europe for the remainder of the year. Despite the brief slowdown in these trades, we are still expecting significant year-over-year pricing improvement for Alaska and Europe for 2010. We have seen anecdotally over the last couple of weeks, with the recent strength in the equity markets, that demand in North America for these trades are starting to pick up.
Interestingly, the effect of these external events seems to have been felt more in North American  markets than in European markets. Our European brand bookings during the last six-week period has held up extremely well, with significant improvement in booking volumes and solid improvement in year-over-year local currency pricing. This is yet another example of how the European consumer appears to be more resilient to geopolitical and economic events than is their American counterpart. So to sum this all up, despite the events that have occurred around the world over the last six weeks, people are still booking their vacations and our business has held up quite well.
Now turning to our full year earnings guidance. As we indicated in the press release, we are maintaining earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 a share. Since our first quarter guidance, currency movements, largely the result of a strengthening dollar net of lower forecasted fuel prices for the second half of the year have caused a 7% per share down draft in our earnings. Offsetting this would have been the better-than-forecasted second quarter earnings of $0.04 and another $0.03 resulting from lower than expected cost in the second half of the year. When we combine these movements, we get back to the same earnings guidance as we provided last March. 
Now let me take you through some of the color for each of the next three quarters. For the third quarter, fleet-wide capacity is 6.2% higher than last year, 3.7% in North America, 8% for Europe brands. At this point, we have very little inventory left to sell in the quarter. Fleet-wide occupancy is slightly ahead year-over-year, with local currency pricing well ahead.
The North American brands during the quarter were 41% in the Caribbean, 25% in Alaska and 17% in Europe. Overall pricing from North American brands is well ahead of last year, with slightly better occupancies. Even pricing from Mexican Riviera cruises out of California, which has been a struggle for us over the last couple of years is showing nice improvement. We are expecting that third quarter ticket pricing for North American brands to increase in the low double-digit levels by the time the third quarter closes.
For European brands, there are 97% in European itineraries in the third quarter. Currently, pricing for Europe brands is slightly higher year-over-year, which is a very positive sign given the 8% capacity increase in our European fleet during the quarter. All brands are performing well, although pricing for our Spanish cruise brand Ibero Cruises, which had a 37% increase in capacity in the quarter is expected to be lower. By the time the quarter closes out, we are expecting European brand pricing to be flattish year-over-year, which is a very good result given the 8% percent increase in capacity.
Thus, as we indicated in the press release, we are forecasting third quarter fleet-wide revenue yields will increase in the 5% to 6% range on a local currency basis, flat to up slightly on a current dollar basis. Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be higher by 1% to 2% on a local currency basis, largely as a result of the British officer pension fund charge that David referred to earlier. 
On a local currency basis, costs excluding fuel are expected to be lower in the 2% to 3% range. Fuel cost for the third quarter is expected to be higher by $74 million year-over-year or $0.09 a share. And as we indicated in the press release, earnings are forecasted to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.47 for the quarter versus $1.33 per share in the third quarter of 2009. So it's nice to get back to positive earnings improvements on a quarterly basis.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Fleet-wide capacity is up 6.1% in the quarter, 1.7% in North America and 10.6% in Europe. In an overall basis, fourth quarter occupancy is slightly lower, with local currency pricing running nicely higher. North American brands in the fourth quarter are up 50% in the Caribbean, with all other itineraries individually below 10%. At the present time, pricing is running nicely ahead year-over-year with lower occupancies, although booking volumes for the fourth quarter for North American brands continue to be strong. And by the time the quarter closes, we are expecting pricing to be nicely higher year-over-year.
European brands is 73% in Europe in the fourth quarter, with all other itineraries individually under 10%. Europe itinerary pricing on a local currency basis is nicely ahead of last year, with slightly better occupancy. Bookings continue to be strong for the fourth quarter. And we are forecasting that by the time the fourth quarter closes, Europe brand local currency pricing will be higher year-over-year, which is a very good result considering the 10-plus percent capacity increase that we have during the quarter.
On a fleet-wide basis, we expect fourth quarter revenue yields to be up approximately 3% on a local currency basis. That's combining Europe and North America. And I should add, it's nice to see a positive sign for European pricing, which we haven't had in quite some time. And that's despite the considerable increases we've had in capacity, which has been absorbed quite nicely. And we've been able to expand our markets at the same time in Europe.
So now I'm going to turn to the fourth quarter of 2011, where our fleet-wide capacity is going to be up 6.6%, 3.8% for North American brands and 11.7% for European brands. Let me emphasize that the first quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development and is provided to give you a picture of how the quarter is shaping up at the present time.
Overall, our first quarter pricing is running higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancy running slightly behind. This is a pattern that is similar to the fourth quarter pattern for 2010. North American brands are 66% in the Caribbean, 11% in Mexican Riviera cruises and the balance in all other itineraries. Presently, Caribbean pricing is slightly higher on lower occupancies, and Mexican Riviera pricing is higher on higher occupancies. Pricing on virtually all other itineraries, mostly longer premium-priced cruises is higher on lower occupancies. 
European brands are 25% in European itineraries, 23% in the Caribbean and 18% in South America, with the remaining in various other itineraries. Local currency pricing for Europe and South America cruises is running higher on lower occupancies. And pricing for European brand, Caribbean cruises is higher on higher occupancies.
Overall pricing in local currency for Europe brand cruises is nicely higher at this time with occupancies, when you combine it all at the same level as the prior year, and that is adjusted for the 11.7% capacity increase we had in the first quarter for Europe.

I think principally what's happening is that the yield -- it varies by brand, but the yield management people are working on getting stronger pricing for the quarter. They are less concerned about the lower occupancies. The booking pace has been good for the fourth quarter, as I indicated. So they're pretty confident that they're going to get to the yield numbers that I gave. And they feel pretty good about the situation. I think there was a little bit of a hiccup, I would call it, for a period of time back in May. And I think the pace has now picked up again. And I think they're feeling pretty comfortable as they go forward for the fourth quarter. But we were running behind in the fourth quarter, really, as I can recall, I think throughout the year. And we've never really pressed to pick up the pace because we're really focusing on getting better pricing and that seems to be happening. One more comment, I should add that booking pace has picked up for the fourth quarter without having to give away any price. So we've been able -- it's been a successful strategy."

For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For the second quarter, our earnings per share was $0.32. The second quarter came in above the midpoint of our March guidance by $0.04 per share, despite a $0.02 impact from the volcanic ash and the Chilean earthquake disruption. Net revenue yields in local currency came in up 2% at the higher end of our March guidance, which was worth $0.02 per share, even with these disruptions, which impacted yields by half a point. In addition, our ongoing cost reductions were better than forecasted and were also worth $0.02 per share.
Now let's take a look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased to 8% for the second quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase going to our European brand. Our European brands grew 13%, while our North American brands grew 4%. As I've previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency increased 2% in the second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.
Now let's take a look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields, we saw our yield increase up 1.6% in local currency. Our North American brands were up 3.8%, driven by increases in Europe, Alaska and other exotic itineraries. Our European brands experienced 1.2% lower local currency ticket yields, which were in line with our expectation.
Similar to the first quarter, the declines were driven by challenging winter season in the Brazilian market, with significant capacity increases this past winter. If you exclude the five ships that Costa and Ibero had in Brazil in the month of March, the European brands' net ticket revenue yields in local currency was flat. We were pleased with this performance, given the economic uncertainty and the significantly higher capacity for our Continental European brands.
For net onboard and other revenue yields, we reported a yield increase up 3.1% in local currency. The increase occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. Our North American brands were up 4.6%, and our European brands were up 3.2% in local currency. This was clearly better than we had expected in our March guidance.
Keep in mind that the second quarter actual is against easy comps, as the second quarter last year was at the low point for onboard and other revenue yields. As a result of our second quarter performance, the operating companies have raised their forecasts for onboard and other revenue yields slightly for the back half of the year.
On the March call, I indicated that excluding a couple of onetime first quarter items, our expectations for the full year was flat, given that the first quarter was flat. However, given the increase in the second quarter, our June guidance for the full year, also excluding the same onetime items in the first quarter, is an increase of approximately 1%.
In summary, we were very encouraged by the 2% increase in net revenue yields in the second quarter, which was the first time we saw positive revenue yields since late 2008. As Howard will discuss later, we expect greater improvement in yields for the remainder of the year.
On the cost side, cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 4.9% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by fewer dry docks, economies of scale relating to double-digit growth at certain of our brands, benefits from cost reduction programs, a low inflationary environment and the timing of certain SG&A expenses. However, the strength of our revenue and cost performance in the second quarter of 2010 were once again masked by rising fuel prices. Fuel prices this quarter were 64% higher than last year, costing us $162 million or $0.20 per share. One final note on costs. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, our fuel consumption per ALBD declined 3.3% in the second quarter, continuing our multiple-year savings trend.
Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day for the third quarter, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be up 1% to 2%. This was driven by a $39 million charge, relating to a closed multi-employer pension plan for certain British officers. The multi-employer pension plan accounting rules require us to expense required participant contribution to fund plan deficits when the invoices are received. Excluding this charge, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel for the third quarter would have been projected to be flat to down 1%. 
For the full year, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency are projected to be down 2½% to 3½%. The decline is driven by our ongoing cost reductions, the first quarter gain on the sale of the P&O Cruises' Artemis and lower dry dock costs. 
Since we first gave guidance for 2010 six months ago, we have taken a full percentage point off our cost guidance. Our ongoing cost-reduction programs are yielding more savings than we anticipated in a variety of areas such as insurance, ports and crew travel, just to name a few.
Based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $495 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton for 2009, costing an additional $440 million or $0.55 per share. So in the end, fuel is driving our costs up. And therefore in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% to 2%. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard."

Okay, let me go over the tone of business with you. On a fleet-wide basis, booking volumes and pricing since our last earnings call, that's in the last 13 weeks or so, covering the next three quarters have held up quite well.",1852,"Thank you. Thank you, David. Okay, let me go over the tone of business with you. On a fleet-wide basis, booking volumes and pricing since our last earnings call, that's in the last 13 weeks or so, covering the next three quarters have held up quite well. Even booking volumes for the last six weeks during the significant downturn in global equity  markets have held up well. Although we have seen reduced booking volumes for certain itineraries, which I'll comment on later. 
For our North American brands on slightly lower year-over-year booking volumes for the last 13 weeks, we have experienced double-digit price increases. Keep in mind, our comparisons of this year's booking volumes are against a 26% increase in booking volumes for the same period as last year, when we were selling at deeply discounted prices to move our inventory.
With respect to bookings by itinerary, during the last 13 weeks for North American brands, we have seen strong volumes and pricing for Caribbean programs, which comprise 52% of North American brand capacity over the next three quarters. Alaska, which is 11% of our North American capacity, on lower booking volumes have experienced significantly higher year-over-year pricing. And Europe itineraries, which comprise 9% of our capacity has also experienced lower booking volumes, but with significantly higher pricing as well. We have also seen stronger year-over-year pricing for our Mexican Riviera itineraries for first time in a while. All of our North American brand itineraries have booked quite well during this 13-week period with good pricing.
For our European brands during the last 13 weeks, booking volumes for the next three quarters have been quite strong, with moderate year-over-year local current pricing improvements. Booking volumes for European itineraries during the 13-week period, which comprise 2/3 of European brand capacity during the next nine months have been higher and are keeping pace with year-over-year European brand capacity increases. These bookings are showing moderate increases in prices on a local currency basis, which is quite satisfactory considering the large increase in European brand capacity during the next nine months. So looking back over the last 13 weeks, it's fair to say that demand for cruises had been solid, and we have continued to achieve higher year-over-year price increases.
Now let me talk a little bit about the last six weeks. Beginning in early May, the effect of the volcanic ash issue in the U.K. and Western Europe did cause nervousness about air travel, particularly for North American consumers taking airline flights across the Atlantic. Compounding this was the European sovereign debt crisis and the resulting negative effect it had on global equity markets. Indeed from late April through late May, U.S. equity markets, as we all know, were down about 12% or so. We believe this caused consumers, especially those in North America, to rethink their discretionary travel decisions. But even with these events, fleet-wide bookings for the last six weeks for our cruises over the next three quarters continue to run ahead of last year on a fleet-wide basis, significantly ahead for Europe brands and just slightly behind for North American brands. And prices for bookings for North America and Europe brands continue to be running nicely higher.
Looking at bookings over the last six weeks by major trades for North American brands, Carribean itineraries, which are more than 50% of North American capacity over the next nine months continued to be strong at higher prices. Bookings for Alaska cruises, however, ran behind the last six-week period but at substantially higher prices. But fortunately, there is very little Alaska inventory left to sell.
Bookings from North American brand Europe programs were also lower, but there also not much inventory left to sell in Europe for the remainder of the year. Despite the brief slowdown in these trades, we are still expecting significant year-over-year pricing improvement for Alaska and Europe for 2010. We have seen anecdotally over the last couple of weeks, with the recent strength in the equity markets, that demand in North America for these trades are starting to pick up.
Interestingly, the effect of these external events seems to have been felt more in North American  markets than in European markets. Our European brand bookings during the last six-week period has held up extremely well, with significant improvement in booking volumes and solid improvement in year-over-year local currency pricing. This is yet another example of how the European consumer appears to be more resilient to geopolitical and economic events than is their American counterpart. So to sum this all up, despite the events that have occurred around the world over the last six weeks, people are still booking their vacations and our business has held up quite well.
Now turning to our full year earnings guidance. As we indicated in the press release, we are maintaining earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 a share. Since our first quarter guidance, currency movements, largely the result of a strengthening dollar net of lower forecasted fuel prices for the second half of the year have caused a 7% per share down draft in our earnings. Offsetting this would have been the better-than-forecasted second quarter earnings of $0.04 and another $0.03 resulting from lower than expected cost in the second half of the year. When we combine these movements, we get back to the same earnings guidance as we provided last March. 
Now let me take you through some of the color for each of the next three quarters. For the third quarter, fleet-wide capacity is 6.2% higher than last year, 3.7% in North America, 8% for Europe brands. At this point, we have very little inventory left to sell in the quarter. Fleet-wide occupancy is slightly ahead year-over-year, with local currency pricing well ahead.
The North American brands during the quarter were 41% in the Caribbean, 25% in Alaska and 17% in Europe. Overall pricing from North American brands is well ahead of last year, with slightly better occupancies. Even pricing from Mexican Riviera cruises out of California, which has been a struggle for us over the last couple of years is showing nice improvement. We are expecting that third quarter ticket pricing for North American brands to increase in the low double-digit levels by the time the third quarter closes.
For European brands, there are 97% in European itineraries in the third quarter. Currently, pricing for Europe brands is slightly higher year-over-year, which is a very positive sign given the 8% capacity increase in our European fleet during the quarter. All brands are performing well, although pricing for our Spanish cruise brand Ibero Cruises, which had a 37% increase in capacity in the quarter is expected to be lower. By the time the quarter closes out, we are expecting European brand pricing to be flattish year-over-year, which is a very good result given the 8% percent increase in capacity.
Thus, as we indicated in the press release, we are forecasting third quarter fleet-wide revenue yields will increase in the 5% to 6% range on a local currency basis, flat to up slightly on a current dollar basis. Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be higher by 1% to 2% on a local currency basis, largely as a result of the British officer pension fund charge that David referred to earlier. 
On a local currency basis, costs excluding fuel are expected to be lower in the 2% to 3% range. Fuel cost for the third quarter is expected to be higher by $74 million year-over-year or $0.09 a share. And as we indicated in the press release, earnings are forecasted to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.47 for the quarter versus $1.33 per share in the third quarter of 2009. So it's nice to get back to positive earnings improvements on a quarterly basis.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Fleet-wide capacity is up 6.1% in the quarter, 1.7% in North America and 10.6% in Europe. In an overall basis, fourth quarter occupancy is slightly lower, with local currency pricing running nicely higher. North American brands in the fourth quarter are up 50% in the Caribbean, with all other itineraries individually below 10%. At the present time, pricing is running nicely ahead year-over-year with lower occupancies, although booking volumes for the fourth quarter for North American brands continue to be strong. And by the time the quarter closes, we are expecting pricing to be nicely higher year-over-year.
European brands is 73% in Europe in the fourth quarter, with all other itineraries individually under 10%. Europe itinerary pricing on a local currency basis is nicely ahead of last year, with slightly better occupancy. Bookings continue to be strong for the fourth quarter. And we are forecasting that by the time the fourth quarter closes, Europe brand local currency pricing will be higher year-over-year, which is a very good result considering the 10-plus percent capacity increase that we have during the quarter.
On a fleet-wide basis, we expect fourth quarter revenue yields to be up approximately 3% on a local currency basis. That's combining Europe and North America. And I should add, it's nice to see a positive sign for European pricing, which we haven't had in quite some time. And that's despite the considerable increases we've had in capacity, which has been absorbed quite nicely. And we've been able to expand our markets at the same time in Europe.
So now I'm going to turn to the fourth quarter of 2011, where our fleet-wide capacity is going to be up 6.6%, 3.8% for North American brands and 11.7% for European brands. Let me emphasize that the first quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development and is provided to give you a picture of how the quarter is shaping up at the present time.
Overall, our first quarter pricing is running higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancy running slightly behind. This is a pattern that is similar to the fourth quarter pattern for 2010. North American brands are 66% in the Caribbean, 11% in Mexican Riviera cruises and the balance in all other itineraries. Presently, Caribbean pricing is slightly higher on lower occupancies, and Mexican Riviera pricing is higher on higher occupancies. Pricing on virtually all other itineraries, mostly longer premium-priced cruises is higher on lower occupancies. 
European brands are 25% in European itineraries, 23% in the Caribbean and 18% in South America, with the remaining in various other itineraries. Local currency pricing for Europe and South America cruises is running higher on lower occupancies. And pricing for European brand, Caribbean cruises is higher on higher occupancies.
Overall pricing in local currency for Europe brand cruises is nicely higher at this time with occupancies, when you combine it all at the same level as the prior year, and that is adjusted for the 11.7% capacity increase we had in the first quarter for Europe. Again, I caution this is an early picture for Q1 of 2011 and not to read too much into this information. 
And with that, Sara, I'm going to turn it back to you for questions."

And we've never really pressed to pick up the pace because we're really focusing on getting better pricing and that seems to be happening. One more comment, I should add that booking pace has picked up for the fourth quarter without having to give away any price. So we've been able -- it's been a successful strategy."

And the way they -- this whole psychology is that vacations are really right at the top of their list of priorities, how they spend their money. So I think it is a very different consumer, and their behavior is different. And I think this is one way, another way of seeing how it's manifested. It's really very interesting. Especially when you talk about the whole sovereign debt crisis, and we talked to our colleagues in Europe, and they were all concerned about it. But they didn't see it affect their business that much, which is to me, the consumer, the day-to-day consumer or the market doesn't really think that much about it."

For the third quarter, our EPS was $1.62. The third quarter came in above the midpoint of our June guidance by $0.17 per share. The improvement was driven by a number of things. First, net revenue yields in local currency came in at 6.2%. This was slightly better than the 5% to 6% forecast in June guidance and was worth about $0.03 per share.
As Micky indicated in the press release, despite ongoing economic concerns, cruise ticket prices remained strong close to sailing rewarding guests that booked early. Secondly, net cruise costs without fuel and in local currency came in down 2.4%. This was significantly better than our June guidance of up 1% to 2%, and was worth $0.08 per share. $0.02 of the $0.08 relates to the one-time legal settlement. The other $0.06 was broad-based. It was spread across most areas of ship operating expense, as well as SG&A. Our operating companies once again did an outstanding job controlling costs. Third our results benefited $0.04 from lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar and lastly several small items worth about $0.02 per share.
Now let us look at the third quarter operating results versus the prior year, our capacity increased 6.2% in the third quarter of 2010 with the majority of the increase once again going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 8% while our North American brands grew 3.7%. Our net revenue yields also increased 6.2% in the third quarter and this was driven by our North American brands, who were up 14.3% with increases across all itineraries.
I’m happy to report that our North Americans brands recaptured more than half the yield they lost in the third quarter last year from the impact of the financial crisis. Our European brands experienced flat local currency net ticket yields, which were in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, the 8% capacity increase, and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year giving them a more difficult prior year comparison.
For net onboard revenue yields, we experienced a 1.3% in local currency, which was in line with our expectations. The increase in net onboard revenue yields occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. In summary, we were very encouraged by the strong performance of our North American brands net ticket yields. The solid performance of our European brands on increased capacity and our overall improved onboard revenue yields.
On the cost side, cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 2.4% versus the prior year. If you exclude the charge for the British pension plan, which was included in our guidance and the one-time legal settlement which was not in our guidance, our costs were down 4%, which was consistent with the first and second quarter. The decline was driven by economies of scale, benefits of cost reduction programs, and a low inflationary environment.
Fuel prices this quarter were up 17% versus last year, costing us $57 million, and while the stronger dollar translates into lower cost, overall the stronger dollar translated into $72 million of lower earnings. So despite a fuel and currency negative impact of $0.16, our EPS improved $0.29 this quarter.
Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. For the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be down 4%. The decline is driven by the ongoing cost reductions which is widespread across all categories of cost, economies of scale and once again the low inflationary environment.
Based off on the current spot prices for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $486 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton in ’09, costing us an additional $410 million or $0.51 per share. So in the end fuel is driving our costs up and therefore in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% for the year.
At this point I will turn the call back to Howard.

258823,113343957,78546,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2010",2010-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Let me talk about the yield outlook. I will first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That is the period since our last earnings call. These would be for bookings or cruises covering the next three quarters, the f",1986,"Thank you, David. Let me talk about the yield outlook. I will first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That is the period since our last earnings call. These would be for bookings or cruises covering the next three quarters, the fourth quarter that we are currently in in 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011.
Across the fleet, bookings during the 13 week period, this past 13 week period, have been strong running 8% ahead on a year-over-year basis. Ticket prices, excluding prices for winter Caribbean cruises are running higher year-over-year. Winter Caribbean pricing is lower largely as a result of significant increases in industry Caribbean capacity, which in the first quarter is approximately 15% higher, and our fleet capacity in the Caribbean winter is up 10% in the quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, closing [ph] pricing has been strong, especially for North American brand bookings. As a result, pricing as held up quite well, and fourth-quarter local currency yields continue to strengthen versus last year at the same time. Turning to the bookings pattern by major markets, for North American brand cruises during the next nine months, the booking momentum for the last 13 weeks has been strong.
As I previously mentioned, with the exception of Caribbean itineraries, pricing for North American brand bookings during this 13 week period is significantly higher than a year ago. However, even if we include the lower-priced Caribbean cruises, because of continued stronger pricing in other itineraries, overall pricing on bookings for North American brands for the last 13 weeks is in line with last year’s pricing.
The impact of the lower Caribbean pricing will be felt more significantly in the first quarter, when our Caribbean capacity is greatest, and to a lesser extent in the second quarter when Caribbean capacity is reduced. Our most recent bookings over the last six weeks covering the next few quarters is even more encouraging, showing solid overall pricing improvement for North American brands.
For our Europe brands, booking volumes for the last 13 weeks have been very strong on a year-over-year basis for cruises during the next three quarters with slightly higher local currency pricing, and bookings volume during the last 6 weeks for Europe brands have also shown significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. The encouraging European brand bookings momentum reconfirms our view that the less penetrated cruise markets in Europe will continue to grow profitably, despite the slow growth economies that currently exist throughout continental Europe and the UK.
Given the current booking and pricing momentum, taken together with the price increases for businesses already on our books, we are already forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields in the first half of 2011 will be higher on a year-over-year basis, and this factors in the lower Caribbean pricing. European yields will be stronger than North American yields in the first quarter also the result of the lower Caribbean prices. I will have further pricing color on the individual quarters later on in my report.
In terms of fleet expansion for 2011, we have four ships scheduled for delivery. The AIDAsol at the end of March of 2011, Carnival Magic at the end of April 2011, the Seabourn Quest in late May, and the Costa Favolosa in late June. Our capacity increase in 2011 is estimated to be 5.4% for the full year. Breaking that down by quarters, it would be 6.7% in Q1, 4.9% in Q2, 5% in Q3, and 5.1% in Q4. With the delivery of the four ships in 2011, our European brand capacity will be close to 40% of our overall fleet capacity, which is a target we set out after the completion of a merger with P&O Princess in 2003.
Although early, we’re encouraged with recent booking patterns, and feel confident that we will have a solid financial performance in 2011 even in this slow growth global economic environment. With estimated Cape of $2.5 billion in 2011, we are forecasting that 2011 will be the first year for driving significant free cash flow in our business. And as cash flow increases and our Cape slows in future years, free cash flow is expected to further increase.
As to 2010 earnings guidance, for the full year 2010, as we have indicated the mid-point of our earnings guidance is now $2.50 per share, which is $0.30 higher than the midpoint guidance of $2.20 a share we established back in December of 2009 at the start of the year. And major factors causing the earnings increase in 2010, looking at it with some perspective right now, are higher ticket yields of approximately $0.23 a share, higher on board yields of $0.05 a share, lower costs of $0.21 a share, and positive one off items of $0.08 a share. Fuel and currency on the other hand affected earnings negatively by $0.27 a share. And this all nets out to a plus $0.30 over our original guidance.
Let me digress a second and take a moment to make a comment. The achievement of our improved 2010 financial results during these difficult economic times is particularly gratifying, and a tribute to our strong management teams throughout the world, and their agility in responding to local economic conditions in their markets.
The strategy of having strong national brands supported by separate management teams in each of our major markets around the world provide us with a major competitive advantage in those markets, including the ability to maximize our profits especially during these difficult and challenging economic times.
Now I will turn to each of the quarters and give you a little bit more color. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the quarter that we are currently in, our capacity is up 5.8%, 1.4% in North America, 10.7% in Europe. On a fleetwide bases, there was very little inventory left to sell in the quarter. Occupancies are in-line with the year ago with local currency pricing running nicely higher.
North American brands, in the fourth quarter are 50% in the Caribbean, up from 45% last year, with all other itineraries individually below 10%. Occupancy for North American brands in the fourth quarter are slightly ahead year-over-year with pricing also nicely higher. Late fourth-quarter bookings for North American brands continue to be strong and yields have shown gradual improvement week-on-week. By the time the quarter closes, we expect North American brand revenue yields to increase in the 3% to 4% range on a year-over-year basis.
For European brands, there are 72% in Europe itineraries, down slightly from 78% last year for the fourth quarter, with all other itineraries individually under 10%. European local currency pricing is also higher year-over-year with occupancies at approximately the same levels. We’re currently forecasting an increase in the European brand local revenue yields in the fourth quarter by approximately 2%, which is a very positive result considering the 11% increase in capacity for the Europe brands during the quarter.
From an overall standpoint as indicated in the press release, we are forecasting fourth-quarter fleetwide revenue yields to increase in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% on a local currency basis, and lowered by 1% to 2% on a current dollar basis as a result of the strengthening dollar during this period on a year-over-year basis. Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be down 1% to 2% on a local currency basis and on a current dollar basis lower by 5% to 6%.
Earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the $0.32 to $0.36. This includes the impact of unfavorable currency and fuel costs of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter, and also compares to the $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Now turning to the first quarter of 2011, fleetwide capacity for the quarter as I indicated is up 6.7%, 4.2% for North American brands, 11.3% for Europe brands. On a fleetwide basis, first quarter of 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancies running slightly behind with patterns similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010.
For North American brands, they are 66% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year and 11% in the Mexican Riviera, which is about the same as the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, Winter Caribbean pricing is lower than a year ago on lower occupancies. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the lower levels we experienced a year ago on higher occupancies and pricing across all other itineraries is higher on slightly lower occupancies. Taking all itineraries together, including the Caribbean pricing, is currently in line with last year.
Looking at our European brands in the first quarter, they are 25% in European itineraries, 23% in the Caribbean down from 25% in the prior year, and 18% in South America, which is about the same as in the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency pricing across all European itineraries is higher year-over-year on slightly higher overall occupancies. And we are very pleased with the booking patterns and pricing in Europe to this point, which is being achieved despite the 11.3% increase in European capacity in the first quarter.
From an overall standpoint in Q1 based on what we are seeing in North America and Europe, on a local currency basis we are estimating that fleetwide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher in the 2% range, driven by strong forecasted increases in European brand pricing, net of a small decline in North American pricing, largely the result of the lower pricing environment in Q1 in the very competitive Caribbean winter market. Current dollar pricing at today’s exchange rate is forecasted to be slightly down year-over-year. This is in Q1.
Turning to Q2, fleetwide capacity as I indicated earlier is up 4.9% in the second quarter, 2.5% for North America, 8.5% for our European companies. Let me emphasize that second-quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development and being provided to give you a picture of how the quarter is shaping up at the present time. On a fleetwide basis second-quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancies in line with the previous year.
For North American brands, they are 55% in the Caribbean, about the same as last year, but 11% lower than in the first quarter of 2011. The balance in various other itineraries, all individually under 10%. Currently pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago, with occupancies currently in line with last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter, but improved from the first quarter, and pricing across all other North American brand itineraries is higher year-over-year.
For European brands, they are 61% in Europe itineraries, up from 57% a year ago with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency pricing for European brand cruises is running nicely higher year-over-year. occupancies are slightly down from the prior year levels given the 8.5% capacity increase in Europe brands is quite acceptable, especially given the higher pricing currently being achieved.
While the booking picture for the second quarter of 2011 is still in its early stages of development, it is progressing quite well, and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields in the second quarter of 2011 will be higher for both North American and European brands.
And with that operator, I will turn it back for questions from those listening in. I would ask that everybody limit their questions to two questions if they would, and I will now turn it back to you.

You know, there are things that we have been doing, and I will just try to give you some examples. Howard talked about our operating companies around the world, and while we have a global presence and a global sourcing and purchasing group, the advantage that we have from the local operating companies is we are well aware of different issues, different products.
And so many times, we will switch our sourcing so that perhaps the European brands might be sourcing certain products from North America or vice versa. And that allows us to gain significantly better pricing. We continue to lever down pricing with the volumes we have, by renegotiating deals and capturing savings from there. We have captured savings from reducing specifications.
We developed a bridge simulator in Europe, which not only improved the training and reduced training costs of our maritime crew and officers, but also lowered our insurance costs as well. So those are just a sample of a few items, but there are many others. There is no one particular item that made up the whole difference.

We had two ships in China this past season and they did well, albeit not at prices that we would have liked, but the prices were okay. The results were good and we probably almost doubled I think our sourcing of Chinese passengers during 2010. For 2011, Costa has taken the decision actually to at least for this period of 2011 to downsize from two ships to one ship with the strategy of trying to get higher prices in 2011 in anticipation of upsizing to a much larger ship in 2012 to get to establish the higher price points in the market.
We think it's something that is very achievable. We're still very positive about China, but it has been in large degree an experiment, and we continue to move different ships in and out to see what works. The product is extremely well accepted by the Chinese market. There are periods when the Chinese and their families will go on to holiday and there are periods when it doesn't. So it's always a challenge to find out how to utilize, how to source business to those ships during periods outside of the period when the Chinese will go on cruises. I think Costa have been very successful in doing that. So, the strategy is to stay in China and to continue to build it, but we will take a little bit blip downward in 2011, and then come back with a larger ship in 2012, with a view that it will then be a profitable business with us with that larger ship. It will be only a modestly - actually, we should get operating profit in 2011, even with the one smaller ship in 2012 we should get to profitability in China.

For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
For the third quarter, our EPS was $1.62. The third quarter came in above the midpoint of our June guidance by $0.17 per share. The improvement was driven by a number of things. First, net revenue yields in local currency came in up 6.2%. This was slightly better than the 5% to 6% forecasted in June guidance and was worth about $0.03 per share. As Micky indicated in the press release, despite ongoing economic concerns, cruise ticket prices remained strong close to sailing, rewarding guests that booked early. Secondly, net cruise costs without fuel and in local currency came in down 2.4%. This was significantly better than our June guidance of up 1% to 2% and was worth $0.08 per share. $0.02 of the $0.08 relates to the one-time legal settlement. The other $0.06 was broad-based. It was spread across most areas of ship operating expense as well as SG&A. Our operating companies once again did an outstanding job controlling costs. Third, our results benefited $0.04 from lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar, and lastly, several small items worth about $0.02 per share. 
Now, let's look at the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 6.2% for the third quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase, once again, going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 8%, while our North American brands grew 3.7%. Our net revenue yields also increased 6.2% in the third quarter, and this was driven by our North American brands, who were up 14.3%, with increases across all itineraries. I'm happy to report that our North American brands recaptured more than half of the yield they lost in the third quarter last year from the impact of the financial crisis. Our European brands experienced flat local currency net ticket yields, which were in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, their 8% capacity increase and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year, giving them a more difficult prior-year comparison. 
For net onboard revenue yields, we experienced a 1.3% increase in local currency, which was in line with our expectations. The increase in net onboard revenue yields occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. In summary, we were very encouraged by the strong performance of our North American brands' net ticket yields, the solid performance of our European brands on increased capacity and our overall improved onboard revenue yields. 
On the cost side, cruise costs per available lower-berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, were down 2.4% versus the prior year. If you would exclude the charge for the British pension plan, which was included in our guidance, and the one-time legal settlement, which was not in our guidance, our costs were down 4%, which was consistent with the first and second quarters. The decline was driven by economies of scale, benefits of cost-reductions programs and a low inflationary environment. 
Fuel prices this quarter were up 17% versus last year, costing us $57 million. And while the stronger dollar translates into lower costs, overall the stronger dollar translated into $72 million of lower earnings. So despite a fuel and currency negative impact of $0.16, our EPS improved $0.29 this quarter. 
Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. For the full year, net cruise costs per available lower-berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be down 4%. The decline is driven by the ongoing cost reductions, which is widespread across all categories, across economies of scale, and once again, the low inflationary environment. Based off of the current spot prices for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $486 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton in '09, costing us an additional $410 million or $0.51 per share. So in the end, fuel is driving our costs up, and therefore, in current dollars, and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% for the year. At this point, I will turn the call back to Howard."
258823,113343957,78568,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2010",2010-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Let me talk about the yield outlook. I'll first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That's the period since our last earnings call.

I'll first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That's the period since our last earnings call. These would be for bookings for cruises covering the next three quarters, the fourth quarter that we're currently in of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011. Across the fleet, bookings during the 13-week period, this past 13-week period, have been strong, running 8% ahead on a year-over-year basis. Ticket prices, excluding prices for winter Caribbean cruises, are running higher year-over-year. Winter Caribbean pricing is lower, largely as a result of a significant increases in industry Caribbean capacity, which in the first quarter, is approximately 15% higher and our fleet capacity in the Caribbean in winter is up 10% in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, closing pricing has been strong, especially for North American brand bookings. As a result, pricing has held up quite well and fourth quarter local currency yields continue to strengthen versus last year at the same time. Turning to the booking patterns by major markets, for North American brand cruises during the next nine months, the booking momentum for the last 13 weeks has been strong. As I previously mentioned, with the exception of Caribbean itineraries, pricing for North American brand bookings during this 13-week period is significantly higher than a year ago. However, even if we include the lower-priced Caribbean cruises, the cost of continued stronger pricing and other itineraries, overall pricing on bookings for North American brands for the last 13 weeks is in line with last year's pricing. The impact of the lower Caribbean pricing will be felt more significantly in the first quarter, when our Caribbean capacity is greatest. And to a lesser extent, in the second quarter, when Caribbean capacity is reduced. 
Our more recent bookings over the last six weeks covering the next three quarters is even more encouraging, showing solid overall pricing improvement for North American brands. For our Europe brands, booking volumes for the last 13 weeks have been very strong on a year-over-year basis for cruises during the next three quarters, with slightly higher local currency pricing. And booking volumes during the last six weeks for Europe brands have also shown significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. The encouraging European brand booking momentum reconfirms our view that the less-penetrated cruise markets in Europe will continue to grow profitably despite the slow-growth economies that currently exist throughout Continental Europe and the U.K. 
Given the current booking and pricing momentum, taken together with the price increases from business already on our books, we are currently forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields in the first half of 2011 will be higher on a year-over-year basis. And this factors in the lower Caribbean pricing. European yields will be stronger than North American yields in the first quarter, also the result of the lower Caribbean prices. I will have further pricing color on the individual quarters later on in my report. 
In terms of fleet expansion for 2011, we have four ships scheduled for delivery. The AIDAsol at the end of March of 2011, the Carnival Magic at the end of April 2011, Seabourn Quest in late May and the Costa Favolosa in late June. Our capacity increase in 2011 is estimated to be 5.4% for the full year. Breaking that down by quarters, it would be 6.7% in Q1, 4.9% in Q2, 5% in Q3 and 5.1% in Q4. 
With the delivery of the four ships in 2011, our European brand capacity will be close to 40% of our overall fleet capacity, which is the target we set out after the completion of our merger with P&O Princess in 2003. Although early, we are encouraged with recent booking patterns. We feel confident that we will have a solid financial performance in 2011, even in this slow growth global economic environment. With estimated CapEx of $2.5 billion in 2011, we are forecasting that 2011 will be the first year for driving significant free cash flow in our business. And as cash flow increases and our CapEx flows in future years, free cash flow is expected to further increase. 
As to 2010 earnings guidance, for the full-year 2010, as we've indicated, the midpoint of our earnings guidance is now $2.50 per share, which is $0.30 higher than the midpoint guidance of $2.20 a share we established back in December of 2009 at the start of the year. The major factors causing the earnings increase in 2010, looking at it with some perspective right now, are higher ticket yields of approximately $0.23 a share, higher onboard yields of $0.05 a share, lower cost of $0.21 a share and positive one-off items of $0.08 a share. Fuel and currency, on the other hand, affected earnings negatively by $0.27 a share. And this all nets out to a plus $0.30 over our original guidance. 
Let me digress a second and take a moment to make a comment. The achievement of our improved 2010 financial results during these difficult economic times is particularly gratifying and a tribute to our strong management teams throughout the world, and their agility in responding to local economic conditions in their markets. The strategy of having strong national brands supported by separate management teams in each of our major markets around the world provide us with a major competitive advantage in those markets, including the ability to maximize our profits, especially during these difficult and challenging economic times. 
Now I'll turn to each of the quarters and give you a little bit more color. The fourth quarter of 2010, the quarter that we're currently in, our capacity is up 5.8%, 1.4% in North America, 10.7% in Europe. On a fleetwide basis, with very little inventory left to sell in the quarter, occupancies are in line with a year ago, with local currency pricing running nicely higher. North American brands in the fourth quarter are 50% in the Caribbean, up from 45% last year, with all other itineraries individually below 10%. Occupancies for North American brands in the fourth quarter are slightly ahead year-over-year, with pricing also nicely higher. Late fourth quarter bookings for North American brands continue to be strong and yields have shown gradual improvement week-on-week. By the time the quarter closes, we expect North America brand revenue yields to increase in the 3% to 4% range on a year-over-year basis. For European brands, they are 72% in Europe itineraries, down slightly from 78% last year for the fourth quarter, with all other itineraries individually under 10%. European local currency pricing is also higher year-over-year, with occupancies at approximately the same levels. We are currently forecasting an increase in European brand local revenue yields in the fourth quarter by approximately 2%, which is a very positive result considering the 11% increase in capacity for the Europe brands during the quarter. From an overall standpoint, as indicated in the press release, we are forecasting fourth quarter fleetwide revenue yields to increase in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% on a local currency basis and lower by 1% to 2% on a current dollar basis as a result of the strengthening of dollar during this period on a year-over-year basis. 
Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be down 1% to 2% on a local currency basis and on a current dollar basis, lower by 5% to 6%. Earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the $0.32 to $0.36 range. This includes the impact of unfavorable currency and fuel costs of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter, and also compares to the $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Now, turning to the first quarter of 2011. Fleetwide capacity for the quarter as I indicated is up 6.7%, 4.2% for North American brands, 11.3% for Europe brands. On a fleetwide basis, first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancies running slightly behind a pattern similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010. For North American brands, they're 66% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year and 11% in the Mexican Riviera, which is about the same as the prior year, with the balance in various other itineraries. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is lower than a year ago on lower occupancies. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the lower levels we experienced a year ago on higher occupancies and pricing across all other itineraries is higher on slightly lower occupancies. Taking all itineraries together, including the Caribbean, pricing is currently in line with last year. 
Looking at our European brands in the first quarter, they're 25% in European itineraries, 23% in the Caribbean, down from 29% the prior year and 18% in South America, which is about the same as in prior year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency pricing across all European itineraries is higher year-over-year on slightly higher overall occupancies. We are very pleased with the booking patterns and pricing in Europe to this point, which is being achieved despite the 11.3% increase in European capacity in the first quarter. From an overall standpoint in Q1, based on what we're seeing in North America and Europe on a local currency basis, we are estimating that fleetwide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher, in the 2% range, driven largely by strong forecasted increases in European brand pricing, net of a small decline in North American pricing, largely the result of the lower pricing environment in Q1 in the very competitive Caribbean winter market. Current dollar pricing at today's exchange rate is forecast to be slightly down year-over-year. This is in Q1. 
Turning to Q2. Fleetwide capacity, as I indicated earlier, is up 4.9% in the second quarter, 2.5% for North America, 8.5% for our European companies. Let me emphasize that second quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development and being provided to give you a picture of how the quarter is shaping up at the present time. On a fleetwide basis, second quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancies in line with the previous year. For North American brands, they're 55% in the Caribbean, about the same as last year, but 11% lower than in the first quarter of 2011, the balance in various other itineraries all individually under 10%. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago, with occupancies currently in line with last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter, but improved from the first quarter. And pricing across all other North American brands itineraries is higher year-over-year. For European brands, they're 61% in Europe itineraries, up from 57% a year ago, with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency pricing for European brand cruises is running nicely higher year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior year levels, which, given the 8.5% capacity increase in Europe brands, is quite acceptable, especially given the higher pricing currently being achieved. While the booking picture for the second quarter of 2011 is still in its early stages of development. It is progressing quite well. And assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields in the second quarter of 2011 will be higher for both North American and European brands.

I don't think you can extrapolate Q1 to the rest of the year though. I think that demand patterns differ greatly as they did during this past year. And you can see where yield improvement improved significantly in the third quarter. Actually in the fourth quarter, they're not all that bad either. So I think we'll be in a position on the next call and have a better sense as we go through budget reviews in the next four to six weeks. We will have a better sense as to how all the brands see their full 2011 year. But right now, it would be too early to comment on that. But we certainly don't think you can extrapolate the 2%, no."

And so many times, we will switch our sourcing so that perhaps the European brands might be sourcing certain products from North America or vice versa. And that allows us to gain significantly better pricing. We continue to lever down pricing with the volumes we have, by renegotiating deals and capturing savings from there. We've captured savings from reducing specifications. We developed a bridge simulator in Europe, which not only improved the training and reduced training costs of our maritime crew and officers, but also lowered our insurance costs as well.

We had two ships in China this past season and they did well, albeit not at prices that we would have liked, but the prices were okay. And the results were good and we probably almost doubled, I think, our sourcing of Chinese passengers during 2010. For 2011, Costa has taken a decision actually to, at least for this period of 2011, to downsize from two ships to one ship, with a strategy of trying to get higher prices in 2011 in anticipation of upsizing to a much larger ship in 2012 to get to establish a higher price point in the market. We think it's something that is very achievable. We're still very positive about China, but it has been, in large degree, an experiment. And we continue to move different ships in and out to see what works. The product is extremely well-accepted by the Chinese market. There are periods when the Chinese and their families will go on holidays and there are periods when it doesn't. So it's always a challenge to find out how to utilize, how to source business to those ships during periods outside of the period when the Chinese will go on cruises. And I think Costa has been very successful in doing that. So the strategy is to stay in China and to continue to build it but we will take a little bit flip downward in 2011 and then come back with a larger ship in 2012, with the view that it will then be a profitable business with us with that larger ship. It will be only a modestly -- actually we should get operating profit in 2011 even with the one smaller ship in 2012, we should get to profitability in China. It's a long story. By the way, I was able to tell you that because I had a conversation about this with Pier yesterday. So I fully understood exactly what the strategy was."

For the third quarter, our EPS was $1.62. The third quarter came in above the midpoint of our June guidance by $0.17 per share. The improvement was driven by a number of things. First, net revenue yields in local currency came in at 6.2%. This was slightly better than the 5% to 6% forecasted in June guidance and was worth about $0.03 per share. As Micky indicated in the press release, despite ongoing economic concerns, cruise ticket prices remained strong close to sailing, rewarding guests that booked early. Secondly, net cruise costs without fuel and in local currency came in down 2.4%. This was significantly better than our June guidance of up 1% to 2% and was worth $0.08 per share. $0.02 of the $0.08 relates to the one-time legal settlement. The other $0.06 was broad-based. It was spread across most areas of ship operating expense as well as SG&A. Our operating companies once again did an outstanding job controlling costs. Third, our results benefited $0.04 from lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar, and lastly, several small items worth about $0.02 per share. 
Now, let's look at the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 6.2% for the third quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase, once again, going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 8%, while our North American brands grew 3.7%. Our net revenue yields also increased 6.2% in the third quarter, and this was driven by our North American brands, who were up 14.3%, with increases across all itineraries. I'm happy to report that our North American brands recaptured more than half of the yield they lost in the third quarter last year from the impact of the financial crisis. Our European brands experienced flat local currency net ticket yields, which were in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, their 8% capacity increase and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year, giving them a more difficult prior-year comparison. 
For net onboard revenue yields, we experienced a 1.3% increase in local currency, which was in line with our expectations. The increase in net onboard revenue yields occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. In summary, we were very encouraged by the strong performance of our North American brand's net ticket yields, the solid performance of our European brands on increased capacity and our overall improved onboard revenue yields. 
On the cost side, cruise costs per available lower-berth day, excluding fuel and in, local currency, were down 2.4% versus the prior year. If you would exclude the charge for the British pension, which was included in our guidance and the one-time legal settlement, which was not in our guidance, our costs were down 4%, which was consistent with the first and second quarters. The decline was driven by economies of scale, benefits of cost-reductions programs and a low inflationary environment. 
Fuel prices this quarter were up 17% versus last year, costing us $57 million. And while the stronger dollar translates into lower costs, overall, the stronger dollar translated into $72 million of lower earnings. So despite a fuel and currency negative impact of $0.16, our EPS improved $0.29 this quarter. 
Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. For the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be down 4%. The decline is driven by the ongoing cost reductions, which is widespread across all categories, across economies of scale, and once again, the low inflationary environment. Based off of the current spot prices for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $486 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton in '09, costing us an additional $410 million or $0.51 per share. So in the end, fuel is driving our costs up, and therefore, in current dollars, and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% for the year. At this point, I will turn the call back to Howard."

Let me talk about the yield outlook. I'll first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That's the period since our last earnings call. This would be for bookings for cruises covering the next three quarters, the four",1963,"Thank you, David. Let me talk about the yield outlook. I'll first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That's the period since our last earnings call. This would be for bookings for cruises covering the next three quarters, the fourth quarter that we're currently in of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011. Across the fleet, bookings during the 13-week period, this past 13-week period, have been strong, running 8% ahead on a year-over-year basis. Ticket prices, excluding prices for winter Caribbean cruises, are running higher year-over-year, when the Caribbean pricing is lower, largely as a result of a significant increases in industry Caribbean capacity, which in the first quarter, is approximately 15% higher and our fleet capacity in the Caribbean winter is up 10% in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, closing pricing has been strong, especially for North American brand bookings. As a result, pricing has held up quite well and fourth quarter local currency yields continue to strengthen versus last year at the same time. Turning to the booking patterns by major markets, for North American brand cruises during the next nine months, the booking momentum for the last 13 weeks has been strong. As I previously mentioned, with the exception of Caribbean itineraries, pricing for North American brand bookings during this 13-week period is significantly higher than a year ago. However, even if we include the lower-priced Caribbean cruises, the cost of continued stronger pricing and other itineraries, overall pricing on bookings for North American brands for the last 13 weeks is in line with last year's pricing. The impact of the lower Caribbean pricing will be felt more significantly in the first quarter, when our Caribbean capacity is greatest. And to a lesser extent, in the second quarter, when Caribbean capacity is reduced. 
Our more recent bookings over the last six weeks covering the next three quarters is even more encouraging, showing solid overall pricing improvement for North American brands. For our Europe brand, booking volumes for the last 13 weeks have been very strong on a year-over-year basis for cruises during the next three quarters, with slightly higher local currency pricing. And booking volumes during the last six weeks for Europe brands have also shown significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. The encouraging European brand booking momentum reconfirms our view that the less-penetrated cruise markets in Europe will continue to grow profitably despite the slow-growth economies that currently exist throughout Continental Europe and the U.K. 
Given the current booking and pricing momentum, taken together with the price increases from business already on our books, we are currently forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields in the first half of 2011 will be higher on a year-over-year basis. And this factors in the lower Caribbean pricing. European yields will be stronger than North American yields in the first quarter, also the result of the lower Caribbean prices. I will have further pricing color on the individual quarters later on in my report. 
In terms of fleet expansion for 2011, we have four ships scheduled for delivery. The AIDAsol at the end of March of 2011, the Carnival Magic at the end of April 2011, Seaborne Quest in late May and the Costa Favolosa in late June. Our capacity increase in 2011 is estimated to be 5.4% for the full year. Breaking that down by quarters, it would be 6.7% in Q1, 4.9% in Q2, 5% in Q3 and 5.1% in Q4. 
With the delivery of the four ships in 2011, our European brand capacity will be close to 40% of our overall fleet capacity, which is the target we set out after the completion of our merger with P&O Princess in 2003. Although early, we are encouraged with recent booking patterns. We feel confident that we will have a solid financial performance in 2011, even in this slow growth global economic environment. With estimated CapEx of $2.5 billion in 2011, we are forecasting that 2011 will be the first year for driving significant free cash flow in our business. And as cash flow increases and our CapEx flows in future years, free cash flow is expected to further increase. 
As to 2010 earnings guidance, for the full-year 2010, as we've indicated, the midpoint of our earnings guidance is now $2.50 per share, which is $0.30 higher than the midpoint guidance of $2.20 a share we established back in December of 2009 at the start of the year. The major factors causing the earnings increase in 2010, looking at it with some perspective right now, are higher ticket yields of approximately $0.23 a share, higher onboard yields of $0.05 a share, lower cost of $0.21 a share and positive one-off items of $0.08 a share. Fuel and currency on the other hand, affected earnings negatively by $0.27 a share. And this all nets out to a plus $0.30 over our original guidance. 
Let me digress a second and take a moment to make a comment. The achievement of our improved 2010 financial results during these difficult economic times is particularly gratifying and a tribute to our strong management teams throughout the world, and their agility in responding to local economic conditions in their markets. The strategy of having strong national brands supported by separate management teams in each of our major markets around the world provide us with a major competitive advantage in those markets, including the ability to maximize our profits, especially during these difficult and challenging economic times. 
Now I'll turn to each of the quarters and give you a little bit more color. The fourth quarter of 2010, the quarter that we're currently in, our capacity is up 5.8%, 1.4% in North America, 10.7% in Europe. On a fleetwide basis, with very little inventory left to sell in the quarter, occupancies are in line with a year ago, with local currency pricing running nicely higher. North American brands in the fourth quarter are 50% in the Caribbean, up from 45% last year, with all other itineraries individually below 10%. Occupancies for North American brands in the fourth quarter are slightly ahead year-over-year, with pricing also nicely higher. Late fourth quarter bookings for North American brands continue to be strong and yields have shown gradual improvement week-on-week. By the time the quarter closes, we expect North America brand revenue yields to increase in the 3% to 4% range on a year-over-year basis. For European brands, they are 72% in Europe itineraries, down slightly from 78% last year for the fourth quarter, with all other itineraries individually under 10%. European local currency pricing is also higher year-over-year, with occupancies at approximately the same levels. We are currently forecasting an increase in European brand local revenue yields in the fourth quarter by approximately 2%, which is a very positive result considering the 11% increase in capacity for the Europe brands during the quarter. From an overall standpoint, as indicated in the press release, we are forecasting fourth quarter fleetwide revenue yields to increase in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% on a local currency basis and lower by 1% to 2% on a current dollar basis as a result of the strengthening of dollar during this period on a year-over-year basis. 
Costs, excluding fuel are expected to be down 1% to 2% on a local currency basis and on a current dollar basis, lower by 5% to 6%. Earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the $0.32 to $0.36 range. This includes the impact of unfavorable currency and fuel costs of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter, and also compares to the $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Now, turning to the first quarter of 2011. Fleetwide capacity for the quarter as I indicated is up 6.7%, 4.2% for North American brands, 11.3% for Europe brands. On a fleetwide basis, first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancies running slightly behind the pattern similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010. For North American brands, they're 66% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year and 11% in the Mexican Riviera, which is about the same as the prior year, with the balance in various other itineraries. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is lower than a year ago on lower occupancies. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the lower levels we experienced a year ago on higher occupancies and pricing across all other itineraries is higher on slightly lower occupancies. Taking all itineraries together, including the Caribbean pricing, is currently in line with last year. 
Looking at our European brands in the first quarter, they're 25% in European itineraries, 23% in the Caribbean, down from 29% in the prior year and 18% in South America, which is about the same as in prior year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency pricing across all European itineraries is higher year-over-year on slightly higher overall occupancies. We are very pleased with the booking patterns and pricing in Europe to this point, which is being achieved despite the 11.3% increase in European capacity in the first quarter. From an overall standpoint in Q1, based on what we're seeing in North America and Europe on a local currency basis, we are estimating that fleetwide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher in the 2% range, driven largely by strong forecasted increases in European brand pricing, net of a small decline in North American pricing, largely the result of the lower pricing environment in Q1 in the very competitive Caribbean winter market. Current dollar pricing at today's exchange rate is forecast to be slightly down year-over-year. This is in Q1. 
Turning to Q2. Fleetwide capacity, as I indicated earlier, is up 4.9% in the second quarter, 2.5% for North America, 8.5% for our European companies. Let me emphasize that second quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development and being provided to give you a picture on how the quarter is shaping up at the present time. On a fleetwide basis, second quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis, with occupancies in line with the previous year. For North American brands, they're 55% in the Caribbean, about the same as last year, but 11% lower than in the first quarter of 2011, the balance in various other itineraries, all individually under 10%. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago, with occupancies currently in line with last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter, but improved from the first quarter. And pricing across all other North American brands itineraries is higher year-over-year. For European brands, they're 61% in Europe itineraries, up from 57% a year ago, with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency pricing for European brand cruises is running nicely higher year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior year levels, with given the 8.5% capacity increase in Europe brands is quite acceptable, especially given the higher pricing currently being achieved. While the booking picture for the second quarter of 2011 is still in its early stages of development, it is progressing quite well and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields in the second quarter of 2011 will be higher for both North American and European brands.

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking, and we refer you to the cautionary language in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local",1047,"Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking, and we refer you to the cautionary language in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted as this is a much better indicator of business trends. 
For the fourth quarter, our EPS was $0.31. The fourth quarter came in below the midpoint of our September guidance by $0.03 per share. The shortfall was caused by the previously announced $0.07 reduction in our fourth quarter EPS as a result of the voyage disruption. Had it not been for the voyage disruption, we would've exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04, driven by higher revenue yields and favorable currency impacts, each worth about $0.02 per share. 
Now let's look at our fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%, with substantially all of the increase coming from our European brand. Our European brands grew 10% while our North American brands only grew 1%. Our net revenue yields increased 3.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by a net ticket yield increase of 4.6%. Yields on both sides of the Atlantic improved, each growing over 4%. 
Our North American brands saw very nice yield increases in all itineraries except the Caribbean, which was flat on higher capacity. Our European brand's net ticket yields improved sequentially each quarter throughout the year and were better than we had expected in the fourth quarter. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, their 10% capacity increase and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year, giving them more difficult prior year comparisons. 
For net onboard and other yields, we saw a 2% increase, which was in line with our expectations, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. 
So in summary, we were very encouraged by the fact that we saw growth on both sides of the Atlantic in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields. 
On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day excluding fuel were up 1.6% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the voyage disruption, net cruise cost would've been down 1%. Fuel cost this quarter was 6% higher than last year and that caused us about $0.03 per share. While the stronger dollar resulted in lower recorded costs, overall, the stronger dollar also translated into $0.03 lower EPS. 
So in summary, our EPS improved $0.07 this quarter, driven by higher revenue yields despite the fuel currency and voyage disruption, which had a combined negative impact of $0.13 per share. 
Looking back at the full year 2010, our EPS was $2.47, which was $0.27 better than the midpoint of our original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.10 to $2.30 per share. The $0.27 improvement was primarily driven by the two points of additional revenue yield and the 1.5 points of additional lower net cruise cost per ALBD. This was partially offset by the combined negative impact from currency and fuel of $0.25. 
In the end, the economies on both sides of the Atlantic improved more than we had anticipated for 2010, driving revenue yields higher in both net ticket and net onboard and other. As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, about $500 million more than we expected last year at this time and more than enough to fund our expansion program, which peaked this year with six ships at a capital investment of $3.6 billion. 
Before I turn to the 2011 outlook, I would like to update you on how our operations will be segmented in future SEC filings, beginning with our 2010 10-K, which will be filed at the end of January. In the past, we have reported our operations split into two segments: One was Cruise and the other was to another. Going forward, we will be splitting the Cruise segment into three parts for a total of four segments as follows: The first segment will be our North American brands, which includes our four brands that primarily source their gas from North America. Those are Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess, Holland America and Seabourn. The second segment will be our European, Australian and Asian brands, which we will call EAA, to keep things simple. 
EAA will include our other six brands AIDA, Costa, North, Ibero, P&O Cruises U.K. and P&O Cruises Australia. The third segment will be Crew Support, which will include our corporate cruises port facilities and cruise support services. The fourth segment will remain unchanged as tour another, which principally includes our Holland America Princess Alaska tour operation. Given the increasing importance of our European brands, we felt that a further breakdown of our cruise segments was appropriate. 
Now turning to the 2011 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yield as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day for the full year and excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat. While we are seeing inflationary pressures in food costs, cotton prices and ocean freight rates, our ongoing cost containment programs, economies of scale and the generally low inflationary environment has allowed us to keep our forecasted costs flat. 
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices are expected to have a $0.17 negative impact on our earnings next year, while currency is expected to help us by $0.04 per share. 
In addition, I wanted to share with you the current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel prices and currency on our 2011 results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel represents $180 million or a $0.23 per share impact on our P&L. The impact of a 10% change in fuel obviously moves along with the price of fuel. With respect to a 10% movement in FX, if all the currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, that would impact our P&L by $194 million or $0.24. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard."

Let me provide sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like. With four ships being delivered during 2011, fleet-wide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and",1674,"Thank you, David. Let me provide sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like. With four ships being delivered during 2011, fleet-wide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and Asia or as we now refer to as EAA. 
In my comments today, if I'm mistaken, we referred to Europe brands, I mean EAA brands unless, of course, I really mean refer to our Europe brands. If you look confused, join the club. It's clear that the accountants went out on this one. 
New ship deliveries in 2011 include the AIDAsol to be delivered in late March to our Germany-based AIDA Cruises. Kind of a magic in late April, Seabourn Quest to be delivered in late May and of the Costa Fabulosa to be delivered in late June. 2011 begins the first year of reduced ship additions to our fleet with the capacity increase of 5.2% compared to our 2010 fleet increase of 7.1%. 
Our estimated CapEx for 2011, including maintenance CapEx, is $2.6 billion, down from the $3.6 billion of CapEx in 2010. Based on our 2011 earnings guidance, we estimate operating cash flow for 2011 will be approximately $4 billion, resulting in free cash flow for the year of $1.4 billion. 
With the reduction of our ship additions in each of the next few years, we anticipate generating an even greater amount of free cash flow in 2012 and beyond. As we have previously indicated, we are planning a dividend increase to shareholders in 2011, and we anticipate making the announcement of the new dividend payout after our mid-January board meeting. 
Now let me move on to the tone of business. At the present time across the company, fleet-wide ticket pricing for all business booked for 2011 is nicely ahead of 2010, with higher local currency pricing for both North America and EAA brands. Fleetwide occupancy levels are slightly lower than last year on a capacity adjusted basis. Within the overall occupancy and pricing data, there are variations in each of our markets and my comments later will include some of that color. 
Bookings taken quarter-to-date, that is, since our last earnings call, more or less, covering the first three quarters of 2011, has been solid, with a strong booking pace and local currency ticket pricing running nicely higher. Ticket pricing for North American brands has been running moderately higher year-over-year, nicely higher as we take out the softer Caribbean winter pricing. While Caribbean pricing on bookings to this period is moderately lower, prices for other more significant North American brand itineraries, the Mexican Riviera, Alaska, Europe et cetera, are nicely higher. 
For EAA brands, pricing quarter-to-date is also higher year-over-year. Most EAA itineraries including EAA winter Caribbean programs are showing good pricing improvement over last year. So it's fair to say that the overall demand for cruises continues to be strong, clearly evidencing that with the economic indicators turning positive, that North America and European consumer confidence is returning. While we are pleased with booking trends and pricing, we are still not back to the pricing levels we enjoyed back in 2008. But I guess that's the good news since even at these 2011 expected pricing levels, we are on track to achieve a significant increase in earnings per share this coming year, which now leads me to our revenue yield forecast and earnings guidance for 2011. 
We have forecasted top line revenue growth of approximately 9% for 2011. This is comprised of the 5.2% increase in our capacity and 3.5% to 4.5% increase in forecasted current dollar revenue yields and on a comps to dollar basis, that's 3% to 4%. In an operating costs on a cost to dollar basis excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat to up 1%. And assuming fuel at a $527 a ton and currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we are guiding earnings per share in the range of $2.90 to $3.10 for the fiscal 2011 year. The increase in fuel prices in our guidance has a 17%, and I think David indicated this before, negative impact on a year-over-year basis. 
Now looking at the first quarter. Fleetwide capacity for the first quarter of 2011 is expected to be 5.1% higher, 1.7% for North American brands and 10.8% for EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis, first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher versus 2010's first quarter, with occupancies at the same level as last year. Last-minute pricing on first quarter bookings has been strong versus last year, and at this juncture, we have only a small amount of inventory remaining to be sold to close out in the quarter. 
For North American brands, they are 67% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries during the first quarter. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is slightly lower and a year ago on lower occupancy. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the low levels of the year ago, and pricing across all other itineraries taken together is higher. 
Taking all North American brand itineraries together, including the Caribbean, pricing at the current time is at the same levels as last year. EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter, 21% in the Caribbean and 16% in South America with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency ticket prices across EAA brand itineraries including their Caribbean programs taken together is nicely higher year-over-year on higher overall occupancies. We continue to be pleased with booking patterns in pricing for all EAA brands, which is being achieved despite the 10.8% increase in EAA capacity in the first quarter. 
On an overall basis, based on the above, for the first quarter, local currency basis, we are and this is on a local currency basis, we are estimate that fleetwide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher in the 1.5% to 2.5% range, driven largely by strong increases in European brand pricing, net of perhaps a slight decline in North American brand prices. Actually, if you adjust 2010 local currency revenue yields with a $19 million benefit, with the unexpected collection of two revenue items, the range of yield improvement would be almost 3% higher in the first quarter of 2011. 
Current dollar pricing at today's exchange rates is now forecasted to be slightly higher year-over-year, and this is all in the first quarter. Unit costs excluding fuel for the first quarter on a local currency basis are expected to be higher by approximately 3% to 4% or 2% on a current dollar basis, and fuel is forecasted at $526 per ton. The higher year-over-year first quarter cost largely results last year's first quarter cost being reduced by certain one-time gains. 
First quarter EPS in 2011 is expected to be the range of $0.15 to $0.19 per share versus $0.12 per share in 2010, which I have adjusted for the one-time gains which amounted to $0.10 per share last year's first quarter. That includes the $0.02 per share for the revenue items I've previously referred to. 
Now turning to the second quarter fleetwide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 4.8% higher, 2.5% in North America and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis, second quarter 2011 local pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancies slightly lower than the previous year. For North American brands, they are 55% in the Caribbean with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago with occupancies currently slightly behind last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter but improved from the first quarter, and pricing across all other North American brand itineraries taken together is higher year-over-year. 
EAA brands in the second quarter are 55% in Europe with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency ticket pricing for EAA brand cruises is running ahead year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior year levels, which given the 8.6% increase in EAA capacity, is not surprising. 
Booking picture for the second quarter on overall basis for 2011 is progressing quite well, and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleetwide local currency yields for the second quarter will be higher for both North America and EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis, we are expecting local currency's second quarter revenue yields to sequentially improve in the first quarter. 
Now turning to the third quarter of 2011. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase 5%, 3.6% in North America and 7.2% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in the early development so I caution not to read too much into this information at this time. Having said that, early indications for the third quarter bookings are encouraging, with fleetwide pricing well ahead year-over-year at slightly lower occupancies. 
North American capacity for the third quarter is 36% in the Caribbean, 25% in Europe and 23% in Alaska. The balance of the capacity is in various other itineraries. Pricing for all itineraries combined is running well ahead of last year at lower occupancy. 
EAA brand capacity in the third quarter is 88% European itineraries. EAA pricing is running well ahead of last year, with occupancies in line with last year. So the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now but there is still a considerable amount of third quarter remaining to be sold. Much of the third quarter's revenue picture will depend on the strength of 2011 wave season but given the recent positive economic signs in the global economy, we are feeling optimistic that the 2011 wave season will be strong. And so that concludes my comments on the 2011 outlook. And with that, Panna, I will turn it back to you for questions."

One of the big benefits from a lot of the new ships is that the newer ships are more fuel efficient than the existing fleet, and that's something that we're seeing lower fuel consumption per berth day as a result of that, and some of the benefits that we've rolled into our guidance is due to the newer ships."

In the first quarter, I would say that my recollection was that because I said late bookings have been solid actually. In fact, actually up year-over-year. Some of that's got to be Caribbean on a broader sense. So I think Caribbean's holding its own and sequentially seems to be getting better in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis so I think that's probably fair. And I think that's about all I can recall. There's so much data that we look at. But Caribbean was holding its own basically and maybe slightly better year-over-year. And that could be attributable to the winter, the tough winters, the early winters we're experiencing up north and so on but clearly, the situation is stable to up, I would say, it's probably fair to say."

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward looking, and we'll refer you to the cautionary language in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in lo",1051,"Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward looking, and we'll refer you to the cautionary language in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted as this is a much better indicator of business trends. 
For the fourth quarter, our EPS was $0.31. The fourth quarter came in below the midpoint of our September guidance by $0.03 per share. The shortfall was caused by the previously announced $0.07 reduction in our fourth quarter EPS as a result of the voyage disruption. Had it not been for the voyage disruption, we would have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04, driven by higher revenue yields and favorable currency impacts, each worth about $0.02 per share. 
Now let's look at our fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%, with substantially all of the increase coming from our European brand. Our European brands grew 10% while our North American brands only grew 1%. Our net revenue yields increased 3.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by a net ticket yield increase of 4.6%. Yields on both sides to the Atlantic improved, each growing over 4%. 
Our North American brands saw very nice yield increases in all itineraries except the Caribbean, which was flat on higher capacity. Our European brand's net ticket yields improved sequentially each quarter throughout the year and were better than we had expected in the fourth quarter. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, their 10% capacity increase and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year, giving them more difficult prior-year comparisons. 
For net onboard and other yields, we saw our 2% increase, which was in line with our expectations, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. So in summary, we were very encouraged by the fact that we saw growth on both sides of the Atlantic in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields. 
On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day excluding fuel were up 1.6% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the voyage disruption, net cruise cost would have been down 1%. Fuel cost this quarter was 6% higher than last year and that caused us about $0.03 per share. While the stronger dollar resulted in lower recorded costs, overall, the stronger dollar also translated into $0.03 lower EPS. So in summary, our EPS improved $0.07 this quarter, driven by higher revenue yields, despite the fuel currency and voyage disruption, which had a combined negative impact of $0.13 per share. 
Looking back at the full year 2010, our EPS was $2.47, which was $0.27 better than the midpoint of our original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.10 to $2.30 per share. The $0.27 improvement was primarily driven by the two points of additional revenue yield and the 1.5 points of additional lower net cruise cost per ALBD. This was partially offset by the combined negative impact from currency and fuel of $0.25. 
In the end, the economies on both sides of the Atlantic improved more than we had anticipated for 2010, driving revenue yields higher in both net ticket and net onboard and other. As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, about $0.5 billion more than we expected last year at this time and more than enough to fund our expansion program, which peaked this year with six ships at a capital investment of $3.6 billion. 
Before I turn to the 2011 outlook, I would like to update you on how our operations will be segmented in future SEC filings, beginning with our 2010 10-K, which will be filed at the end of January. In the past, we have reported our operations split into two segments: one was Cruise and the other was Tour and Other. Going forward, we will be splitting the Cruise segment into three parts for a total of four segments as follows: the first segment will be our North American brands, which includes our four brands that primarily source their gas from North America. Those are Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess, Holland America and Seabourn. The second segment will be our European, Australian and Asian brands, which we will call EAA, to keep things simple. 
EAA will include our other six brands AIDA, Costa, Cunard, Ibero, P&O Cruises U.K. and P&O Cruises Australia. The third segment will be Cruise Support, which will include our corporate cruise port facilities and cruise support services. The fourth segment will remain unchanged as Tour and Other, which principally includes our Holland America, Princess Alaska tour operation. Given the increasing importance of our European brands, we felt that a further breakdown of our Cruise segments was appropriate. 
Now turning to the 2011 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yield as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day for the full year and excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat. While we are seeing inflationary pressures in food costs, cotton prices and ocean freight rates, our ongoing cost containment programs, economies of scale and the generally low inflationary environment has allowed us to keep our forecasted costs flat. 
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices are expected to have a $0.17 negative impact on our earnings next year, while currency is expected to help us by $0.04 per share. In addition, I wanted to share with you the current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel prices and currency on our 2011 results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel represents $180 million or a $0.23 per share impact on our P&L. The impact of a 10% change in fuel obviously moves along with the price of fuel. With respect to a 10% movement in FX, if all the currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, that would impact our P&L by $194 million or $0.24. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard."

Let me provide sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like. With four ships being delivered during 2011, fleet-wide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and",1676,"Thank you, David. Let me provide sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like. With four ships being delivered during 2011, fleet-wide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and Asia or as we now refer to it, EAA. 
In my comments today, if I'm mistakenly refer to Europe brands, I mean EAA brands unless, of course, I really mean to refer to our Europe brands. If you get a little confused, join the club. It's clear that the accountants went out on this one. 
New ship deliveries in 2011 include the AIDAsol to be delivered in late March to our Germany-based AIDA Cruises. Kind of a magic in late April, Seabourn Quest to be delivered in late May and the Costa Favolosa to be delivered in late June. 2011 begins the first year of reduced ship additions to our fleet with the capacity increase of 5.2% compared to our 2010 fleet increase of 7.1%. 
Our estimated CapEx for 2011, including maintenance CapEx, is $2.6 billion, down from the $3.6 billion of CapEx in 2010. Based on our 2011 earnings guidance, we estimate operating cash flow for 2011 will be approximately $4 billion, resulting in free cash flow for the year of $1.4 billion. 
With the reduction of our ship additions in each of the next few years, we anticipate generating an even greater amount of free cash flow in 2012 and beyond. As we have previously indicated, we are planning a dividend increase to shareholders in 2011, and we anticipate making the announcement of the new dividend payout after our mid-January board meeting. 
Now let me move on to the tone of business. At the present time across the company, fleet-wide ticket pricing for all business booked for 2011 is nicely ahead of 2010, with higher local currency pricing for both North America and EAA brands. Fleet-wide occupancy levels are slightly lower than last year on a capacity-adjusted basis. Within the overall occupancy and pricing data, there are variations in each of our markets and my comments later will include some of that color. 
Bookings taken quarter-to-date, that is, since our last earnings call, more or less, covering the first three quarters of 2011, have been solid, with a strong booking pace and local currency ticket pricing running nicely higher. Ticket pricing for North American brands has been running moderately higher year-over-year, nicely higher as we take out the softer Caribbean winter pricing. While Caribbean pricing on bookings to this period is moderately lower, prices for other more significant North American brand itineraries, the Mexican Riviera, Alaska, Europe, et cetera, are nicely higher. 
For EAA brands, surprising quarter-to-date is also higher year-over-year. Most EAA itineraries, including EAA winter Caribbean programs, are showing good pricing improvement over last year. So it's fair to say that the overall demand for cruises continues to be strong, clearly evidencing that with the economic indicators turning positive, that North America and European consumer confidence is returning. While we are pleased with booking trends and pricing, we are still not back to the pricing levels we enjoyed back in 2008. But I guess that's the good news since even at these 2011 expected pricing levels, we are on track to achieve a significant increase in earnings per share this coming year, which now leads me to our revenue yield forecast and earnings guidance for 2011. 
We have forecasted top line revenue growth of approximately 9% for 2011. This is comprised of the 5.2% increase in our capacity and 3.5% to 4.5% increase in forecasted current dollar revenue yields and on a comps-to-dollar basis, that's 3% to 4%. In an operating costs on a current dollar basis excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat to up 1%. And assuming fuel at a $527 a ton and currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we are guiding earnings per share in the range of $2.90 to $3.10 for the fiscal 2011 year. The increase in fuel prices in our guidance has a 17%, and I think David indicated this before, negative impact on a year-over-year basis. 
Now looking at the first quarter. Fleet-wide capacity for the first quarter of 2011 is expected to be 5.1% higher, 1.7% for North American brands and 10.8% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher versus 2010's first quarter, with occupancies at the same level as last year. Last-minute pricing on first quarter bookings has been strong versus last year, and at this juncture, we have only a small amount of inventory remaining to be sold to close out the quarter. 
For North American brands, they are 67% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries during this first quarter. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is slightly lower and a year ago on lower occupancy. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the low levels of the year ago, and pricing across all other itineraries taken together is higher. 
Taking all North American brand itineraries together, including the Caribbean, pricing at the current time is at the same levels as last year. EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter, 21% in the Caribbean and 16% in South America with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency ticket prices across EAA brand itineraries, including their Caribbean programs taken together, is nicely higher year-over-year on higher overall occupancies. We continue to be pleased with booking patterns in pricing for all EAA brands, which is being achieved despite the 10.8% increase in EAA capacity in the first quarter. 
On an overall basis, based on the above, for the first quarter, local currency basis, we are -- and this is on a local currency basis, we are estimating that fleet-wide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher in the 1.5% to 2.5% range, driven largely by strong increases in European brand pricing, net of perhaps a slight decline in North American brand prices. Actually, if you adjust first quarter 2010 local currency revenue yields with a $19 million benefit, with the unexpected collection of two revenue items, the range of yield improvement would be almost 3% higher in the first quarter of 2011. 
Current dollar pricing at today's exchange rates is now forecasted to be slightly higher year-over-year, and this is all in the first quarter. Unit costs excluding fuel for the first quarter on a local currency basis are expected to be higher by approximately 3% to 4% or 2% on a current dollar basis, and fuel is forecasted at $526 per ton. A higher year-over-year first quarter cost largely results from last year's first quarter cost being reduced by certain one-time gains. 
First quarter EPS in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.19 per share versus $0.12 per share in 2010, which I have adjusted for the one-time gains, which amounted to $0.10 per share last year's first quarter. And that includes the $0.02 per share for the revenue items I previously referred to. 
Now turning to the second quarter fleet-wide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 4.8% higher, 2.5% in North America and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, second quarter 2011 local pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancies slightly lower from the previous year. For North American brands, they are 55% in the Caribbean with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago with occupancies currently slightly behind last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter, but improved from the first quarter, and pricing across all other North American brand itineraries taken together is higher year-over-year. 
EAA brands in the second quarter are 55% in Europe with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency ticket pricing for EAA brand cruises is running ahead year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior-year levels, which given the 8.6% increase in EAA capacity, is not surprising. 
Booking picture for the second quarter on overall basis for 2011 is progressing quite well and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleet-wide local currency yields for the second quarter will be higher for both North America and EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, we are expecting local currency's second quarter revenue yields to sequentially improve in the first quarter. 
Now turning to the third quarter of 2011. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase 5%, 3.6% in North America and 7.2% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in the early development, so I caution not to read too much into this information at this time. Having said that, early indications for the third quarter bookings are encouraging, with fleet-wide pricing well ahead year-over-year at slightly lower occupancies. 
North American capacity for the third quarter is 36% in the Caribbean, 25% in Europe and 23% in Alaska. The balance of the capacity is in various other itineraries. Pricing for all itineraries combined is running well ahead of last year at lower occupancy. 
EAA brand capacity in the third quarter is 88% European itineraries. EAA pricing is running well ahead of last year, with occupancies in line with last year. So the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now, but there is still a considerable amount of third quarter inventory remaining to be sold. Much of the third quarter's revenue picture will depend on the strength of 2011 wave season, but given the recent positive economic signs in the global economy, we are feeling optimistic that the 2011 wave season will be strong. 
And so that concludes my comments on the 2011 outlook. And with that, Pema, I will turn it back to you for questions."

Some of that's got to be Caribbean on a broader sense. So I think Caribbean's holding its own and sequentially seems to be getting better in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. So I think that's probably fair. And I think that's about all I can recall. There's so much data that we look at. But Caribbean was holding its own basically and maybe slightly better year-over-year. And that could be attributable to the winter, the tough winters or early winters we're experiencing up north and so on. But clearly, the situation is stable to up, I would say, it's probably fair to say."

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary language in today’s press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in loc",1051,"Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary language in today’s press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted as this is a much better indicator of business trends.
For the fourth quarter our EPS was $0.31. The fourth quarter came in below the midpoint of our September guidance by $0.03 per share. The shortfall was caused by the previously announced $0.07 reduction in our fourth quarter EPS as a result of the voyage disruption, and it not been for the voyage disruption we would have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 driven by higher revenue yields and favorable currency impacts each worth about $0.02 per, excuse me, per share.
Now let’s look at our fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5% with substantially all of the increase coming from our European brands. Our European brands grew 10% while our North American brands only grew 1%.
Our net revenue yields increased 3.9% in the fourth quarter driven by a net ticket yield increase of 4.6%. Yields on both sides of the Atlantic improved each growing over 4%. Our North American brands saw very nice yield increases in all itineraries except the Caribbean which was flat on higher capacity.
Our European brands net ticket yields improved sequentially each quarter throughout the year and were better than we had expected in the fourth quarter. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, their 10% capacity increase and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year giving them more difficult prior year comparisons.
For net onboard and other yields we saw 2% increase, which was in line with our expectations with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. So in summary, we were very encouraged by the fact that we saw growth on both sides of the Atlantic in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields.
On the cost side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day excluding fuel were up 1.6% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the voyage disruption net cruise costs would have been down 1%.
Fuel costs this quarter was 6% higher than last year and that cost us about $0.03 per share, while the stronger dollar resulted in lower recorded costs, overall the stronger dollar also translated into $0.03 lower EPS.
So in summary, our EPS improved $0.07 this quarter driven by higher revenue yields despite the fuel, currency and voyage disruptions which had a combined negative impact of $0.13 per share.
Looking back at the full-year 2010, our EPS was $2.47 which was $0.27 better than the midpoint of our original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.10 to $2.30 per share. The $0.27 improvement was primarily driven by the 2 points of additional revenue yield and the 1.5 points of additional lower net cruise costs per ALBD. This was partially offset by the combined negative impact from currency and fuel of $0.25.
In the end the economies on both sides of the Atlantic improved more than we had anticipated for 2010 driving revenue yields higher in both net ticket and net onboard and other.
As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, about $0.5 billion more than we expected last year at this time and more than enough to fund our expansion program which peaked this year with six ships at a capital investment of $3.6 billion.
Before I turn to the 2011 outlook, I would like to update you on how our operations will be segmented in future SEC filings beginning with our 2010 10-K, which will be filed at the end of January.
In the past we have reported our operations split into two segments, one was Cruise and the other was Tour and Other. Going forward, we will be splitting the Cruise segment into three parts for a total of four segments as follows.
The first segment will be our North American brands which includes our four brands that primarily source their guests from North America. Those are Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess, Holland America and Seabourn.
The second segment will be our European, Australian and Asian brands, which we will call EAA to keep things simple. EAA will include our other six brands, AIDA, Costa, Cunard, Ibero, P&O Cruises U.K. and P&O Cruises Australia.
The third segment will be Cruise Support which will include our corporate cruise port facilities and cruise support services.
The fourth segment will remain unchanged as Tour and Other, which principally includes our Holland America Princess Alaska tour operation. Given the increasing importance of our European brands, we felt that a further breakdown of our Cruise segment was appropriate.
Now turning to the 2011 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side net cruise costs per available lower berth day for the full year and excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat.
While we are seeing inflationary pressures in food costs, cotton prices and ocean freight rates, our ongoing cost containment programs, economies of scale and the generally low inflationary environment has allowed us to keep our forecasted costs flat.
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices are expected to have a $0.17 negative impact on our earnings next year, while currency is expected to help us by $0.04 per share.
In addition, I wanted to share with you the current rules of sum about the impact of fuel prices and currency on our 2011 results. To start with a 10% change in the price of fuel represents $180 million or $0.23 per share impact on our P&L.
The impact of a 10% change in fuel obviously moves along with the price of fuel. With respect to a 10% movement in FX, if all the currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar that would impact our P&L by $194 million or $0.24.
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard.

Let me provide some sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like, with four ships being delivered during 2011, fleetwide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia",1680,"Thank you, David. Let me provide some sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like, with four ships being delivered during 2011, fleetwide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and Asia or as we now refer to it EAA.
In my comments today if I mistakenly refer to Europe brands, I mean EAA brands unless of course, I really mean to refer to our Europe brands. To you get a little confused join the club. It’s clear that the accountants won out on this one.
New ship deliveries in 2011 include the AIDAsol to be delivered in late March to our Germany-based AIDA Cruises, Carnival Magic in late April, Seabourn Quest to be delivered in late May and the Costa Fabulosa to be delivered in late June.
2011 begins the first year of reduced ship additions to our fleet with a capacity increase of 5.2% compared to our 2010 fleet increase of 7.1%. Our estimated CapEx for 2011, including maintenance CapEx is $2.6 billion, down from the $3.6 billion of CapEx in 2010.
Based on our 2011 earnings guidance we estimate operating cash flow for 2011 will be approximately $4 billion, resulting in free cash flow for the year of $1.4 billion. With the reduction of our ship additions in each of the next few years, we anticipate generating an even greater amount of free cash flow in 2012 and beyond.
As we have previously indicated, we are planning a dividend increase to shareholders in 2011 and we anticipate making the announcement of the new dividend payout after our mid-January Board meeting.
Now let me move on to the tone of business. At the present time across the company fleetwide ticket pricing for all business booked for 2011 is nicely ahead of 2010 with higher local currency pricing for both North America and EAA brands.
Fleetwide occupancy levels are slightly lower than last year on a capacity adjusted basis, within the overall occupancy and pricing data there are variations in each of our markets and my comments later will include some of that color.
Bookings taken quarter-to-date that is since our last earnings call, more or less covering the first three quarters of 2011 have been solid with a strong booking pace and local currency ticket pricing running nicely higher.
Ticket pricing for North American brands has been running moderately higher year-over-year, nicely higher if we take out the softer Caribbean winter pricing. While Caribbean pricing on bookings for this period is moderately lower, prices for our other more significant North American brand itineraries, the Mexican Riviera, Alaska, Europe, et cetera are nicely higher.
For EAA brands pricing quarter-to-date is also higher year-over-year, most EAA itineraries, including EAA winter Caribbean programs are showing good pricing improvement over last year.
So it’s fair to say that the overall demand for cruises continues to be strong clearly evidencing that with the economic indicators turning positive that North America and European consumer confidence is returning.
While we are pleased with booking trends and pricing, we are still not back to the pricing levels we enjoyed back in 2008. But I guess that’s good news, since even at those -- at these 2011 expected pricing levels we are on track to achieve a significant increase in earnings per share this coming year, which now leaves me to our revenue yield forecast and earnings guidance for 2011.
We have forecasted topline revenue growth of approximately 9% for 2011. This is comprised of the 5.2% increase in our capacity and 3.5% and 4.5% -- to a 4.5% increase in forecasted current dollar revenue yields and on a constant dollar basis that is 3% to 4%.
Unit operating costs on a current dollar basis excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat to up 1% and assuming fuel at $527 a ton and currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we are guiding earnings per share in the range of $2.90 to $3.10 for the fiscal 2011 year. The increase in fuel prices in our guidance has a 17% and I think, David, indicated this before, negative impact on a year-over-year basis.
Now, looking at the first quarter. Fleetwide capacity for the first quarter of 2011 is expected to be 5.1% higher, 1.7% for North American brands and 10.8% for EAA brands.
On a fleetwide basis first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher versus 2010’s first quarter with occupancies at the same level as last year. Last minute pricing on first quarter bookings has been strong versus last year and at this juncture we have only a small amount of inventory remaining to be sold to close out the quarter.
Our North American brands, they are 67% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries during this first quarter. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is slightly lower a year ago on lower occupancies. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the low levels of a year ago and pricing across all other itineraries taken together is higher.
Taking all North American brand itineraries together, including the Caribbean pricing at the current time is at the same levels as last year. EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter -- 21% in the Caribbean and 16% in South America with the balance in various other itineraries.
Local currency ticket prices, of course, EAA brand itineraries including their Caribbean programs taken together is nicely higher year-over-year on higher overall occupancies. We continue to be pleased with booking patterns and pricing for all EAA brands which is being achieved despite the 10.8% increase in EAA capacity in the first quarter.
On an overall basis based on the above for the first quarter, local currency basis we are and this is on a local currency basis. We are estimating that fleetwide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher in the 1.5% to 2.5% range, driven largely by strong increases in European brand pricing net perhaps a slight decline in North American brand pricing.
Actually, we adjust first quarter 2010 local currency revenue yields for the $19 million benefit for the unexpected collection of two revenue items, the range of yield improvement would be almost 3% higher in the first quarter of 2011.
Current dollar pricing at today’s exchange rates is now forecasted to be slightly higher year-over-year and this is all in the first quarter.
Unit costs excluding fuel for the first quarter on a local currency basis are expected to be higher by approximately 3% to 4% or 2% on a current dollar basis and fuel is forecasted at $526 per ton. The higher year-over-year first quarter costs largely results from last year’s first quarter costs being reduced by certain one-time gains.
First quarter EPS into 2011 is expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.19 per share versus $0.12 per share in 2010, which I’ve adjusted for the one-time gains which amounted to $0.10 per share last year’s first quarter. That includes the $0.02 per share for the revenue items I’d previously referred to.
Now turning to the second quarter. Fleetwide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 4.8% higher, 2.5% in North America and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis second quarter 2011 local pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancies slightly lower from the previous year.
For North American brands they are 55% in the Caribbean with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago with occupancies currently slightly behind last year.
Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter but improved from the first quarter. Pricing across all other North American brand itineraries taken together is higher year-over-year.
EAA brands in the second quarter are 55% in Europe with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency ticket pricing for EAA brand cruises is running ahead year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior year levels, which given the 8.6% increase in EAA capacity is not surprising.
Booking picture for the second quarter on an overall basis of 2011 is progressing quite well and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns we currently are forecasting that fleetwide local currency yields for the second quarter will be higher for both North America and EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis we are expecting local currency second quarter revenue yields to sequentially improve in the first quarter.
Now turning to the third quarter of 2011. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase 5%, 3.6% in North America and 7.2% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in the early development, so I caution not to read too much into this information at this time.
Having said that, early indications for the third quarter bookings are encouraging with fleetwide pricing well ahead year-over-year at slightly lower occupancies, North American capacity from third quarter is 36% in the Caribbean, 25% in Europe and 23% in Alaska. The balance of the capacity is in various other itineraries. Pricing for all itineraries combined is running well ahead of last year at lower occupancy.
EAA brand capacity in the third quarter is 88% European itineraries. EAA pricing is running well ahead of last year and occupancy is in line with last year. So the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now but there is still a considerable amount of third quarter inventory remaining to be sold.
Much of the third quarter’s revenue picture will depend on the strength of 2011 wave season, but given the recent positive economic signs in the global economy, we are feeling optimistic that the 2011 wave season will be strong.
And so that concludes my comments on the 2011 outlook. And with that, Parma, I will turn it back to you for questions.

I think if you believe the economic forecasters and we talk about a 3% to 4% growth in GDP in North America next year and getting back to some growth in Europe. I think the slowing capacity is a positive sign for us and I think demand will start to catch up with the capacity that we have added over the last several years. So I think it’s a sign that we should see some good growth in ticket prices as we go forward. And I think that is what we are forecasting for this year.

So we are seeing a gradual improvement in the consumer and expecting the onboards to go up throughout the year. And we are also taking lots of steps to make things better ourselves.
We’re not just waiting for the consumer, adding various things on our ship, things like facial recognition in the photo, karaoke with live bands on some of the Carnival ships. We are even adding things like the carotene hair straightening treatments on a lot of our ships. So we are looking to expand the various offerings and to increase the revenue yields.

So I think that is probably fair and I think that is about all I can recall because there is so much data that we look at. But Caribbean was holding its own basically and maybe slightly better year-over-year.

But I think a lot of that stems from the fact that we were able to achieve things with suppliers that was significantly better than we had anticipated in the guidance. Plus on top of it this year what we are starting to see is as the economy turns it’s a little bit better world out there.
So I mentioned before we are starting to see inflationary pressures in certain areas. So we are finding ways to get that out of the system and keep costs flat. Our brands are working on hundreds of different items to save costs.
So we gave you what we anticipated to be the most realistic cost guidance for the year. But we are never going to stop. If there is an opportunity to do better than that, just like last year, we will find a way and we will get the costs out of the system.

I think going forward I think it’s going to be more or less the same that both premium and contemporary pricing are showing good improvement here in North America as well as in Europe.

Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted as this is a much better indicator of business trends. 
For the fourth quarter, our EPS was $0.31. The fourth quarter came in below the midpoint of our September guidance by $0.03 per share. The shortfall was caused by the previously announced $0.07 reduction in our fourth quarter EPS as a result of the voyage disruption. Had it not been for the voyage disruption, we would have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04, driven by higher revenue yields and favorable currency impacts, each worth about $0.02 per share. 
Now let's look at our fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%, with substantially all of the increase coming from our European brand. Our European brands grew 10% while our North American brands only grew 1%. Our net revenue yields increased 3.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by a net ticket yield increase of 4.6%. Yields on both sides to the Atlantic improved, each growing over 4%. 
Our North American brands saw very nice yield increases in all itineraries except the Caribbean, which was flat on higher capacity. Our European brand's net ticket yields improved sequentially each quarter throughout the year and were better than we had expected in the fourth quarter. We were pleased with this performance given the uncertain economic environment, their 10% capacity increase and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year, giving them more difficult prior-year comparisons. 
For net onboard and other yields, we saw our 2% increase, which was in line with our expectations, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. So in summary, we were very encouraged by the fact that we saw growth on both sides of the Atlantic in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields. 
On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day excluding fuel were up 1.6% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the voyage disruption, net cruise cost would have been down 1%. Fuel cost this quarter was 6% higher than last year and that cost us about $0.03 per share. While the stronger dollar resulted in lower recorded costs, overall, the stronger dollar also translated into $0.03 lower EPS. So in summary, our EPS improved $0.07 this quarter, driven by higher revenue yields, despite the fuel currency and voyage disruption, which had a combined negative impact of $0.13 per share. 
Looking back at the full year 2010, our EPS was $2.47, which was $0.27 better than the midpoint of our original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.10 to $2.30 per share. The $0.27 improvement was primarily driven by the two points of additional revenue yield and the 1.5 points of additional lower net cruise cost per ALBD. This was partially offset by the combined negative impact from currency and fuel of $0.25. 
In the end, the economies on both sides of the Atlantic improved more than we had anticipated for 2010, driving revenue yields higher in both net ticket and net onboard and other. As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, about $0.5 billion more than we expected last year at this time and more than enough to fund our expansion program, which peaked this year with six ships at a capital investment of $3.6 billion. 
Before I turn to the 2011 outlook, I would like to update you on how our operations will be segmented in future SEC filings, beginning with our 2010 10-K, which will be filed at the end of January. In the past, we have reported our operations split into two segments: one was Cruise and the other was Tour and Other. Going forward, we will be splitting the Cruise segment into three parts for a total of four segments as follows: the first segment will be our North American brands, which includes our four brands that primarily source their gas from North America. Those are Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess, Holland America and Seabourn. The second segment will be our European, Australian and Asian brands, which we will call EAA, to keep things simple. 
EAA will include our other six brands AIDA, Costa, Cunard, Ibero, P&O Cruises U.K. and P&O Cruises Australia. The third segment will be Cruise Support, which will include our corporate cruise port facilities and cruise support services. The fourth segment will remain unchanged as Tour and Other, which principally includes our Holland America, Princess Alaska tour operation. Given the increasing importance of our European brands, we felt that a further breakdown of our Cruise segments was appropriate. 
Now turning to the 2011 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yield as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day for the full year and excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat. While we are seeing inflationary pressures in food costs, cotton prices and ocean freight rates, our ongoing cost containment programs, economies of scale and the generally low inflationary environment has allowed us to keep our forecasted costs flat. 
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that based on the current spot price for fuel, fuel prices are expected to have a $0.17 negative impact on our earnings next year, while currency is expected to help us by $0.04 per share. In addition, I wanted to share with you the current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel prices and currency on our 2011 results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel represents $180 million or a $0.23 per share impact on our P&L. The impact of a 10% change in fuel obviously moves along with the price of fuel. With respect to a 10% movement in FX, if all the currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, that would impact our P&L by $194 million or $0.24. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard."

Let me provide sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like. With four ships being delivered during 2011, fleet-wide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and",1676,"Thank you, David. Let me provide sort of an overview of what 2011 looks like. With four ships being delivered during 2011, fleet-wide capacity will increase by 5.2%, 2.8% for our North American fleet and 9.1% for our cruise brands in Europe, Australia and Asia or as we now refer to it, EAA. 
In my comments today, if I'm mistakenly refer to Europe brands, I mean EAA brands unless, of course, I really mean to refer to our Europe brands. If you get a little confused, join the club. It's clear that the accountants went out on this one. 
New ship deliveries in 2011 include the AIDAsol to be delivered in late March to our Germany-based AIDA Cruises. Kind of a magic in late April, Seabourn Quest to be delivered in late May and the Costa Favolosa to be delivered in late June. 2011 begins the first year of reduced ship additions to our fleet with the capacity increase of 5.2% compared to our 2010 fleet increase of 7.1%. 
Our estimated CapEx for 2011, including maintenance CapEx, is $2.6 billion, down from the $3.6 billion of CapEx in 2010. Based on our 2011 earnings guidance, we estimate operating cash flow for 2011 will be approximately $4 billion, resulting in free cash flow for the year of $1.4 billion. 
With the reduction of our ship additions in each of the next few years, we anticipate generating an even greater amount of free cash flow in 2012 and beyond. As we have previously indicated, we are planning a dividend increase to shareholders in 2011, and we anticipate making the announcement of the new dividend payout after our mid-January board meeting. 
Now let me move on to the tone of business. At the present time across the company, fleet-wide ticket pricing for all business booked for 2011 is nicely ahead of 2010, with higher local currency pricing for both North America and EAA brands. Fleet-wide occupancy levels are slightly lower than last year on a capacity-adjusted basis. Within the overall occupancy and pricing data, there are variations in each of our markets and my comments later will include some of that color. 
Bookings taken quarter-to-date, that is, since our last earnings call, more or less, covering the first three quarters of 2011, have been solid, with a strong booking pace and local currency ticket pricing running nicely higher. Ticket pricing for North American brands has been running moderately higher year-over-year, nicely higher as we take out the softer Caribbean winter pricing. While Caribbean pricing on bookings to this period is moderately lower, prices for other more significant North American brand itineraries, the Mexican Riviera, Alaska, Europe, et cetera, are nicely higher. 
For EAA brands, pricing quarter-to-date is also higher year-over-year. Most EAA itineraries, including EAA winter Caribbean programs, are showing good pricing improvement over last year. So it's fair to say that the overall demand for cruises continues to be strong, clearly evidencing that with the economic indicators turning positive, that North America and European consumer confidence is returning. While we are pleased with booking trends and pricing, we are still not back to the pricing levels we enjoyed back in 2008. But I guess that's the good news since even at these 2011 expected pricing levels, we are on track to achieve a significant increase in earnings per share this coming year, which now leads me to our revenue yield forecast and earnings guidance for 2011. 
We have forecasted top line revenue growth of approximately 9% for 2011. This is comprised of the 5.2% increase in our capacity and 3.5% to 4.5% increase in forecasted current dollar revenue yields and on a comps-to-dollar basis, that's 3% to 4%. In an operating costs on a current dollar basis excluding fuel are forecasted to be flat to up 1%. And assuming fuel at a $527 a ton and currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we are guiding earnings per share in the range of $2.90 to $3.10 for the fiscal 2011 year. The increase in fuel prices in our guidance has a 17%, and I think David indicated this before, negative impact on a year-over-year basis. 
Now looking at the first quarter. Fleet-wide capacity for the first quarter of 2011 is expected to be 5.1% higher, 1.7% for North American brands and 10.8% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher versus 2010's first quarter, with occupancies at the same level as last year. Last-minute pricing on first quarter bookings has been strong versus last year, and at this juncture, we have only a small amount of inventory remaining to be sold to close out the quarter. 
For North American brands, they are 67% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries during this first quarter. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is slightly lower and a year ago on lower occupancy. Mexican Riviera pricing is nicely higher from the low levels of the year ago, and pricing across all other itineraries taken together is higher. 
Taking all North American brand itineraries together, including the Caribbean, pricing at the current time is at the same levels as last year. EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter, 21% in the Caribbean and 16% in South America with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency ticket prices across EAA brand itineraries, including their Caribbean programs taken together, is nicely higher year-over-year on higher overall occupancies. We continue to be pleased with booking patterns in pricing for all EAA brands, which is being achieved despite the 10.8% increase in EAA capacity in the first quarter. 
On an overall basis, based on the above, for the first quarter, local currency basis, we are -- and this is on a local currency basis, we are estimating that fleet-wide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher in the 1.5% to 2.5% range, driven largely by strong increases in European brand pricing, net of perhaps a slight decline in North American brand pricing. Actually, if you adjust first quarter 2010 local currency revenue yields with a $19 million benefit, with the unexpected collection of two revenue items, the range of yield improvement would be almost 3% higher in the first quarter of 2011. 
Current dollar pricing at today's exchange rates is now forecasted to be slightly higher year-over-year, and this is all in the first quarter. Unit costs excluding fuel for the first quarter on a local currency basis are expected to be higher by approximately 3% to 4% or 2% on a current dollar basis, and fuel is forecasted at $526 per ton. A higher year-over-year first quarter cost largely results from last year's first quarter cost being reduced by certain one-time gains. 
First quarter EPS in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.19 per share versus $0.12 per share in 2010, which I have adjusted for the one-time gains, which amounted to $0.10 per share last year's first quarter. And that includes the $0.02 per share for the revenue items I previously referred to. 
Now turning to the second quarter fleet-wide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 4.8% higher, 2.5% in North America and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, second quarter 2011 local pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancies slightly lower from the previous year. For North American brands, they are 55% in the Caribbean with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago with occupancies currently slightly behind last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter, but improved from the first quarter, and pricing across all other North American brand itineraries taken together is higher year-over-year. 
EAA brands in the second quarter are 55% in Europe with the balance in various other itineraries. Similar to the first quarter, local currency ticket pricing for EAA brand cruises is running ahead year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior-year levels, which given the 8.6% increase in EAA capacity, is not surprising. 
Booking picture for the second quarter on overall basis of 2011 is progressing quite well and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleet-wide local currency yields for the second quarter will be higher for both North America and EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, we are expecting local currency's second quarter revenue yields to sequentially improve in the first quarter. 
Now turning to the third quarter of 2011. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase 5%, 3.6% in North America and 7.2% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in the early development, so I caution not to read too much into this information at this time. Having said that, early indications for the third quarter bookings are encouraging, with fleet-wide pricing well ahead year-over-year at slightly lower occupancies. 
North American capacity for the third quarter is 36% in the Caribbean, 25% in Europe and 23% in Alaska. The balance of the capacity is in various other itineraries. Pricing for all itineraries combined is running well ahead of last year at lower occupancy. 
EAA brand capacity in the third quarter is 88% European itineraries. EAA pricing is running well ahead of last year, with occupancies in line with last year. So the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now, but there is still a considerable amount of third quarter inventory remaining to be sold. Much of the third quarter's revenue picture will depend on the strength of 2011 wave season, but given the recent positive economic signs in the global economy, we are feeling optimistic that the 2011 wave season will be strong. 
And so that concludes my comments on the 2011 outlook. And with that, Pema, I will turn it back to you for questions."

And secondly, on the new split into EAA, will you be giving us the foreign exchange rates at which you convert? So we get a little bit more clarity. And then if I can just slip a last one in, in the last two or three calls, Micky, you've talked about being a little bit worried about the increasing seasonality of the business, Q1 and being less profitable maybe than in the past and Q3 being much more profitable. You haven't mentioned that this time. Is that not panned out to be as not you thought it might be?"
