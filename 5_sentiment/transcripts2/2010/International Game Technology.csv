Before I go into a discussion of the results for the quarter, I'd first like to remind our li",2730,"Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to IGT's First Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me this afternoon is Patti Hart, our President and CEO. Before I go into a discussion of the results for the quarter, I'd first like to remind our listeners our discussion reflects management views based on the marketplace environment as of today January 21, 2010, and will include forward-looking statements, including forecasts of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products, play levels for our installed base of recurring revenue gains, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments and business strategies.  We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2009. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and in our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website at igt.com. You will find additional disclosures regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. With that said, this afternoon, IGT reported its first quarter results for fiscal 2010, net income totaled $73 million or $0.25 per diluted share. This compares to $61 million and $0.21 per diluted share on the prior year quarter. First quarter benefited from $0.01 of EPS related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules. And we effectively were able to recognize some revenue that have been scheduled to occur later in this fiscal year, so it was really just swapping that one quarter to the next. And then we also benefited of $0.01 of EPS related to discrete tax items. Additionally, the first quarter was affected by a number of notable items, the details of which are broken out in our earnings press release, which went out this afternoon. The prior year quarter include certain restated amounts due to the required retrospective application of new accounting standards associated with our convertible debt.  On a consolidated basis, our revenues for the quarter were $516 million, of which 54% came from gaming operations and the balance from product sales, compared to $602 million for the same quarter last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter was $297 million and $140 million respectively, compared to $306 million and $100 million respectively in the prior quarter. Revenue comparisons for last year were impacted by an extra week in the prior year quarter, which contributed $22.4 million of revenues and an $11.5 million of the gross profit line in our consolidated operations, as well as lower play levels and fewer new openings.During the current quarter, we adopted new accounting standards required in retrospective application to prior periods associated with our convertible debt and with equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the end of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in diluted EPS of $0.02 and $0.01 in the current and prior periods. Additionally, we adopted new accounting guidance during the quarter related to revenue recognition for certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements on a prospective basis. The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance for transactions in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 resulted in $10.4 million of revenues, which would have been recognized in later periods of this fiscal year under the prior guidance. Approximately $6.9 million of this amount was accumulated lease fees that have not yet been recognized pending the execution of the final contract, which occurred this quarter, Q1 of '10. The increased revenues of $10.4 million, which were recognized because we met the accounting requirements for revenue recognition earlier than anticipated, resulted in approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS. Moving on to gaming operations. Our gaming operations continue to feel the impact of challenging marketplace conditions. Game op revenues were $277 million in the quarter, which was down 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, excluding the extra week in the prior year quarter. Gross margins were 62% for the quarter versus 52% in the prior year quarter. Current quarter margins were positively impacted by reduced jackpot expense associated with interest rate changes and lower depreciation on the installed base. The prior year quarter margins were impacted by $14.1 million unfavorable adjustment to jackpot expense related to interest rate reductions, as well as $3.5 million in fixed asset charges that occurred in that prior quarter.The fluctuation in these rates leads to a quarterly re-evaluation of the balance sheet liability and impacts margins. Excluding these items, gross margins in the prior year quarter would have been 57%. We earn an average of $49 a day in revenue per unit, which is slightly below the revenue per unit over the last four sequential quarters and down from $53 in last year's first quarter. Fiscal ended yield of $49 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse installed base comprised of our MegaJackpots, Central Determination products, Class II and lease ops units, all of which serve distinct markets and have unique yield characteristics. Lower year-over-year blended yield saw the combined result of the decline in play levels and the continued shift in the installed base mix to include more lower yield in leased machines. IGT's installed base ended the first quarter at 62,200 units, up 1,300 units over the prior year and up 800 sequentially. Our installed base in both the domestic and international markets showed modest growth during the quarter. Approximately 85% of our installed base is comprised of variable key games that earn a percentage of machine play levels rather not a fixed daily fee.Moving on to product sales. Product sales revenues totaled $238 million for the quarter, compared to $288 million in the prior year. Worldwide, we shipped 11,200 machines during the quarter, down from prior year shipments of 14,000. Non-machine revenues comprised of gaming systems, game theme conversion, tables, cards and intellectual property fees came in at $77 million for the quarter or 32% of total product sales for the quarter, compared to $97 million and 34% of total product sales in the prior year quarter. Product sales gross margins were 52% for the quarter, up 200 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to reduced material costs and less obsolescence, as well as an increased mix of higher margin products. For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release. Breaking product sales down, domestic versus international. First with domestic, domestic revenues totaled $135 million on volume of 5,500 units recognized for the current quarter, compared to $215 million and 9,500 units recognized in the prior year quarter. Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 3,000, up 200 units from the prior year and down 800 sequentially. Patti will give you a little additional color on some of the factors that affect the first quarter seasonality. While we continue to have limited visibility around replacement demand, we believe future demand will exceed trough levels experienced in the early part of 2009. Domestic, new and expansion shipments totaled 2,300 units in the quarter, flat sequentially and down 2,700 units in the prior year quarter due to the fact that we have fewer new openings occurring in this past fiscal quarter. As we continue to pursue our sales strategy, we will continue to experience deferred revenues from multi-element contracts including system software machines bundled together. Units shipped for the current periods reflect all units shipped to customers which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent units recognized in revenues under generally accepted accounting principles during the quarter.Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $52 million on the quarter, down from $78 million on the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower systems revenues and slightly less parts and conversions. Domestic deferred non-machine revenue decreased approximately $3 million during the quarter to a total of $78 million as of December 31, 2009. The majority of this decrease relates to the completion of obligations under multi-element contracts. The domestic average revenue per unit computed on an equivalent units recognized basis was 24,600 for the first quarter, compared to 22,600 in the prior year due to the increased mix of MLD products. We shipped about 1,700 MLD's during the quarter or roughly 32% of total North American shipments in the first quarter, compared to 900 units or 12% of total North American shipments in the prior year quarter.Sales of machines utilized in our AVP technology comprised 92% of total North American machine shipped during the first quarter. The trend we expect to continue is our legacy for sale products were phased out. International product sales revenue totaled $103 million on volumes of 6,400 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $73 million and 6,000 units recognized in the prior year quarter. Our international markets benefited from recognized revenues associated with the Casino Rosario in Latin America and the increased sales in Europe. International non-machine sales were $26 million, up from $20 million in the prior year quarter. The quarter was driven by increases in systems revenue. International deferred revenue decreased $12 million during the quarter to a balance of $29 million at December 31, 2009.International average revenue per unit computed on an equivalent unit recognized basis in the first quarter was 16,100, up 32% over the prior year quarter due to a favorable product mix, but a smaller proportion of lower margin units. Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 52%, up 200 basis points on the prior year quarter. The quarter was impacted due to reduced material costs and less obsolescence, as well as an increase mix in higher margin products. Going forward, we expect product sales gross margins to remain in the low 50% range, also [ph] by our cost savings initiatives and impact of product sales mix.Operating expenses and other. First quarter operating expenses totaled $156 million compared to $206 million on the prior year period. Excluding restructuring costs and the extra week in the prior year, operating expenses decreased 11%, primarily due to our cost reduction efforts, reduced bad debt provisions and lower legal and compliance fees. We continue to move towards our goal of the previously announced $200 million of cost cuts when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel that we are on track to achieve our cost reduction goals as we move throughout fiscal 2010.SG&A, excluding bad debt restructuring charges and the extra week in the prior year. SG&A declined $9 million or 9% to $87 million in the quarter as a result of our cost reduction efforts and lower legal and compliance fees. We expect the quarterly SG&A run rate in the range of $95 million to $100 million. Bad debt provisions for the quarter totaled $3 million, compared to $11 million on the last year's quarter. The bad debt decreased in the quarter primarily stems from fewer specific reserves related to customers, which were affected by the economic downturn. R&D expense totaled $47 million for the quarter, a decline of $7 million or 13% in the prior year quarter. We expect a quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area. Depreciation and amortization within operating expenses totaled $20 million for the quarter, which is roughly flat with the prior year. Total depreciation and amortization, inclusive of depreciation on game ops, that is recognized in our game ops expense line was $63 million for the quarter, down from $79 million in the prior year quarter. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic MegaJackpots and Mexico lease operations. Please note that some of this will come back as we refresh our installed base of assets over time. Other income and expense net in the first quarter was a net expense of $28 million, compared to $27 million on the prior year quarter. The change is mostly due to increased borrowing costs on our recent refinancing, nearly offset by reduced investment breakdowns and less foreign exchange loss. Beginning in this quarter, no accounting guidance required us to bifurcate our convertible debt instrument into their debt and equity components. Interest on the debt component will be calculated using a borrowing rate for similar non-convertible bonds, resulting in higher recorded interest and actual coupon rate. This resulted in an increase in interest expense of $9 million on the current quarter and $5 million in the prior year quarter due to additional convertible debt amortization. In addition, we expect the difference between these two amounts to be non-cash interest of approximately $30 million, or $0.07 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and approximately $30 million or $0.07 per diluted share for 2009 as restated.The tax. Our tax rate was 35% in the first quarter versus 16% in the prior year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter benefited from $2.9 million of favorable discrete items, primarily related to the stock exchange that we did earlier this quarter or earlier in Q1 and totaled approximately $0.01 of EPS. The current quarter tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 37%. Going forward, we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discrete items. Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $277 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009.  Contractual debt obligations totaled $2.1 billion, with $1.1 billion of availability under our $1.8 billion line of credit at December 31, 2009. It's important to note that the adoption of the new accounting rules for convertible debt, which I mentioned earlier, decreased our book debt by approximately $145 million at December 31, 2009, and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is the unamortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity. For purposes of bank covenants, we will continue to use contractual debt obligations, which totaled $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2009, a decrease of $63 million compared to September 30, 2009. On December 15, 2009, holders of IGT's 2.6% convertible note exercise their put right which resulted in us repurchasing 701.2 million of face value of bonds at par and 5.8 million par value of the bonds remained outstanding and have been called for redemption on February 4, 2010. Our 3.25% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the period ended December 31, 2009, because the conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price per common stock. The weighted average stock price during the first quarter was $19.71. On the balance sheet, we've made a lot of progress to the working capital ratios and conversion of working capital and free cash flow. Working capital totaled $643 million at December 31, compared to $609 million as of September 30, 2009. Average days sales outstanding excluding receivables from our notes of contracts was 54 days, down from 58 days as of September 30, 2009. Inventory turns averaged 2.9x down from 3x at September 30, 2009. For the quarter, we've generated $169 million in cash from operations, compared to $150 million in the prior year period. During the quarter, we saw improved working capital efficiencies, such as reduced accounts receivable of the lowest that's been in 32 quarters. Reduced inventory balance the lowest that's been in eight quarters and strong free cash flow, the highest that's been in nine quarters. Capital expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, compared to $76 million on the prior year period due to lower investments and PP&E. CapEx is expected to trend in the range of $50 million to $75 million, although we do continue to come in nearer the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx as part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts.That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's first quarter. Thanks for your time and attention. I'll now turn the call over to Patti for her comments."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal first quarter. Achieving these result in what continues to be a relatively challenging market is a testament to the measured progress we are making at IGT. While there is still much work for us to do, I am proud of our accomplishments this quarter, a quarter in which we rolled out new market leading products in G2E, installed the very first large-scale deployment of server-based gaming and achieved the highest operating margin we have experienced in some time. On the heels of the successful launch of G2E, our Sex and the City units are outperforming our expectations, with the highest performing unit averaging up to $900 in win per unit per day and an average daily yield to IGT of up to $180. Our go-to-market strategy for these unit, which focuses on selective placement is designed to make this product as productive as possible for our operator customers.In product sales, the first quarter has historically been our lowest due to the holidays and the tendencies for customers to carefully consider their options after G2E and ahead of the release of their annual budget. Despite this, we shipped 200 more replacement units this quarter than we did in the first quarter of 2009. However, we do remain cautiously optimistic about operator demand. We would like to congratulate the folks at MGM Mirage and the opening of CityCenter. We are extremely pleased with the performance of our server-based system, both during and after the opening of ARIA. The system performed flawlessly through the peak on opening night and through the holidays including new years.  Finally, our first quarter operating margin of 27% is the highest since the third quarter of 2008, while our balance sheet metrics continued to improve with working capital declining by $102 million from the prior year quarter and our bank leverage ratio declining by 2/10 of a turn sequentially. We remain focused on the efficiency of capital in all aspects of our business. Looking forward, we continue to make progress on numerous fronts, which will positively impact our business in the future. We continue to add talent to our management ranks. In the first quarter, Harold Dykes [ph] joined us from AT&T Wireless as our new Vice President of Core Products. With a background in both content and product development, Harold brings a fresh perspective to our game development process. We also recently announced the addition of Susan Macke as our Chief Marketing Officer. Susan joined us for Hewlett Packard and brings a wealth of experience in brand development and marketing communication.  Both of these recent additions highlight our continued focus on enhancing our customer phasing activities at the product level and at the corporate level. We are genuinely pleased to have both Harold and Susan with us. As many of you saw yesterday, we announced that Gideon Bierer will join IGT as our Executive President of New Media. As a market leader, we are intent on helping to shape the changes that the Internet, mobile and social networking technologies bring to our business and to that of our customers. Gideon brings with him a wealth of experience repurposing content for multiple platforms, a process that will be critical to our future growth. In the new year, we announced the election of Paget Alves, a seasoned technology executive to our Board of Directors. We also continue to work through our process improvement activities. Through our Ease of Doing Business program, we are focused on reducing the order to revenue cycle, and our product development program is focused on bringing more innovative products to market it faster and at a lower cost. Both of these projects will make IGT a better business partner for our operator customers.Again, this was a quarter of measured progress for us and we continue to work relentlessly to improve IGT for our customers, our employees and importantly, for you, our shareholders. We remain cautiously optimistic regarding operator budgets and spending. With the seasonally slow first quarter behind us, we are looking forward to an increasingly clearer view of the industry prospects for 2010. As previously mentioned, there have been significant changes to our capital structure and certain changes in accounting principles, which impact our current quarter results relative to our prior period. As a result of all of these factors, our guidance for 2010 remains a range of $0.77 to $0.87 per diluted share. As always, our guidance exclude the one-time items like the first quarter tax benefit of $0.01, which resulted primarily from our recent stock option exchange program. Our guidance also assumes no dilution impact from our convertible notes. We will now open the call for questions."

So just to refresh everyone's memory, our DynamiX promotional offer that we introduced, the G2E, had basically two different options. But fundamentally, the philosophy is focused on acquiring one new product and receiving backwards and looking conversions on the 8960 [ph], the older platform. The response from the market has been very positive. We don't typically disclose obviously, order numbers at that level. I would say that it is resulting in more focus. And as you see in our average revenue per unit numbers, more of a focus on the MLD product. And so we expect both MLDs and AVP products to participate in the replacement cycle at a higher rate than we had expected. So we think the benefit of it is pulling through the higher average revenue per unit is what we'll see going forward. But great response from the marketplace, processing both on the conversion side and on the new product side."

I mean, I understand you guys want to be conservative and beat the number, but gosh, there must be something that we're missing because it sounds like things are going much better and this quarter was a good example of you controlling the things you can control and keeping things tight in front of what looks to be like a pretty good year on the revenue side as we move forward."

So first of all, thank you for recognizing the good work we're doing because we are really very diligently working through the expense side and getting our products lined up for the replacement cycle. So I would say a couple of things, I think we look at this more as a $0.22, $0.23 quarter with an adjustment for some of the one-time events. When you look at the risk-adjusted work that we're doing in the business, we feel very good that the replacement cycle will make its way back from the trough loads. It is timing that is less obvious to us. So we are managing ourselves, we're managing our company, we're managing all of you to be a bit agnostic to when the market comes back and lining our products up, so that when the market does come back, we participate from a market share perspective as we would hope to beyond what our expectations are. We're risk adjusting, obviously, the business for the replacement cycle. We have a bit of risk adjustment for the worst case scenario in Alabama. We're working through that. We're working through some firmware changes in Alabama, but there -- we think on the downside of our guidance or worst case scenario there but some risk. So we think we're being very prudent in the way we're approaching the business and communicating to you in a way where we would have closed this guidance up from a range that we would've felt that we had visibility that would have allowed us to do that."

Welcome to IGT’s Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me today are Patti Hart, our President and CEO and Eric Tom, our Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.Before we begin, we wou",2786,"Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IGT’s Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me today are Patti Hart, our President and CEO and Eric Tom, our Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.
Before we begin, we would like to remind listeners that our discussion reflects management’s views based on the marketplace environment, as of today, April 22, 2010 and will include forward-looking statements, including forecasts of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products, levels for install base of recurring revenue gains as well as future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
Our future financial condition and results of operation as well as our forward-looking statements are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances and you should not assume later in the quarter or the year that the comments we made today are still valid.
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our Web site at igt.com you will additional disclosures regarding any non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of the measures with comparable GAAP measures.
With that I will turn to the discussion of the business. This afternoon IGT reported its second quarter results for fiscal 2010. Net income totaled $36 million or $0.12 per diluted share. This compares to $34 million and $0.11 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. The current quarter including restructuring and inventory obsolescence charges of 18 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share. These were all primarily related to the decision to close our Japan operations as well as an impairment for intellectual property of 7 million with no tax benefits or $0.02 per diluted share, primarily due to uncertainties about how certain patterns sit in with our strategic direction.
The prior year quarter included restructuring charges of 8 million, 5 million after tax or $0.02 per diluted share. So excluding these charges mentioned above, second quarter adjusted net income was 61 million or $0.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and 39 million or $0.13 per diluted share in fiscal 2009.
Additionally, the second quarter comparability was affected by a number of notable items, the details of which are broken out in our earnings press release, which went out this afternoon. The prior year quarter includes certain restated amounts due to the required retrospect of application of new accounting standards associated with our convertible debt.
On a consolidated basis our revenues for the second quarter were $498 million of which 57% was generated from gaming operations and the other 43% from product sales compared to $476 million for the same quarter last year.
For the six months ended March 31, 2010, consolidated revenues were 1 billion compared to 1.1 billion in the same period last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter was $276 million and $95 million respectively and $573 million and $235 million respectively for the six months ended March 31.
During the first fiscal quarter of 2010, we adopted new accounting standards to acquire retrospective application to prior periods associated with our convertible debt and with equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the end of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in reduced diluted EPS of $0.01 for the current quarter and $0.02 for the prior year quarter.
Moving on to gaming operations, game op revenues were 285 million in the current quarter which was up 3% sequentially but down 3% year-over-year. Approximately 5 million of the decrease in the revenues in the current quarter was attributed to property closures of electronic charitable bingo terminal being operated in Alabama compared to the same period last year.
Gross margins were 62% for the quarter versus 59% in the prior year quarter. Current quarter margins were positively impacted primarily by lower depreciation. We earned an average of $51 and $0.70 a share in revenue per unit per day which is up 5% sequentially and down from $52.96 in the last year’s second quarter.
This blended yield of $51.70 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse install base, comprised of our mega jackpots, our central determination, Class II and lease ops units, all of which serve distinct markets and have unique yield characteristics.
Lower year-over-year blended yield is a result of the continued shift towards lower yielding machines. IGT’s install base ended the second quarter at 58,800 units, down 2,500 units over the prior year and down 3,400 compared to the prior sequential quarter. The decline in our installed base is primarily due to the reduction of electronic charitable bingo terminals being operated in Alabama. Approximately 83% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games which earn a percentage of the machines play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
Moving to product sales, product sales revenues totaled $213 million for the quarter compared to $181 million in the prior year. Worldwide, we shipped 11,800 machines during the quarter, down from prior year shipments of 12,700. Non-machine revenues comprised of gaming systems, game theme conversions, tables, cards and intellectually property fees came in at $72 million for the quarter or 34% of total product sales for the quarter compared to $70 million and 38% of total product sales in the prior year quarter.
Product sales gross margins were 46% for the quarter, down 200 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher obsolescence incurred in the current year quarter, including write-downs related to the closure of our Japanese operations. For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release.
Units shipped for the current period reflect all units shipped to customers which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent units recognized in revenues under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles during the quarter.
Taking breaking up product sales down domestic versus international first domestic product sales revenue totaled $124 million on volume of 5,200 units recognized for the current quarter compared to 120 million and 5,400 units recognized in the prior year quarter. Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 4,100 for the quarter, which is up 2,300 units from the prior year and up 1,100 units sequentially.
While we continue to have limited visibility around replacement demand, we are encouraged by the recent uptick in demand as well as quality and innovation of our product sales segment. Domestic new and expansion shipments totaled 1,800 units in the quarter, down 1,500 sequentially and down 2,900 units from the prior year quarter due to the fact that there are just fewer new openings occurring this fiscal year.
The prospective adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi element arrangements, as of the beginning of the fiscal 2010 resulted in 13 million of revenues in the current quarter which would have been recognized in later periods under the prior guidance.
Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $50 million in the quarter, down from $52 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower systems revenues. Domestic average selling price was 14,300 in the second quarter compared to 13,700 in the prior year quarter. And domestic average revenue per unit computed on an equivalent unit basis was 23,800 for the second quarter compared to 23,500 in the prior year. Both the ASP and ARPU increases were due to the increase mix of MLDs shipped and sold during the quarter.
We shipped 2,500 MLD units or 51% of total North American shipments in the second quarter compared to 500 units or 8% of total North American shipments in the prior year quarter. Sales of machines utilizing or AVP technology now comprise 95% of total North American machines shipped during the second quarter, a trend we expect to continue as our legacy for sale products continue to be phased out.
International product sales revenue totaled $89 million on volume of 7,400 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $54 million and 7,100 units recognized in the prior year quarter. Our international markets benefited from the opening of Resorts World Santosa in Singapore, improved sales in Europe and favorable foreign currency exchange.
International non-machine sales were $23 million, up from $18 million in the prior year quarter. The quarter was driven primarily by increases in systems revenue.
International ASPs were 9,000 for the second quarter compared to 5200 in the prior year quarter and international ARPU computed on an equivalent units recognized basis in the second quarter was 12,100, up 59% over the prior year quarter. Both the ASP and the ARPU increases were due to a more favorable geographic product mix, i.e., more heavily weighted with Casinos sell products.
Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 46%, down 200 basis points from the prior year quarter. As the quarter was impacted by higher obsolescence, going forward, we expect product sales gross margins to trend within a range of approximately 48% to 50% depending on product sales mix.
Moving on to operating expenses, second quarter operating expenses totaled $181 million compared to $190 million in the prior year. Current quarter restructuring and other charges of 23 million were comprised of 16 million of severance costs and other asset write-offs, primarily related to the closure of our Japan operations and 7 million of intellectual property impairment, recorded primarily due to uncertainties around how certain bad pattern sits with our product strategy going forward.
Excluding restructuring and other, second quarter operating expenses and operating income margin would have been 158 million and 24% respectively, compared to 182 million and 17% respectively in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower bad debt provisions and lower expenses largely related to cost control efforts.
Update on our cost reduction efforts, we continue to move towards our goal of the previously announced $200 million of cost savings when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel we are on track to achieve our cost reduction goals, as we move throughout 2010 and exit the year.
SG&A excluding bad debt declined 12 million or 12% to 84 million for the quarter as a result of our continued cost control efforts, including lower legal and compliance fees. We expect quarterly SG&A run rate of $90 million to $95 million.
Bad debt provisions totaled $2 million for the quarter compared to $13 million in last year’s quarter. The bad debt decrease for the quarter primarily stems from fewer specific reserves related to customers which were affected by the economic environment.
R&D expense totaled $53 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. We expect a quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area.
Depreciation and amortization within operating expenses totaled $19 million for the quarter which was flat with the prior year. Total depreciation and amortization inclusive of that included in game ops was $58 million for the quarter, down from $69 million in the prior year quarter. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic mega jackpots business and our Mexico lease operations. Please note that some of this will come back as we refresh our install base with assets.
Other income and expense net in the second quarter was a net expense of $22 million compared to $19 million in the prior year quarter. The change is mostly due to increased borrowing costs, partially offset by less foreign exchange loss. Additional convertible debt amortization required under our accounting guidance adopted retrospectively at the beginning of the fiscal year increased interest expense by 7 million in the quarter and 4 million in the prior year period.
In addition, we expect non-cash interest of approximately $30 million. $19 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and approximately $22 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 as restated, including repurchased gains of 5 million.
Moving on to the tax rate. Our tax rate came in at 50% in the second quarter versus 34% in the prior year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter was impacted due to significant one-time items, i.e., largely the intellectual property impairment and the impairment charges taken in Japan. The current quarter tax rate excluding these one-time items was approximately 38%.
Going forward we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discrete items. However, we may experience volatility in our quarterly tax rate due to the impact of 1048 and quarterly discrete items including the expected closure of various audit cycles.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash and equivalents and short term investments inclusive of restricted amounts totaled $259 million at March 31, 2010 compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009. Contractual debt obligations totaled $2 billion with $1.2 billion of available under our line of credit.
It is important to note that the adoption of the new accounting rules for convertible debt, which I mentioned earlier, decreased our book debt by approximately $138 million at March 31, 2010 and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is the unamortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity.
For purposes of bank covenants we will continue to use contractual debt obligations which totaled $2 billion as of March 31, a decrease of $142 million compared to September 30, 2009. Our 3.25% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from the diluted shares outstanding for the period ended March 31, because the conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price for our common stock.
On the balance sheet we made a lot of progress with our working capital ratios and conversion of working capital of free cash flow. Working capital totaled $647 million at March 31 compared to $609 million at September 30.
Average day sales outstanding excluding receivables from our notes and contracts was 54 days down from 58 days as of September 30. Inventory turns averaged 3.7 times, up from three times at September 30.
For the six months ended March 31, IGT generated $277 million in cash flow from operations compared to $206 million for the first six months of last year. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in working capital efficiencies such as reduced inventory balance, the lowest it’s been in 40 quarters. For the six months ended March 31, 2010, IGT recorded 124 million in free cash flow compared to negative 14 million for the first six months of last year. All of the free cash flow generated in 2010 has been used to pay down debt.
Capital expenditures totaled $64 million for the quarter compared to $53 million in the prior sequential quarter due to higher investments in game ops assets. CapEx is expected to trend in a quarterly range of $65 to $75 million although we continue to come in near the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx as part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts.
We understand that the bill which would have allowed the Alabama voters to decide on a constitutional amendment authorizing Bingo, including electronic charitable Bingo at the state level, did not pass the Alabama House. Notwithstanding this unfortunate legislative outcome we believe the electronic charitable Bingo terminal at our customers Victoryland, Country Crossing and Greentrack are legal.
Despite our belief there does exist some risk that the properties will be able to continue operating or will we open in the case of Country Crossing. We continue to monitor the Alabama charitable market, in the near future, electronic charitable Bingo in the state may be impacted by the outcome of several cases pending before the Alabama Supreme Court or from other developments. As of March 31, 2010 we had approximately 85.5 million on development financing notes, 9.2 million on fixed assets, and 7.2 million on accounts receivable associated with our customers now in Alabama.
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT’s second quarter. And I’ll now turn the call over to Patti.

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal second quarter. As many of you know we have been tempering expectations on the state of the market over the past several quarters as we await a sustained and meaningful increase in customer spending levels. Similar to most of you we remain cautiously optimistic about the macro environment. We are more enthusiastic about several bright spots in certain areas of our business.
In gaming operations, overall yields were $51.70 for the quarter, an improvement of 5% sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in play level. Our mega jackpots yield improved 11% sequentially, with Sex and the City continuing to perform earning up to $1,260 per day for our customers.
In addition, we have now deployed 149 units of Amazing Race and 93 units of Top Dollar, our latest generation of titles in our gaming operations business.
4,100 shipped units are North American replacement sales improved 37% from the prior sequential quarter, a sign of market improvement and a testament to the quality of our latest for sale titles.
We also made progress on several strategic marketing initiatives during the quarter to better respond to the needs of our customers while reinforcing our historical strength, including, a continuation of our program to refresh our market leading Wheel of Fortune brand. The announcement of a backward integration solution for our Service Window functionality and the continued production of certain titles for convergence on our 80960 platform.
Joining us today is Eric Tom, our Executive Vice President of North American Sales and Marketing who would tell you a bit more about these programs and give you a broader overview of our customer facing activities.

We believe this activity showcases our innovative talents and maximizes the value proposition to our customers. As Patti mentioned we are highly focused on leveraging our historical strength.
We continue to refresh our signature brand Wheel of Fortune. The first title for our new center stage game series is Wheel of Fortune Experience, available with both three and five real games. Additionally, we recently unveiled Wheel of Fortune multiplay, which allows players to play up to four concurrent base games.
And finally, Wheel of Fortune Secret Spins a game in which the wheel rotates to reveal an extra multiplier will be introduced to market later this year. Additionally, we continue to focus certain aspects of our product strategy on initiative, designed to maximize our share of those lean customer budgets.
Here are three examples. First, our previously announced Service Window solution to a legacy 80960 video machine furthers the company’s commitment to providing our customers with cost effective and flexible solutions for our network floor. This backward integration solution which is scheduled to be deployed in fall 2010 allows our customers to satisfy demand for service window capabilities in our existing 80960 footprint.
Second, so far this year, we released 21 new conversion games, where our legacy 80960 Spring Wheel and video platforms. These games enable our customers to freshen their floors with limited expenditure while reinforcing our existing position in their casino.
And third, we continue to experience success with our dynamic package, which bundles one new AVP slot machine with two 80960 conversion kits, allowing a customer to refresh three machines concurrently. As of March 31, we sold 4,017 units under these customer friendly programs.
I would also like to highlight other important initiatives that we are executing. Patti mentioned our success with Sex and the City, Amazing Race and Top Dollar. And we are excited about the continued improvement in our game operations product portfolio. As of March 31, our backlog for these three themes plus the recently released Wheel of Fortune experience stood at 2,153 units.
In the first two quarters of 2010, for our four sale business, we have released 80 game titles compared to 30 titles during the same period in 2009. These included an even mix of spinning wheel and video slot games. Some of the exciting titles include Pirate Bay, Kodiak King and Majestic Sea. We anticipate another 50 to 70 titles to be released through the remainder of this fiscal year. And as of April 19, we have 3,200 games in the backlog.
We are now over 13,000 AVP units with MLD in the marketplace offering 3D games and enabling spin wheel, video slot and poker slot, all in one machine.
Now, turning to systems, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of our server-based gaming system (inaudible). We believe we have met our customers’ high expectations with the first system of its content.
During the second quarter we announced several key tier one successes including Casino D in Italy, Grand Casino in Helsinki, New Orleans, Colusa and Mohawk. In North America as of March 31, we are in varying contract stages with two other FDX opportunities and seven other tier one opportunities.
Please understand there is no guarantee that we will close all these opportunities. In our traditional systems business we continue to face a challenging new build environment, with few additional casino properties scheduled to open in the near-term. That being said this quarter we have closed three new advantage customers as of March 31, and as of the date we are in varying contract stages with five new advantage customers. Again, no guarantee that we will close all these opportunities.
We are also aggressively focused on marketing FDX to our existing advantage customers who are a deal candidate, delivers the power of this new platform.
More broadly, we continue to receive positive feedback from our customers for our restructured North American sales organization, implemented in September of 2009. This change included the addition of strategic account managers, trained sales personnel who manage our largest customers and are focused on corporate relationships, system and marketing opportunities.
Additionally, we now have each account manager responsible for the entire IGT portfolio. The breadth of which we consider to be a competitive advantage. We also organize our systems, professional services and poker experts to more effectively assist our frontline account managers.
So as we move forward in our sales and marketing strategies we will continue to focus on content quality, product innovation and a customer first approach the market.
With that I will turn it back over to Patti to speak about our broader corporate initiatives and our outlook for the remainder of 2010.
Patti
Thank you, Eric. Last quarter we discussed our measured success. And in the light of a continued challenging environment this quarter I will focus on activities pertinent to those items that are under our control. Our balance sheet metrics continue to improve with working capital reduced by $88 million from the prior year quarter and total contractual debt obligation declining by $80 million sequentially.
We remain extremely focused on free cash flow generation. We continue to actively manage costs in the midst of the challenging environment as evidenced by decline in operating expense of 13% excluding restructuring and other charges and a decline in SG&A of 12% excluding bad debt over the prior year quarter. Additionally, we continue to make forward-looking and occasionally difficult capital allocation decision.
We continue to prepare our products and financing strategies for the impending 35,000 to 40,000 units Illinois expansion. We anticipate that the central system provider will be announced shortly with the associated rules and regulations issue thereafter. And we anticipate units to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2011.
We recently announced our decision to exit from the Japanese (inaudible) market. And while we are never happy to part with employees’ difficult market require difficult decision. Looking forward, Gideon Bierer, our Executive Vice President of New Media continues to establish his organization. And organization that will focus on the emerging opportunities in our industry, while Chris Satchell, our Chief Technology Officer continues to focus on platform improvement, a critical aspect of our future game development efforts. Both Gideon and Chris are implementing initiatives that will have long term impact on our business.
Again, we continue to work tirelessly to improve IGT for our customers, our employees and most importantly, review our shareholders. As I mentioned we remain cautiously optimistic regarding operator budgets and spending. With the seasonally slow first half of the year behind us we are looking forward to an increasingly clear view of the industry prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. As I previously noting, there have been significant changes to our capital structure and certain changes in accounting principles which impact our current quarter results relative to our prior period.
We have adjusted our guidance to reflect the risk of the potential loss in revenues associated with units in Alabama. As a result of all these factors our guidance for 2010 has changed to a range of $0.77 to $0.85 per diluted share. As always, our guidance excludes a one-time item. Our guidance also assumes no dilution effect from our convertible note.
And with that we will open the call for questions.

Robin’s question was if we had any color on what our market share was. At this point we really follow the same problems as you all do and until at least couple of them the primary competitors reported really hard. From our internal estimates it looks like it’s probably in the 35% to 40% share basis on replacements given that’s largely the bulk of the shipments in this past quarter.

They want to refresh their floors, we’ve missed the whole cycle, they see that their floors need that reinvestment, but the capital budgets being controlled so tightly they just don’t have the opportunity. With that we’ve really focused on how we can facilitate the refreshing their floors and minimize the capital budgets.
So one of the reasons why the dynamics package meet sense to us and actually turned out to be very successful is that it combines the refreshing of two older beings which are susceptible to replacement because they are older, they are older being, at the same time you never change the minimal capital budget, they do have to buy in the next generation platform. It’s kind of a win-win, you invest in the future but you solidify the past. It made a lot of sense because these 80960 game themes that we put out the convergence themes don’t cost very much. It’s $500 a piece so $1,000 total. The other area that we’re focused on because the capital budgets are so limited is placing our MegaJackpots themes on the floor, because it’s capital less to the customers, it refreshes the floor, that’s need refreshing and is a lot of energy behind a new labels, so everybody seems to be excited about that, we’re having a good run at it because of that.

I think a bundling again the bundling and packaging is focused on splitting the activity between converting the old install base and selling new machines. And as we move out of this level of replacement cycle into the next level of replacement cycle where customers becoming less focused on refreshing the old machines and they become more focused on replacing them, then the dynamics products kind of disappears for us. So if you look at the ASP on a standalone product less discount looking back on the conversion, you ‘d still find the same levels of ASP that we’ve been enjoying but you’re getting the discounts of a convergent package. So they move away from combining convergent with new purchases you will find the ASPs will reflect that.

Chris Satchel brings a very long history in gaming from Microsoft to the company. So when you look at the senior management team it’s kind of split half and half, we have folks who have been in the industry a very long time and we have new thinkers in the business, but I think with the right balance where the areas where gaming experience is very important from a product development perspective, from a technology investment perspective, from an intellectual property creation perspective, we have aired towards the side of protecting that gaming legacy and in areas of legal and compliance and sales and new media obviously we’ve been less so.
So culturally going well so far, I think again, we’re really relying on both sides to do what they need them to do. The new eyes to really push and challenge why are we doing things this way and the legacy executives including all the legacy in place of IGT should really challenge and help understand why we do things certainly. I think what we’re finding as we’re working through that is we’re moving our decisions to the middle to balance of input from both sides of that equation.
So I would say at this point it’s going well, we’re starting to do some things differently and we’ve invested in marketing, really the third time in this company’s history, really Eric has created a marketing organization and thinks about the four Ps of marketing, in product and placement, promotion and price and bundling and packaging and our brand in ways that we haven’t been thinking about it, we think about routes to market differently than we thought about that before.
And I would say that some of our competitors have done a better job than we have over a lot several years, new thinking and challenges to status quo and we’re at a point and not only our company, but in this industry where we’re destined to do more of that. So I would say at this point I would give a high marks and we’ll see who wears down whom first.

And when you think about the game ops business, that’s really about return on capital. We have those folks focused on the performance of their games against the capital that IGT strand in the marketplace. So we don’t think about it is much, its quantity, frankly, as we think about each all that role that each studio plays in the market
Now, I would say always in every quarter you are going to have studios that play stronger than others and we have that at this particular time. That’s based on the needs of the business, less than the talent of the workforce. So when the needs of the business shift you do have to ride and push studios differently. And so we’re doing that. I would say it will never be equal because studios are studios and they are creative people so will never be equal but I think we had each studio playing the role that the company has defined for them to play. Eric, do you have anything to add to that?

With me today are Patti Hart, our President and CEO; and Eric Tom, our Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. 
Before we begin, we would like to remind listeners that our discussion reflects management's views based on the marketplace environment as of today, April 22, 2010, and will include forward-looking statements including: Forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable; the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products; play levels for an installed base of recurring revenue games as well as future prospects; and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as our forward-looking statements, are subject to change into inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. And you should not assume later in the quarter or the years that the comments we make today are still valid. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, and included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and in our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website at igt.com. You will find additional disclosures regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of the measures with comparable GAAP measures. With that, I'll turn to the discussion of the business. 
This afternoon, IGT reported a second quarter results for fiscal 2010. Net income totaled $36 million or $0.12 per diluted share. This compares to $34 million and $0.11 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter included restructuring and inventory obsolescence charges of $18 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share. These are all primarily related to the decision to close our Japan operations as well as an impairment for intellectual property of $7 million with no tax benefits or $0.02 per diluted share, primarily due to uncertainties about how certain patents stayed in within our strategic direction.
The prior-year quarter included restructuring charges of $8 million, $5 million after-tax or $0.02 per diluted share. So excluding these charges mentioned above, second quarter adjusted net income was $61 million or $0.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2010, and $39 million or $0.13 per diluted share in fiscal 2009. Additionally, the second quarter comparability was affected by a number of notable items, the detail of which are broken out in our earnings press release, which went out earlier this afternoon.
The prior-year quarter includes certain restated amounts due to the required retrospective application of new accounting standards associated with our convertible debt. On a consolidated basis, our revenues for the second quarter were $498 million, of which 57% was generated from gaming operations and the other 43% from product sales, compared to $476 million for the same quarter last year.
For the six months ended March 31, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the same period last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter was $276 million and $95 million respectively, and $573 million and $235 million respectively for the six months ended March 31.
During the first fiscal quarter of 2010, we adopted new accounting standards to require a retrospective application to prior periods associated with our convertible debt and with equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the end of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in reduced diluted EPS of $0.01 for the current quarter and $0.02 for the prior-year quarter.
Moving on to Gaming Operations. Game Op revenues were $285 million in the current quarter, which was up 3% sequentially but down 3% year-over-year. Approximately $5 million of the decrease in the revenues in the current quarter was attributed to property closures and the reduction of electronic charitable bingo terminals being operated in Alabama, compared to the same period last year. Gross margins were 62% for the quarter versus 59% in the prior-year quarter. Current quarter margins were positively impacted primarily by lower depreciation. We earned an average of $51.70 a share in revenue per unit per day, which is up 5% sequentially and down from $52.96 in the last year's second quarter.
Fiscal ended yield of 51 70 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse installed base, comprised of our MegaJackpots, our Central Determination, Class II and lease ops units, all of which served distinct markets and have the unique yield characteristics. Lower year-over-year blended yield is the result of the continued shift towards lower yield in machines. 
IGT's installed base ended the second quarter at 58,800 units, down 2,500 units over the prior year and down 3,400 units compared to prior sequential quarter.  The decline in our installed base is primarily due to the reduction of electronic charitable bingo terminals being operated in Alabama. Approximately, 83% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games, which earn a percentage of the machine's play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
Moving to product sales. Product sales revenue totaled $213 million for the quarter, compared to $181 million in the prior year. Worldwide, we shipped 11,800 machines during the quarter, down from prior-year shipments of 12,700. Our machine revenues is comprised of gaming systems, game theme conversions, tables, parts and intellectual property fees came in at $72 million for the quarter or 34% of total product sales for the quarter, compared to $70 million and 38% of total product sales in the prior-year quarter.
Product sales gross margins were 46% for the quarter, down 200 basis points from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher obsolescence incurred in the current year quarter including write-downs related to the closure of our Japanese operations.
For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release. Units shipped for the current period reflect all units shipped to customers, which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent units recognized in revenues under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles during the quarter.
Taking a break in our product sales down, the domestic versus international. First, domestic product sales revenue totaled $124 million, a volume of 5,200 units recognized for the current quarter, compared to $127 million and 5,400 units recognized during the prior-year quarter. Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 4,100 for quarter, which is up 2,300 units from the prior year, and up 1,100 units sequentially. While we continue to have limited visibility around replacement demand, we are encouraged by the recent uptick in demand as well as the quality and innovation of our Product Sales segment.
Domestic new and expansion shipments totaled 800 units in the quarter, down 1,500 sequentially and down 2,900 units from the prior-year quarter due to the fact that there are just fewer new openings occurring this fiscal year. The prospective adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of the fiscal 2010 resulted in $13 million of revenues in the current quarter, which would have been recognized in later periods under the prior guidance.
Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $50 million in the quarter, down from $52 million in the prior quarter primarily due to lower systems revenues. Domestic average selling price was $14,300 for the second quarter, compared to $13,700 in the prior-year quarter. And Domestic average revenue per unit, computed on a equivalent unit basis, was 23,800 for the second quarter compared to 23,500 in the prior year. Both the ASP and the ARPU increases were due to the increase mix of MLDs [Multi-Layer Display] shipped and sold during the quarter.
We shipped 2,500 MLD units or 51% of total North American shipments in the second quarter, compared to 500 units or 8% of total North American shipments in the prior-year quarter. Sales of machines utilizing our AVP [Advanced Video Platform] technology now comprise 95% of total North American machines shipped during the second quarter. The trend we expect to continue as our legacy for-sale products continue to be phased out.
International product sales revenue totaled $89 million on volume of 7,400 units recognized for the current quarter, compared to $54 million on 7,100 units recognized in the prior-year quarter. Our international markets benefited from the opening of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore, improved sales in Europe and favorable foreign currency exchange.
International non-machine sales were $23 million, up from $18 million in the prior quarter. Quarter was driven primarily by increases in systems revenue. International ASPs were 9,000 for the second quarter, compared to 5,200 in the prior-year quarter. And international ARPU, computed on equivalent units recognized basis, in the second quarter was 12,100, up 59% over the prior-year quarter. Both the ASP and the ARPU increases were due to a more favorable geographic product mix, i.e. more heavily weighted with casinos-style products.
Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 46%, down 200 basis points from the prior-year quarter. As the quarter was impacted by higher obsolescence. Going forward, we expect product sales gross margins to trend within a range of approximately 48% to 50% depending on product sales mix.
Moving on to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses totaled $181 million, compared to $190 million in the prior year. Current quarter restructuring and other charges of $23 million were comprised of $60 million of severance cost and other asset write-offs primarily related to the closure of our Japan operations and $7 million of intellectual property impairment recorded primarily due to uncertainties around how certain that patents fit with our product strategy going forward. Excluding restructuring and other, second quarter operating expenses and operating income margin would have been $158 million and 24% respectively, compared to $182 million and 17% respectively in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower bad debt provisions and lower expenses largely related to cost control efforts.
Update on our cost reduction efforts. We continue to move towards our goal of the previously announced $200 million of cost savings when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel that we're on track to achieve our cost reduction goals as we move throughout 2010 and exit the year. SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined $12 million or 12% to $84 million for the quarter as a result of our continued cost control efforts, including lower legal and compliance fees. We expect quarterly SG&A to be in the run rate of $90 million, $95 million. 
Bad debt provisions has totaled $2 million for the quarter compared to $13 million in the last year's quarter. The bad debt decrease for the quarter primarily stems from fewer specific reserves related to customers which were affected by the economic environment. R&D expense totaled $53 million for the quarter flat compared to the prior quarter. We expect the quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area. Depreciation, amortization within operating expenses totaled $19 million for the quarter, which is flat to the prior year. Total depreciation and amortization, inclusive of that included in the game ops, was $58 million for the quarter, down from $69 million in the prior quarter. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic MegaJackpots business and our Mexico lease operations. Please note that some of this will come back as we refresh our installed base of assets. 
Other income and expense net in the second quarter was a net expense of $22 million, compared to $19 million in the prior-year quarter. The change was mostly due to increased borrowing cost, partially offset by less foreign exchange loss. Additional convertible debt amortization acquired under our accounting guidance, adopted retrospectively at the beginning of the fiscal year, increased interest expense by $7 million in the quarter and $4 million in the prior-year period. In addition, we expect non-cash interest of approximately $30 million, $19 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and approximately $35 million, $22 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 as restated, including repurchased gains of $5 million.
Moving on to the tax rate. Our tax rate came in at 50% in the second quarter versus 34% in the prior-year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter was impacted due to significant one-time items, i.e. largely the intellectual property impairment and the impairment charges taken in Japan. The current quarter tax rate, excluding this one-time items was approximately 38%. Going forward, we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discreet items. However, we may experience volatility in our quarterly tax rate due to the impact of 1048 and quarterly discrete items including the expected closure of various audit cycles.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash and equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $259 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009. Contractual debt obligations totaled $2 billion with $1.2 billion available under our line of credit. It is important to note that these options of new accounting rules for convertible debt, which I mentioned earlier, decreased our book debt by approximately $138 million at March 31, 2010, and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is beyond amortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity. For purpose of bank covenants, we will continue to use contractual debt obligations which totaled $2 billion as of March 31, a decrease of $142 million compared to September 30, 2009.
Our 3.25% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from the diluted shares outstanding for the period ended March 31, because the conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
On the balance sheet, we made a lot of progress with our working capital ratios and conversion of working capital of free cash flow. Working capital totaled $647 million at March 31, compared to $609 million at September 30. Average days sales outstanding excluding receivables from our notes and contracts was 54 days, down from 58 days as of September 30. Inventory turns averaged 3.7x up from 3x at September 30.
For the six months ended March 31, IGT generated $277 million in cash flow from operations, compared to $206 million for the first six months of last year. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement in working capital efficiencies such as reduced inventory balance, the lowest it's been in 40 quarters.
For the six months ended March 31, 2010, IGT reported $124 million in free cash flow compared to negative $14 million for the first six months of last year. All of the free cash flow generated in 2010 has been used to pay down debt. Capital expenditures totaled $64 million for the quarter, compared to $53 million in the prior sequential quarter due to higher investments in game ops assets. CapEx is expected to trend in a quarterly range of $65 million to $75 million. Although we continue to come in near the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx, is part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts. 
We understand that the bill, which would have allowed the Alabama voters to decide on a constitutional amendment authorizing bingo, including electronic charitable bingo at the state level, did not pass the Alabama House. Notwithstanding this unfortunate legislative outcome, we believe the electronic charitable bingo terminals at our customers' VictoryLand Country Crossing and Greenetrack are legal. 
Despite our belief, there does exist some risk that the properties will be able to continue operating or will reopen in the case of Country Crossing. We continue to monitor the Alabama charitable market. In the near future, electronic charitable bingo in the state may be impacted by the outcome of several cases pending before the Alabama Supreme Court or from other developments. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $85.5 million on development financing notes, $9.2 million on fixed assets and $7.2 million in accounts receivable associated with our customers in Alabama.
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's second quarter. And I'll now turn the call over to Patti."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal second quarter.
As many of you know, we have been tampering expectations on the state of the market over the past several quarters as we await a sustained and meaningful increase in customer spending levels. And similar to most of you, we remain cautiously optimistic about the macro environment but more enthusiastic about several bright spots in certain areas of our business.
In Gaming Operations, overall yields were $51.70 for the quarter, an improvement of 5% sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in play levels. Our MegaJackpots yield improved 11% sequentially, with Sex and the City continuing to perform earning up to $1,260 per day for our customers.
In addition, we have now deployed 149 units of Amazing Race and 93 units of Top Dollar, our latest generation of titles in our Gaming Operations business. At 4,100 shipped units, our North American replacement sales improved 37% from the prior sequential quarter, the sign of market improvement and a testament to the quality of our latest for-sale titles.
We also made progress on several strategic marketing initiatives during the quarter to better respond to the needs of our customers while reinforcing our historical strength, including: The continuation of a program to refresh our market-leading Wheel of Fortune brand; the announcement of a backward integration solution or our Service Window functionality; and a continued production of certain titles for convergence on our 8960 platform. 
Joining us today is Eric Tom, our Executive Vice President of North American Sales and Marketing, who will tell you a bit more about these programs and give you a broader overview of our customer-facing activities."

I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. We believe this activity showcases our innovative talents and maximizes the value propositions to our customers.
As Patti mentioned, we are highly focused on leveraging our historical strength. We continue to refresh our signature brand, Wheel of Fortune. The first title for a new Center Stage game series is Wheel of Fortune Experience, available with both three- and five-reel games. Additionally, we recently unveiled Wheel of Fortune multi-play, which allows players to play up to four concurrent based games. And finally, Wheel of Fortune Secret Spins, a game in which the wheel rotates to reveal an extra multiplier, will be introduced to the market later this year.
Additionally, we continue to focus certain aspects of our product strategy on initiatives designed to maximize our share of those lean customer budgets. There are three examples, first, our previously announced Service Window solution to a legacy 80960 video machine further the company's commitment to providing our customers with cost-effective and flexible solutions for a network quarter floor. Its backward integration solution, which is scheduled to be deployed in fall 2010, allows our customers to satisfy demands for Service Window capabilities in our existing 80960 footprint. Second, so far this year, we released 21 new convergent games for our legacy 8960 spinning reel and video platforms. These games enable our customers to freshen their floors with limited expenditure while reinforcing our existing position in their casino. And third, we continue to experience success with our DynamiX package, which bundles one new AVP slot machine with two 80960 conversion kits, allowing the customer to refresh three machines concurrently.
Through March 31, we sold 4,017 units under this customer-friendly program. I would also like to highlight other important initiatives that we are executing. Patti mentioned our success with Sex and the City, Amazing Race and Top Dollar. And we are excited about the continued improvement in our game operations product portfolio. As of March 31, our backlog for these three teams, plus the recently released Wheel of Fortune Experience stood at 2,153 units.
In the first two quarters of 2010, for our For Sale business, we have released 80 game titles, compared to 30 titles during the same period in 2009. These included an even mix of spinning reel and video slot games. Some of the exiting new titles include, Pirate Bay, Kodiak King and Majestic Sea. We anticipate another 50 to 70 titles to be released through the remainder of this fiscal year. And as of April 19, we have 3,200 games in the backlog. We are now over 13,000 AVP units with MLD in the marketplace, offering 3D games and enabling spinning reels, video slots and poker slots all in one machine.
Now turning to systems. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of our server-based gaming system in Aria. We believe we have met our customers' high expectations with a first system of its kind. During the second quarter, we announced several key Tier One successes, including Casino di Venezia in Italy, Grand Casino in Helsinki, The Orleans and Colusa and Mohawk.
In North America, as of March 31, we are in varying contract stages with two other sbX opportunities and seven other tier I opportunities. Please understand there is no guarantee that we will close all these opportunities. In our Traditional Systems business, we continue to face a challenging new build environment with few additional casino properties scheduled to open in the near term. With that being said, this quarter we have closed three new Advantage customers as of March 31. And as of that date, we are in varying contract stages with five new Advantage customers. Again, no guarantee that we'll close all these opportunities. We are also aggressively focused on marketing sbX to our existing Advantage customers, who are ideal candidate to leverage the power of this new platform.
Now more broadly, we continue to receive positive feedback from our customers for our restructured North American sales organization. Implemented in September of 2009, this change included the addition of strategic account managers, highly trained sales personnel, who manage our largest customers, and our focus on corporate relationships, system and marketing opportunities.
Additionally, we now have each account manager responsible for the entire IGT portfolio. The breadth of which we consider to be a competitive advantage. We also organized our systems, professional services and poker experts to more effectively assist our frontline account managers.
So as we move forward in our sales and marketing strategies, we'll continue to focus on content quality, product innovation and a customer first approach to market. And with that, I will turn it back over to Patti to speak about our broader corporate initiatives and our outlook for the remainder of 2010."

And in light of the continued challenging environment this quarter, I will focus on activity pertinent to those items that are under our control. Our balance sheet metrics continue to improve with working capital reduced by $88 million from the prior-year quarter and total contractual debt obligations declining by $80 million sequentially.
We remain extremely focused on free cash flow generation. We continue to actively manage cost in the midst of the challenging environment as evidenced by the decline in operating expense of 13%, excluding restructuring and other charges and a decline in SG&A of 12%, excluding bad debt over the prior-year quarter.
Additionally, we continue to make forward-looking and occasionally difficult capital allocation decisions. We continue to prepare our product and financing strategies for the impending 35,000- to 40,000-units Illinois expansion. We anticipate that the central system provider will be announced shortly with the associated rules and regulations issued thereafter. And we anticipate units to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2011.
We recently announced our decision to exit from the Japanese patent law [ph](47:13) market. And while we are never happy to part with employees, difficult markets require difficult decisions. Looking forward, Gideon Bierer, our Executive Vice President of New Media, continues to establish his organization, an organization that will focus on the emerging opportunities in our industry. While Chris Satchell, our Chief Technology Officer continues to focus on platform improvement, a critical aspect of our future game development efforts. Both Gideon and Chris are implementing initiatives that will have long-term impact on our business. Again, we continue to work tirelessly to improve IGT for our customers, our employees and most importantly, for you, our shareholders.
As I mentioned, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding operator budgets and spending. But the seasonally slow first half of the year behind us, we are looking forward to an increasingly clear view of the industry prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. As I previously noted, there have been significant changes to our capital structure and certain changes in accounting principles, which impact our current quarter results relative to our prior periods.
We have adjusted our guidance to reflect the rest of the potential loss of revenues associated with units in Alabama. As a result of all these factors, our guidance for 2010 has changed to a range of $0.77 to $0.85 per diluted share. As always, our guidance excludes one-time items. Our guidance also assumes no dilution impact from our convertible notes. 
And with that, we'll open the call for questions."

They see that their floors need that re-investment. But capital budget's being controlled so tightly. They just don't have the opportunity. With that, we really focused on how we can facilitate the refreshener of floors and minimize the capital budget. So one of the reasons why the dynamics package made sense to us and actually turned out to be very successful, is that it combines the refreshing of two older games, which are susceptible to replacement because they're older, they're an older theme. At the same time, leveraging the minimal capital budget that you have to buy in the next-generation platform. So it's kind of win-win investment in the future, but you solidify the past. And it made a lot of sense because, these 8,960 game themes that we put out to convergent themes.
don't cost very much, I mean, $500 a piece to a $1,000 total. The other area that we're focused on, because the capital budgets are so limited, is placing new MegaJackpot themes on the floor, because it's capitalist to the customer, it refreshes the floor that's in need of refreshing. And there's a lot of energy behind the new labels. So everybody seems to be excited about that, and we're having a good run at it [indiscernible] (1:00:28)."

So we don't think about it as much as quantity, frankly, as we think about each role that the relevant each studio plays in the market. Now, I will say, as always in every quarter, you're going to have studios that play stronger than others, and we have that at this particular time. But that's based on the needs of the business, less than the talent of the workforce. So when the needs of the business shift, you do have to widen and push studious differently. And so we're doing that. So I would say, it will never be equal because studios are studios and their creative people. So we'll never be equal. But I think, we had each studio playing the role that the company has defined for them to play. Eric, do you have anything to add to that?"

With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.Before we begin, we'd like",2858,"All right. Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IGT's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.
Before we begin, we'd like to remind listeners that our discussion reflects management's views based on marketplace environment as of today, July 27, 2010, includes forward-looking statements, including forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products, play levels for our installed base of reoccurring revenue gain, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
Our future financial condition, results of operations, as well as forward-looking statement are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. And you should not assume later in the quarter or the year that the comments we make today are still valid. The actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release, and our filings with the SEC included our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, Form 8-K dated June 3, 2010, applying the retrospective adoption of accounting standards and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, igt.com. You will find additional disclosure regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Turning now to our discussion about the business. This afternoon, IGT reported third quarter results for fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations totaled $95 million or $0.32 per diluted share versus the $62 million and $0.21 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items of $37 million or $0.12 per diluted share, offset by restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing costs of $4 million, collectively $0.01 per diluted share. The favorable discrete tax items recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily related to the IRS audit closure for the fiscal years 2002 through 2005, and these were partially offset by changes in our uncertain tax liabilities. The prior-year quarter included restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing charges of $6 million, collectively $0.02 per diluted share. 
Excluding the items mentioned above, third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $62 million or $0.21 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and $67 million or $0.23 per diluted share for fiscal 2009. A list of the items affecting comparability for all periods presented is included in a supplemental reconciliation of adjusted income from continuing operations in our earnings press release that went out this afternoon.
Third quarter net income, including discontinued operations related to the closure of our Japan operation, totaled $92 million or $0.31 per diluted share versus $61 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Our consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $490 million of which 56% was generated from gaming operations and the balance from product sales, compared to $517 million for the same quarter last year. Nine months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion on the same period last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter were $276 million and $120 million, respectively, and $844 million and $320 million, respectively for the nine months ended June 30, 2010.
At the beginning of fiscal 2010, we adopted accounting standards requiring retrospective application of prior periods associated with our convertible debt and the equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the back of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in reduced diluted EPS of $0.01 for the current quarter and $0.02 in the prior-year quarter.
Moving on to Gaming Operations. Revenue were $277 million in the current quarter, which was down 1% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58% for the quarter versus 62% in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased jackpots, hence resulting from interest rate changes. Interest rate change on jackpot liabilities increased jackpot expense by $6 million in this year's third quarter and decreased jackpot expense by $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Jackpot liabilities are recorded on the books at present value. Until a jackpot is paid out as a lump sum for annuity versus to fund the longer-term payment stream, changes in interest rates affect this present value calculation. For example, decreased in interest rates increased the present value of the jackpot liability, which increases the liability on the balance sheet and also increase the jackpot expense and Game Operations margin. The opposite effect occurs when there are increases in interest rates. We expect fourth quarter Game Ops gross margins to trend within a range of approximately 58% to 61%.
We earned an average of $51.68 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 1% sequentially and up from $51.47 in last year's quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter that revenue per unit per day is up on a sequential basis while not up a large amount it's starting to show some stability. We encouraged by the recent uptick as sign of innovation and a testament of the quality of our latest Game Ops games. This blended yield of $51.68 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse installed based comprised of our MegaJackpots, CDS Class II and lease ops units, all of which served distinct markets and have unique yield characteristics. 
Our Game Ops yields range from $10 to $15 per day on some of our lower yielding units and in international units to a more than $100 per day on some of our MegaJackpot units. During our fiscal third quarter, one additional property in Alabama ceased operations, or in the remaining non-Native American property opened, which has 1,800 IGT electronic charitable bingo terminals operable. We are currently recognizing revenue on a cash basis only due to the uncertainty in the market.
IGT's installed base ended the third quarter at 58,900 units, up 100 units over the prior-sequential quarter and down 2,200 units compared to the prior-year quarter. North American decreases over the prior year largely attributable to regulatory issues in Alabama were partially offset by increases in international markets. Approximately 83% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games, which are on a percentage of a machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
Moving onto product sales. Product sales totaled $213 million for the quarter compared to $231 million in the prior year. Both, we shift 9,000 machines during the quarter, down from prior year shipments of 12,600.
Non-machine revenues comprised of gaming system, game theme conversions, tables, parts, and intellectual property fees came at $91 million for the quarter and accounted for 43% of total product sales for the quarter, compared to $81 million and 35% of total product sales in the prior-year quarter.
Product sales gross margins were 54% for the quarter, up 300 basis points in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and an increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release. Units shipped for the current periods reflect all units shipped to customers, which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent the units recognized in revenues under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
Now breaking down product sales domestic versus international. Domestic product sales revenue totaled $124 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared with $148 million and 6,700 units recognized in the prior-year quarter.
Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 3,200, up 900 units from the prior year and down 900 units sequentially. The sequential decline is driven by lower replacement in Canada, partially offset by  higher sales in Washington. Domestic new and expansion shipments totaled 900 units in the quarter, up 100 sequentially and down 3,600 from the prior-year quarter due to fewer new openings. Respective adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, resulted in $8 million of consolidated revenues in the current quarter, which would have been recognized in different periods under the prior guidance.
Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $61 million in the quarter, up from $52 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the DynamiX promotional conversion and higher systems-related revenue. Domestic ASPs were 14,100 for the third quarter compared to 14,400 in the prior-year quarter. And domestic ARPU computed on equivalent-units-recognized basis was 27,600 for the third quarter compared to 22,100 in the prior year. ASP decline was due to the DynamiX promotion, which defers a portion of the sales price to the related conversion kits. When a customer takes delivery of these conversion kits, the associated revenue is recognized and shows up non-machine revenue. The ARPU increase was due to increased non-machine revenue. We shipped 2,200 MLD units or 55% of total North American shipments in the third quarter compared to 900 units or 13% of total North American shipments in the prior-year quarter. Sales and machines utilizing our AVP technology comprised 92% of total North American machines shipped during the third quarter, a trend we expect to continue as our legacy-for-sale products are phased out.
International product sales revenue totaled $89 million on volume of 5,400 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,500 units recognized from the prior-year quarter.  Our international markets benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange, as well as the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and improved sales in Mexico. International non-machine sales were $30 million in the third quarter, flat compared to the prior-year quarter. International ASP was 10,900 for the third quarter compared to 9,600 in the prior-year quarter. And international ARPU computed on an equivalent-units-recognized basis in the third quarter was 16,400, up 9% over the prior quarter.
Both international ASP and ARPU increases were primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange as well as better product and the geographic mix. Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 54%, up 300 basis points from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. We expect product sales margins in the fourth quarter to trend within a range of approximately 50% to 52% depending on product sales mix.
Now moving on to OpEx. Quarter operating expenses decreased 8% to $156 million compared to $169 million on the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the cost-reduction efforts and lower professional service fees.
We continue to move towards our goal of previously announced $200 million of annual cost savings when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel that we are well on track to achieve our cost-reduction goal as we exit this fiscal year.
Third quarter SG&A declined $13 million or 13% from the prior quarter to $82 million, primarily result of our continued cost-control efforts. Professional fees were also down due to debt refinancing costs of $1.8 million included in the prior quarter. We expect a quarterly SG&A run rate of $85 million to $90 million on the fourth quarter. Bad debt provisions totaled $1 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. R&D expense totaled $52 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. We expect the quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area. 
Depreciation and amortization within operating expenses totaled $19 million for the quarter, relatively flat to the prior-year quarter. Total depreciation and amortization, inclusive of that is included in cost of Game Ops, was $59 million for the quarter, down from $64 million in the prior year. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic MegaJackpot and CDS operations. We expect depreciation and amortization to be flat in the fourth quarter compared to this quarter.
Other income and expense in the third quarter was a net expense to $24 million compared to $26 million in the prior quarter. The decline was largely attributable to foreign currency gains and reduced interest expense on lower borrowings. Third quarter interest expense included debt refinancing charges of $4 million due to a $300 million reduction in the total size of our debt domestic credit facility in the current year and $4 million related to early breakage fees on our line of credit in the prior year.
Additional convertible debt amortization required under accounting guidance adopted retrospectively at the beginning of this fiscal year, increased interest expense by $7 million in the current quarter and $9 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, we expect incremental non-cash interest of approximately $30 million, $19 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share for this fiscal year and approximately $35 million and $22 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 as restated, including repurchased gains of $5 million.
Our tax rate was 2% in the third quarter versus 38% in the prior-year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter was impacted by the previously mentioned favorable discrete tax items related to the closure of IRS audits for the years 2002 through 2005, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax liabilities. The current quarter tax rate, excluding discrete items was approximately 39%.
Going forward, we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discrete items. However, we may experience volatility on our quarterly tax rate due to the impact of discrete items.
Moving onto the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $252 million at June 30 compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.9 billion with $1.2 billion of available capacity on our $1.5 billion credit facility as of June 30. It's important to note that the adoption of new accounting rules for convertible debt mentioned earlier decreased our book debt by approximately $131 million at June 30 and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is the unamortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity.
For the purpose of bank covenants, we continue to use contractual debt obligations, which totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, a decrease of $242 million compared to September 30, 2009. Our bank leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.5x, a decrease of a half a turn, down from 3x at September 30, 2009. We issued $300 million of 5.5% notes due June 2020 during the quarter. The net proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our domestic credit facility, which currently has an outstanding balance of $270 million, a decrease of $400 million from prior-sequential quarter. In conjunction with this note offering, we reduced the total commitment on our domestic line of credit from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion.
Our 3 1/4% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the period ended June 30, 2010, because of conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
On the balance sheet, we made a lot of progress with our working capital ratios and conversion of working capital and the free cash flow. Working capital totaled $609 million at June 30 and at September 30, 2009, average days sales outstanding, excluding receivables from our notes and contracts and Japan operations, was 50 days, down from 58 days as of September 30, 2009. Inventory turns excluding Japan operations averaged 3.8x, up from 2.9x as of September 30, 2009.
For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $424 million in cash flow from operations compared to $354 million for the first nine months of last year. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement of working capital efficiencies such as reduced inventory balance, the lowest it's been in the 41 quarters. The nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $192 million in free cash flow compared to $75 million for the first nine months last year. All of this free cash flow was used to pay down debt.
Capital expenditures totaled $61 million for the quarter compared to $64 million in the prior-sequential quarter due to lower PP&E. CapEx is expected to trend in the quarterly range of $60 million to $65 million for the fourth quarter, although we continue to come in near the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx as part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts. 
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's third quarter. Thanks for your time and attention. I will now turn the call over to Patti for her comments."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal third quarter. Our customers continue to spend capital at a conservative pace in an uncertain economy, but we cannot avoid the impact of the economic conditions affecting our customers around the globe. We can focus our efforts on making IGT stronger and more nimble ahead of an improvement in the macro environment. We continue to focus on improving our balance sheet. As Pat mentioned, we recently refinanced $300 million of debt through the sale of 5 1/2% notes that are due in 2020. The rate is 200 basis points less than the notes we priced in June of 2009. Additionally, our contractual debt obligations declined by $100 million sequentially. Our focus on the generation of free cash flow remains our highest priority. We are aggressively managing our cost structure as evidenced by a decline in operating expense of 8% and a decline in SG&A of 13% over the prior-year quarter.
We are addressing the need for improved efficiency in the application of our research and development resources. We are unifying our platforms and processes across the studio structure, giving us increased leverage from our development tools. This standardization is allowing us to more rapidly gain productivity improvements and increase the quality of our game content.
In the Systems business, we are capitalizing on our investment in server-based gaming and the increased quality of Advantage by focusing more of our engineering efforts on applications and content. The number of server-based installations now numbers 14 with four pending installations and numerous others in various stages of contract negotiation. Our focus on open standards and technologies will allow us to rapidly add customer-centric functionality to our growing server-based customers set.
We have significantly reduced the complexity of our hardware platform and increased the standardization on the AVP platform on a global basis providing further economies of scale. We continue to deliver our latest innovative products to markets around the world. During the quarter, we announced the installation of our sbX Tier One in France, Finland and Italy, our M-P Roulette Evolution in Switzerland and an extension on our contract with the University of Iceland Lottery to provide MLD video slots and Casinolink, as well as the implementation of EasyPay. Our WagerWorks online and mobile subsidiary was officially crowned Slot Provider of the Year at the inaugural EGR b2b Supplier Awards in London. 
Joining us today is Eric Tom, our recently appointed Chief Operating Officer, who will share with you a bit more about our strategic product initiatives and give you a broader overview of our customer-facing activities. Eric?"

In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products,",751,"Thank you, Patti. I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products, MegaJackpots for sale and systems; and also include North American sales, marketing services and soon, manufacturing operations and sales outside of North America. I'll continue to focus on building a market-driven organization with a customer-first perspective and improving the operational efficiency of the company.
Here are some highlights regarding the product performance for the quarter. In Gaming Operations, overall yields were $51.68, an improvement of 1% sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in play levels. Our stand-alone MegaJackpot yields improved 2% sequentially. Sex and the City, now with more than 1,300 units installed since its release, continues to perform and is earning up to $1,090 per day for some of our customers. Additionally, our latest generation of game titles, Amazing Race, Top Dollar and Super Nova Blast now have 790, 391 and 362 units deployed, respectively. As of June 30, our backlog for these four titles that I just mentioned stood at 1,202 games, and our total backlog for MegaJackpots stood at 3,397 games.
In our For Sale business, we have developed and released 104 game titles to the first three quarters of this year, compared to 56 titles during the same period in 2009. Some of the recently-released titles include the Cats MultiPLAY, Boozing [ph] (41:17), the industry's first 3D video slot, Queen Isabella, Lion's Heart [ph] (41:24) and  Jumpin' Jungle. We expect to complete development of another 30 to 40 titles in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Our very successful DynamiX package, which bundled one new AVP slot machine with two 8960 conversion kits allow the customer to refresh three machines concurrently. The promotion ended on June 30. Under this customer-focused program, we sold 6,300 units.
Other highlights for the third quarter include: We're excited about the recently-announced agreement with Cosmopolitan to provide them with a multi-product and system solutions, including sbX, our server-based gaming solution, a majority of their games plus the entire suite of IGT Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature IGT's GSA compliant server-based network, which incorporates the award-winning, player-focused Service Window, SbX Floor Manager, Media Manager and access to IGT's game library. Our success with Cosmopolitan is a result of our efforts to leverage the value of our comprehensive product and systems portfolio of for sale games, MegaJackpot games and systems infrastructure and applications. 
Our account managers and strategic account managers are trained across the entire portfolio and they're supported by subject matter experts in the field. This allows us to have a more elevated discussion at a much more strategic level that includes different disciplines within our customers' organizations. The strategic approach, in place since September of last year, allows us to focus on specific areas of need for our customers while leveraging the breadth of our product portfolio.
During the third quarter, we announced several key Tier One successes including the installation at the Mohawk Casino in New York, Casino d'Evian in France, Casino Helsinki in Finland, Casino di Venezia in Italy. Additionally, we announced our first field trial location of sbX floor manager on a non-IGT system at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Our sbX Floor Manager provides The Orleans unlimited access to our expansive game library of nearly 300 game themes with new themes added each month. In North America as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with three sbX opportunities and 10 Tier One opportunities. Additionally, we are in varying contract stages with 10 Tier One international opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we'll close any of these opportunities.
In our Traditional Systems business, in the third quarter, we closed five new Advantage customers, of which three were replacements of our competitors' systems. And as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with seven new Advantage customers. Again, there is no guarantee we will close any of these opportunities. 
I'm excited to be IGT's new Chief Operating Officer and as we move forward, we will continue to focus on customer-centric orientation in game and system development while leveraging our operational resources in an effective and efficient manner. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti to speak about our broader corporate strategy and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Patti?"

We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the s",906,"Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. 
First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the state's seven racetracks has been revived with the official withdrawal of the measure from the 2010 general election ballot. And last week, the Ohio Lottery Commission voted unanimously on three items that would withdraw old rules on VLT and install new rules and seek the court judgment affirming the Commission's authority to install slots at racetracks.
In Illinois, the implementation of the VLT program is proceeding with the awarding of the central monitoring system contract, the adoption of administrative rules and the licensing process has been initiated. The City of Chicago, which represents a potential market for up to 15,000 machines, is still waiting to pass the necessary city council resolution to opt-in to the program. Initial shipments for Illinois are projected for early calendar 2011.
In Massachusetts, both the State Senate and House have passed their own versions of the gaming bill. The bills are currently in a conference committee made up of members from both the House and Senate who are working towards a compromised measure. However, they're working against a July 31 deadline for their summer adjournment. The prospects for a gaming bill remains extremely high, and the governor continues to indicate his support. We are closely monitoring the legalization of gaming in both Kentucky and New Hampshire. 
In Canada, the VLT replacement process continues to move slowly, and we expect the majority of the games to come online in 2012. Of the 34,000 games in Canada, we estimate that approximately 20,000 to 25,000 could be replaced over the next two to three years.
In Italy, all 10 concessionaires have paid half of the license fee and therefore, all 55,000 license have been taken. The approval process has delayed the rollout and today, only Lottomatica has received approval and has opened their first site in Rome. We expect approval for one of our installations in September and to have machines operating in the first quarter of 2011 and approval for a subsequent shipment in early 2011.
In Brazil, the parliament did not vote for the new bingo legislation in advance of their leave due to their upcoming October election. Depending upon the outcome of the election, we could see the proposal resurface as early as next year. 
In Greece, we expect that within one month, a proposal for VLT legislation will be submitted and with the consultation process, EC and parliament approval, we expect final legislation by the end of 2010 with a potential operational date of late 2011. The market potential in Greece is approximately 50,000 VLTs, which will require an upfront license fee of eur 10,000 apiece to be paid in two installments. The expectation is that this market will be on a bit of a fast track due to the economic stress in the country.
In the quarter, we also made progress with pending litigation which never happens quickly or easily. Concerning the pending shareholder actions, the four initial shareholder derivative suits that were filed against the company in 2009 were recently dismissed with leave to amend from the Federal District court in Nevada. In another case, our motion for summary judgment was recently granted in a suit filed by a competitor in 2006, which alleged infringement of one of its game method patents.
We continue to build and strengthen our senior management team. Eric spoke about his new responsibilities as the Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Satchell, our Chief Technology Officer, has expanded his responsibilities to include the leadership of Research and Development. As our CTO and Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Chris will lead the company's effort to continue the development of groundbreaking and innovative products for the gaming industry. 
We announced in the quarter the retirement from IGT of Tony Ciorciari who is currently in charge of Global Operations; and Paulus Karskens, the President of our International Organization. Over the next six months, we will work with Tony and Paulus to transition their work to the capable organizations they'll leave behind. We also announced the appointment of Vince Sadusky, a seasoned media executive to our Board of Director. 
We remain laser focused on creating long-term value for all of our shareholders by continuing as a profitable company that generates significant cash flows. Our objective is to provide superior financial results through disciplined strategic actions. And I want to thank all of you for your continued support. 
As I mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the short-term pending activity of operators, but we will make strides within our company towards being as lean and mean as possible, heading into an inevitable and sustainable increase in customer spending levels. There are a few factors that might impact our fourth quarter results such as the continued lack of visibility around replacement demand, revenue recognition risks associated with a few significant transactions and the impact of interest rates on our Gaming Operations margin. 
As a result of all of these factors, our guidance for 2010 has moved to a range of $0.82 to $0.85 in earnings per diluted share. As always, our guidance excludes one-time items. Our guidance also assumes no dilution impact from our convertible notes. 
So with that, we'll open the call for questions."

One were those free conversions that got allocated away from -- remember, the question last quarter on ASPs, the reason they were lower was because we had to allocate the fair value of the conversions that were given up. Now what you're seeing is customers starting to take delivery of those conversions, and so that deferred revenues are on back up. The balance sheet now probably continued for at least through Q4, I would assume. The other piece and they were about equal, I think, in weight, was improved largely Advantage system installations during the quarter and some application and bonuses and things we delivered. That's the one that could be a little bit more volatile quarter-to-quarter because of rev rec rules."

And that was a significant difference in the product sales, and we're still waiting for the rest of those from the promotion to make their way through. So I think you will see it for a couple of more quarters. They were the significant contributor in the quarter."

Access to capital and the new cost of their capital for some customers is an issue, for others, it's not. So I think it really depends on who the customer is, but I would say generally, they're waiting for the malaise to lift in the travel and leisure industry, in general, before they really are comfortable spending ahead of the cycle.

And then there's still new type to ARIA that is contemplated in the quarter, but is predicated on delivery of some additional software, which will be tight to get in by the end of the quarter. And then I think the risk is just the continued lack of visibility around replacements. Then follow up to Patti and Eric's comments about -- our customers have clearly shown over the last couple of years, that they're managing their capital budgets over much shorter increments than the time they have historically because they're looking for, I believe, first, stability in their business before they're going to let go. And then there's still some incremental risk in interest rates. We saw treasuries drop below prime for the first time in recent memory. And of course, we always use the higher rate to value our jackpot liabilities. And so, if agencies should compress, you still got probably 50 basis points of spread there between them. So those are kind of at the high end where the biggest risks are in terms of the magnitude."

It's very high-margin business for us and it drives, overtime, boxes, but it is less predictable from a revenue-recognition prospective. So the two projects, large projects on some of the custom software deliverables to ARIA and then the Cosmo project, they're going to be tough for us to predict getting them in the quarter."

With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.Before we begin, we'd like",2860,"All right. Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IGT's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.
Before we begin, we'd like to remind listeners that our discussion reflects management's views based on marketplace environment as of today, July 27, 2010, includes forward-looking statements, including forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products, play levels for our installed base of reoccurring revenue gain, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
Our future financial condition, results of operations, as well as forward-looking statement are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. And you should not assume later in the quarter or the year that the comments we make today are still valid. The actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release, and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, Form 8-K dated June 3, 2010, applying the retrospective adoption of accounting standards and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, igt.com. You will find additional disclosure regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Turning now to our discussion about the business. This afternoon, IGT reported third quarter results for fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations totaled $95 million or $0.32 per diluted share versus the $62 million and $0.21 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items of $37 million or $0.12 per diluted share, offset by restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing costs of $4 million, collectively $0.01 per diluted share. The favorable discrete tax items recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily related to the IRS audit closure for the fiscal years 2002 through 2005, and these were partially offset by changes in our uncertain tax liabilities. The prior-year quarter included restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing charges of $6 million, collectively $0.02 per diluted share. 
Excluding the items mentioned above, third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $62 million or $0.21 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and $67 million or $0.23 per diluted share for fiscal 2009. A list of the items affecting comparability for all periods presented is included in a supplemental reconciliation of adjusted income from continuing operations in our earnings press release that went out this afternoon.
Third quarter net income, including discontinued operations related to the closure of our Japan operation, totaled $92 million or $0.31 per diluted share versus $61 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Our consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $490 million of which 56% was generated from gaming operations and the balance from product sales, compared to $517 million for the same quarter last year. Nine months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion on the same period last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter were $276 million and $120 million, respectively, and $844 million and $320 million, respectively for the nine months ended June 30, 2010.
At the beginning of fiscal 2010, we adopted accounting standards requiring retrospective application of prior periods associated with our convertible debt and the equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the back of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in reduced diluted EPS of $0.01 for the current quarter and $0.02 in the prior-year quarter.
Moving on to Gaming Operations. Revenue were $277 million in the current quarter, which was down 1% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58% for the quarter versus 62% in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased jackpots, hence resulting from interest rate changes. 
Interest rate change on jackpot liabilities increased jackpot expense by $6 million in this year's third quarter and decreased jackpot expense by $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Jackpot liabilities are recorded on the books at present value. Until a jackpot is paid out as a lump sum or annuity versus to fund the longer-term payment stream, changes in interest rates affect this present value calculation. For example, decrease in interest rates increase the present value of the jackpot liability, which increases the liability on the balance sheet and also increase the jackpot expense and Game Operations margin. The opposite effect occurs when there are increases in interest rates. We expect fourth quarter Game Ops gross margins to trend within a range of approximately 58% to 61%.
We earned an average of $51.68 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 1% sequentially and up from $51.47 in last year's quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter that revenue per unit per day is up on a sequential basis while not up a large amount it's starting to show some stability. 
We encouraged by the recent uptick as sign of innovation and a testament of the quality of our latest Game Ops games. This blended yield of $51.68 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse installed based comprised of our MegaJackpots, CDS Class II and lease ops units, all of which served distinct markets and have unique yield characteristics. 
Our Game Ops yields range from $10 to $15 per day on some of our lower yielding units and in international units to a more than $100 per day on some of our MegaJackpot units. During our fiscal third quarter, one additional property in Alabama ceased operations, or in the remaining non-Native American property opened, which has 1,800 IGT electronic charitable bingo terminals operable. We are currently recognizing revenue on a cash basis only due to the uncertainty in the market.
IGT's install base ended the third quarter at 58,900 units, up 100 units over the prior-sequential quarter and down 2,200 units compared to the prior-year quarter. North American decreases over the prior year largely attributable to regulatory issues in Alabama were partially offset by increases in international markets. Approximately 83% of our install base is comprised of variable fee games, which are on a percentage of a machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
Moving onto product sales. Product sales totaled $213 million for the quarter compared to $231 million in the prior year. Both, we shipped 9,000 machines during the quarter, down from prior year shipments of 12,600.
Non-machine revenues comprised of gaming system, game theme conversions, tables, parts, and intellectual property fees came in at $91 million for the quarter and accounted for 43% of total product sales for the quarter, compared to $81 million and 35% of total product sales in the prior-year quarter.
Product sales gross margins were 54% for the quarter, up 300 basis points in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and an increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release. Units shipped for the current periods reflect all units shipped to customers, which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent the units recognized in revenues under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
Now breaking down product sales domestic versus international. Domestic product sales revenue totaled $124 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared with $148 million and 6,700 units recognized in the prior-year quarter.
Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 3,200, up 900 units from the prior year and down 900 units sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower replacements in Canada, partially offset by  higher sales in Washington. Domestic new and expansion shipments totaled 900 units in the quarter, up 100 sequentially and down 3,600 from the prior-year quarter due to fewer new openings.
Respective adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, resulted in $8 million of consolidated revenues in the current quarter, which would have been recognized in different periods under the prior guidance.
Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $61 million in the quarter, up from $52 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the DynamiX promotional conversion and higher systems-related revenue. Domestic ASPs were 14,100 for the third quarter compared to 14,400 in the prior-year quarter. And domestic ARPU computed on equivalent-units-recognized basis was 27,600 for the third quarter compared to 22,100 in the prior year. ASP decline was due to the DynamiX promotion, which defers a portion of the sales price to the related conversion kits. When a customer takes delivery of these conversion kits, the associated revenue is recognized and shows up non-machine revenue. The ARPU increase was due to increased non-machine revenue. We shipped 2,200 MLD units or 55% of total North American shipments in the third quarter compared to 900 units or 13% of total North American shipments in the prior-year quarter. Sales and machines utilizing our AVP technology comprised 92% of total North American machines shipped during the third quarter, a trend we expect to continue as our legacy-for-sale products are phased out.
International product sales revenue totaled $89 million on volume of 5,400 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,500 units recognized from the prior-year quarter.  Our international markets benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange, as well as the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and improved sales in Mexico. International non-machine sales were $30 million in the third quarter, flat compared to the prior-year quarter. International ASP was 10,900 for the third quarter compared to 9,600 in the prior-year quarter. And international ARPU computed on an equivalent-units-recognized basis in the third quarter was 16,400, up 9% over the prior quarter.
Both international ASP and ARPU increases were primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange as well as better product and the geographic mix. Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 54%, up 300 basis points from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. We expect product sales margins in the fourth quarter to trend within a range of approximately 50% to 52% depending on product sales mix.
Now moving on to OpEx. Quarter operating expenses decreased 8% to $156 million compared to $169 million on the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the cost-reduction efforts and lower professional service fees.
We continue to move towards our goal of previously announced $200 million of annual cost savings when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel that we are well on track to achieve our cost-reduction goal as we exit this fiscal year.
Third quarter SG&A declined $13 million or 13% from the prior quarter to $82 million, primarily result of our continued cost-control efforts. Professional fees were also down due to debt refinancing costs of $1.8 million included in the prior quarter. We expect a quarterly SG&A run rate of $85 million to $90 million on the fourth quarter. Bad debt provisions totaled $1 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. R&D expense totaled $52 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. We expect the quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area. 
Depreciation and amortization within operating expenses totaled $19 million for the quarter, relatively flat to the prior-year quarter. Total depreciation and amortization, inclusive of that is included in cost of Game Ops, was $59 million for the quarter, down from $64 million in the prior year. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic MegaJackpot and CDS operations. We expect depreciation and amortization to be flat in the fourth quarter compared to this quarter.
Other income and expense in the third quarter was a net expense to $24 million compared to $26 million in the prior quarter. The decline was largely attributable to foreign currency gains and reduced interest expense on lower borrowings. Third quarter interest expense included debt refinancing charges of $4 million due to a $300 million reduction in the total size of our debt domestic credit facility in the current year and $4 million related to early breakage fees on our line of credit in the prior year.
Additional convertible debt amortization required under accounting guidance adopted retrospectively at the beginning of this fiscal year, increased interest expense by $7 million in the current quarter and $9 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, we expect incremental non-cash interest of approximately $30 million, $19 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share for this fiscal year and approximately $35 million and $22 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 as restated, including repurchased gains of $5 million.
Our tax rate was 2% in the third quarter versus 38% in the prior-year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter was impacted by the previously mentioned favorable discrete tax items related to the closure of IRS audits for the years 2002 through 2005, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax liabilities. The current quarter tax rate, excluding discrete items was approximately 39%.
Going forward, we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discrete items. However, we may experience volatility on our quarterly tax rate due to the impact of discrete items.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $252 million at June 30 compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.9 billion with $1.2 billion of available capacity on our $1.5 billion credit facility as of June 30. It's important to note that the adoption of new accounting rules for convertible debt mentioned earlier decreased our book debt by approximately $131 million at June 30 and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is the unamortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity.
For the purpose of bank covenants, we continue to use contractual debt obligations, which totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, a decrease of $242 million compared to September 30, 2009. Our bank leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.5x, a decrease of a half a turn, down from 3x at September 30, 2009. We issued $300 million of 5.5% notes due June 2020 during the quarter. The net proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our domestic credit facility, which currently has an outstanding balance of $270 million, a decrease of $400 million from prior-sequential quarter. In conjunction with this note offering, we reduced the total commitment on our domestic line of credit from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion.
Our 3 1/4% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the period ended June 30, 2010, because of conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
On the balance sheet, we made a lot of progress with our working capital ratios and conversion of working capital and the free cash flow. Working capital totaled $609 million at June 30 and at September 30, 2009, average days sales outstanding, excluding receivables from our notes and contracts and Japan operations, was 50 days, down from 58 days as of September 30, 2009. Inventory turns excluding Japan operations averaged 3.8x, up from 2.9x as of September 30, 2009.
For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $424 million in cash flow from operations compared to $354 million for the first nine months of last year. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement of working capital efficiencies such as reduced inventory balance, the lowest it's been in the 41 quarters. The nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $192 million in free cash flow compared to $75 million for the first nine months last year. All of this free cash flow was used to pay down debt.
Capital expenditures totaled $61 million for the quarter compared to $64 million in the prior-sequential quarter due to lower PP&E. CapEx is expected to trend in the quarterly range of $60 million to $65 million for the fourth quarter, although we continue to come in near the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx as part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts. 
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's third quarter. Thanks for your time and attention. I will now turn the call over to Patti for her comments."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal third quarter. Our customers continue to spend capital at a conservative pace in an uncertain economy, but we cannot avoid the impact of the economic conditions affecting our customers around the globe. We can focus our efforts on making IGT stronger and more nimble ahead of an improvement in the macro environment. We continue to focus on improving our balance sheet. As Pat mentioned, we recently refinanced $300 million of debt through the sale of 5 1/2% notes that are due in 2020. The rate is 200 basis points less than the notes we priced in June of 2009. Additionally, our contractual debt obligations declined by $100 million sequentially. Our focus on the generation of free cash flow remains our highest priority. We are aggressively managing our cost structure as evidenced by a decline in operating expense of 8% and a decline in SG&A of 13% over the prior-year quarter.
We are addressing the need for improved efficiency in the application of our research and development resources. We are unifying our platforms and processes across the studio structure, giving us increased leverage from our development tools. This standardization is allowing us to more rapidly gain productivity improvements and increase the quality of our game content.
In the Systems business, we are capitalizing on our investment in server-based gaming and the increased quality of Advantage by focusing more of our engineering efforts on applications and content. The number of server-based installations now numbers 14 with four pending installations and numerous others in various stages of contract negotiation. Our focus on open standards and technologies will allow us to rapidly add customer-centric functionality to our growing server-based customers set.
We have significantly reduced the complexity of our hardware platform and increased the standardization on the AVP platform on a global basis providing further economies of scale. We continue to deliver our latest innovative products to markets around the world. During the quarter, we announced the installation of our sbX Tier One in France, Finland and Italy, our M-P Roulette Evolution in Switzerland and an extension on our contract with the University of Iceland Lottery to provide MLD video slots and Casinolink, as well as the implementation of EasyPay. Our WagerWorks online and mobile subsidiary was officially crowned Slot Provider of the Year at the inaugural EGR b2b Supplier Awards in London. 
Joining us today is Eric Tom, our recently appointed Chief Operating Officer, who will share with you a bit more about our strategic product initiatives and give you a broader overview of our customer-facing activities. Eric?"

I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products,",749,"Thank you, Patti. I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products, MegaJackpots for sale and systems; and also include North American sales, marketing services and soon, manufacturing operations and sales outside of North America. I'll continue to focus on building a market-driven organization with a customer-first perspective and improving the operational efficiency of the company.
Here are some highlights regarding the product performance for the quarter. In Gaming Operations, overall yields were $51.68, an improvement of 1% sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in play levels. Our stand-alone MegaJackpot yields improved 2% sequentially. Sex and the City, now with more than 1,300 units installed since its release, continues to perform and is earning up to $1,090 per day for some of our customers. Additionally, our latest generation of game titles, Amazing Race, Top Dollar and Super Nova Blast now have 790, 391 and 362 units deployed, respectively. As of June 30, our backlog for these four titles that I just mentioned stood at 1,202 games, and our total backlog for MegaJackpots stood at 3,397 games.
In our For Sale business, we have developed and released 104 game titles to the first three quarters of this year, compared to 56 titles during the same period in 2009. Some of the recently-released titles include the Cats MultiPLAY, Boozing [ph], the industry's first 3D video slot, Queen Isabella, Lion's Heart [ph] and Jumpin' Jungle. We expect to complete development of another 30 to 40 titles in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Our very successful DynamiX package, which bundled one new AVP slot machine with two 8960 conversion kits allow the customer to refresh three machines concurrently. The promotion ended on June 30. Under this customer-focused program, we sold 6,300 units.
Other highlights for the third quarter include: We're excited about the recently-announced agreement with Cosmopolitan to provide them with a multi-product and system solutions, including sbX, our server-based gaming solution, a majority of their games plus the entire suite of IGT Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature IGT's GSA compliant server-based network, which incorporates the award-winning, player-focused Service Window, sbX Floor Manager, Media Manager and access to IGT's game library. Our success with Cosmopolitan is a result of our efforts to leverage the value of our comprehensive product and systems portfolio of for sale games, MegaJackpot games and systems infrastructure and applications. 
Our account managers and strategic account managers are trained across the entire portfolio and they're supported by subject matter experts in the field. This allows us to have a more elevated discussion at a much more strategic level that includes different disciplines within our customers' organizations. The strategic approach, in place since September of last year, allows us to focus on specific areas of need for our customers while leveraging the breadth of our product portfolio.
During the third quarter, we announced several key Tier One successes including the installation at the Mohawk Casino in New York, Casino d'Evian in France, Casino Helsinki in Finland, Casino di Venezia in Italy. Additionally, we announced our first field trial location of sbX Floor Manager on a non-IGT system at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Our sbX Floor Manager provides The Orleans unlimited access to our expansive game library of nearly 300 game themes with new themes added each month. 
In North America as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with three sbX opportunities and 10 Tier One opportunities. Additionally, we are in varying contract stages with 10 Tier One international opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we'll close any of these opportunities.
In our Traditional Systems business, in the third quarter, we closed five new Advantage customers, of which three were replacements of our competitors' systems. And as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with seven new Advantage customers. Again, there is no guarantee we will close any of these opportunities. 
I'm excited to be IGT's new Chief Operating Officer and as we move forward, we will continue to focus on customer-centric orientation in game and system development while leveraging our operational resources in an effective and efficient manner. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti to speak about our broader corporate strategy and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Patti?"
281438,109022739,69795,"International Game Technology, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the s",906,"Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. 
First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the state's seven racetracks has been revived with the official withdrawal of the measure from the 2010 general election ballot. And last week, the Ohio Lottery Commission voted unanimously on three items that would withdraw old rules on VLT and install new rules and seek the court judgment affirming the Commission's authority to install slots at racetracks.
In Illinois, the implementation of the VLT program is proceeding with the awarding of the central monitoring system contract, the adoption of administrative rules and the licensing process has been initiated. The City of Chicago, which represents a potential market for up to 15,000 machines, is still waiting to pass the necessary city council resolution to opt-in to the program. Initial shipments for Illinois are projected for early calendar 2011.
In Massachusetts, both the State Senate and House have passed their own versions of the gaming bill. The bills are currently in a conference committee made up of members from both the House and Senate who are working towards a compromised measure. However, they're working against a July 31 deadline for their summer adjournment. The prospects for a gaming bill remains extremely high, and the governor continues to indicate his support. We are closely monitoring the legalization of gaming in both Kentucky and New Hampshire. 
In Canada, the VLT replacement process continues to move slowly, and we expect the majority of the games to come online in 2012. Of the 34,000 games in Canada, we estimate that approximately 20,000 to 25,000 could be replaced over the next two to three years.
In Italy, all 10 concessionaires have paid half of the license fee and therefore, all 55,000 license have been taken. The approval process has delayed the rollout and today, only Lottomatica has received approval and has opened their first site in Rome. We expect approval for one of our installations in September and to have machines operating in the first quarter of 2011 and approval for a subsequent shipment in early 2011.
In Brazil, the parliament did not vote for the new bingo legislation in advance of their leave due to their upcoming October election. Depending upon the outcome of the election, we could see the proposal resurface as early as next year. 
In Greece, we expect that within one month, a proposal for VLT legislation will be submitted and with the consultation process, EC and parliament approval, we expect final legislation by the end of 2010 with a potential operational date of late 2011. The market potential in Greece is approximately 50,000 VLTs, which will require an upfront license fee of eur 10,000 apiece to be paid in two installments. The expectation is that this market will be on a bit of a fast track due to the economic stress in the country.
In the quarter, we also made progress with pending litigation which never happens quickly or easily. Concerning the pending shareholder actions, the four initial shareholder derivative suits that were filed against the company in 2009 were recently dismissed with leave to amend from the Federal District court in Nevada. In another case, our motion for summary judgment was recently granted in a suit filed by a competitor in 2006, which alleged infringement of one of its game method patents.
We continue to build and strengthen our senior management team. Eric spoke about his new responsibilities as the Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Satchell, our Chief Technology Officer, has expanded his responsibilities to include the leadership of Research and Development. As our CTO and Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Chris will lead the company's effort to continue the development of groundbreaking and innovative products for the gaming industry. 
We announced in the quarter the retirement from IGT of Tony Ciorciari who is currently in charge of Global Operations; and Paulus Karskens, the President of our International Organization. Over the next six months, we will work with Tony and Paulus to transition their work to the capable organizations they'll leave behind. We also announced the appointment of Vince Sadusky, a seasoned media executive to our Board of Director. 
We remain laser focused on creating long-term value for all of our shareholders by continuing as a profitable company that generates significant cash flows. Our objective is to provide superior financial results through disciplined strategic actions. And I want to thank all of you for your continued support. 
As I mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the short-term pending activity of operators, but we will make strides within our company towards being as lean and mean as possible, heading into an inevitable and sustainable increase in customer spending levels. There are a few factors that might impact our fourth quarter results such as the continued lack of visibility around replacement demand, revenue recognition risks associated with a few significant transactions and the impact of interest rates on our Gaming Operations margin. 
As a result of all of these factors, our guidance for 2010 has moved to a range of $0.82 to $0.85 in earnings per diluted share. As always, our guidance excludes one-time items. Our guidance also assumes no dilution impact from our convertible notes. 
So with that, we'll open the call for questions."

I think two things primarily drove it, Joe. One were those free conversions that got allocated away from -- remember, the question last quarter on ASPs, the reason they were lower was because we had to allocate the fair value of the conversions that were given up. Now what you're seeing is customers starting to take delivery of those conversions, and so that deferred revenues are on back up. The balance sheet now probably continued for at least through Q4, I would assume. The other piece and they were about equal, I think, in weight, was improved largely Advantage system installations during the quarter and some application and bonuses and things we delivered. That's the one that could be a little bit more volatile quarter-to-quarter because of rev rec rules."

I just think that what we expected to happen when we rolled out the DynamiX program is exactly what happened, which is we had about, sequentially 1,000-unit increase in conversions this quarter from the previous quarter. So what we thought would happen, happened, which is we stabilized the base of the 8,960 machines and we sold conversions into that market. And that was a significant difference in the product sales, and we're still waiting for the rest of those from the promotion to make their way through. So I think you will see it for a couple of more quarters. But it was a significant contributor in the quarter."

To the extent, they're in a destination location, they're waiting for occupancy rates to stabilize, to increase and then stabilize a bit and for a lot of the vulnerability to make its way out of their own business. Access to capital and the cost of their capital for some customers is an issue, for others, it's not. So I think it really depends on who the customer is, but I would say generally, they're waiting for the malaise to lift in the travel and leisure industry, in general, before they really are comfortable spending ahead of the cycle. Because right now, they all feel like they would be spending ahead of the cycle. So that's kind of my view from my conversations with them. Eric, I would ask you to add your thoughts."

And then there's still new type to ARIA that is contemplated in the quarter, but is predicated on delivery of some additional software, which will be tight to get in by the end of the quarter. And then I think the risk is just the continued lack of visibility around replacements. Then follow up to Patti and Eric's comments about -- our customers have clearly shown over the last couple of years, that they're managing their capital budgets over much shorter increments than the time they have historically because they're looking for, I believe, first, stability in their business before they're going to let go. And then there's still some incremental risk in interest rates. We saw treasuries drop below prime for the first time in recent memory. And of course, we always use the higher rate to value our jackpot liabilities. And so, if agencies should compress, you still got probably 50 basis points of spread there between them. So those are kind of at the high end where the biggest risks are in terms of the magnitude."

But the non-box products revenue for the quarter was such a significant contributor for us, which has been an objective of IGT for some time, and we feel like we're accomplishing the objective of letting our Systems business play a more robust role. It's very high-margin business for us and it drives, overtime, boxes, but it is less predictable from a revenue-recognition prospective. So the two projects, large projects on some of the custom software deliverables to ARIA and then the Cosmo project, they're going to be tough for us to predict getting them in the quarter."

With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.Before we begin, we'd like",2860,"All right. Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IGT's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.
Before we begin, we'd like to remind listeners that our discussion reflects management's views based on marketplace environment as of today, July 27, 2010, includes forward-looking statements, including forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products, play levels for our installed base of reoccurring revenue gain, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
Our future financial condition, results of operations, as well as forward-looking statement are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. And you should not assume later in the quarter or the year that the comments we make today are still valid. The actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release, and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, Form 8-K dated June 3, 2010, applying the retrospective adoption of accounting standards and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, igt.com. You will find additional disclosure regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Turning now to our discussion about the business. This afternoon, IGT reported third quarter results for fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations totaled $95 million or $0.32 per diluted share versus the $62 million and $0.21 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items of $37 million or $0.12 per diluted share, offset by restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing costs of $4 million, collectively $0.01 per diluted share. The favorable discrete tax items recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily related to the IRS audit closure for the fiscal years 2002 through 2005, and these were partially offset by changes in our uncertain tax liabilities. The prior-year quarter included restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing charges of $6 million, collectively $0.02 per diluted share. 
Excluding the items mentioned above, third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $62 million or $0.21 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and $67 million or $0.23 per diluted share for fiscal 2009. A list of the items affecting comparability for all periods presented is included in a supplemental reconciliation of adjusted income from continuing operations in our earnings press release that went out this afternoon.
Third quarter net income, including discontinued operations related to the closure of our Japan operation, totaled $92 million or $0.31 per diluted share versus $61 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Our consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $490 million of which 56% was generated from gaming operations and the balance from product sales, compared to $517 million for the same quarter last year. Nine months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion on the same period last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter were $276 million and $120 million, respectively, and $844 million and $320 million, respectively for the nine months ended June 30, 2010.
At the beginning of fiscal 2010, we adopted accounting standards requiring retrospective application of prior periods associated with our convertible debt and the equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the back of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in reduced diluted EPS of $0.01 for the current quarter and $0.02 in the prior-year quarter.
Moving on to Gaming Operations. Revenue were $277 million in the current quarter, which was down 1% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58% for the quarter versus 62% in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased jackpots, hence resulting from interest rate changes. 
Interest rate change on jackpot liabilities increased jackpot expense by $6 million in this year's third quarter and decreased jackpot expense by $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Jackpot liabilities are recorded on the books at present value. Until a jackpot is paid out as a lump sum or annuity versus to fund the longer-term payment stream, changes in interest rates affect this present value calculation. For example, decrease in interest rates increase the present value of the jackpot liability, which increases the liability on the balance sheet and also increase the jackpot expense and Game Operations margin. The opposite effect occurs when there are increases in interest rates. We expect fourth quarter Game Ops gross margins to trend within a range of approximately 58% to 61%.
We earned an average of $51.68 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 1% sequentially and up from $51.47 in last year's quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter that revenue per unit per day is up on a sequential basis while not up a large amount it's starting to show some stability. 
We encouraged by the recent uptick as sign of innovation and a testament of the quality of our latest Game Ops games. This blended yield of $51.68 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse installed based comprised of our MegaJackpots, CDS Class II and lease ops units, all of which served distinct markets and have unique yield characteristics. 
Our Game Ops yields range from $10 to $15 per day on some of our lower yielding units and in international units to a more than $100 per day on some of our MegaJackpot units. During our fiscal third quarter, one additional property in Alabama ceased operations, or in the remaining non-Native American property opened, which has 1,800 IGT electronic charitable bingo terminals operable. We are currently recognizing revenue on a cash basis only due to the uncertainty in the market.
IGT's install base ended the third quarter at 58,900 units, up 100 units over the prior-sequential quarter and down 2,200 units compared to the prior-year quarter. North American decreases over the prior year largely attributable to regulatory issues in Alabama were partially offset by increases in international markets. Approximately 83% of our install base is comprised of variable fee games, which are on a percentage of a machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
Moving onto product sales. Product sales totaled $213 million for the quarter compared to $231 million in the prior year. Both, we shipped 9,000 machines during the quarter, down from prior year shipments of 12,600.
Non-machine revenues comprised of gaming system, game theme conversions, tables, parts, and intellectual property fees came in at $91 million for the quarter and accounted for 43% of total product sales for the quarter, compared to $81 million and 35% of total product sales in the prior-year quarter.
Product sales gross margins were 54% for the quarter, up 300 basis points in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and an increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release. Units shipped for the current periods reflect all units shipped to customers, which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent the units recognized in revenues under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
Now breaking down product sales domestic versus international. Domestic product sales revenue totaled $124 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared with $148 million and 6,700 units recognized in the prior-year quarter.
Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 3,200, up 900 units from the prior year and down 900 units sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower replacements in Canada, partially offset by  higher sales in Washington. Domestic new and expansion shipments totaled 900 units in the quarter, up 100 sequentially and down 3,600 from the prior-year quarter due to fewer new openings.
Respective adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, resulted in $8 million of consolidated revenues in the current quarter, which would have been recognized in different periods under the prior guidance.
Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $61 million in the quarter, up from $52 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the DynamiX promotional conversion and higher systems-related revenue. Domestic ASPs were 14,100 for the third quarter compared to 14,400 in the prior-year quarter. And domestic ARPU computed on equivalent-units-recognized basis was 27,600 for the third quarter compared to 22,100 in the prior year. ASP decline was due to the DynamiX promotion, which defers a portion of the sales price to the related conversion kits. When a customer takes delivery of these conversion kits, the associated revenue is recognized and shows up non-machine revenue. The ARPU increase was due to increased non-machine revenue. We shipped 2,200 MLD units or 55% of total North American shipments in the third quarter compared to 900 units or 13% of total North American shipments in the prior-year quarter. Sales and machines utilizing our AVP technology comprised 92% of total North American machines shipped during the third quarter, a trend we expect to continue as our legacy-for-sale products are phased out.
International product sales revenue totaled $89 million on volume of 5,400 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,500 units recognized from the prior-year quarter.  Our international markets benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange, as well as the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and improved sales in Mexico. International non-machine sales were $30 million in the third quarter, flat compared to the prior-year quarter. International ASP was 10,900 for the third quarter compared to 9,600 in the prior-year quarter. And international ARPU computed on an equivalent-units-recognized basis in the third quarter was 16,400, up 9% over the prior quarter.
Both international ASP and ARPU increases were primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange as well as better product and the geographic mix. Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 54%, up 300 basis points from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. We expect product sales margins in the fourth quarter to trend within a range of approximately 50% to 52% depending on product sales mix.
Now moving on to OpEx. Quarter operating expenses decreased 8% to $156 million compared to $169 million on the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the cost-reduction efforts and lower professional service fees.
We continue to move towards our goal of previously announced $200 million of annual cost savings when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel that we are well on track to achieve our cost-reduction goal as we exit this fiscal year.
Third quarter SG&A declined $13 million or 13% from the prior quarter to $82 million, primarily result of our continued cost-control efforts. Professional fees were also down due to debt refinancing costs of $1.8 million included in the prior quarter. We expect a quarterly SG&A run rate of $85 million to $90 million on the fourth quarter. Bad debt provisions totaled $1 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. R&D expense totaled $52 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. We expect the quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area. 
Depreciation and amortization within operating expenses totaled $19 million for the quarter, relatively flat to the prior-year quarter. Total depreciation and amortization, inclusive of that is included in cost of Game Ops, was $59 million for the quarter, down from $64 million in the prior year. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic MegaJackpot and CDS operations. We expect depreciation and amortization to be flat in the fourth quarter compared to this quarter.
Other income and expense in the third quarter was a net expense to $24 million compared to $26 million in the prior quarter. The decline was largely attributable to foreign currency gains and reduced interest expense on lower borrowings. Third quarter interest expense included debt refinancing charges of $4 million due to a $300 million reduction in the total size of our debt domestic credit facility in the current year and $4 million related to early breakage fees on our line of credit in the prior year.
Additional convertible debt amortization required under accounting guidance adopted retrospectively at the beginning of this fiscal year, increased interest expense by $7 million in the current quarter and $9 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, we expect incremental non-cash interest of approximately $30 million, $19 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share for this fiscal year and approximately $35 million and $22 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 as restated, including repurchased gains of $5 million.
Our tax rate was 2% in the third quarter versus 38% in the prior-year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter was impacted by the previously mentioned favorable discrete tax items related to the closure of IRS audits for the years 2002 through 2005, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax liabilities. The current quarter tax rate, excluding discrete items was approximately 39%.
Going forward, we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discrete items. However, we may experience volatility on our quarterly tax rate due to the impact of discrete items.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $252 million at June 30 compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.9 billion with $1.2 billion of available capacity on our $1.5 billion credit facility as of June 30. It's important to note that the adoption of new accounting rules for convertible debt mentioned earlier decreased our book debt by approximately $131 million at June 30 and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is the unamortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity.
For the purpose of bank covenants, we continue to use contractual debt obligations, which totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, a decrease of $242 million compared to September 30, 2009. Our bank leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.5x, a decrease of a half a turn, down from 3x at September 30, 2009. We issued $300 million of 5.5% notes due June 2020 during the quarter. The net proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our domestic credit facility, which currently has an outstanding balance of $270 million, a decrease of $400 million from prior-sequential quarter. In conjunction with this note offering, we reduced the total commitment on our domestic line of credit from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion.
Our 3 1/4% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the period ended June 30, 2010, because of conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
On the balance sheet, we made a lot of progress with our working capital ratios and conversion of working capital and the free cash flow. Working capital totaled $609 million at June 30 and at September 30, 2009, average days sales outstanding, excluding receivables from our notes and contracts and Japan operations, was 50 days, down from 58 days as of September 30, 2009. Inventory turns excluding Japan operations averaged 3.8x, up from 2.9x as of September 30, 2009.
For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $424 million in cash flow from operations compared to $354 million for the first nine months of last year. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement of working capital efficiencies such as reduced inventory balance, the lowest it's been in the 41 quarters. The nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $192 million in free cash flow compared to $75 million for the first nine months last year. All of this free cash flow was used to pay down debt.
Capital expenditures totaled $61 million for the quarter compared to $64 million in the prior-sequential quarter due to lower PP&E. CapEx is expected to trend in the quarterly range of $60 million to $65 million for the fourth quarter, although we continue to come in near the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx as part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts. 
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's third quarter. Thanks for your time and attention. I will now turn the call over to Patti for her comments."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal third quarter. Our customers continue to spend capital at a conservative pace in an uncertain economy, but we cannot avoid the impact of the economic conditions affecting our customers around the globe. We can focus our efforts on making IGT stronger and more nimble ahead of an improvement in the macro environment. We continue to focus on improving our balance sheet. As Pat mentioned, we recently refinanced $300 million of debt through the sale of 5 1/2% notes that are due in 2020. The rate is 200 basis points less than the notes we priced in June of 2009. Additionally, our contractual debt obligations declined by $100 million sequentially. Our focus on the generation of free cash flow remains our highest priority. We are aggressively managing our cost structure as evidenced by a decline in operating expense of 8% and a decline in SG&A of 13% over the prior-year quarter.
We are addressing the need for improved efficiency in the application of our research and development resources. We are unifying our platforms and processes across the studio structure, giving us increased leverage from our development tools. This standardization is allowing us to more rapidly gain productivity improvements and increase the quality of our game content.
In the Systems business, we are capitalizing on our investment in server-based gaming and the increased quality of Advantage by focusing more of our engineering efforts on applications and content. The number of server-based installations now numbers 14 with four pending installations and numerous others in various stages of contract negotiation. Our focus on open standards and technologies will allow us to rapidly add customer-centric functionality to our growing server-based customers set.
We have significantly reduced the complexity of our hardware platform and increased the standardization on the AVP platform on a global basis providing further economies of scale. We continue to deliver our latest innovative products to markets around the world. During the quarter, we announced the installation of our sbX Tier One in France, Finland and Italy, our M-P Roulette Evolution in Switzerland and an extension on our contract with the University of Iceland Lottery to provide MLD video slots and Casinolink, as well as the implementation of EasyPay.

I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products,",749,"Thank you, Patti. I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products, MegaJackpots for sale and systems; and also include North American sales, marketing services and soon, manufacturing operations and sales outside of North America. I'll continue to focus on building a market-driven organization with a customer-first perspective and improving the operational efficiency of the company.
Here are some highlights regarding the product performance for the quarter. In Gaming Operations, overall yields were $51.68, an improvement of 1% sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in play levels. Our stand-alone MegaJackpot yields improved 2% sequentially. Sex and the City, now with more than 1,300 units installed since its release, continues to perform and is earning up to $1,090 per day for some of our customers. Additionally, our latest generation of game titles, Amazing Race, Top Dollar and Super Nova Blast now have 790, 391 and 362 units deployed, respectively. As of June 30, our backlog for these four titles that I just mentioned stood at 1,202 games, and our total backlog for MegaJackpots stood at 3,397 games.
In our For Sale business, we have developed and released 104 game titles to the first three quarters of this year, compared to 56 titles during the same period in 2009. Some of the recently-released titles include the Cats MultiPLAY, Boozing [ph], the industry's first 3D video slot, Queen Isabella, Lion's Heart [ph] and Jumpin' Jungle. We expect to complete development of another 30 to 40 titles in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Our very successful DynamiX package, which bundled one new AVP slot machine with two 8960 conversion kits allow the customer to refresh three machines concurrently. The promotion ended on June 30. Under this customer-focused program, we sold 6,300 units.
Other highlights for the third quarter include: We're excited about the recently-announced agreement with Cosmopolitan to provide them with a multi-product and system solutions, including sbX, our server-based gaming solution, a majority of their games plus the entire suite of IGT Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature IGT's GSA compliant server-based network, which incorporates the award-winning, player-focused Service Window, sbX Floor Manager, Media Manager and access to IGT's game library. Our success with Cosmopolitan is a result of our efforts to leverage the value of our comprehensive product and systems portfolio of for sale games, MegaJackpot games and systems infrastructure and applications. 
Our account managers and strategic account managers are trained across the entire portfolio and they're supported by subject matter experts in the field. This allows us to have a more elevated discussion at a much more strategic level that includes different disciplines within our customers' organizations. The strategic approach, in place since September of last year, allows us to focus on specific areas of need for our customers while leveraging the breadth of our product portfolio.
During the third quarter, we announced several key Tier One successes including the installation at the Mohawk Casino in New York, Casino d'Evian in France, Casino Helsinki in Finland, Casino di Venezia in Italy. Additionally, we announced our first field trial location of sbX Floor Manager on a non-IGT system at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Our sbX Floor Manager provides The Orleans unlimited access to our expansive game library of nearly 300 game themes with new themes added each month. 
In North America as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with three sbX opportunities and 10 Tier One opportunities. Additionally, we are in varying contract stages with 10 Tier One international opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we'll close any of these opportunities.
In our Traditional Systems business, in the third quarter, we closed five new Advantage customers, of which three were replacements of our competitors' systems. And as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with seven new Advantage customers. Again, there is no guarantee we will close any of these opportunities. 
I'm excited to be IGT's new Chief Operating Officer and as we move forward, we will continue to focus on customer-centric orientation in game and system development while leveraging our operational resources in an effective and efficient manner. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti to speak about our broader corporate strategy and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Patti?"
281438,109022739,69796,"International Game Technology, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the s",906,"Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. 
First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the state's seven racetracks has been revived with the official withdrawal of the measure from the 2010 general election ballot. And last week, the Ohio Lottery Commission voted unanimously on three items that would withdraw old rules on VLT and install new rules and seek the court judgment affirming the Commission's authority to install slots at racetracks.
In Illinois, the implementation of the VLT program is proceeding with the awarding of the central monitoring system contract, the adoption of administrative rules and the licensing process has been initiated. The City of Chicago, which represents a potential market for up to 15,000 machines, is still waiting to pass the necessary city council resolution to opt-in to the program. Initial shipments for Illinois are projected for early calendar 2011.
In Massachusetts, both the State Senate and House have passed their own versions of the gaming bill. The bills are currently in a conference committee made up of members from both the House and Senate who are working towards a compromised measure. However, they're working against a July 31 deadline for their summer adjournment. The prospects for a gaming bill remains extremely high, and the governor continues to indicate his support. We are closely monitoring the legalization of gaming in both Kentucky and New Hampshire. 
In Canada, the VLT replacement process continues to move slowly, and we expect the majority of the games to come online in 2012. Of the 34,000 games in Canada, we estimate that approximately 20,000 to 25,000 could be replaced over the next two to three years.
In Italy, all 10 concessionaires have paid half of the license fee and therefore, all 55,000 license have been taken. The approval process has delayed the rollout and today, only Lottomatica has received approval and has opened their first site in Rome. We expect approval for one of our installations in September and to have machines operating in the first quarter of 2011 and approval for a subsequent shipment in early 2011.
In Brazil, the parliament did not vote for the new bingo legislation in advance of their leave due to their upcoming October election. Depending upon the outcome of the election, we could see the proposal resurface as early as next year. 
In Greece, we expect that within one month, a proposal for VLT legislation will be submitted and with the consultation process, EC and parliament approval, we expect final legislation by the end of 2010 with a potential operational date of late 2011. The market potential in Greece is approximately 50,000 VLTs, which will require an upfront license fee of eur 10,000 apiece to be paid in two installments. The expectation is that this market will be on a bit of a fast track due to the economic stress in the country.
In the quarter, we also made progress with pending litigation which never happens quickly or easily. Concerning the pending shareholder actions, the four initial shareholder derivative suits that were filed against the company in 2009 were recently dismissed with leave to amend from the Federal District court in Nevada. In another case, our motion for summary judgment was recently granted in a suit filed by a competitor in 2006, which alleged infringement of one of its game method patents.
We continue to build and strengthen our senior management team. Eric spoke about his new responsibilities as the Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Satchell, our Chief Technology Officer, has expanded his responsibilities to include the leadership of Research and Development. As our CTO and Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Chris will lead the company's effort to continue the development of groundbreaking and innovative products for the gaming industry. 
We announced in the quarter the retirement from IGT of Tony Ciorciari who is currently in charge of Global Operations; and Paulus Karskens, the President of our International Organization. Over the next six months, we will work with Tony and Paulus to transition their work to the capable organizations they'll leave behind. We also announced the appointment of Vince Sadusky, a seasoned media executive to our Board of Director. 
We remain laser focused on creating long-term value for all of our shareholders by continuing as a profitable company that generates significant cash flows. Our objective is to provide superior financial results through disciplined strategic actions. And I want to thank all of you for your continued support. 
As I mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the short-term pending activity of operators, but we will make strides within our company towards being as lean and mean as possible, heading into an inevitable and sustainable increase in customer spending levels. There are a few factors that might impact our fourth quarter results such as the continued lack of visibility around replacement demand, revenue recognition risks associated with a few significant transactions and the impact of interest rates on our Gaming Operations margin. 
As a result of all of these factors, our guidance for 2010 has moved to a range of $0.82 to $0.85 in earnings per diluted share. As always, our guidance excludes one-time items. Our guidance also assumes no dilution impact from our convertible notes. 
So with that, we'll open the call for questions."

I think two things primarily drove it, Joe. One were those free conversions that got allocated away from -- remember, the question last quarter on ASPs, the reason they were lower was because we had to allocate the fair value of the conversions that were given up. Now what you're seeing is customers starting to take delivery of those conversions, and so that deferred revenues are on back up. The balance sheet now probably continued for at least through Q4, I would assume. The other piece and they were about equal, I think, in weight, was improved largely Advantage system installations during the quarter and some application and bonuses and things we delivered. That's the one that could be a little bit more volatile quarter-to-quarter because of rev rec rules."

So what we thought would happen, happened, which is we stabilized the base of the 8,960 machines and we sold conversions into that market. And that was a significant difference in the product sales, and we're still waiting for the rest of those from the promotion to make their way through. So I think you will see it for a couple of more quarters. But it was a significant contributor in the quarter."

To the extent, they're in a destination location, they're waiting for occupancy rates to stabilize, to increase and then stabilize a bit and for a lot of the vulnerability to make its way out of their own business. Access to capital and the cost of their capital for some customers is an issue, for others, it's not. So I think it really depends on who the customer is, but I would say generally, they're waiting for the malaise to lift in the travel and leisure industry, in general, before they really are comfortable spending ahead of the cycle. Because right now, they all feel like they would be spending ahead of the cycle. So that's kind of my view from my conversations with them. Eric, I would ask you to add your thoughts."

And then there's still new type to ARIA that is contemplated in the quarter, but is predicated on delivery of some additional software, which will be tight to get in by the end of the quarter. And then I think the risk is just the continued lack of visibility around replacements. Then follow up to Patti and Eric's comments about -- our customers have clearly shown over the last couple of years, that they're managing their capital budgets over much shorter increments than the time they have historically because they're looking for, I believe, first, stability in their business before they're going to let go. And then there's still some incremental risk in interest rates. We saw treasuries drop below prime for the first time in recent memory. And of course, we always use the higher rate to value our jackpot liabilities. And so, if agencies should compress, you still got probably 50 basis points of spread there between them. So those are kind of at the high end where the biggest risks are in terms of the magnitude."

But the non-box products revenue for the quarter was such a significant contributor for us, which has been an objective of IGT for some time, and we feel like we're accomplishing the objective of letting our Systems business play a more robust role. It's very high-margin business for us and it drives, overtime, boxes, but it is less predictable from a revenue-recognition prospective. So the two projects, large projects on some of the custom software deliverables to ARIA and then the Cosmo project, they're going to be tough for us to predict getting them in the quarter."

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IGT's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer. Before we begin, we'd li",2860," All right. Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IGT's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Patti Hart, our CEO and President; and Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer.
 Before we begin, we'd like to remind listeners that our discussion reflects management's views based on marketplace environment as of today, July 27, 2010, includes forward-looking statements, including forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new markets for our products, play levels for our installed base of reoccurring revenue gain, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
 Our future financial condition, results of operations, as well as forward-looking statement are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. And you should not assume later in the quarter or the year that the comments we make today are still valid. The actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release, and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, Form 8-K dated June 3, 2010, applying the retrospective adoption of accounting standards and our reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
 During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, igt.com. You will find additional disclosure regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 Turning now to our discussion about the business. This afternoon, IGT reported third quarter results for fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations totaled $95 million or $0.32 per diluted share versus the $62 million and $0.21 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items of $37 million or $0.12 per diluted share, offset by restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing costs of $4 million, collectively $0.01 per diluted share. The favorable discrete tax items recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily related to the IRS audit closure for the fiscal years 2002 through 2005, and these were partially offset by changes in our uncertain tax liabilities. The prior-year quarter included restructuring charges of $3 million and debt refinancing charges of $6 million, collectively $0.02 per diluted share.
 Excluding the items mentioned above, third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $62 million or $0.21 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 and $67 million or $0.23 per diluted share for fiscal 2009. A list of the items affecting comparability for all periods presented is included in a supplemental reconciliation of adjusted income from continuing operations in our earnings press release that went out this afternoon.
 Third quarter net income, including discontinued operations related to the closure of our Japan operation, totaled $92 million or $0.31 per diluted share versus $61 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
 Our consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $490 million of which 56% was generated from gaming operations and the balance from product sales, compared to $517 million for the same quarter last year. Nine months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion on the same period last year. Consolidated gross profit and operating income for the quarter were $276 million and $120 million, respectively, and $844 million and $320 million, respectively for the nine months ended June 30, 2010.
 At the beginning of fiscal 2010, we adopted accounting standards requiring retrospective application of prior periods associated with our convertible debt and the equity classification of non-controlling interest. The retrospective adjustments are outlined in the supplemental schedule at the back of our press release. The new accounting standards for convertible debt resulted in reduced diluted EPS of $0.01 for the current quarter and $0.02 in the prior-year quarter.
 Moving on to Gaming Operations. Revenue were $277 million in the current quarter, which was down 1% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58% for the quarter versus 62% in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased jackpots, hence resulting from interest rate changes.
 Interest rate change on jackpot liabilities increased jackpot expense by $6 million in this year's third quarter and decreased jackpot expense by $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Jackpot liabilities are recorded on the books at present value. Until a jackpot is paid out as a lump sum or annuity versus to fund the longer-term payment stream, changes in interest rates affect this present value calculation. For example, decrease in interest rates increase the present value of the jackpot liability, which increases the liability on the balance sheet and also increase the jackpot expense and Game Operations margin. The opposite effect occurs when there are increases in interest rates. We expect fourth quarter Game Ops gross margins to trend within a range of approximately 58% to 61%.
 We earned an average of $51.68 in revenue per unit per day, which is up 1% sequentially and up from $51.47 in last year's quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter that revenue per unit per day is up on a sequential basis while not up a large amount it's starting to show some stability.
 We encouraged by the recent uptick as sign of innovation and a testament of the quality of our latest Game Ops games. This blended yield of $51.68 is an average of the various components of our broad and diverse installed based comprised of our MegaJackpots, CDS Class II and lease ops units, all of which served distinct markets and have unique yield characteristics.
 Our Game Ops yields range from $10 to $15 per day on some of our lower yielding units and in international units to a more than $100 per day on some of our MegaJackpot units. During our fiscal third quarter, one additional property in Alabama ceased operations, or in the remaining non-Native American property opened, which has 1,800 IGT electronic charitable bingo terminals operable. We are currently recognizing revenue on a cash basis only due to the uncertainty in the market.
 IGT's install base ended the third quarter at 58,900 units, up 100 units over the prior-sequential quarter and down 2,200 units compared to the prior-year quarter. North American decreases over the prior year largely attributable to regulatory issues in Alabama were partially offset by increases in international markets. Approximately 83% of our install base is comprised of variable fee games, which are on a percentage of a machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
 Moving onto product sales. Product sales totaled $213 million for the quarter compared to $231 million in the prior year. Both, we shipped 9,000 machines during the quarter, down from prior year shipments of 12,600.
 Non-machine revenues comprised of gaming system, game theme conversions, tables, parts, and intellectual property fees came in at $91 million for the quarter and accounted for 43% of total product sales for the quarter, compared to $81 million and 35% of total product sales in the prior-year quarter.
 Product sales gross margins were 54% for the quarter, up 300 basis points in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and an increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. For a reconciliation of units shipped to equivalent units recognized, please see our earnings release. Units shipped for the current periods reflect all units shipped to customers, which include units for which revenues have been deferred. Equivalent units recognized represent the units recognized in revenues under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
 Now breaking down product sales domestic versus international. Domestic product sales revenue totaled $124 million on volume of 4,500 units recognized for the current quarter compared with $148 million and 6,700 units recognized in the prior-year quarter.
 Domestic replacement units shipped totaled 3,200, up 900 units from the prior year and down 900 units sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower replacements in Canada, partially offset by  higher sales in Washington. Domestic new and expansion shipments totaled 900 units in the quarter, up 100 sequentially and down 3,600 from the prior-year quarter due to fewer new openings.
 Respective adoption of revenue recognition accounting standards related to certain software-enabled products and multi-element arrangements as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, resulted in $8 million of consolidated revenues in the current quarter, which would have been recognized in different periods under the prior guidance.
 Domestic non-machine revenue totaled $61 million in the quarter, up from $52 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the DynamiX promotional conversion and higher systems-related revenue. Domestic ASPs were 14,100 for the third quarter compared to 14,400 in the prior-year quarter. And domestic ARPU computed on equivalent-units-recognized basis was 27,600 for the third quarter compared to 22,100 in the prior year. ASP decline was due to the DynamiX promotion, which defers a portion of the sales price to the related conversion kits. When a customer takes delivery of these conversion kits, the associated revenue is recognized and shows up non-machine revenue. The ARPU increase was due to increased non-machine revenue. We shipped 2,200 MLD units or 55% of total North American shipments in the third quarter compared to 900 units or 13% of total North American shipments in the prior-year quarter. Sales and machines utilizing our AVP technology comprised 92% of total North American machines shipped during the third quarter, a trend we expect to continue as our legacy-for-sale products are phased out.
 International product sales revenue totaled $89 million on volume of 5,400 units recognized for the current quarter compared to $83 million and 5,500 units recognized from the prior-year quarter.  Our international markets benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange, as well as the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and improved sales in Mexico. International non-machine sales were $30 million in the third quarter, flat compared to the prior-year quarter. International ASP was 10,900 for the third quarter compared to 9,600 in the prior-year quarter. And international ARPU computed on an equivalent-units-recognized basis in the third quarter was 16,400, up 9% over the prior quarter.
 Both international ASP and ARPU increases were primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange as well as better product and the geographic mix. Total product sales gross margins for the quarter were 54%, up 300 basis points from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to reduced material cost and increased mix of higher margin non-machine products. We expect product sales margins in the fourth quarter to trend within a range of approximately 50% to 52% depending on product sales mix.
 Now moving on to OpEx. Quarter operating expenses decreased 8% to $156 million compared to $169 million on the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the cost-reduction efforts and lower professional service fees.
 We continue to move towards our goal of previously announced $200 million of annual cost savings when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We feel that we are well on track to achieve our cost-reduction goal as we exit this fiscal year.
 Third quarter SG&A declined $13 million or 13% from the prior quarter to $82 million, primarily result of our continued cost-control efforts. Professional fees were also down due to debt refinancing costs of $1.8 million included in the prior quarter. We expect a quarterly SG&A run rate of $85 million to $90 million on the fourth quarter. Bad debt provisions totaled $1 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. R&D expense totaled $52 million for the quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter. We expect the quarterly R&D run rate in the low $50 million area.
 Depreciation and amortization within operating expenses totaled $19 million for the quarter, relatively flat to the prior-year quarter. Total depreciation and amortization, inclusive of that is included in cost of Game Ops, was $59 million for the quarter, down from $64 million in the prior year. The decline in total depreciation and amortization was primarily due to lower depreciation in our domestic MegaJackpot and CDS operations. We expect depreciation and amortization to be flat in the fourth quarter compared to this quarter.
 Other income and expense in the third quarter was a net expense to $24 million compared to $26 million in the prior quarter. The decline was largely attributable to foreign currency gains and reduced interest expense on lower borrowings. Third quarter interest expense included debt refinancing charges of $4 million due to a $300 million reduction in the total size of our debt domestic credit facility in the current year and $4 million related to early breakage fees on our line of credit in the prior year.
 Additional convertible debt amortization required under accounting guidance adopted retrospectively at the beginning of this fiscal year, increased interest expense by $7 million in the current quarter and $9 million in the prior-year quarter. For the full year, we expect incremental non-cash interest of approximately $30 million, $19 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share for this fiscal year and approximately $35 million and $22 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 as restated, including repurchased gains of $5 million.
 Our tax rate was 2% in the third quarter versus 38% in the prior-year quarter. The tax rate during the quarter was impacted by the previously mentioned favorable discrete tax items related to the closure of IRS audits for the years 2002 through 2005, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax liabilities. The current quarter tax rate, excluding discrete items was approximately 39%.
 Going forward, we expect our quarterly tax rate to trend at approximately 37% to 39% before discrete items. However, we may experience volatility on our quarterly tax rate due to the impact of discrete items.
 Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $252 million at June 30 compared to $247 million at September 30, 2009. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.9 billion with $1.2 billion of available capacity on our $1.5 billion credit facility as of June 30. It's important to note that the adoption of new accounting rules for convertible debt mentioned earlier decreased our book debt by approximately $131 million at June 30 and $155 million at September 30, 2009. This amount is the unamortized discount related to the implied value of the equity options in our converts, which was recorded in equity.
 For the purpose of bank covenants, we continue to use contractual debt obligations, which totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, a decrease of $242 million compared to September 30, 2009. Our bank leverage ratio at June 30 was 2.5x, a decrease of a half a turn, down from 3x at September 30, 2009. We issued $300 million of 5.5% notes due June 2020 during the quarter. The net proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our domestic credit facility, which currently has an outstanding balance of $270 million, a decrease of $400 million from prior-sequential quarter. In conjunction with this note offering, we reduced the total commitment on our domestic line of credit from $1.8 billion to $1.5 billion.
 Our 3 1/4% convertible notes and warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding for the period ended June 30, 2010, because of conversion price and the exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock.
 On the balance sheet, we made a lot of progress with our working capital ratios and conversion of working capital and the free cash flow. Working capital totaled $609 million at June 30 and at September 30, 2009, average days sales outstanding, excluding receivables from our notes and contracts and Japan operations, was 50 days, down from 58 days as of September 30, 2009. Inventory turns excluding Japan operations averaged 3.8x, up from 2.9x as of September 30, 2009.
 For the nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $424 million in cash flow from operations compared to $354 million for the first nine months of last year. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement of working capital efficiencies such as reduced inventory balance, the lowest it's been in the 41 quarters. The nine months ended June 30, 2010, IGT generated $192 million in free cash flow compared to $75 million for the first nine months last year. All of this free cash flow was used to pay down debt.
 Capital expenditures totaled $61 million for the quarter compared to $64 million in the prior-sequential quarter due to lower PP&E. CapEx is expected to trend in the quarterly range of $60 million to $65 million for the fourth quarter, although we continue to come in near the lower end of the range as we more proactively manage our CapEx as part of our efficiency and cost reduction efforts.
 That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's third quarter. Thanks for your time and attention. I will now turn the call over to Patti for her comments.

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us as we discuss our fiscal third quarter. Our customers continue to spend capital at a conservative pace in an uncertain economy, but we cannot avoid the impact of the economic conditions affecting our customers around the globe. We can focus our efforts on making IGT stronger and more nimble ahead of an improvement in the macro environment. We continue to focus on improving our balance sheet. As Pat mentioned, we recently refinanced $300 million of debt through the sale of 5 1/2% notes that are due in 2020. The rate is 200 basis points less than the notes we priced in June of 2009. Additionally, our contractual debt obligations declined by $100 million sequentially. Our focus on the generation of free cash flow remains our highest priority. We are aggressively managing our cost structure as evidenced by a decline in operating expense of 8% and a decline in SG&A of 13% over the prior-year quarter.
 We are addressing the need for improved efficiency in the application of our research and development resources. We are unifying our platforms and processes across the studio structure, giving us increased leverage from our development tools. This standardization is allowing us to more rapidly gain productivity improvements and increase the quality of our game content.
 In the Systems business, we are capitalizing on our investment in server-based gaming and the increased quality of Advantage by focusing more of our engineering efforts on applications and content. The number of server-based installations now numbers 14 with four pending installations and numerous others in various stages of contract negotiation. Our focus on open standards and technologies will allow us to rapidly add customer-centric functionality to our growing server-based customers set.
 We have significantly reduced the complexity of our hardware platform and increased the standardization on the AVP platform on a global basis providing further economies of scale. We continue to deliver our latest innovative products to markets around the world. During the quarter, we announced the installation of our sbX Tier One in France, Finland and Italy, our M-P Roulette Evolution in Switzerland and an extension on our contract with the University of Iceland Lottery to provide MLD video slots and Casinolink, as well as the implementation of EasyPay. Our WagerWorks online and mobile subsidiary was officially crowned Slot Provider of the Year at the inaugural EGR b2b Supplier Awards in London.

I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products,",749," Thank you, Patti. I'm pleased to talk about this quarter's activity in both games and systems. But first, I wanted to comment on my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. In my new role, my responsibilities include: All our land-based products, MegaJackpots for sale and systems; and also include North American sales, marketing services and soon, manufacturing operations and sales outside of North America. I'll continue to focus on building a market-driven organization with a customer-first perspective and improving the operational efficiency of the company.
 Here are some highlights regarding the product performance for the quarter. In Gaming Operations, overall yields were $51.68, an improvement of 1% sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in play levels. Our stand-alone MegaJackpot yields improved 2% sequentially. Sex and the City, now with more than 1,300 units installed since its release, continues to perform and is earning up to $1,090 per day for some of our customers. Additionally, our latest generation of game titles, Amazing Race, Top Dollar and Super Nova Blast now have 790, 391 and 362 units deployed, respectively. As of June 30, our backlog for these four titles that I just mentioned stood at 1,202 games, and our total backlog for MegaJackpots stood at 3,397 games.
 In our For Sale business, we have developed and released 104 game titles to the first three quarters of this year, compared to 56 titles during the same period in 2009. Some of the recently-released titles include the Cats MultiPLAY, Boozing [ph], the industry's first 3D video slot, Queen Isabella, Lion's Heart [ph] and Jumpin' Jungle. We expect to complete development of another 30 to 40 titles in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Our very successful DynamiX package, which bundled one new AVP slot machine with two 8960 conversion kits allow the customer to refresh three machines concurrently. The promotion ended on June 30. Under this customer-focused program, we sold 6,300 units.
 Other highlights for the third quarter include: We're excited about the recently-announced agreement with Cosmopolitan to provide them with a multi-product and system solutions, including sbX, our server-based gaming solution, a majority of their games plus the entire suite of IGT Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature IGT's GSA compliant server-based network, which incorporates the award-winning, player-focused Service Window, sbX Floor Manager, Media Manager and access to IGT's game library. Our success with Cosmopolitan is a result of our efforts to leverage the value of our comprehensive product and systems portfolio of for sale games, MegaJackpot games and systems infrastructure and applications.
 Our account managers and strategic account managers are trained across the entire portfolio and they're supported by subject matter experts in the field. This allows us to have a more elevated discussion at a much more strategic level that includes different disciplines within our customers' organizations. The strategic approach, in place since September of last year, allows us to focus on specific areas of need for our customers while leveraging the breadth of our product portfolio.
 During the third quarter, we announced several key Tier One successes including the installation at the Mohawk Casino in New York, Casino d'Evian in France, Casino Helsinki in Finland, Casino di Venezia in Italy. Additionally, we announced our first field trial location of sbX Floor Manager on a non-IGT system at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Our sbX Floor Manager provides The Orleans unlimited access to our expansive game library of nearly 300 game themes with new themes added each month.
 In North America as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with three sbX opportunities and 10 Tier One opportunities. Additionally, we are in varying contract stages with 10 Tier One international opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities, and there's no guarantee that we'll close any of these opportunities.
 In our Traditional Systems business, in the third quarter, we closed five new Advantage customers, of which three were replacements of our competitors' systems. And as of June 30, we are in varying contract stages with seven new Advantage customers. Again, there is no guarantee we will close any of these opportunities.
 I'm excited to be IGT's new Chief Operating Officer and as we move forward, we will continue to focus on customer-centric orientation in game and system development while leveraging our operational resources in an effective and efficient manner.
 With that, I'll turn it back to Patti to speak about our broader corporate strategy and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Patti?

281438,109022739,71305,"International Game Technology, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives"," Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views. First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the",906," Thanks very much, Eric. We are encouraged by the activity to expand gaming, both domestically and internationally, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes just giving you an update on our views.
 First, in Ohio, the previously delayed VLT program for the state's seven racetracks has been revived with the official withdrawal of the measure from the 2010 general election ballot. And last week, the Ohio Lottery Commission voted unanimously on three items that would withdraw old rules on VLT and install new rules and seek the court judgment affirming the Commission's authority to install slots at racetracks.
 In Illinois, the implementation of the VLT program is proceeding with the awarding of the central monitoring system contract, the adoption of administrative rules and the licensing process has been initiated. The City of Chicago, which represents a potential market for up to 15,000 machines, is still waiting to pass the necessary city council resolution to opt-in to the program. Initial shipments for Illinois are projected for early calendar 2011.
 In Massachusetts, both the State Senate and House have passed their own versions of the gaming bill. The bills are currently in a conference committee made up of members from both the House and Senate who are working towards a compromised measure. However, they're working against a July 31 deadline for their summer adjournment. The prospects for a gaming bill remains extremely high, and the governor continues to indicate his support. We are closely monitoring the legalization of gaming in both Kentucky and New Hampshire.
 In Canada, the VLT replacement process continues to move slowly, and we expect the majority of the games to come online in 2012. Of the 34,000 games in Canada, we estimate that approximately 20,000 to 25,000 could be replaced over the next two to three years.
 In Italy, all 10 concessionaires have paid half of the license fee and therefore, all 55,000 license have been taken. The approval process has delayed the rollout and today, only Lottomatica has received approval and has opened their first site in Rome. We expect approval for one of our installations in September and to have machines operating in the first quarter of 2011 and approval for a subsequent shipment in early 2011.
 In Brazil, the parliament did not vote for the new bingo legislation in advance of their leave due to their upcoming October election. Depending upon the outcome of the election, we could see the proposal resurface as early as next year.
 In Greece, we expect that within one month, a proposal for VLT legislation will be submitted and with the consultation process, EC and parliament approval, we expect final legislation by the end of 2010 with a potential operational date of late 2011. The market potential in Greece is approximately 50,000 VLTs, which will require an upfront license fee of eur 10,000 apiece to be paid in two installments. The expectation is that this market will be on a bit of a fast track due to the economic stress in the country.
 In the quarter, we also made progress with pending litigation which never happens quickly or easily. Concerning the pending shareholder actions, the four initial shareholder derivative suits that were filed against the company in 2009 were recently dismissed with leave to amend from the Federal District court in Nevada. In another case, our motion for summary judgment was recently granted in a suit filed by a competitor in 2006, which alleged infringement of one of its game method patents.
 We continue to build and strengthen our senior management team. Eric spoke about his new responsibilities as the Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Satchell, our Chief Technology Officer, has expanded his responsibilities to include the leadership of Research and Development. As our CTO and Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Chris will lead the company's effort to continue the development of groundbreaking and innovative products for the gaming industry.
 We announced in the quarter the retirement from IGT of Tony Ciorciari who is currently in charge of Global Operations; and Paulus Karskens, the President of our International Organization. Over the next six months, we will work with Tony and Paulus to transition their work to the capable organizations they'll leave behind. We also announced the appointment of Vince Sadusky, a seasoned media executive to our Board of Director.
 We remain laser focused on creating long-term value for all of our shareholders by continuing as a profitable company that generates significant cash flows. Our objective is to provide superior financial results through disciplined strategic actions. And I want to thank all of you for your continued support.
 As I mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the short-term pending activity of operators, but we will make strides within our company towards being as lean and mean as possible, heading into an inevitable and sustainable increase in customer spending levels. There are a few factors that might impact our fourth quarter results such as the continued lack of visibility around replacement demand, revenue recognition risks associated with a few significant transactions and the impact of interest rates on our Gaming Operations margin.
 As a result of all of these factors, our guidance for 2010 has moved to a range of $0.82 to $0.85 in earnings per diluted share. As always, our guidance excludes one-time items. Our guidance also assumes no dilution impact from our convertible notes.
 So with that, we'll open the call for questions.

I think two things primarily drove it, Joe. One were those free conversions that got allocated away from -- remember, the question last quarter on ASPs, the reason they were lower was because we had to allocate the fair value of the conversions that were given up. Now what you're seeing is customers starting to take delivery of those conversions, and so that deferred revenues are on back up. The balance sheet now probably continued for at least through Q4, I would assume. The other piece and they were about equal, I think, in weight, was improved largely Advantage system installations during the quarter and some application and bonuses and things we delivered. That's the one that could be a little bit more volatile quarter-to-quarter because of rev rec rules.

I would just add to that, Joe. I just think that what we expected to happen when we rolled out the DynamiX program is exactly what happened, which is we had about, sequentially 1,000-unit increase in conversions this quarter from the previous quarter. So what we thought would happen, happened, which is we stabilized the base of the 8,960 machines and we sold conversions into that market. And that was a significant difference in the product sales, and we're still waiting for the rest of those from the promotion to make their way through. So I think you will see it for a couple of more quarters. But it was a significant contributor in the quarter.

But I think it's a little bit of everything, and I think it depends on who it is. In some cases, they are waiting for their own financial performance to make its way up. To the extent, they're in a destination location, they're waiting for occupancy rates to stabilize, to increase and then stabilize a bit and for a lot of the vulnerability to make its way out of their own business. Access to capital and the cost of their capital for some customers is an issue, for others, it's not. So I think it really depends on who the customer is, but I would say generally, they're waiting for the malaise to lift in the travel and leisure industry, in general, before they really are comfortable spending ahead of the cycle. Because right now, they all feel like they would be spending ahead of the cycle. So that's kind of my view from my conversations with them. Eric, I would ask you to add your thoughts.

Probably the things -- well, in the new area, you've got Cosmopolitan, obviously, which there's a lot of risk around whether or not that revenue could be realized in Q4 just given the timing of when that property opens, and the revenue recognition given that we're spying both the system and the boxes. And then there's still new type to ARIA that is contemplated in the quarter, but is predicated on delivery of some additional software, which will be tight to get in by the end of the quarter. And then I think the risk is just the continued lack of visibility around replacements. Then follow up to Patti and Eric's comments about -- our customers have clearly shown over the last couple of years, that they're managing their capital budgets over much shorter increments than the time they have historically because they're looking for, I believe, first, stability in their business before they're going to let go. And then there's still some incremental risk in interest rates. We saw treasuries drop below prime for the first time in recent memory. And of course, we always use the higher rate to value our jackpot liabilities. And so, if agencies should compress, you still got probably 50 basis points of spread there between them. So those are kind of at the high end where the biggest risks are in terms of the magnitude.

But the non-box products revenue for the quarter was such a significant contributor for us, which has been an objective of IGT for some time, and we feel like we're accomplishing the objective of letting our Systems business play a more robust role. It's very high-margin business for us and it drives, overtime, boxes, but it is less predictable from a revenue-recognition prospective. So the two projects, large projects on some of the custom software deliverables to ARIA and then the Cosmo project, they're going to be tough for us to predict getting them in the quarter.

Before beginning, we’d like to remind listeners our discussion reflects management’s views based on the business environment as of today, November 9, 2010, and will include forward-looking statements, including forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determined or the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new jurisdictions for our products, play levels for our installed base of recurring revenue games, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Actual results may differ materially.
Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In our press release which is posted on our website, www.igt.com, you will find additional disclosures regarding any non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
With that in mind, I’ll turn the call over to Patti.

In fiscal year 2010 we continued to have relatively strong financial performance in an economy that remains weakened. More importantly, we set the company on a course to achieve greater financial and operational performance in the future. Our 2010 financial achievements include growing our international revenues by 21% to $559 million, increasing our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis to 25%, and reducing our debt obligations by over $400 million.
Despite the challenging macro environment, our revenues were nearly $2 billion and we produced over $770 million of adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our significant cash flow generation capabilities. We also improved our leverage ratio, increased our inventory turns and accomplished all of this with much lower overhead. We are intent on driving higher returns for our stakeholders. Meanwhile, many of our customers are improving their financial position which gives them the opportunity to increase investment in their slot floors. This is a very important step in getting our industry back on a growth track.
The bottom line results of these achievements are adjusted EPS of 85 cents for the year, at the upper end of our latest guidance. It also represents my team’s intent focus on making IGT the leanest, most competitive organization that it can be. As I have said before, driving constant improvement at IGT is a short, medium and long-term theme for me and my management team. I am proud of our 2010 financial results and our company’s focus on making the coming quarters and years even better.
Personally I have been spending a lot of time with our customers both domestically and internationally. These meetings solidify my faith that IGT is an industry leader and that we are doing the right things. That said, I’m still cautiously optimistic about the coming year. While it appears that the visitation numbers are stabilizing, it is still too early to call the bottom. We need to see a marked improvement in the economy in the form of more jobs, higher consumer confidence and disposable income before we can expect to see a return to healthy top line growth in our industry. Internationally we are enthusiastic about our growing business and the potential we see in new jurisdictions.
Finally, 2010 essentially completed my transition into the CEO role at IGT. And my leadership team is fully embedded into the business. Our long-term global strategies are now in place and every employee has a clear understanding of our goals. Fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be a rewarding year as we start seeing the results of our well-planned strategy.
I will now ask Pat to share with you some of the financial details for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Pat?

This afternoon IGT reported its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2010, GAAP net income and continuing ops came in for the fourth quarter at $26 million or 9 cents per share, inclusive of non-cash charges of $27 million after tax or 9 cents per share. This compares to a net loss of $10 million or 4 cents a share in the previous fourth quarter, last year’s fourth quarter.
For the year, GAAP net income from continuing ops was $224 million or 75 cents per share compared to $153 million or 52 cents per share last year, an increase of over 40%. Both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year were affected by a number of non-cash items, the details of which are broken out in our earnings release which went out earlier today.
Our adjusted EPS was 85 cents for the year and 18 cents for the fourth quarter, both near the top end of our previous guidance. We are particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin that came in at 25% this year versus 23% last year, perhaps one of the best in the supplier space [ph].
Our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were $496 million, of which 54% were generated from our gaming ops business and the remainder from product sales. For the year, our revenues were $2, 55% from game ops and the rest from product sales. Consolidated gross profit increased 100 basis points to 56% and totaled $1.1 billion for the year.
Our gaming operations continued to feel the impact of challenging economic conditions, although we are encouraged by continued stabilization in yields. Game ops revenues were $268 million in the fourth quarter, which is down 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
Gross margins decreased 200 basis points to 58% for the quarter, primarily due to fixed cost spread over a smaller installed base. We earned an average of $50.86 per unit per day, which is up slightly compared to last year’s fourth quarter. This blended yield is an average of the various components of our broad and global installed base, our game ops yields range, $10 to $15 per day on some of the lower-yielding markets such as we’re seeing in those in some of our international markets, to more than $100 today in some of our major jackpot units. On an important side note, our international installed base is now at 16,000 machines. If looked at on a standalone basis, this would make it the third largest installed base in the industry.
For the year, gaming operations revenues were $1.1 billion compared to prior year revenues of $1.2 billion, and gross margins increased 200 basis points to 60% compared to 58% in prior year. IGT’s installed base ended the fourth quarter 57,000 units, down 4,300 units over the prior year largely attributable to the closure of certain charitable bingo facilities in Alabama. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that are in a percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fee.
Moving on to product sales, product sales revenues totaled $228 million in the fourth quarter compared to $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For FY10, product sales revenues were $886 million compared to $925 million in the prior year. Both periods were affected by fewer new openings in North America.
For widely [ph] recognized and shipped 11,000 machines during the quarter, down from prior year of 11,300. In this fiscal year, IGT recognized 42,200 machines, down from 49,700 machines last year. For units shipped but not yet recognized, please see the supporting data at the back of the press release.
International product sales revenue totaled $116 million for the quarter on volume of 7,700 units compared to $102 million and 7,100 units in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, international product sales revenue was $391 million, up from $307 million in the prior year, while units recognized for the year were 24,600, up from 23,900 in the previous year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in shipments into higher revenue jurisdictions and some to favorable foreign currency exchange.
Worldwide non-machine revenues mainly from sales of systems convergence and electric property fees came in at $89 million for the quarter or 39% of total product sales compared to $98 million and 43% of product sales in the prior year quarter. For the year, non-machine revenues were $329 million or 37% of total product sales, down from $346 million and 37% of product sales in the previous year.
Product sales gross margins were 53% for the quarter, up 100 basis points for the quarter, and were 52% for the year, again up 100 basis points from the previous fiscal year. Domestic new and expansion unit shipped but not recognized totaled 1,700 in the quarter, up 800 sequentially due to shipments related to Cosmopolitan and First Council in Oklahoma and the opening of Sugarhouse.
Moving on to operating expenses and others, fourth quarter operating expense decreased to $174 million or 35% of revenue compared to $257 million or 50% of revenues in the prior year quarter. For the full year, operating expenses decreased to $687 million or 35% of revenue compared to $810 million or 39% of revenue in fiscal 2009.
Quarterly adjusted operating expenses decreased slightly to $164 million in prior year quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating expenses decreased 7% to $615 million or 31% of revenues. Adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses as reconciled in the supplemental schedule at the end of our press release exclude non-cash impairment and losses on other assets, restructuring and debt refinancing costs and bad debt provisions.
Moving in to 2011, we may see SG&A stay about flat on a total dollar basis when compared to the full year 2010 as we invest in the people and processes necessary to take advantage of the expected industry turnaround and new business opportunities. SG&A for the fourth quarter was up sequentially but down year-on-year as we recognized certain yearend items and ramped up for this year’s G2E and a large amount of new products that we’ll be showing.
R&D expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, an increase of $1 million from the prior year. For the year, our investment in R&D was $200 million, down 2% over 2009. We expect R&D to be about flat to up slightly for fiscal 2011.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash equivalents and short-term investments inclusive of restricted amounts totaled $249 million at September 30, 2010 compared to $247 million at the end of last year.
Contractual debt obligations $1.8 billion at September 30 this year compared to $2.2 billion last year. The available capacity on our $1.5 billion revolver totaled $1.4 billion. As of the end of this year, during this year we’ve reduced our debt obligations by over $400 million and improved our leverage ratio significantly. We went from 3.3 times levered at the end of last year to 2.4 as we exited this fiscal year.
For the year we generated $280 million in free cash flow, up from $169 million last year. We also increased our return on invested capital and anticipate further improvement as we move forward.
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT’s quarter and fiscal year. Thanks for your time and attention. I’ll turn it back to Patti.

We will continue to strive to improve our financial performance and leverage our industry-leading free cash flow. In the coming year, we will, however, also increase our focus on many important areas.
First, we will plan to further reduce our reliance on the North American replacement cycle by taking advantage of our diverse global revenue sources. We expect to begin to see improvement in our gaming operations yield. We believe we have the most exciting titles both on the floor and in our pipeline and I cannot wait for the world to see some of the best games IGT has ever introduced at G2E this year. We are planning for increased adoption of our improved systems products and heightened returns on our vast intellectual property portfolio.
Next, we will continue to expand our far-reaching international presence through both jurisdictional expansion and market share growth. We will maintain our urgency as it relates to returns on our international invested capital. In the last three years our international revenues excluding Japan’s discontinued operations have increased from 20% of total revenues to 28% this year.
Third, we will continue to find ways to drive our improving profitability and margins even higher. We carefully monitor every dollar we spend and are continuously looking for ways to minimize SG&A. Our research and development budget is as focused as ever before. We will develop gains our customers are demanding and products they value.
Finally, we are planning to accelerate our growth in the online and mobile business. We have attracted some of the best talent available to prepare us for broader participation in the interactive gaming space. We believe that it is inevitable that gaming will become widespread in the developed nations of the world in land-based, online and mobile applications. We will strive to be the leader in this fast-growing business and to help our customers thrive in the new digital arena.
Again, fiscal 2011 will be an exciting year for IGT. Much of the change in planning is behind us. Now it is time for all of us to benefit from the returns on our focused activities.
Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer, will now take you through a few of the specifics and how we plan to achieve these goals. Eric?

We have in place a specific plan and measurement points to meet and exceed our 2011 strategy that Patti has outlined. Let me share with you some of the specifics.
First, we expect to see improved financial results from our MegaJackpots business through new player-centric products that are player-tested for usability and entertainment value before they are released to the floors. Through new processes, we’re quickly incorporating customer feedback as suggestions into our products. We utilize this immediate feedback to better facilitate our sales training, increase the success of future product launches, and reduce our stranded capital.
We’re strengthening our marketing capabilities and increasing our business segmentation efforts. We’ll bring new games more quickly than entice and excite both today’s slot players and future generations of slot players.
For example, our Center Stage product delivers big screen thrills for our players. It is the most exciting platform yet giving operators the flexibility to simply download new content without having to replace hardware. It is not only a powerful and magnetic presence on the casino floor, but for our shareholders, it represents a reusable platform that provides IGT a new improved set of economics for our game operations business. It keeps our machines in place longer, reduces turnover and dramatically increases our returns. For the players, they love the multi-way interactive game play, enticing bonus features and incredible sound shares [ph] and huge graphics screens.
In our core business, we have an unmatched library of video and spinning real slots. In fiscal year 2010 alone, we released well over 100 new games, more than any other manufacturer. This includes nearly 30 new games on our 8960 box [ph] that enables our customers to refresh their floors in these tough economic times.
We released the number one performing penny video slot Siberian Storm that has an innovative interface with over 120 ways to win. We also released Three Kings, the industry’s first free game progressive in the for-sale slot segment, that is outperforming our expectations and the competition.
Our new Reel Edge series gives players for the first time control to stop the reels, create wins and use a joystick to control the outcome of the bonuses in the top box. This gives that younger demographic the sense of playing of skill-based game that we believe is much more appealing to them than the traditional slot machine.
Additionally, we have introduced 3D action with an unmatched gaming experience that’s making game play even more thrilling. For the evolving spinning reel player, our 3D spinning reel games look, feel and sound just like their mechanical counterparts. We refer to this as the shake, wobble and bounce effect.
To market all of these games, we’ve developed an activity-based selling culture in our sales organization and we are confident that we will drive better results and more satisfied operators.
While I’m at it, I’m going to talk a little bit about our video poker business. IGT is the leading seller of video poker products in the United States for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is our strong intellectual property. Moreover, we believe, we also believe, that we know the customer better than anybody and that our incredible recurring cash flows allow us to be in a great position to maintain our industry leadership. We built many new layers on top of our foundation of patents and we continue to innovate the product line which will help us maintain our leadership into the foreseeable future.
In sum, as we move forward with our global product strategy, we’ll continue to focus on core content and leverage our talented pool of game-designed resources and extensive IP portfolio.
In our systems business, we’re improving our offering from top to bottom. We have incorporated customer feedback into our next generation of sbX that will increase interoperability with other game developers. It will allow for intelligent and real-time bonusing [ph] that drives increased player loyalty and incremental play. For example, we developed an app called W2G. This app allows a player to electronically receive a W2G text [ph] form instantly and gets them back to playing. It’s improved the operating economics and return on investment.
This new open network approach is driving our customers and outside content developers to create applications for our systems that allow for highly-customized experiences that boost returns for everyone. We think this really shows the promise of sbX beyond downloading config and the powerful potential of networking slot machines with a flexible slot floor.
We are eagerly anticipating the upcoming December 15 opening of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. IGT will provide them with a multi-product and systems solution including sbX, 55% of their gain, inclusive of 4% MegaJackpots, plus an entire suite of Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature a GSA compliance server-based network which incorporates the award-winning player focus service window, sbX floor manager, media manager and access to IGT’s game library.
The debut of several applications that will differentiate this next-generation slot floor include an integrated enterprise rating capability that would allow Cosmo to understand the complete value of a customer across the entire resort and to reward patrons based on their particular total spend. Additionally, Cosmo will be enabled with an integrated analytical tool that will break down game performance by pay tables versus the generic total box [ph] of data only available today on integrated systems.
During the fourth quarter we had several key tier 1 and full sbX successes including the signing of six new sbX and tier 1 customers, the installation of tier 1 at three domestic locations, and a full sbX installation at two international locations.
In North America, as of September 30, we are currently in varying contract stages with four sbX opportunities combined with Advantage systems and 27 tier 1 opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities and there is no guarantee that we will close any of these opportunities.
Midterm elections were held last week and we feel that the outcomes of these elections will benefit us both in the near and long term. In Maryland, voters approved Question A which allows for zoning of a 4,750 BLT slot casino next to a Randall Mill mall. In Alabama, Governor-Elect Bentley has announced that he’ll follow through on his campaign promise to disband Governor Riley’s Anti-Gambling Task Force and instead work with the new Attorney-General to ensure proper enforcement of the state’s gambling statutes. Although the situation remains uncertain, there is a possibility that electronic bingo locations could be allowed to reopen if their machines are checked and approved by proper legal authority.
With the reelection of Governor Quinn in Illinois, we expect the implementation of the BLT program to continue. We also feel that the progress towards legalization in Massachusetts will resume next year regardless of their election outcomes. And we expect deliberate progress on other possible new jurisdictions.
We’re committed to developing games that meet our international customers’ expectations and exceed the demands of specific regions players while also reducing cost and inventories and driving higher returns.
Mexico is a good example of our success in the international markets. We developed an early presence in Class II marketplace with 7,200 machines that provided us a foothold for the eventual conversion to Class III machines. We currently have 7,200 Class III machines in Mexico, of which 6,200 are revenue share placements. We have a total of 3,000 AVPs in Mexico with a win per unit range of $70 to $140 as compared to our win per unit for Class II machines which was $56.
I’m energized about this year and beyond for IGT. As Patti mentioned, we spent much of the last year or so developing our strong long-term strategy. It is now time to execute and see the results.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Patti for her closing remarks, and we look forward to seeing you at G2E.

I hope you now understand why I am so confident that IGT is heading into some of the most dynamic times in its history. Technology is advancing rapidly in this industry and I am certain that IGT will again lead the way.
Before I share with you what all this means for our bottom line, let me first take some time to thank our employees. We have endured a dramatic creative change at IGT and within the industry. I have asked everyone in the corporation to be more efficient and to do more with less. To date we’ve seen some pretty amazing results. That said, much of the well-hanging fruit has been harvested and some challenges still remain. I’m confident we will continue to achieve great things, in working together, we will all share in the results. So thank you to everyone.
In the long term, I believe we are well-positioned for top line growth with or without a meaningful change in replacement levels in North America. I also believe that eventually our customers will begin to focus on refreshing their slot floors to increase the differentiation of their entertainment offering. The timing is elusive. Therefore at this time I believe we must remain prudent and conservative, focusing on controlling that which we can control.
For the current fiscal year 2011, we offer GAAP earnings guidance of 77 cents to 87 cents per share, which is similar to our projections at this time a year ago. This is guidance that we are at this time confident in achieving. We also know that there is tremendous leverage in our business should demand for our products accelerate. While we have some lofty goals for this year, I must also point out that downside risks and uncertainties still exist and that visibility is as limited as ever.
In summary, we expect to see positive top line contributions in fiscal 2011 in the form of further international growth, leveraging our industry-leading MegaJackpots business, increasing our non-box revenues and garnering improved market share in new jurisdictions domestically and abroad. We will continue to take advantage of our significant cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet, investing in new technologies and leading the industry technologically as gaming transforms around the globe.
We expect to improve our efficiencies and our focus on driving higher returns on our investments, lowering operating cost and harvesting stranded capital. And finally, we are confident that opportunities for replacement sales will return. When our customers meaningful reinvest in their slot floors, they will turn to IGT as they always have for leading products and technologies.
And with that, we’d like to take your questions.

So I think for us, again, it’s about portfolio management. So we’ve got to have the big brand, we’ve got to have the themes, but we’ve got to fill in all around it. And I think Eric talked about this Reel Edge product which we had one customer that ordered product right on the showroom floor, which hasn’t happened to us in a while, when they saw the Reel Edge product.

And I think now given that we have two individuals in charge of both of those, there’s intense focus on both.

And so keeping our focus on the sub-segments, if you will, of game ops, but thinking about it at the consolidated level in a way that is always a trade-off between participating and entering new markets with holding up the high-end performing games in the MegaJackpots sector.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to IGT's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today is Patti Hart, President and CEO; Pat Cavanaugh, CFO; and Eric Tom, COO.
Before beginning, we'd like to remind listeners our discussion reflects management's views based on the business environment as of today, November 9, 2010, and will include forward-looking statements, including forecast of future performance and estimates of amounts not yet determinable, the potential for growth of existing and the opening of new jurisdictions for our products, play levels for our installed base of recurring revenue gains, as well as our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies.
We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In our press release, which is posted in our website, www.igt.com, you will find additional disclosure regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
With that in mind, I'll turn the call over to Patti."

In fiscal year 2010, we continued to have relatively strong financial performance in an economy that remains weakened. More importantly, we've set the company on a course to achieve greater financial and operational performance in the future. 
Our 2010 financial achievements include growing our international revenues by 21% to $559 million, increasing our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points to 25% and reducing our debt obligation by over $400 million. 
Despite the challenging macro environment, our revenues were nearly $2 billion and we produced over $770 million of adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our significant cash flow generation capabilities. We also improved our leverage ratio, increased our inventory turns and accomplished all of this with much lower overhead. We are intent on driving higher returns for our stakeholders. 
Meanwhile, many of our customers are improving their financial position, which gives them the opportunity to increase investment in their slot floors. This is a very important step in getting our industry back on a growth track. 
The bottom line results of these achievements are adjusted EPS of $0.85 for the year at the upper end of our latest guidance. It also represents my team's intense focus on making IGT the leanest, most competitive organization that it can be. As I've said before, driving constant improvement at IGT is a short-, medium- and long-term theme for me and my management team. I am proud of our 2010 financial results, and our company is focused on making the coming quarters and years even better. 
Personally, I have been spending a lot of time with our customers, both domestically and internationally. These meetings solidify my faith that IGT is an industry leader and that we are doing the right things. That said, I am still cautiously optimistic about the coming year. While it appears that the visitation numbers are stabilizing, it is still too early to call the bottom. We need to see a marked improvement in the economy in the form of more jobs, higher consumer confidence and disposable income before we can expect to see a return to healthy top line growth in our industry.  Internationally, we are enthusiastic about our growing business and the potential we see in new jurisdictions. 
Finally, 2010 essentially completed my transition into the CEO role with IGT, and my leadership team is fully embedded into the business. Our long-term global strategies are now in place, and every employee has a clear understanding of our goals.  Fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be a rewarding year as we start seeing the results of our well-planned strategy. 
I will now ask Pat to share with you some of the financial details for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Pat?"
281438,114667290,87134,"International Game Technology, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2010",2010-11-09,"Earnings Calls","International Game Technology","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. This afternoon, IGT reported its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2010.

This afternoon, IGT reported its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2010. 
GAAP net income from continuing ops came in for the fourth quarter at $26 million or $0.09 per share, inclusive of noncash charges of $27 million after tax or $0.09 per share. This compares a net loss of $10 million or $0.04 a share in the previous fourth quarter, last year's fourth quarter. For the year, GAAP net income from continuing ops is $224 million or $0.75 per share, compared to $153 million or $0.52 per share last year, an increase of over 40%. 
Both the fourth quarter and fiscal year were affected by a number of noncash items, the details of which are broken out in our earnings release which went out earlier today. Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 for the year and $0.18 for the fourth quarter, both near the top end of our previous guidance. 
We are particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin that came in at 25% this year versus 23% last year, perhaps one of the best in the supplier space. Our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were $496 million, of which 54% were generated from our Gaming Ops business and the remainder from product sales. For the year, our revenues were $2 billion, 55% from Gaming Ops and the rest from product sales. 
Consolidated gross profit increased 100 basis points to 56% and total $1.1 billion for the year. Our Gaming Operations continued to feel the impact of challenging economic conditions, although we are encouraged by continued stabilization in yields. 
Gaming Ops revenues were $268 million in the fourth quarter, which is down 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Gross margins decreased 200 basis points to 58% for the quarter, primarily due to fixed costs spread over a smaller installed base. 
We're in an average of $50.86 per unit, per day, which is up slightly compared to last year's fourth quarter. The splendid yield is an average of the various components of our broadened global installed base. Our Game ops yield range from $10 to $15 per day in some of the lower-yielding markets, such as racinos and in some of our international markets, to more than $100 today in some of our MegaJackpots units. 
On an important side note, our international installed base is now at 16,000 machines. If we look at that on a stand-alone basis, this would make it the third-largest installed base in the industry. 
For the year, Gaming Operations revenues were $1.1 billion compared to prior year revenues of $1.2 billion. And gross margins increased 200 basis points to 60% compared to 58% in the prior year. 
IGT's installed base into the fourth quarter of 57,000 units, down 4,300 units over the prior year, largely attributable to the closure or certain charitable bingo facilities in Alabama. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that are in the percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fees. 
Moving on to product sales. Product sales revenues totaled $228 million for the quarter, compared to $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For FY '10, product sales revenues were $886 million compared to $925 million in the prior year. Both periods were affected by fewer new openings in North America. Worldwide, we recognized and shipped 11,000 machines during the quarter, down from the prior year of 11,300. 
In this fiscal year, IGT recognized 42,200 machines, down from 49,700 machines last year. The units shipped but not yet recognized, please see the supporting data at the back of the press release. 
International product sales revenue totaled $116 million for the quarter on volumes 7,700 units, compared to $102 million and 7,100 units in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, International product sales revenue was $391 million, up from $307 million in the prior year, while units recognized for the year were 24,600, up from 23,900 in the previous year. The increase in revenues is primarily due to an increase in shipments into higher revenue jurisdictions and some favorable foreign currency exchange. 
Worldwide non-machine revenues mainly from sales of systems conversions and property fees came in at $89 million for the quarter with 39% of total product sales compared to $98 million and 43% of the product sales in the prior-year quarter. For the year, non-machine revenues were $329 million or 37% of total product sales, down from $346 million and 37% of product sales in the previous year. 
Product sales gross margins were 53% for the quarter, up 100 basis points for the quarter and were 52% for the year, again, up 100 basis points from the previous fiscal year. Domestic new and expansion units shipped but not recognized totaled 1,700 end of quarter, up 800 sequentially due to shipments related to Cosmopolitan and First Council in Oklahoma and the opening of SugarHouse. 
Moving on to operating expenses and others. Fourth quarter operating expense has decreased to $174 million or 35% of revenues, compared to $257 million or 50% of revenues in the prior-year quarter. 
For the full year, operating expenses decreased to $687 million or 35% of revenue, compared to $810 million or 39% of revenue in fiscal 2009. Quarterly adjusted operating expenses decreased slightly to $164 million in the prior-year quarter.  For the full year, adjusted operating expenses decreased 7% to $615 million or 31% of revenues. 
Adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses as reconciled in a supplemental schedule at the end of our press release exclude noncash impairments and losses on other assets, restructuring and debt refinancing costs and bad debt provisions. 
Moving into 2011. We may see SG&A stay about flat on a total dollar basis when compared to the full year 2010 as we invest in the people and processes necessary to take advantage of the expected industry turnaround and new business opportunities. 
SG&A for the fourth quarter was up sequentially but down year-on-year as we recognize certain year-end items and ramped up for this year's G2E and a large amount of new products that we'll be showing. 
R&D expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, an increase of $1 million from the prior year. For the year, our investment in R&D was $200 million, down 2% over 2009. We expect R&D to be about flat to up slightly for fiscal 2011. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $249 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $247 million at the end of last year. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.8 billion at September 30 of this year, compared to $2.2 billion last year. 
The available capacity on our $1.5 billion revolver totaled $1.4 billion as of the end of this year.  During this year, we've reduced our debt obligations by over $400 million and improved our leverage ratio significantly. We went from 3.3x levered at the end of last year to 2.4x as we exited this fiscal year. 
For the year, we generated $280 million in free cash flow, up from $169 million last year. We also increased our return on invested capital and anticipate further improvement as we move forward. 
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's quarter and fiscal year. Thanks for your time and attention. I'll turn it back to Patti."

We will continue to strive to improve our financial performance and leverage our industry-leading free cash flow. In the coming year, we will, however, also increase our focus on many important areas. 
First, we will plan to further reduce our reliance on the North American replacement cycle by taking advantage of our diverse global revenue sources . We expect to begin to see improvement in our Gaming Operations yield. We believe we have the most exciting titles, both on the floor and in our pipeline, and I cannot wait for the world to see some of the best games IGT has ever introduced at G2E this year. We are planning for an increased adoption of our improved systems products and heightened returns on our vast intellectual property portfolio. 
Next, we will continue to expand our far-reaching international presence through both the jurisdictional expansion and market share growth. We will maintain our urgency as it relates to returns on our international invested capital. In the last three years, our international revenues, excluding Japan's discontinued operations, have increased from 20% of total revenues to 28% this year. 
Third, we will continue to find ways to drive our improving profitability and margins even higher.  We carefully monitor every dollar we spend and are continuously looking for ways to minimize SG&A. Our research and development budget is as focused as ever before. We will develop games our customers are demanding and products they value. 
Finally, we are planning to accelerate our growth in the Online and Mobile business. We have attracted some of the best talent available to prepare us for broader participation in the interactive gaming space. We believe that it is inevitable that gaming will become widespread in the developed nations of the world in LAN-based, online and mobile application. We will strive to be the leader in this fast-growing business and to help our customers thrive in the new digital arena. Again, fiscal 2011 will be an exciting year at IGT, much of the change in planning is behind us. Now it is time for all of us to benefit from the returns on our focused activities. 
Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer, will now take you through the period specifics on how we plan to achieve these goals. Eric?"

We have in place the specific plan and measurement points to meet and exceed our 2011 strategy that Patti has outlined. Let me share with you some of the specifics. First, we expect to see improved financial results from our MegaJackpo",1325,"Thank you, Patti. We have in place the specific plan and measurement points to meet and exceed our 2011 strategy that Patti has outlined. Let me share with you some of the specifics. 
First, we expect to see improved financial results from our MegaJackpot business through new player-centric products that are player tested for usability and entertainment value before they are released to the floors. Through new processes, we're quickly incorporating customer feedback and suggestions into our products. We utilize this immediate feedback to better facilitate our sales training, increase the success of future product launches and reduce our stranded capital. We're strengthening our marketing capabilities and increasing our business segmentation efforts. We'll bring new games more quickly and entice and excite both today's slot players and future generations of slot players. For example, our Center Stage product delivers big screen thrills for our players. It is the most exciting platform yet, giving operators the flexibility to simply download new content without having to replace hardware. It is not only a powerful and magnetic presence on the casino floor, but for our shareholders, it represents a reusable platform that provides IGT a new improved set of economics for our Gaming Operations business. It keeps our machines in place longer, reduces turnover and dramatically increases our returns. For the players, they love the multiway interactive game play, enticing bonus features and incredible sound chairs and huge graphics screens. 
In our core business, we have an unmatched library of video and spinning reel slots. In fiscal year 2010, alone, we released well over 100 new games, more than any other manufacturer. This includes nearly 30 new games on our 8960 box that enables our customers to refresh their floors in this tough economic times. 
We released the number one performing penny video slot, Siberian Storm, that has an innovative interface with over 720 ways to win. We also released Three Kings, the industry's first three-game progressive in the for sale slot segment. It is outperforming our expectations and the competition. 
Our new Reel Edge Series gives players for the first time, control to stop the reels, create wins and use a joystick to control the outcome of the bonuses in the top box. This gives the younger demographic the sense of playing a skill-based game that we believe is much more appealing to them than the traditional slot machine. 
Additionally, we have introduced 3D action with an unmatched gaming experience that makes a game play even more thrilling. For the evolving spinning reel player, our 3D spinning reel games look, feel and sound just like their mechanical counterparts. We refer to this as, the shake, wobble and bounce effect. 
To market all of these games, we have developed an activity-based selling culture in our sales organization. And we are confident that we will drive better results and more satisfied operators. 
While I'm at it, I'm going to talk a little bit about our Video Poker business. IGT is the leading seller of video poker products in the United States for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is our strong intellectual property. 
Moreover, we also believe that we know the customer better than anybody and that our incredible recurring cash flows allow us to be in a great position to maintain our industry leadership. We build many new layers on top of our foundation of patents, and we continue to innovate the product line, which will help us maintain our leadership in to the foreseeable future. 
In sum, as we move forward with our global product strategy, we'll continue to focus on core content and leverage our talented pool of game design resources and extensive IT portfolio. 
In our Systems business, we're improving our offering from top to bottom. We have incorporated customer feedback into our next generation of sbX that will increase interoperability with other game developers. We'll allow for intelligent and realtime bonusing that drives increased player loyalty and incremental play. 
For example, we developed an app called W2G. This app allows the player to electronically receive a W2G text form instantly and gets them back to playing. This improves the operators economics and return on investments. This new open-network approach is driving our customers and outside developers to create applications for our systems that allow for highly customized experiences that boost returns for everyone. We think this really shows the promise of sbX beyond downloading config and the powerful potential of networking slot machines with a flexible slot floor. 
We are eagerly anticipating the upcoming December 15 opening of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. IGT will provide them with a multi-product and system solution, including sbX, 55% of their games, inclusive of 4% MegaJackpots plus an entire suite of Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature a GSA-compliant server-based network, which incorporates the award-winning player focused Service Window, sbX Floor Manager, Media Manager and access to IGT's game library. 
The debut of several applications that will differentiate this next-generation slot floor include an integrated enterprise rating capability that would allow Cosmo to understand the complete value of a customer across the entire resort and to reward patrons based on their particular total spend. 
Additionally, Cosmo will be enabled with an integrated analytical tool that will break down game performance by pay tables versus the generic total box data only available today on integrated systems. 
During the fourth quarter, we have several key Tier One and full sbX successes, including the signing of six new sbX and Tier One customers. The installation of Tier One at three domestic locations and a full sbX installation at two international locations. 
In North America, as of September 30, we are currently in varying contract stages with four sbX opportunities combined with Advantage systems and 27 Tier One opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities and there is no guarantee that we will close any of these opportunities. 
Midterm elections were held last week and we feel that the outcome of these elections will benefit us both in the near and long term. In Maryland, voters approved questioning which allows for zoning of a 4,750 VLT slot casino next to Arundel Mills Mall. 
In Alabama, governor-elect Bentley [Robert Bentley], has announced that he'll follow through on his campaign promise to suspend Governor Riley's [Robert Riley] antigambling task force, and instead work with the new attorney general to ensure proper enforcement of the state's gambling statutes. Although the situation remains uncertain, there is a possibility that electronic bingo locations could be allowed to reopen if their machines are checked and approved by proper legal authority. 
With the re-election of Governor Quinn [Pat Quinn] in Illinois, we expect the implementation of the BFT [ph] program to continue. We also feel that the progress towards legalization in Massachusetts will resume next year regardless of their election outcomes. And we expect deliberate progress on other possible new jurisdictions. 
We're committed to developing games that meet our international customers' expectations and exceed the demands of specific regions players, while also reducing cost in inventories and driving higher returns. 
Mexico is a good example of our success in the international markets. We developed an early presence in Class II marketplace with 7,200 machines that provided us a foothold for the eventual conversion to Class III machines. We currently have 7,200 Class III machines in Mexico, all of which, 6,200 are revenue share placements. We have a total of 3,000 AVPs in Mexico with a win-per-unit range of $70 to $140 as compared to our win per unit for Class II machines which was $56. 
I'm energized about this year and beyond for IGT. As Patti mentioned, we spent much of the last year or so developing our strong long-term strategy. It is now time to execute and see the results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti for her closing remarks. And we look forward to seeing you at G2E."

I hope you now understand why I am so confident that IGT is heading into some of the most dynamic times in its history.

I hope you now understand why I am so confident that IGT is heading into some of the most dynamic times in its history. Technology is advancing rapidly in this industry, and I am certain that IGT will again lead the way. 
Before I share with you what all this means for our bottom line, let me first take some time to thank our employees. We have endured a dramatic period of change at IGT and within the industry. I have asked everyone in the corporation to be more efficient and to do more with less. To date, we've seen some pretty amazing results. 
That said, much of the well-hanging fruit have been harvested and some challenges still remain. I'm confident we will continue to achieve great things in working together. We will all share in the results. So thank you to everyone. 
In the long term, I believe we are well-positioned for top line growth with or without a meaningful change in the replacement levels in North America. I also believe that eventually, our customers will begin to focus on refreshing their slot floors to increase the differentiation of their entertainment offering. The timing is elusive. Therefore, at this time, I believe we must remain prudent and conservative, focusing on controlling that which we can control. 
For the current fiscal year '11, we offered GAAP earnings guidance of $0.77 to $0.87 per share, which is similar to our projections at this time a year ago. This is guidance that we are, at this time, confident in achieving. 
We also know that there is tremendous leverage in our business should demand for our products accelerate. While we have some lofty goals for this year, I must also point out the downside risks and uncertainties still exist, and that visibility is as limited as ever. 
In summary, we expect to see positive top line contributions in fiscal 2011 in the form of further International growth, leveraging our industry-leading MegaJackpots business, increasing our non-box revenues and garnering improved market share in new jurisdictions, domestically and abroad. We will continue to take advantage of our significant cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet, investing in new technologies and leading the industry technologically as gaming transforms around the globe. 
We expect to improve our efficiencies and our focus on driving higher returns on our investments, lowering operating costs and harvesting stranded capital. And finally, we are confident that opportunities for replacement sales will return. When our customers meaningfully reinvest in their slot floors, they will turn to IGT as they always have, for leading products and technologies. 
And with that, we'd like to take your questions."

So you line up our shift share on a global basis with WMS and Valley [ph] and we ship more than twice the closest competitor on a global basis. So that's where you, as an investor, get real operating leverage from IGT. It's really us pulling on every lever we have. And we just have some many more. So like Eric said, we have to go where the business is. So we're comfortable that when you look at the ship share on a global basis, which is the way we think about our business, right? We build the product. We ship it everywhere in the world. We're really comfortable with the representation we're getting in the marketplace."

So I think for us, again, it's about portfolio management. So we've got to have the big brand. We've got to have the themes, but we've got to fill in all around it. And I think, Eric talked about this Reel Edge product which we had one customer that ordered the product right on the showroom floor, which haven't happened for us in a while, when they saw the Reel Edge product.

So a lot of the opportunities to enter new jurisdictions come at the low yielding product levels.

We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors which could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed during fiscal 2010.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In our press release, which is posted in our website, www.igt.com, you will find additional disclosures regarding any non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

In fiscal year 2010, we continued to have relatively strong financial performance in an economy that remains weakened. More importantly, we've set the company on a course to achieve greater financial and operational performance in the future. 
Our 2010 financial achievements include growing our international revenues by 21% to $559 million, increasing our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points to 25% and reducing our debt obligation by over $400 million. 
Despite the challenging macro environment, our revenues were nearly $2 billion and we produced over $770 million of adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our significant cash flow generation capabilities. We also improved our leverage ratio, increased our inventory turns and accomplished all of this with much lower overhead. We are intent on driving higher returns for our stakeholders. 
Meanwhile, many of our customers are improving their financial position, which gives them the opportunity to increase investment in their slot floors. This is a very important step in getting our industry back on a growth track. 
The bottom line results of these achievements are adjusted EPS of $0.85 for the year at the upper end of our latest guidance. It also represents my team's intense focus on making IGT the leanest, most competitive organization that it can be. As I've said before, driving constant improvement at IGT is a short-, medium- and long-term theme for me and my management team. I am proud of our 2010 financial results, and our company’s is focused on making the coming quarters and years even better. 
Personally, I have been spending a lot of time with our customers, both domestically and internationally. These meetings solidify my faith that IGT is an industry leader and that we are doing the right things. That said, I am still cautiously optimistic about the coming year. While it appears that the visitation numbers are stabilizing, it is still too early to call the bottom. We need to see a marked improvement in the economy in the form of more jobs, higher consumer confidence and disposable income before we can expect to see a return to healthy top line growth in our industry.  Internationally, we are enthusiastic about our growing business and the potential we see in new jurisdictions. 
Finally, 2010 essentially completed my transition into the CEO role with IGT, and my leadership team is fully embedded into the business. Our long-term global strategies are now in place, and every employee has a clear understanding of our goals.  Fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be a rewarding year as we start seeing the results of our well-planned strategy. 
I will now ask Pat to share with you some of the financial details for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Pat?"

This afternoon, IGT reported its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2010. GAAP net income from continuing ops came in for the fourth quarter at $26 million or $0.09 per share, inclusive of non",1225,"Thanks, Patti, and good afternoon, everyone. This afternoon, IGT reported its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2010. 
GAAP net income from continuing ops came in for the fourth quarter at $26 million or $0.09 per share, inclusive of noncash charges of $27 million after tax or $0.09 per share. This compares a net loss of $10 million or $0.04 a share in the previous fourth quarter, last year's fourth quarter. For the year, GAAP net income from continuing ops is $224 million or $0.75 per share, compared to $153 million or $0.52 per share last year, an increase of over 40%. 
Both the fourth quarter and fiscal year were affected by a number of noncash items, the details of which are broken out in our earnings release which went out earlier today. Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 for the year and $0.18 for the fourth quarter, both near the top end of our previous guidance. 
We are particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin that came in at 25% this year versus 23% last year, perhaps one of the best in the supplier space. Our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were $496 million, of which 54% were generated from our Gaming Ops business and the remainder from product sales. For the year, our revenues were $2 billion, 55% from Gaming Ops and the rest from product sales. 
Consolidated gross profit increased 100 basis points to 56% and total $1.1 billion for the year. Our Gaming Operations continued to feel the impact of challenging economic conditions, although we are encouraged by continued stabilization in yields. 
Gaming Ops revenues were $268 million in the fourth quarter, which is down 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Gross margins decreased 200 basis points to 58% for the quarter, primarily due to fixed costs spread over a smaller installed base. 
We're in an average of $50.86 per unit, per day, which is up slightly compared to last year's fourth quarter. The splendid yield is an average of the various components of our broadened global installed base. Our Game ops yield range from $10 to $15 per day in some of the lower-yielding markets, such as racinos and in some of our international markets, to more than $100 today in some of our MegaJackpots units. 
On an important side note, our international installed base is now at 16,000 machines. If we look at that on a stand-alone basis, this would make it the third-largest installed base in the industry. 
For the year, Gaming Operations revenues were $1.1 billion compared to prior year revenues of $1.2 billion. And gross margins increased 200 basis points to 60% compared to 58% in the prior year. 
IGT's installed base into the fourth quarter of 57,000 units, down 4,300 units over the prior year, largely attributable to the closure or certain charitable bingo facilities in Alabama. Approximately 82% of our installed base is comprised of variable fee games that are in the percentage of machine play levels rather than a fixed daily fees. 
Moving on to product sales. Product sales revenues totaled $228 million for the quarter, compared to $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For FY '10, product sales revenues were $886 million compared to $925 million in the prior year. Both periods were affected by fewer new openings in North America. Worldwide, we recognized and shipped 11,000 machines during the quarter, down from the prior year of 11,300. 
In this fiscal year, IGT recognized 42,200 machines, down from 49,700 machines last year. The units shipped but not yet recognized, please see the supporting data at the back of the press release. 
International product sales revenue totaled $116 million for the quarter on volumes 7,700 units, compared to $102 million and 7,100 units in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, International product sales revenue was $391 million, up from $307 million in the prior year, while units recognized for the year were 24,600, up from 23,900 in the previous year. The increase in revenues is primarily due to an increase in shipments into higher revenue jurisdictions and some favorable foreign currency exchange. 
Worldwide non-machine revenues mainly from sales of systems conversions and property fees came in at $89 million for the quarter with 39% of total product sales compared to $98 million and 43% of the product sales in the prior-year quarter. For the year, non-machine revenues were $329 million or 37% of total product sales, down from $346 million and 37% of product sales in the previous year. 
Product sales gross margins were 53% for the quarter, up 100 basis points for the quarter and were 52% for the year, again, up 100 basis points from the previous fiscal year. Domestic new and expansion units shipped but not recognized totaled 1,700 end of quarter, up 800 sequentially due to shipments related to Cosmopolitan and First Council in Oklahoma and the opening of SugarHouse. 
Moving on to operating expenses and others. Fourth quarter operating expense has decreased to $174 million or 35% of revenues, compared to $257 million or 50% of revenues in the prior-year quarter. 
For the full year, operating expenses decreased to $687 million or 35% of revenue, compared to $810 million or 39% of revenue in fiscal 2009. Quarterly adjusted operating expenses decreased slightly to $164 million in the prior-year quarter.  For the full year, adjusted operating expenses decreased 7% to $615 million or 31% of revenues. 
Adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses as reconciled in a supplemental schedule at the end of our press release exclude noncash impairments and losses on other assets, restructuring and debt refinancing costs and bad debt provisions. 
Moving into 2011. We may see SG&A stay about flat on a total dollar basis when compared to the full year 2010 as we invest in the people and processes necessary to take advantage of the expected industry turnaround and new business opportunities. 
SG&A for the fourth quarter was up sequentially but down year-on-year as we recognize certain year-end items and ramped up for this year's G2E and a large amount of new products that we'll be showing. 
R&D expenditures totaled $53 million for the quarter, an increase of $1 million from the prior year. For the year, our investment in R&D was $200 million, down 2% over 2009. We expect R&D to be about flat to up slightly for fiscal 2011. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments, inclusive of restricted amounts, totaled $249 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $247 million at the end of last year. Contractual debt obligations totaled $1.8 billion at September 30 this year, compared to $2.2 billion last year. 
The available capacity on our $1.5 billion revolver totaled $1.4 billion as of the end of this year.  During this year, we've reduced our debt obligations by over $400 million and improved our leverage ratio significantly. We went from 3.3x levered at the end of last year to 2.4x as we exited this fiscal year. 
For the year, we generated $280 million in free cash flow, up from $169 million last year. We also increased our return on invested capital and anticipate further improvement as we move forward. 
That concludes my prepared remarks regarding IGT's quarter and fiscal year. Thanks for your time and attention. I'll turn it back to Patti."

We will continue to strive to improve our financial performance and leverage our industry-leading free cash flow. In the coming year, we will, however, also increase our focus on many important areas. 
First, we will plan to further reduce our reliance on the North American replacement cycle by taking advantage of our diverse global revenue sources . We expect to begin to see improvement in our Gaming Operations yield. We believe we have the most exciting titles, both on the floor and in our pipeline, and I cannot wait for the world to see some of the best games IGT has ever introduced at G2E this year. We are planning for an increased adoption of our improved systems products and heightened returns on our vast intellectual property portfolio. 
Next, we will continue to expand our far-reaching international presence through both the jurisdictional expansion and market share growth. We will maintain our urgency as it relates to returns on our international invested capital. In the last three years, our international revenues, excluding Japan's discontinued operations, have increased from 20% of total revenues to 28% this year. 
Third, we will continue to find ways to drive our improving profitability and margins even higher.  We carefully monitor every dollar we spend and are continuously looking for ways to minimize SG&A. Our research and development budget is as focused as ever before. We will develop games our customers are demanding and products they value. 
Finally, we are planning to accelerate our growth in the Online and Mobile business. We have attracted some of the best talent available to prepare us for broader participation in the interactive gaming space. We believe that it is inevitable that gaming will become widespread in the developed nations of the world in LAN-based, online and mobile application. We will strive to be the leader in this fast-growing business and to help our customers thrive in the new digital arena. Again, fiscal 2011 will be an exciting year at IGT, much of the change in planning is behind us. Now it is time for all of us to benefit from the returns on our focused activities. 
Eric Tom, our Chief Operating Officer, will now take you through the period specifics on how we plan to achieve these goals. Eric?"

We have in place the specific plan and measurement points to meet and exceed our 2011 strategy that Patti has outlined. Let me share with you some of the specifics. First, we expect to see improved financial results from our MegaJackpo",1326,"Thank you, Patti. We have in place the specific plan and measurement points to meet and exceed our 2011 strategy that Patti has outlined. Let me share with you some of the specifics. 
First, we expect to see improved financial results from our MegaJackpot business through new player-centric products that are player tested for usability and entertainment value before they are released to the floors. Through new processes, we're quickly incorporating customer feedback and suggestions into our products. We utilize this immediate feedback to better facilitate our sales training, increase the success of future product launches and reduce our stranded capital. We're strengthening our marketing capabilities and increasing our business segmentation efforts. We'll bring new games more quickly and entice and excite both today's slot players and future generations of slot players. For example, our Center Stage product delivers big screen thrills for our players. It is the most exciting platform yet, giving operators the flexibility to simply download new content without having to replace hardware. It is not only a powerful and magnetic presence on the casino floor, but for our shareholders, it represents a reusable platform that provides IGT a new improved set of economics for our Gaming Operations business. It keeps our machines in place longer, reduces turnover and dramatically increases our returns. For the players, they love the multi-way interactive game play, enticing bonus features and incredible sound chairs and huge graphics screens. 
In our core business, we have an unmatched library of video and spinning reel slots. In fiscal year 2010, alone, we released well over 100 new games, more than any other manufacturer. This includes nearly 30 new games on our 8960 box that enables our customers to refresh their floors in this tough economic times. 
We released the number one performing penny video slot, Siberian Storm, that has an innovative interface with over 720 ways to win. We also released Three Kings, the industry's first three-game progressive in the for sale slot segment. It is outperforming our expectations and the competition. 
Our new Reel Edge Series gives players for the first time, control to stop the reels, create wins and use a joystick to control the outcome of the bonuses in the top box. This gives the younger demographic the sense of playing a skill-based game that we believe is much more appealing to them than the traditional slot machine. 
Additionally, we have introduced 3D action with an unmatched gaming experience that makes a game play even more thrilling. For the evolving spinning reel player, our 3D spinning reel games look, feel and sound just like their mechanical counterparts. We refer to this as, the shake, wobble and bounce effect. 
To market all of these games, we have developed an activity-based selling culture in our sales organization. And we are confident that we will drive better results and more satisfied operators. 
While I'm at it, I'm going to talk a little bit about our Video Poker business. IGT is the leading seller of video poker products in the United States for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is our strong intellectual property. 
Moreover, we also believe that we know the customer better than anybody and that our incredible recurring cash flows allow us to be in a great position to maintain our industry leadership. We build many new layers on top of our foundation of patents, and we continue to innovate the product line, which will help us maintain our leadership into the foreseeable future. 
In sum, as we move forward with our global product strategy, we'll continue to focus on core content and leverage our talented pool of game design resources and extensive IT portfolio. 
In our Systems business, we're improving our offering from top to bottom. We have incorporated customer feedback into our next generation of sbX that will increase interoperability with other game developers. We'll allow for intelligent and realtime bonusing that drives increased player loyalty and incremental play. 
For example, we developed an app called W2G. This app allows the player to electronically receive a W2G text form instantly and gets them back to playing. This improves the operators economics and return on investments. This new open-network approach is driving our customers and outside content developers to create applications for our systems that allow for highly customized experiences that boost returns for everyone. We think this really shows the promise of sbX beyond downloading config and the powerful potential of networking slot machines with a flexible slot floor. 
We are eagerly anticipating the upcoming December 15 opening of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. IGT will provide them with a multi-product and system solution, including sbX, 55% of their games, inclusive of 4% MegaJackpots plus an entire suite of Advantage system products. The casino floor will feature a GSA-compliant server-based network, which incorporates the award-winning player focused Service Window, sbX Floor Manager, Media Manager and access to IGT's game library. 
The debut of several applications that will differentiate this next-generation slot floor include an integrated enterprise rating capability that would allow Cosmo to understand the complete value of a customer across the entire resort and to reward patrons based on their particular total spend. 
Additionally, Cosmo will be enabled with an integrated analytical tool that will break down game performance by pay tables versus the generic total box data only available today on integrated systems. 
During the fourth quarter, we have several key Tier One and full sbX successes, including the signing of six new sbX and Tier One customers. The installation of Tier One at three domestic locations and a full sbX installation at two international locations. 
In North America, as of September 30, we are currently in varying contract stages with four sbX opportunities combined with Advantage systems and 27 Tier One opportunities. Please understand that these are only opportunities and there is no guarantee that we will close any of these opportunities. 
Midterm elections were held last week and we feel that the outcome of these elections will benefit us both in the near and long term. In Maryland, voters approved questioning which allows for zoning of a 4,750 VLT slot casino next to Arundel Mills Mall. 
In Alabama, governor-elect Bentley [Robert Bentley], has announced that he'll follow through on his campaign promise to suspend Governor Riley's [Robert Riley] antigambling task force, and instead work with the new attorney general to ensure proper enforcement of the state's gambling statutes. Although the situation remains uncertain, there is a possibility that electronic bingo locations could be allowed to reopen if their machines are checked and approved by proper legal authority. 
With the re-election of Governor Quinn [Pat Quinn] in Illinois, we expect the implementation of the BFT [ph] fealty program to continue. We also feel that the progress towards legalization in Massachusetts will resume next year regardless of their election outcomes. And we expect deliberate progress on other possible new jurisdictions. 
We're committed to developing games that meet our international customers' expectations and exceed the demands of specific regions players, while also reducing cost in inventories and driving higher returns. 
Mexico is a good example of our success in the international markets. We developed an early presence in Class II marketplace with 7,200 machines that provided us a foothold for the eventual conversion to Class III machines. We currently have 7,200 Class III machines in Mexico, all of which, 6,200 are revenue share placements. We have a total of 3,000 AVPs in Mexico with a win-per-unit range of $70 to $140 as compared to our win per unit for Class II machines which was $56. 
I'm energized about this year and beyond for IGT. As Patti mentioned, we spent much of the last year or so developing our strong long-term strategy. It is now time to execute and see the results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Patti for her closing remarks. And we look forward to seeing you at G2E."

I hope you now understand why I am so confident that IGT is heading into some of the most dynamic times in its history. Technology is advancing rapidly in this industry, and I am certain that IGT will again lead the way. 
Before I share with you what all this means for our bottom line, let me first take some time to thank our employees. We have endured a dramatic period of change at IGT and within the industry. I have asked everyone in the corporation to be more efficient and to do more with less. To date, we've seen some pretty amazing results. 
That said, much of the well-hanging fruit have been harvested and some challenges still remain. I'm confident we will continue to achieve great things in working together. We will all share in the results. So thank you to everyone. 
In the long term, I believe we are well-positioned for top line growth with or without a meaningful change in the replacement levels in North America. I also believe that eventually, our customers will begin to focus on refreshing their slot floors to increase the differentiation of their entertainment offering. The timing is elusive. Therefore, at this time, I believe we must remain prudent and conservative, focusing on controlling that which we can control. 
For the current fiscal year '11, we offered GAAP earnings guidance of $0.77 to $0.87 per share, which is similar to our projections at this time a year ago. This is guidance that we are, at this time, confident in achieving. 
We also know that there is tremendous leverage in our business should demand for our products accelerate. While we have some lofty goals for this year, I must also point out the downside risks and uncertainties still exist, and that visibility is as limited as ever. 
In summary, we expect to see positive top line contributions in fiscal 2011 in the form of further International growth, leveraging our industry-leading MegaJackpots business, increasing our non-box revenues and garnering improved market share in new jurisdictions, domestically and abroad. We will continue to take advantage of our significant cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet, investing in new technologies and leading the industry technologically as gaming transforms around the globe. 
We expect to improve our efficiencies and our focus on driving higher returns on our investments, lowering operating costs and harvesting stranded capital. And finally, we are confident that opportunities for replacement sales will return. When our customers meaningfully reinvest in their slot floors, they will turn to IGT as they always have, for leading products and technologies. 
And with that, we'd like to take your questions."

The faster you get, the better game on the floor, the faster it starts to earn revenue. What I'm harking about, reinforcing what Patti has said, is in our process of game development, a lot of the improvements are structural in a sense that we've deployed tools that allow the game developed to be more effective. In the order to delivery process, we have a lot more process definition, a lot more process improvement and it has driven that speed to market. So like Patti said, not done yet, but still work in progress, but excellent, good progress."

I think that the mix issues, we're always going to have that challenge because we're creating products in all of those categories. And sometimes you have a product in one -- say, you take wide-area progressive versus stand-alone. And sometimes, you'll have a very dynamic product that really drives some of that shift. But I think the thing we're encouraged by is that the yields are starting to stabilize. And the pipeline of games that we have, we've got a real renewed focus, intense focus on WAP and stand-alone so that no one product category gets ignored, which I think in times past, the times we've shift a little bit too far in one direction, either the product sales or at the expense of Game Ops or vice versa, and I think now given that we have two individuals in charge of both of those, there is intense focus on both. And then relative to the tax rate, on a go-forward basis, I think about 39%."

What we don't want to do is put so much focus on that yield number that we don't purchase to take in jurisdictional expansion. So a lot of the opportunities to enter new jurisdictions come at the low yielding product levels. And so using that as a way to enter market is a really important strategy that has served IGT so well historically. And so keeping our focus on the sub-segments, if you will, of Game Ops, but thinking about it at a consolidated level in a way that is always a trade-off between participating and entering new markets with holding up the high-end performing games in the MegaJackpots sector."
